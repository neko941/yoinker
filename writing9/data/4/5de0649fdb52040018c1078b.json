        "Today ,  many  people  believe  that  a  mixture  of  nationalities,or  multi-culturalism,could  help  a  country  to  become  more  attractive  and  develop  faster.  In  my  personal view,  multi-culturalism could  create  many  advantages  to a country\u2019s development. This essay will examine why a mixture of nationalities is important and conclude my personal idea.",
        "There   are   several   obvious   benefits   from a mixture   of   nationalities   to the development  of a city.  First  of  all, the increasing  economy and  business  of  the country,  when  many  people  from  different  cultures  and  nations  live  together,  this could  create  a  diverse  of  activities  and  characters  in  a  single  place,  which  might attract  many  tourists  into  the  city. An increasing number of  tourists  could  develop the tourism  business  and  other  related  businesses,  this would lead  to a rise in economic growth and many developments for citizens and the city in the future.",
        "Despite, increasing tourism, it also helps to create new innovations and technologies because the many  different  nationalities  have  different  cultures  and  backgrounds, and  these different  cultures  and different knowledge can  be exchanged.  This \u201ccross-culture\u201d might leadto the creationof new innovations and provide benefit to the people of the   city.   This   example can be   seen   in   America, where many innovations  and  technology have been  developed  from multi-culturalismand  a  mix of nationalities.",
        "In  conclusion,  there  are  many  discussions  about whether a  mixture  of  nationalities could help a country to become more interesting and developfaster. In my opinion, if a country promotes diversity in cultureand nations, this could create many benefits to the economy and innovations which could helpacountry to develop faster in the"
