In scientific aspects, leaking unpublished articles about health and contageous illnesses could evoke a public chaos and even riote among uneducated people. Based on these, defending the essential information in much more secracy is all can be done.",
        "On the other hand, sometimes when it is the matter of corrupted institutes and unreiable managers, revealing truthful infromation about them is completely allowed and people have the right to know what has happened to their money or property. Likewise, there are several cases in police offices where secret information about a great deal of crimes like embazzlement, murder, ruberry and hostage situations are archived. For instance, family of a person who has been hostaged or kidnapped should have access to the details of the case.",
