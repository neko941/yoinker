        "Considering the persistence lament it can not be overlooked the number of persons, who migrate to the foreign land due to the elevation in life standards as well upliftment in career opportunities.That is why, an question arises on a global scale regarding the rituals;rather the same have been adopted or not. As far as my views are concern, I agree to a large extent to the mentioned view. My thoughts will be discussed in the ensuing paragraphs.",
        "To begin with, I must say that nation's virtues and traditions are giving more friendly atmosphere and freedom to the individual.This is because, If a migrator would familiar with the language and dressing sense the same will definitely take a sole to higher emotional intelligency. Moreover, an article of New York Times once had published that almost 30% of the migrators are adopting traditions before bording to the foreigh land.",
        "On the other hand, a loud voiceness supports that though having numerous pros, it is irrefutable that due to the formar discussed cause mother country's ritues are on the verge of extinct. Furthermore, sometimes the same scenaris has led individual to a dilemna. To support the prior sentence, an impending threat observed when Saudi Arebia deport a family because lady refused to wear \"Burkha.\"So, raputation of the country was restrained.",
        "In the final analysis, it can be seen that, although, there are few downsides of cultivating rituals such as diminishing of local culture, my reasoning is that it remarkably improves living standard and freedom which infers that adopting nature is inevitable, which certainly bridge up the differences and offer more time to be one responsable citizen."
