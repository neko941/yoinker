        "Designing a building is more complex than we think. In fact, it takes months to ideate and iterate a concept before it is built. While a number of people work on it, the debate on prioritizing its functionality over beauty is never-ending",
        "The first thing that anyone notices about a building is definitely its exterior. The outward appearance of the building which includes color, shape and size is what makes a structure look welcoming. The design of the outside of the building can tell you whether it is a place of serious business or is it a fun club?",
        "However, most structures are built with some purpose- for instance it could be for a commercial enterprise or it could be a residential complex. Both these types need different type of constructions irrespective of what the outside looks like. For example, you will need a bedroom if it is a house but won't need it if you were building a school. Similarly you will not have a game room if it's a hospital and not a hotel.",
        "Apart from the functionalities, the interior of the building is also expected to have psychological influence on its patrons. To illustrate, a blue, red, pink combination for walls might make sense for a daycare where these colors will keep the curious minds of kids happy. Milder lights and colors are used for conference rooms in a company so that discussions don't turn into arguments.",
        "Much like humans, buildings need to be attractive so that people are drawn to it, but not at the cost of hampering its functionality."
