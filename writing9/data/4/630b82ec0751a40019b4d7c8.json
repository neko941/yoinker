        "To safe the traffic raods need punish drivers with penalty. I totally disagree with this statement we can solve this problem with another way adding traffic rolls to school subject.",
        "A lot of people think that the most important think is safe traffic rolls and to safe people from acsident. I totally agree with statement but they give a lot of punishments people who do not do rolls for example one percent drive a car on the red light and he get punishment to this work. However he is reach and he can do this job more times. with this work he will acsident after a lot of times. The punishment is not right way like a this events. It can help people live but no more.",
        "I think we need add subject than we can improve our knowlange from traffic rolls and in every school need built places to learn how right ride a car after finishing school the goverenment should give car documents but we also need punishments but it should be who don't do rolls. They need go to place like big school and they shoud practice there until they catch their mistake and drive correctly.",
        "In conclusion, There are a lot of other way improve driving skills not only with punishments we cannot change we cannot improve peoples' driving skills we need more usefull way like adding \"Traffic rolls\" subject or builting big places to practice like punishment schools."
