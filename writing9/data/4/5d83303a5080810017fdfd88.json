        "Now a days, individuals are affected by a number of health related issues because of their present way of living that cannot be cured by allopathic medicines. According to some, substitute medicines can work effectively. This essay believes that different type of treatment can work but only to some extent which will be discussed down below.",
        "",
        "Firstly, there are lot of different options under alternative medicines which are not present  in western medicines so it gives a patient, multiple  options to choose according to the severity of his disease.  Moreover, it is also quite cheaper than allopathic medicines so a large number of people can have access to it which makes it more effective for those who cannot afford expensive medicines. For instance, recent survey conducted in India in 2013 showed that there\u2019s a rise in number of people who switched to Homeopathy, Acupuncture, Ayurveda, etc.",
        "",
        "Secondly, substitution medicines have less adverse reactions on human body as they contain drugs in lesser amount so they can be taken for a long period of time which makes them effective especially for chronic diseases like hypertension, obesity, etc.",
        "",
        "However, potency of alternative medicines are not always up to the mark as sometimes they are quite effective but other times they are not. Moreover there\u2019s no scientific basis of how effectively they work. For instance, complementary medicines are not powerful enough to replace cancer medicines like methotrexate, cisplatin, etc.",
        "",
        "To reiterate, alternative medicines like Homeopathy, Acupuncture, etc can be helpful in successful treatment of diseases which occur because of modern lifestyle but they are not always potential as they can\u2019t cure every present day health problem."
