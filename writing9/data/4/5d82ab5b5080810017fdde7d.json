        "Kids nowadays are spending a lot of their time indoors, mostly watching TV shows. This activity is benefitial for their development while being entertained. With this, parents or guardians keep an eye on them in order to choose properly the programs they are watching and controlling the length of time watching to avoid any risk in their health.",
        "The television is considered one of the cheapest form of entertainment. To a child, projecting illustration or sometimes animation in vivid colors is attractive. With background music as accompaniment, it stimulates one's senses. Having both in television programs allows a child to broaden his imagination and also awareness to his surroundings. Back when I was babysitting my cousin, we would enjoy our time wathing TV. I would hear her immitating lines from the shows or even the commercials; at times dancing with the music. At the age of two, she was able to speak our mother tongue in sentences unlike other toddlers at her age who are just starting to speak words or phrases.",
        "With this, parents will feel safe and secure, since their child is enjoying his idle time indoors. In addition, they could carefully select and monitor the shows suitable for their kid; also they can limit the TV time spent by the child in order to allocate to other activities in order to prevent, or at least lessen the health problems due to prolonged usage of television.",
        "Longer hours of television usage deteriorates a kid's health. It weakens one's metabolism due to lack of physical exercise. The proximity with the applicance could also affect his sight and hearing as well. I recently watched a documentary regarding obese kids and most of the interviewed parents blamed the starte of their kid's health with their love of watching TV.",
        "To sum it up, allowing kids to watch TV shows help them to learn while getting preoccupied. It is favorable on their part that parents supervise them in order to guide them correctly while doing this activity."
