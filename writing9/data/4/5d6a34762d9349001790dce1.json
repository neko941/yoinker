        "In this contemporery era, everyone wants to live a comfortable life. Therefore they workhard to get all the essential facilities for their better lifestyle.However there is a heated argument over the issue that people forgotten their cultural as well as traditional values in rush to buy everything for a comfortable life. My inclination lies in line with this view.",
        "I see eye to eye with the central idea for various reasons.First and foremost, people become more materialistic nowadays, they only focus on show off about their affluent lifestyle. Therefore, they need to work harder and such people work even more than the average working hours to get success in less time.But, in craving of getting wealthier they are getting far away from their natural daily life schedule, they did not have time to meet their parents friends and family.Secondly, people from rural areas left their parents over there and move to urban areas to get better employement opportunities, afterthat they lost in materialistic world In rush to get more money for their comfort people use many different ways, either positive or neagtive no matter they only need money.",
        "In addition to this, they hardly get time to go to religious places, libraries and cultural events from where they get some useful knowledge and stay in touch with their diverse and rich culture.",
        "Last but not least, due to advancement in technology , everyone has smarthone and coming generation tottaly relies on these latest gadgets. Although, they think there is no socal status in society without these latest gadgets.Thus, they did not respect their parents and fight with them for such items.",
        "However, there are few people, Although, they are famous and live good life, they stay in touch with the roots of their affluent culture.",
        "To recapitulate, I believe we should live a balanced life so that we can learn various aspect of our life from our rich haritage culture and teach our next generation respect, love, happiness and other ethical values."
