But while it may offer some advantages, it is probably better to stay home because of the difficulties a student inevitably encounters living and studying in a different culture.\n\nTo what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?\n\nGive reasons for your answer.\n\nYou should write at least 250 words",

        "The studying overseas is a great and exciting experience. It is not only because they offer courses which your home country couldn\u2019t but also gives you chance to meet new people, culture and maybe making new friends. Personally I love studying abroad because of cultural exchange. Most people disagree say that it is hard to adapt to new place and there is another thing called \u201ccultural shock\u201d which means people who come from abroad find it hard to understand new culture because it is not the culture they used to have back at home country. I agree with that it hard to get use to new place not only in studying. But I am sure that after a while people get used to new place.",
        "Studying in your home country is good too. It depends on person\u2019s preferences. For example some people like me prefer studying overseas or some couldn\u2019t find course that they wanted attend in their home country and other like to study where they live. But maybe there are other reasons too. Personally I disagree with opinion that says studying in your home country better than studying abroad. Because when you study abroad you not only study your subject you learn to adapt to new situation which makes it easier for you to adapt to new changes.",
        "In conclusion, as I said, it depends on person. Because some people who live in developed countries goes to study in less developed country. This shows that it is not always environment that makes people to study home or overseas."
