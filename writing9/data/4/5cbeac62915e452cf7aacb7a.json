The has been resulted into cutting down of the jungle area of trees to match with demand of the citizen. So, in return the global warming has been increased and also health issue of common man has seen rise from last few decades. Thus, to have better quality of air index we should all focus on having more trees.",

To add on, the dooms day has arrived when the governements of all nations ought to get unite and take some strong and quick actions toward saving the environment else there will natural disasters coming on the way. The green area and parks should be built and it significaces should be promoted to not get destryoed by the local people.",
        "To recapitulize, the building houses can solve the problem of people moving towards cities or towns. However, in the long run the effect will be quite catastrophic. The trees are free source of gases mainly oxygen that requires life to survive. Moreover, these are the only spaecs for many birds."
