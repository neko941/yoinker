        "Are family ties becoming weaker? It would be an error if we denied that family relationships are less relevant than before and this has been brought about by the change in our values , lifestyles and the lack of communication among members of the family.",
        "To begin with, family traditions are completely different than they used to be for instance , twenty years ago on Sundays families use to gather to eat together either it was someone's birthday or not and as a result ,the members of the families were more closely connected  and enjoyed each other company needless to say that there was no internet and just a couple of things to watch on tv.",
        "In addition, most families used to go to the park to play with their children , they had what is called quality time.",
        "Secondly,another important aspect that need to be mentioned is that in past years the father was responsible for making ends meet although ,it was not easy the mother did not work in most cases and therefore, the mother used to have more communication with their children compared to these days.",
        "To begin to tackle this situation it is vitally important that families try to spend the Sunday together like the old traditions even if it is for a little time in addition ,while they are having dinner  it is highly important that they try to turn off thier mobile phones thus, they will be forced to speak to each other and in this way their relationships will be strengthen.Only after doing this families will be able to start to re-connect.",
        "To sum up, families surely would be closer and bolster if members of families made and effort to spend time together and if both parents work the few time they spend with their children it should  be completely dedicated to each other ."
