        "Students who study at schools and  tertiary institutions gain more knowledge from teachers than from any other mode of learning such as the internet and television. In my opinion, I totally agree with this statement as teachers are better equipped with the necessary  skills and the persons being taught can get clarified on anything  they don't understand.",
        "",
        "To begin, there are many ways students gain more information   from what  is being taught by teachers.",
        "Firstly,  the availability of qualified teachers .This means that , when teachers with the necessary skills are employed to teach these students ,  they inculcate the right technique of teaching them and by so doing , these individuals being taught, gain more knowledge .This is exemplified in Futo, a federal university in the eastern part of Nigeria, in  the mechanical  engineering department , when the students attested to the fact that  their lecturers teach them with diagrams and thus making them learn more .",
        "Secondly,   when they do not comprehend ,they seek for explanation and then  the conflicting issue is resolved. This infers that if there",
        "is any unclear meaning, they get answers when they ask questions which is not readily available with the use of the internet.For example, a study recently conducted amongst the 200 level students of Alvan Ikoku College of Education ,department of Crop Science revealed that the students preferred their instructors teaching them to studying through online media because their coach made sure they perfectly understood what is being taught by further explanations when asked.",
        "In conclusion, the ability to rectify compounding issues   and the presence of qualified trainers with the requisite training are some of the  reasons why  students gain more  knowledge from teachers  as compared to electronic studying."
