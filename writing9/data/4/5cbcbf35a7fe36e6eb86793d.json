        "In modern times the world has become globalized, and the influence of occidental cultures over the entire planet has made people think that a good society position and having a lot of money and properties are the most important things for an individual to pursue hapiness. I agree with this statement, but I do not share this way of thinking.",
        "Nowadays, generations of young adults and teenagers tend to be superficial and materialistic, and have left behind good manners and politeness. For example, young ladies are more worried about being popular and pretty, than of having good performance at school and obtain good grades; and young men think is important to own the latest mobile phone available on the market, in order to be considered cool by their friends. With this said, it is clear that newer generations are growing with the idea that being popular and having money are the most important things to succeed in life.",
        "However, there are still some people who assume that good family values and education are the best things that a person can have. Sadly, good manners have been gradually forgotten, even in conservative populations.",
        "In conclusion, I think that modern societies judge individuals according to their income and possessions, and that old-fashioned values and good manners are no longer needed in the globalized world that we live in."
