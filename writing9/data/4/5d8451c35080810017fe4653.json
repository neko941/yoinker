        "Monetary influence has taken command over mankind. Those with exorbitant bank balances and owned property can earn more respect in society. It is observed that the importance of values like honor, kindness, and trust has degraded in society. I agree with the notion and will elaborate in the following paragraphs.",
        "Being rich nowadays amplifies the power individual gains on shaping others' views about them. The consumerist population tends to get influenced by the materialistic life, the affluent are leading.  Every person has a craving to own a luxurious car and a bungalow. Its because they highly value the luxury of an opulent lifestyle, it is very natural to admire the people who are living at that stage and own the wealthy condition. For instance, the",
        "living standards of a successful businessman like Ambani can be alluring to most of us, that we are likely to get persuaded to give them honor.",
        "In addition to that, it is a well-known fact that a person needs to be able to help himself first to be able to help others. While choosing for a friend nowadays, humans do look at their income standards, because having limited earning not only shows about the finances, it also exhibits that the person does not have a positive attitude towards his well-being. The poverty-stricken also develops a tendency where they are habituated in looking for help rather than helping themselves. Thus, individuals with inadequate funds are often not valued.",
        "On the other hand, other sets of human beings do not define values like honor and respect to be fluctuated by the monetary position of others. All living beings have the right to be regarded with these basic behavioral etiquettes and should not be declined. It does not cost expenses to reverberate these humble practice of showing courtesy to anyone. Inculcating these habits in our life can certainly make a difference in our society.",
        "To conclude, although the basic behavior of humbleness and gratitude should be innate with us, it is getting suppressed due to the materialistic behavior of mankind. There are times when the affluence is looked upon and respected highly. There are other instances, where monetary condition has become a filter when making an aquantaince. In my opinion, the values from past has taken a back-seat and the material possesions has become significant in deciding a person's ability."
