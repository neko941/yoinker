        "Many scholars tend to believe that the platform, to make new friends, provided by social networking sites and internet chat group is commendable. While others opine that face to face interaction holds massive importance in making new friendship. In my opinion, face to face interaction does greater good to provide strong foundation and sustainability of new friendship.",
        "Social networking sites have time and again proven to be boon for connecting with new individuals. Personality of an individual is reflected through statuses, comments and photos. Thus, if wavelength matches, they eventually happen to be friends. Furthermore, the group of people with similar interests are often member of the same group in social sites. In 2015, when massive earthquake of 7.8 Richter hit Nepal, 1,200 members of sisterhood Nepal got to know each other and came forth for the greater good of nation.",
        "However, to be friends face to face interaction is utmost necessary. Through messages sent from internet, it is almost impossible to transfer the evoked emotions, which is the essence of any kind of friendships. \u2018I love you\u2019 or \u2018I am there for you\u2019 in chat boxes will never have the same impact as when someone says it upfront, right in face. Small gestures while having coffee together or unpredicted high- fives or just a simple hug or any other comforting body language are the memories that friends are going to cherish forever. The effect of which will have lasting impact on any friendship.",
        "All in all, social networking sites does assist individual in making new friends, to a small extent. But the impact that face to face interaction brings along is beyond comparison. The essence of friendship like reciprocating emotions while interacting will have greater effect when the person is present physically as opposed to online interaction."
