        "As we know, each country is growing rapidly, and competition among them are increasing day by day. Every country wants to be in a superior place and wants to be powerful in every stage. I strongly agree that it is the responsibility of the governments of poorer nations to look after their citizens themselves and wealthy nations should not share their wealth among poorer nations by providing such things as food and education because it starts the feeling of dependency in the citizens of poorer nations.",
        "To embark, I believe that poorer nations do not get any kind of help from rich countries because they always depend on them to fulfil their needs and desires, for illustration,  there are plenty of poor countries in the world, if every country get help from wealthy ones, so the developement procedure of them remain constant. The citizens of poorer nations also face some problems due to rich people because they will always rule them, If we take an example of military uses, rich countries always force the citizens of poorer nations to be a part of their army and work for them in difficult circumstances.",
        "However, some people thinks wealthy nations give help to poorer ones because the country get an opportunity to become famous by this. Some nations are extremely poor and the people of these nations are also a human being so it is fruitful for them to get help from wealthy nations but I disagree with them because it is a big task to help poorter nations and wealthy nations have some problems of economy by this, they cannot develope their technology more so they face some difficulties to give help for them.",
        "To sum up, government of poorer nations must look after their citizens themselves because they will be independent or they will not depend on others."
