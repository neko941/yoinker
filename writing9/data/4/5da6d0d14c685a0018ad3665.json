        "Now a days everyone has a car which uses fuels like petroleum or gas, many companies are coming forward in manufacturing electric cars which will replace the existing one.Agree. Electric cars can reduce global warming and fossil fuels are becoming expensive and demanding",
        "Electric cars help in alleviating global warming by reducing the consumption of fossil fuels. Cars which runs through electric power does not emit any smoke, which in turn protects our surrounding  from pollution. Replacement of electric cars tend to gives a clean and safe environment to live in. Apparent;y, usage of  electric power in cars our natural resources like petroleum, gas, coal can be retained for future use . Significant  use of those fuels can be controlled. A recent survey about how electric cars will be useful for the environment prove that 90 percentage of prevailing pollution will be in control through usage of cars run by electricity.",
        "In our modern days natural gases are becoming more demanding and expensive. Availability of crude oil is becoming very demanding nowadays because of their excessive mining. In general , by using car driven by consuming electricity these natural gases will be available in sufficient to consume in the  future.Since fuels are not available in abundance their price has been elevated by the countries which supplies those oils. By using electric cars we can save money by restricting the purchase of those cost driven crude oils.In India as fossils cars are being  used more the supply of natural gases like petrol, diesel are in demand ,which in turn demands the government to spend more money on purchasing natural gases  which is very expensive . this practice affects our economy standards .Implementation of electric cars can save money since electricity can be produced by the country itself.",
        "Cars using electricity are cost effective and environment friendly. It saves our environment from pollution and improves our economy standards by protecting us from purchasing expensive crude oils .cars which uses fuel needs to be banned and replaced by electric cars."
