        "Today, English is one of the most popular languages in the world and it is undeniable that English plays such an important role in the world's business. The tourism development has made English become the most prominent language in the world. Therefore, this essay will show the advantages and disadvantages when English becomes the only language that is spoken globally.",
        "There are evident advantages to having one global language. Firstly, having such a global language creates greater understanding between many people all over the world. We do not have to learn any foreign languages, people from all the walks on the street can easily communicate with foreigners when they use the same language. Secondly, having one global language gives a range of opportunities for individual development. Using different languages usually restains many people showing their best. So that, those who actually have abilities can not accomplish in making their dreams, their passion. Thirdly, using the same language also helps economic growth, it is easier for business to cooperate and enrich themselves.",
        "Besides those advantages, having one global language also involves many disadvantages. Forthly, it causes the lack of cultural diversity. Language is believed to be the most important thing that creates a nation or a minority. What if all countries use only one language? Is there only one country in the world? Fifthly, the discrimination of the minority groups will exist if English becomes the global language. The English's native speakers will be on the higher level and the people who have never approached Engish are nearly deaf and mute, those people can not communicate and cooperate with the others. they will be discriminated by the people who can speak English fluently. Finally, there will be the downturn in tourism. people go travalling to relax, to enjoy the fascinating views and to widen their knowledge about the place that they come. Every country use only one language - English, so there is no national culture and people do not have to move, television and Internet are popular now.",
        "In short, having one language also has advantages and disadvantages, it should be carefully considered before making any worldwide change, especially language."
