        "Citizens are becoming extremely busy in recent times. This change has made a lot of individuals to prefer dishes made in restaurants or ready-to-cook food rather than opting for a meal which is made at residence. In this essay we will discuss the merits and demerits of this choice followed by conclusion",
        "There are several pros to choose a dining over a home cooked meal. Firstly, Can anyone deny the fact that fast food is tastier than food prepared at home? No, not in my knowledge. A large part of the society opts for fast-food place or instant food primary because it not only delicious but also saves time. Secondly, the ambiance that a restaurant provides is quite difficult to recreate at home. Finally, the choices of food one might get while ordering a meal at restaurant is no match when compared to choices available at home. To cite an example,  my friends prefer going out to have a meal for the reason that home cooked food gets monotonous after a period.",
        "There are, however, multiple cons associated with choosing a quick and easy meal over food made at home. Packed food and restaurant food is not only expensive but also they are quite unhealthy. Because, the level of preservatives and food color is alarmingly high in restaurant food, many people get sick after consumption. A recent study done by the International food association found that people who have packed food often fall ill compared to their counter parts who have home prepared food.",
        "To conclude, in totality, there are benefits and drawback associated with restaurant food and convenience food. The choice of food can vary from individual to individual depending on one's circumstances."
