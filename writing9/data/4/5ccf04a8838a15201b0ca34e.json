        "The recent increase in the trend of fast food in our society, which has helped citizens to keep with the speed of advanced lifestyle. In my opinion, the demerits from this development exceed the gains varying from diseases.",
        "On the one hand, fast food's availability is the one that has been beneficiary to a lot of people, especially, the working - class. These are professionals that have much tasks to carry out on daily basis. So, this offers them opportunity to order for meal at their own convenient time and still meet up with their targets without going hungry.For example, a customer call for an order at anytime and get delivery within 30 minutes  Another advantage, is the accessibility the providers have made easy for their customers. .",
        "However, despite the above opportunities, there are adverse effects of this. First of which, these foods are not properly cooked and they are not fresh sources. This is the leading cause of gastroenteritis in the world. Also, these meals are too rich in Salt and fat. These also cause hypertension, obesity, diabetes and cancers. For instance, the department of General Surgery in Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospital reveal that, consumption fast food which is rich in poorly processed fat is responsible for the increase rate colon cancer recently.",
        "In conclusion, availability of ready-made meal truly relieve busy-workers the stress of making it at home, however, the repercussions supercede with the development of diseases associated with it"
