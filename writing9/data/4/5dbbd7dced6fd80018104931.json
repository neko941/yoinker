        "Teaching  children  to  become  good  members  of  society  is  extremely  important because  children  will  become  adults  that  influence  our  society  in  future. Initially,  the  responsibility  for  teaching  children  falls  primarily  on  parents  as they spend  a  great  deal  of  time with  children  and  are  important  role  models.  As children  grow  older  and  attend  school  the  influence  of  parents  diminishes  and schools  become  an  important  part  of  children\u2019s  learning  not  just  in  academic areas,  but  also  in  social  behaviour.  In  this  essay,  the  role  of  parents  and teachers in  teaching  children  will be  discussed. The  influence  of  parents  on  their  children  should  not  be  underestimated. Children  spend  the  first  years  of  their  life  almost  exclusively  with  parents  and therefore  parents  have  a  profound  influence  on  the  development  of  children. Throughout  our  lives  people  learn  mostly  by  observing  and  listening  to  others, so  time  spent  with  a  child  and  influence are  dependent.  This  teaching  extends across  many  areas  including  basic  manners,  showing  respect  and  care  for others,  teaching  culture  and  convention  and  teaching  skills  including  those  that are  not  taught  in  schools  but  are  essential  to  succeeding  in  society such  as managing  time,  personal  finances,  using  tools  and  even  driving  cars.  Although the  influence  of  parents  diminishes  over  time  (this  is  a  good  thing  as  children must  eventually  become  independent)  it  is  profound  and  is  reflected  in  the  fact that  people  can  often  see  mannerisms  and  behaviours  in  themselves  that  they observe  in  their  parents  or  children. Teachers  also  play  an  important  role  in  teaching  children  because  children  also spend  many  hours in  the care  of  teachers.  The  role  of  teaching  children  extends far  beyond  teaching  them  subject  material  because  school  is  the  beginning  of independence  and  teachers  guide  students  through  that process.  School  can  be viewed  as  a  small  society,  where  students  must  navigate  relationships  without the  oversight  of  parents,  and  teachers,  other  students  and  the  school environment  support  this  process.  A  key  part  of  schooling  is  that  students  are not  just  exposed  to  their  parents  but  many  teachers  with  different  experiences and  views  and  this  helps  children  broaden  their  worldview  and  become  better members  of  society.  The  influence  of  teachers  can  be  measured  by  the  large number  of  people  who  can  reflect  upon  their  school  days  and  remember  a teacher  who helped  change  their  lives for  the  better.",
        "In  summary,  although  in  most  cases  parents  exert  the  greatest  influence  on children  in  becoming  good  members  of  society, teachers  also  play  an  extremely important  role.  In  fact,  it  is  the  responsibility  of  all  members  of  society  to support  the  learning  and  care  of  children  as they  represent  our  future."
