        "Rise in obesity is a chronic problem plaguing people of all ages today but the worst affected are the children. Unthinkable it may be, but it\u2019s a reality that children under 10 are experiencing same levels of obesity as that of the people above 35 as per \u201cNational Health Census Bureau\u201d. Leading theories for this issue blame two main parties, the government and the parents. In my opinion, both contribute significantly for this pediatric overweight.",
        "On the one hand, some believe governments were lackadaisical in their approach towards this growing menace in the first place. It is said that they were irresponsible in the publicity of nutritional value of food and its impact on the health of the children. Public health department delayed the \u201cLabelling of packed foods\u201d bill by a decade due to the lobbying of vested interests. This led to the higher consumption of salt and sugars, which are major culprits for weight gain, they believe.",
        "On the other hand, some opine that the parents failed their kids. Due to social pressures, children were taken to fancy fast food restaurants from an early age, creating an addiction for high-calorie foods. It is widely believed that, this, coupled with lack of spending control led to high consumption of fatty foods by the kids. While this is a major concern, a bigger concern is the example elders are setting. Pupils imitate the elders in all aspects. If grown ups in the home are consuming cholesterol filled foods as a habit, children would see no harm in eating them.",
        "Finally, in my opinion, both factors are justly blamed. Governments are responsible for inspections of food quality & measures and the job is not done properly. While they conduct raids regularly, an anti-tobacco level campaign is required to battle this curse. In addition to this, parents are also responsbile for their habit of splurging on junk food which should subside significantly for this condition to vanish."
