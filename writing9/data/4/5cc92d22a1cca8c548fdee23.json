        "Children are the future of the nation and thus it is the nation\u2019s duty and responsibility along with the parents to nurture them properly and in a good way. This will also include making rules and regulations by the country. Though some countries are way too lenient, some countries put up strict rules for behavior. In this essay, I will be discussing about that too which extent the rules should strict the children behavior.",
        "I think that the rules and regulations are necessary for the grooming of the kids and for providing them information about the discipline. Moreover, being disciplined from early ages helps them to become a great asset later. But it is also necessary that the cuteness and kindness of the children should not be harmed at the stake of strictness. This will not allow them to bloom properly and have a proper understanding about what to do and what not do and why not to do.",
        "Similarly, if a nation makes a rule for not allowing kids to play or mingle in public garden or parks then it will restrict them to interact with neighborhood kids and might feel lonely as they will never be able to interact with any other kids post school hours. Becoming non-social will stop them from being open hearted and talk about what they feel and in future might suffer because of that.",
        "For an instance, US has no federal minimum age for the possession of long gun. This makes it easier for even the early teenagers to have a licensed gun. They are not that matured and thus a lot of mishaps happen by them. If there would have been a limit of 18 or 21 then this would have been curtailed.",
        "As per me, the rules should be there for children but they should be progressive and not restrictive. They should be designed in such a way that it takes care of the welfare of the children and also the nation."
