        "From ages people give more importance to time, and in recent years  money also considered as  the utmost one. Many people are debating  on what is the ideal  proportion of the money and  time mix ,makes one life more happy?  In the below paragraphs , i will outline both the outcomes with relevant examples.",
        "To begin with having more money and less free time means , the person is a hardworking one. By continously putting more efforts even though having more money , he is  focussed and securing his career as well the future of next generation.  Eventhough ,if he doesnot have more time he can spend the limited time in a quality manner .Because, he is  filtyh rich so he can get afford to pay for the comforts and luxury. Many billionioare are busy with their tasks and will lead a good life. E.g Mukesh abmani the richest indian spends  50-60 hours in office in a week, having minimal time with family, but leads a comfortable life.",
        "On the other side, many individuals are more concerned about their family and their wellbeing. Gives less important to money, as they are not materalistic . Less bothered towards the money, for them relations , bonding and goals are important. They will spend  majority of the time with their family and the dear one's or towards their interests.  Internal peace is utmost important for them as compared to the status . To cite an example, 14th indian president Mr Abdul kalam he spend majority of his life on various projects , as he is more passionate towards those. Eventhough he dint had much money and had more time. He lead a comfortable life, which is memorable for many of us.",
        "To conclude the ideal one is having limited time and money , then only life will teach the importance of both it.And one will not ignore the necessity of other."
