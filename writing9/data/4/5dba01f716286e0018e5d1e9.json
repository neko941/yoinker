        "In many parts of the world, there have been events when government have to moved their capitals either on outcomes of the elections or due to some political reasons. This changes have sometimes resulted in benefits but majorly disadvantages for the people's. Hence, I strongly condemn these changes.",
        "Some of the benefit's consists of getting new capital with history attached with it which can garner a lot of tourism's attention and generate new economic opportunities. Also, bringing the capital close to the constituency of current party in power helps them immensely in their personal political gains. The new capital also occupies space in country map which adds extra value to it's history which could be remembered for quiet long.",
        "But with these advantages, there are many disadvantages also. Some of them are, fascination towards setting up life in new capital with hopes of new opportunities attracts a lot of people from around the capital who comes and dreams about new economic opportunities without any assurance. This yields in push in population of capital, many among which settles anywhere even without much concern of promising future. The price of land properties suddenly sky rockets which possess issues for many working class professionals who dreams of buying their own property in new capital.",
        "In conclusion, The movement of capital by the government if had some benefits. So, does it have many disadvantages associated with it to which a normal human life has to face up. Some of these challenges could be met while many couldn't."
