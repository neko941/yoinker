        "All parents across the world, want their children to be free of illness and diseases. But with, change in environment and food habits, new diseases have been identified. Modern healthcare has also introduced drugs, immunization doses to fight such problems. Today, we are blessed with the invention of many vaccines that can protect children against many common health problems and diseases.",
        "Small pox, was a deadly disease that had caused havoc across the globe in earlier centuries. In many countries the governments, had decided to make small pox vaccination mandatory for their citizens. I have seen marks of vaccination on the arms of my grandparents. They said it was a painful procedure then and many people used to avoid getting the vaccine due to the pain. Less knowledge about it also stopped many from getting their children immunized. I believe imparting correct knowledge would have been more useful. Though, the world is free of small pox today, a right awareness program might have made this possible a little earlier.",
        "Similarly, polio had been a health problem that had damaged many people\u2019s lives. In India, the Government educated the Indian citizens about polio vaccination through different campaigns and have finally made India, a polio free nation. Though the immunisation was not made mandatory by law but the success rate was remarkable due to the awareness campaign that spread to very rural areas of the country.",
        "Another valid point is that, once the vaccines were subsidized or made free for the citizens of a country, the success rate increased. Often, the poor people try to avoid getting the doses as they are unable to afford the cost of it.",
        "In conclusion, I would like to say that vaccination need not be made mandatory by law, rather awareness, and education about immunization should be made mandatory. The governments, should also see that it is easily available to everyone in their respective countries and are safe to use. I believe only then our world will have healthy and happy children free of common diseases."
