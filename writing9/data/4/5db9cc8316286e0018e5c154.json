        "Most of the countries think that people should do matured things like vote for country,marriage,getting driving license etc.., at the age of 30.Whereas few countries think that a little yoger age would be better.I totally agree with the way that few countries think.",
        "When people are allowed to do these matured things at the age below 30,they are in a situation to get into the world without the help of their parents .These experiences make them matured in their ideas and thoughts.This also gains knowledge to select their own career,life partner etc..,They become smart enough to survive in society tackling all the odds to acheive beyond boundaries.",
        "Allowing them to do these things,make them more responsible at a younger age.For example if a 19 years old person is allowed to vote,he will definitely know th current political situation of his country.So having knowledge on these things,he would do the better things a citizen could contribute for the country's development.",
        "Many countries think that people may go astray if they are allowed to do these things at a youger age.But connotations of it would be they are not ready to face challenges on their own,unable to make right decisions in critical situations.And finally when they regret for their mistakes,they can't solve it.Because he may not have age to correct it.",
        "If you ask me? people at younger should make their own decision from 18 not later at 30.These decision making can happen only they are allowed to do matured things at a younger age and not exactly at 30.Considering the deterimental effects of doing matured things at the age of 30,I think the way that the few countries think was right (i.e.,) doing these things at younger age before 30."
