        "Young age is the most suitable time to learn new things because during this phase people are more quick and more susciptible to adaptation. Considering the same, many countries are emphasizing on juveniles to explore the opportunity based on their interest in doing work or touring around new places for an year. In this essay, I am going to discuss the pros and cons of this footstep.",
        "To start with, many provinces are encouraging young people to work for an year before joining any university. It not only helps them in learning expense management but also helps in attaining maturity level at workplace. Alongside, it may also lead one to experiment various fields based on its areas of interests and, on the basis of the same, can prepare a roadmap for his/her career. This period can help in deciding which stream would be helpful in future and which wouldn't.",
        "In addition, many states like Norway inspire youngsters to visit foreign lands. Such methods makes a person to re-invent himself on the basis of surroundings. Also, it enables them to learn new culture and while doing so, if required, can adapt a new living style which could be helpful to their home country as well. Such activity may led to buidling experience in different times.",
        "On the other hand, such procdures before joining college may cause an year break in studies. Resultingly, other competitors may move ahead in terms of studies. It could be frustrating with whom one used to share the class, are one year ahead.",
        "To recapitulate with, it is good for young students to roam or induldge in some project before joining any educational establishment.  As it not only helps in finding the correct route for future but also helps in making one more robust by adapting to different situations. Although, it may toll a one year loss in studies but considering the positive aspects of the same, can be taken up further. After all, Decisions takes us to destiny."
