        "We are surrounded by friends in various periods in our life. We started making friends as early as we are one year old. They share our happiness and unhappiness. Some people believe to choose friends who always have the same opinions as them, while others believe it is not the case. In this essay, I am going to discuss both these views and my opinion on should I choose friends based on his or her opinions.",
        "On one hand, some believe one should makes friends that have the same opinions as one does. As friends are important to us, we have them in all of our important events. From starting schools to graduation, from starting a relationship to getting married. They are around us all the time, when we have doubts, we consult our friends right away. Having same opinions from friends do provide emotional support to us as we know our friends are supporting us. These kind of supports do provide better feeling as we need these for us to  face various up and down in our life time.",
        "On the other hand, some believe it is better to have friends disagree with them every now and then. They believe listen to a different opinions on a situtation can provide a better picture that one can not see. Having a second opinion helps people to think in a different angle, which might able to help one that spending too much time on worrying things that they might not need to worry on. Providing another way out for them to solve the problem.",
        "In my opinion, friends should not be choose by if their opinions align with mine. It is more important to have friends I can share with, willing to listen to my problems. No matter they agree or disagree my opinion, as long as they are willing to be there when I need them, then it is a good one."
