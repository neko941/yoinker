        "In the era of electronic powering devices taking over the role of delivering content to people, some may say, it is possible that newspapers and magazines will cease to exsist in the near future. This essay will tell you why.",
        "Tablets readers allow content cusumers to receive the latest news within a blink of an eye, which is exactly people need. Traditionally, the newspaper firms produce their news one day before the end reader sees it, therefore, no matter how fast they are, the content shows up the other day will be always outdated. Such sutition has been completely eliminated when it comes electronic devices. Furthermore, the president of United States, Donald Trump can post a message on Twitter, within seconds, his followers would be reading and talking accordingly, which on the other side, no body want to talk about yesterday\u2019s news via a piece of paper.",
        "By presenting content on advancing equipments in the 21th centre, people can produce and percive information in a whole new level, which made them ditch the old fashion way to consume contents. The newest Apple products can host color dots within a frame of 2880 times 1440 pixles, which means more explicit screen projecting, therefore, better gauging experiences. Which explains why people would love to see pictures on a screen rather on static papers. More also, with the trend of technology developing speed, those advantages will only go stronger and stronger.",
        "In conclusion, the morden technologies has won over content consumers by its nature to fast information delivery and high resolutional eyes projecting, the future will favor the tech more and more."
