        "Nowadays people generally beleive and accept that excercise is good for children and teenagers. Because of this mindset, there is a common talk going on, to make the physical education and sport should be made compulsory for all students in all school.  I would agree with the point of making the physical education and sports compulsory for all students in all schools across country.",
        "In current generation, technology booming is one of the major advantage and at the same time it also creates a major problem. Teenagers nowadays are more addicted to the video games and spend their most of the times on the same after their school hours. There is no phsycial activities involved. Even at the school, management are result oriented. So they make students only to study without engaging them in any of the sports during the school hours.",
        "Recently, one of the teenager who is very good at the academics had a severe health issue as there is no physical activity made by him. His routine was to wake up in the morning, go to school, study for all 8 hours, come back home, play video games and go to bed. Even the school he studied has no separate period for sports and physical education. Schools should give an equal importance to the physical activity and sports as same as that they give importance for studies.",
        "To conclude, Every schools should make the physical education and sports to be mandatory for all the students. Government should takes necessary actions on schools who fails to do this. As schools plays a major role in students life as they spend more time in school rather than at home. Each and every school should be more responsible in students health by making physical education and sports to be mandatory."
