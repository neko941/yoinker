        "We were expecting our friends to join us.However, none of the above plans worked out due to the chaos created by the incorrect food served.",
        "Let me explain you the problem,  my wife is a vegan and she ordered for a non diary food.",
        "When her dish was served, she double checked the ingredients with the waiter and on confirmation, she started eating it.",
        "Not only was she served with the non vegan food, but also it had seafood which she was allergic too.",
        "I had to rush her to the hospital and thus celebrated the anniversary night at the medical canteen.",
        "On enquiring, I learnt that the food which was supposed to be served to the table next to ours' was served to us.",
        "Is it possible for the restaurant to number the tables? I reckon that system would serve as a solution to the mix-up related issues.",
        "I sincerely hope you would personally look into such issues and prevent them from future occurance.",
        "Thank you for considering.",
