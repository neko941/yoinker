        "Effectiveness of enjoyable activity with a child over reading is debatable. Some people believe that an enjoyable activity with a child can develop better skills and creativity than spending time on reading books. This essay will discuss why interesting activities with children are better than reading books.",
        "Performing scientific experiments with kids are great way to learn and understand science better. Practically experiencing or visualizing an event give great understanding than just reading or seeing pictures in a science book. Helping children perform a Volcanic eruption using experimental tools and witnessing the event happening would be an ideal example to improve their skills.",
        "Craftworks is another activity which can help to improve creativity and skills of children. It creates that ability to look at things in a different perspective and stimulates creativity to arrive new ideas. Craftwork also requires special skills and great concentration to ensure the outcomes are amazing. Papercraft, wooden craft, textile craft are few activities which can be considered by parents to boost their kids\u2019 creativity and skills.",
        "Besides, practicing essay writing would be another idea to improve your kids\u2019 creativity. Putting pen to paper would help improve their grammar, spelling and writing skills. Discussing the essay topic and sharing ideas about the chosen topic would be a great way to help kids thought process and creativity. It would help to boost their creative ideas when they try to come up with reasons or points to justify what are writing about. An Essay on future amusements parks or fantasy park would be an ideal way to boost their creativity.",
        "Therefore, interesting activities with children can contribute improving their skills and creativity than just reading books. This goes with the saying, practice makes a man perfect. I would like to reiterate that activities with children are far better than reading books or articles or magazines."
