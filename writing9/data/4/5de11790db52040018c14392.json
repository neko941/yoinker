        "In contemporary era, Discipline plays very cucial role in everyone's life.But some says that it should be the responsibility of teachers,while other says that it is the duty of the parents .Now I will discuss both sides in upcoming paragraph.",
        "To comence that , Discipline should be the duty of the tutor.Because children spend alot of time in school.It is the schoolteacher's job to tell the child about the moral values like how to behave with others,how to talk with others and how to  obey rules. Moreover ,the tutor should punish the students if they misbehave with others . They also use punishment to correct their disobedience.Furthermore, The instructor donot do any difference between the students like some examiners make difference between the intelligent pupil and weak schoolchild .They should treat all the juniors equally.",
        "On the other hand,As we know that parents is the first school of every child.They learn all the things from their parents like how to walk, how to speak, how to sit, how to stand and so on. The guardian teach ethics and moral values to the kids. Without parents children cannot survive in the society.Moreover, If guardians are well educated then they take care of their kids in every field for example they upbring their child in best way They shows his child in good school.",
        "At the end,I think both parents as well as techers are important for the children. They both teach discipline to the children."
