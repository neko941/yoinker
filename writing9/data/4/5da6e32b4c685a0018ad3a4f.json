        "It is commonly seen that celebrities and stars give their opinion regarding events of public. I believe this is a negative trend because it can cause violence among people and can divert the attention of scores towards the certain issue.",
        "Understandably, the statements given by well-known people can create anarchy among locals because of people's love or hatred towards certain personality. The ones who adore those stars would support their notion, whereas others might get agitated  by interference in their issues by someone they do not admire. Hence, it can cause restlessness in the community. In the past, backlash was observed due to statements given by well-known persons.",
        "In addition to this, the matter on which they give their opinion might become less important. This is due to the fact that inhabitants instead of focussing on the message might find the personality of the star more appealing. Hence, it can divert masses' attention from an essential topic. It is observed that the matters which get intruded by some famous people either become less important or they entirely become different.",
        "To conclude, invasion of public matters by celebrities can only cause disturbance in the society and  can deviate the attention from a crucial issue."
