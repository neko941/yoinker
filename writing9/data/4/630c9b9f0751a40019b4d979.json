        "Unfortunately, global warming has become the most serious issue in the world. Many organizations and governments have sounded alarmed about this case. In this essay, I will analyse some reasons that led to this incident and offer some bits of advice.",
        "Definitely, the rapid development of industrialisation and technology exacerbate situations, and over  time it is becoming more and more dangerous. Undoubtedly, there are several reasons for our topic, but the two most important reasons are pollution and energy emission. Furthermore, the polluted gas exported by manufacturers affects the weather one  way or the other. Moreover, the contaminated gas that is creat by automobiles and vehicles also is playing the role in harmful to our atmosphere. For instance, many reports said that  the proportion of pollution has increased by about seventy per cent in comparison with the last year, and our breathing has become more contained by a lot of gases."
