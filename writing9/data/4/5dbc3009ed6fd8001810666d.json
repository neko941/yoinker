        "In the recent time it has been seen that parents are busy with their work place\u2019s responsibilities so they do not have enough time to spend with children which has a devastating impacts on their offspring. In my opinion, passing more quality time with younger member of the family will flourish their psychological development as well as their nutritional foundation of the future.",
        "To begin with, I believe that, in the childhood offspring\u2019s psychological improvement depends on their parent\u2019s lesson because on that time parent are the sole teacher for their education. If parents provide more time they can support them in difficult situations and help them to learn how to face the unfavorable situations. For instance, children may upset for the failure in the exam so parent can make them understand do not be broken heart, identify their week points and tell them how to strengthen these portions which take lots of time.",
        "In addition to the importance of psychology, nutrition development also has lifelong impact on toddlers.",
        "Certainly children try to consume food that are unhealthy, like chocolate, ice cream, junk food, however parents with more time prevent them, tell them the adverse effects and advice them the benefits of taking healthy and nutritious foods.",
        "Even though pupils maintain lot of responsibilities on the pace of life, but work-life balance is pivotal for the future generation. In my opinion, parents would provide more time at the early stage of their son or daughter and share things with them in friendly manner which help them to absorb good manner and to deny unlawful things.",
        "By way of conclusion, based on the arguments explored above, I am of the opinion that, more quality time with offspring will make them more productive, intelligent and fittest for the future adverse situations."
