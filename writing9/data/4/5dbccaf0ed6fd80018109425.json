        "It is a fact that we are living in the most advanced technological era,which is the result of past researches and discoveries.Though some may opine that the research process is mere wastage of time and money, I consider it as the key to a better world.",
        "There are ample reasons to argue that researches play a pivotal role in shaping the world today.Firstly,the researches in the field of physics and chemistry had led to the development of many of the facilities that we are enjoying today.May it be electricity,transportation, infrastructure, all are the products of researches conducted long back in the 1800s.Secondly the advancements in the health sector by which some of the deadly diseases in the past like leprosy,small pox are completely eradicated from the society and  many ailments like tuberculosis, measles, hepatitis are brought under control through vaccination.",
        "Moreover the  advancements in the field of communication ,by which we are able to see and hear a person in the other corner of the planet, has brought the world into a single global market.",
        "The flourishing technology makes everything at the finger tip .",
        "Though the technological advancements and research studies are the cornerstones of development,many nations are spending large amounts of money for researches that are not beneficial to the society, which includes",
        "researches in the fieds of nuclear weapons, war planes and so on.",
        "So in my opinion researches should be promoted, but it should be with an aim of making the society a better place to live,improving our health and not for destroying the mankind"
