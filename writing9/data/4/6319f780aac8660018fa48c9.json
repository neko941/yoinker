        "Most people were aware that the ongoing use of cars and motorcycles gives bad impact to the environment. They are both major contributors to air pollution.",
        "Nowadays, due to the increasing number of populations, the majority of the people tend to use private cars and motorcycles for comfort and convenience purposes. With your own transportation, there is no need of waiting in a long queue nor for the bus or any public utility vehicle's schedule. Life could be easy and handy.",
        "People can be selfish at times even though they already knew the possible cause why the ozone layer is depleted. With the current transportation pollution, it really contributes to the effect of global warming.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, with what we have been seen and experienced, the developing countries utilise the use of motorcycles wherein it collectively emit more hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and other air pollutants. Motorcycles and other public utility vehicles are much more affordable.",
        "The best way to reduce the use of cars and motorcycles is to implement every family the allotted number of vehicles. It should not be more than two vehicles every household, and it should be upgrades at least every two or three years the most. Another tip is the following: walk or bike when you can, take public transport when possible, and carpool with friends or school instead of driving alone. In the cities, there should be parking and traffic control, congestion charges, limited traffic zone and mobility services for commuters."
