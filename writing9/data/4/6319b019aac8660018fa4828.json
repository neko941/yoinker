        "Media channels are investing in domestic as well as news from other countries. I would say that they should invest more on spreading awareness about the country. But, showing the situations of foreign countries are also very important.",

Spreading awarenes about the domestic issues may alarm the dometic people about the present and upcoming problems and help them prepared for the future events. Also, in case of natural disasters the people within the country should be infomed immediately so that they can help their countrymates on time.",
        "But. keeping the people aware of the international situation is also important. International trade and global trends' knowledge may help the locals to adopt the fruitful strategy within the country to get maimum benfit form the outside world. International crisis, wars and natural disasters may effect the economy worldwide or of a particular areas, information of which should be reached to the people so that they can prepare themselves for any global crisis. Those who are deciding to migrate must be aware of the situation of the foreign countries so that they can decide better that when and which country to migrate. Immigrants must know the situation of their native countries as their families and beloved ones live there.",
