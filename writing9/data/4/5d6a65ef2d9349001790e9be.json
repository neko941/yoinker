        "Freedom is one of those speciial gifts which is provided by the almighty to every organism on this earth. Every living being has an instinct inclined more toward being free rather than to live a life full of luxury but with boundations. with the advent of human interuptions to the nature and the enviroment considerable damage has been done.And In this essay I would be discussing the affect of human activites to the wildlife.",
        "In this contemporary era , with the increase in the human population their is also increasing the amusement types of the people and this has led to drastically increase in the confinements of wild animals which are used  for the entertainment of the general public. With the increase in the popularity of such parks , their is also increasing henious crimes against animals.To make money poachers and hunter has exploited the wildlife to such an extent that today considerable number of animal species are on the verge of extinction.",
        "Contrary to this , Zoological gardens also serve an examplar place for juveniles to learn about the nature and its evolution. They get to know about the fauna of their region and being close to the nature inculcated with in them the feeling of love to the mother nature. Moreover such a place could be a haven for those species which are being killed in the open for either their flesh,ivory or skin.",
        "Last but not the least , I would say that such estate shuold be promoted on the motive of  only to conserve nature , and to increase a sense of responsibility in the society towards the planet, else we would be ending ourself into an uninhabitable zone."
