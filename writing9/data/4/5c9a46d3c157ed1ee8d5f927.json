        "People believe that the expenditure of art by government is unnecessary and some other sector deserves this money more. In my opinion, I completely disagree with this statement.",
        "Firstly, are is a form which represents culture, human emotion and largely, humanity. From stoneage, people are engaging themselves on art. It does not only give people visual pleasure but also gives their heart peace. Many people claims that they managed inspiration or reason of living even the meaning of life through art.",
        "On the other hand, some people may think that art has no productivity so that the money should be invested on some industries or factories. However, a good painting may not help a nation economically much, but it can make us feel human. To give a clear example, a painting on poor people can melt out heart and inspire us to help them. This type of emotions are created by art and these emotions represents humanity.",
        "In my opinion, government should spent money on art as much as required. Despite of having a practical life, dealing with materialistic staff, people have to go back to the fundamental reason of living which is happiness. So, if government stop funding on art, many artist would be forced to stop painting and nation would lose many talents and inspirational paintings.",
        "In conclusion, I would recommend the expenditure on art as necessary. In addition, this expenditure is not any sense of wastage, this is necessary for humankind."
