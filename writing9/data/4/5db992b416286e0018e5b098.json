        "Museums and art galleries attract various historical items and unique art to be viewed by the public.This attracts many visitors and the organization in charge make the decision as to whether there is a necessity for an entry fee or to allow free  admission.This essay will discuss the cons and pros of such admission fees and also will completely agree that the advantages outweight the disavantages of these admission fees.",
        "These places give  an individual an insight into the past of the specific country.This is an essential part of the country\u2019s culture and history.Thus, an entry fee will prevent certain people especially those from the poorest class to enjoy the pleasures of this sight.For example:- Even a person with the lowest income will get the chance to see the unfathomable beauty of the pictures and understand the history of the country didn\u2019t charge any money.",
        "However, the funding needed to maintain the building of a museum or the processn to present the potriats are very expensive and  require sources of funds.The historical remnants and the arts are very fragile anad easily destrutable increasing the chance for it to be damaged.For example;- The museum in Galle, Sri Lanka faced a major problem when the armour of the famous king Dharamathna started to erode as the museum wasn\u2019t being supported by the government as an income.",
        "Another advantage of charging a reasonable fee will allow the facility to improve its standards and renovate. Therefore it vital to charge the vistiors a sum of money in order to reach higher by better providing better facilities.This will not only maintain the building as a whole but also enhances the improvement of these places.",
        "Even though there is always a dilemea whether or not the admission fees for these places is important.It is clearly seen that the advantages of charging  money are far greater than the disadvantages as helps to maintain the assets and improve the facilites without hunting for funds."
