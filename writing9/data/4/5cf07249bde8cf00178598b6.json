        "As we move into the twenty - first century, technology is affecting many different areas of life",
        "and education is no exception. Indeed, in some institutions traditional forms of education have",
        "been revolutionised by new technology to the extent that the lecture is no longer the main",
        "method of delivery. While there are a variety of benefits to this new approach, there are also",
        "significant drawbacks.",
        "Perhaps the greatest bonus of the introduction of technology is the flexibility it offers. This is",
        "evident in two different ways. Firstly, it is now no longer essential for students to be present in",
        "the lecture theatre for their courses. This means that part - time courses for adults who are in",
        "employment and distance learning courses for people in other countries are now much more",
        "practical. Another area of flexibility is of course that the lecturer and tutor are able to use",
        "Moodles, interactive whiteboards and other tools to deliver their courses in a more stimulating",
        "way to large numbers of students.",
        "Not everything, however, about the introduction of this new technology into education is",
        "positive. One major problem is that not all students are comfortable with using technology, even",
        "if they are part of the digital native generation. This is a serious issue as they may suffer from",
        "their lack of technological skills. Another related issue is that education is a human activity and it",
        "works best with as much human interaction as possible. Impersonal technology cannot replace",
        "the human contact found in traditional face - to - face tutorials and seminars.",
        "As we have seen, there are major benefits to the introduction of technology into education, not",
        "least because it enables modern forms of education such as distance learning courses. This is",
        "balanced, however, by the fact that it can be too impersonal for some and disadvantages others",
        "for their lack of technological skills."
