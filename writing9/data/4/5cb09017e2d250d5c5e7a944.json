        "We are quite aware of the rising issues with environment now a days as the problems such as there is no country in the world which is not facing problems such as pollution or global warming.I partially agree with solving the problem at an international level and the essay will layout the points for both.",
        "As environmental problems is becoming a global concern,it is a mandate that these issues must be dealt at an international level.The laws and rules for all the countries regarding the contribution towards environment must be made and it must be checked that which country is creating more pollution or waste and accordingly the countries must be penalised.It must be made compulsary for every counry to organise sessions and events to make the common people aware of the havocs the environmental problems can create.",
        "It is vital that the the environmental issues must be dealt at an international level however we cannot neglect the fact that every country must also deal with the issue at its own level also.As every country has its own geographical conditions,climate and with different type of industries,each country tend to produce different types of waste so they must also make rules to deal with the inhouse issues on their own.It will be a vital step towards acheiving a healthy environment for the world.",
        "With the drastic climatic changes that our worls is facing it is important that international laws are made to protect the environment ,and along with that every country must consider it as a major cause of concern and work towards the protection of environment so that our next generations can get a healthy world to live in."
