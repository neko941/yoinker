        "To reduce this dialema, government must take seriouse steps to reduce the production and usages of plastic products.Nowadyas in many developed countries paper base products has been replaced by the plastic products.",
        "In my experience using the paper base products instead of plastic products will be really helpfull to reduce rubbish growth.",
        "Secondlly governement should also warn companies to use paper packing there products in paper base material instead of plastic base.",
        "We all know that, it can not be happened overnight, we should all take the resposibilty to reduce the use of plastic and on the other hand governement should give certain time span to industries to reduce producing plastic materials.It will definatelly be helpfull to reduce rubbish in a huge quintity."
