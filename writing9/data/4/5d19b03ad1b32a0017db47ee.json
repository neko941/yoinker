        "The students at universities are increasing for student exchange programme as a part of their degrees. Although, students find it difficult to cope with new environment and new methods of learning while abroad, they will gain deep knowledge in their subject and that will reward them in the future of their careers. In my opinion, students studying abroad will have more chance to explore and can master in what they do. Therefore, advantages outweighs the disadvantages.",
        "To begin with, students studying abroad helps to gain more knowledge on different subjects which may not available in their home country. In addition to that, the exchange of ideas from different people all around the world will help them to shape their career in the future. For instance, when I studied in indonesia where I need to work for a project which is a part of our academic curriculum with people from differentcontinents. So, it helped me to cope with various people when I joined as an employee in a major firm. Therefore, studying abroad helps to learn many things.",
        "On the other side, there are some things which they often find it difficult when moving to other countries for the academic purpose. One of the main problem is the method of learning; it may vary from their home country. Secondly,",
        "the laws that are in place which is entirely different from their own place. For example, when I completed my research paper in thailand, it was rejected because the paper which I submitted is not following the local standards.",
        "these are the  down sides of studying abroad.",
        "Studying overseas has become incredibly common from past ten years. while students abroad find it hard to cope with new environment however, these situation brings best out of them. In my opinion, studying abroad has more advantages than disadvantages."
