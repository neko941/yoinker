        "Nowadays, people have different views about how modern lifestyles is. Some people believe that having a healthy style is really hard in this developing society. Meanwhile, others find it easy to have a good way of living. In my opinion, it cannot be denied that modern life causes many health problems and leads human to an unhealthy style. However, people need to aware the importance of having a healthy lifestyle and follow this model of life.",
        "Due to the rapid changes of world, the speed of life has become faster and faster. People always try to do everything as quickly as possible and they always have to face with competition. They mostly have no time to concern other things except their works. As a result, fast food is the first choice for their daily eating. Other reason why people cannot live a healthy life is the development of technology. Because of these technology, people are not required a lot of motion. They spend most of time sitting down in front of computer at workplace or in the car that causes many poor health problems",
        "On the other hand, a group of people believe that there are several ways to be healthy and keep fit in this busy society. Thanks to the improvement of technology, there are many available information about what people should eat. It also help people access to clean and healthy food stores which are very convenient. In additions, people can take just half hour per day to prepare their all day meals because healthy food is very easy to cook and saves time. Besides, people also can spend one or half hour a day to do exercise. It really does not take much time.",
        "I think that the first two outweigh the second view. I mainly agree that human need to live a healthier life because without a good health, people even cannot do anything. It is not hard to break bad habit if they have strong mind to make a change",
        "In conclusion, having a healthy way of living or not is not difficult and it depends on each person\u2019s choices."
