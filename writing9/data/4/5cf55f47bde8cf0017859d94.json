        "It is stated that behavior of  adults plays major role in the adopting and learning processes of the toddlers and adoloscents.In my opinion,I agree that adults influence the developmental and behavioral changes which occur in children.",
        "There is no surprise that why doctor's child becomes a doctor, Lawyer's child becomes a lawyer or judge so on as we see so often in our world. This clearly points out that children during their developmental period are highly influenced by their surroundings.Kids frequently imitate the activities of the adults.This learning behavior can lead to a prosperous or disasterous future for the child.",
        "Considering good habits a kid develops in its early life , for instance seeing at an adult waking up early and indulging in exercises and studies can lead to a bright future for the kid.Similarly like planting trees , watering the plants,feeding the pets, etc lead to positive outcomes for the child and also for the society.",
        "On contrast,unhealthy activities of an adult leads to a miserable life for children.For instance, consider smoking,alcoholism,drugs abuse including the conflicts,fights and crimes can lead to poor mental development of a child and increases the percentage of the world's Juvenile crime reports.",
        "Though behavior of the adults has vital role in childs's life,there are many other ways through which a child can learn.For example, 'trial and error method'.Considering an example where a toddler touches a hot vessel and withdraws his/her hand as quickly as possible.With this the child learns that he should never touch any hot material.",
        "In conclusion, there are many ways a child learns in its developmental period but the behavior of adults influence more than any other mode of child's learning process."
