        "The fabric of any culture is built upon arts and the loss of a common man\u2019s interest in this field has casted negative impacts on the society. There are a number of reasons for this transition which include the decline in quality art produce as well as the dry nature of the subject.",
        "To begin with the quality of art showcased to the public has declined over time. This is because neither do the artists have great mentors, nor is the government providing quality art schools. For example, the quality of a cultural theatre these days will be much lower than dramas from the past. Moreover, art is a difficult subject to understand because of its dry nature. People who do not have a natural interest in art find it difficult to appreciate the work.",
        "Providing quality art schools to the students will help alleviate this issue. Although there is a dearth of good mentors in the industry but not all has been lost. The governments can still step up to the challenge and provide good art learning facilities to the future artists. The preaching of quality arts would eventually result in the dissemination of good material to the public. Another step that can be taken to promote arts is to hold free of cost exhibitions and seminars. The interest in art can be reinvigorated with the help of free exhibitions where people can come to appreciate the work.",
        "In conclusion, it is an inarguable fact that the field of arts has lost its popularity because of various reasons. However, with the right steps taken, the passion for arts can be reignited in the hearts of the people."
