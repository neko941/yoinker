        "In recent times, there is an increase in the amount of garbage being disposed by people. As individuals we need to be cognizant about the amount of thrash that is being produced. In the esaay, I would want to highlight two points, first reasons why there is an increase and second what are options for the government to reduce the amount of rubish produced.",
        "People now have tendency to dispose things that is not being used frequently. They are ready to discard anything that they do not like or they are not comfortable using it. The reason for this is because individuals buy things that may not be needed or they just purchased more than needed quantity of it. Off late, the disposable incomes of the mass population has increased multiple folds, when compared to ten years ago. For example, in the 1980 an  household could only purchase a can of Coke with $20 salary that he had. Now the salaries have changed to $100, which give the masses ability to buy more cans of Coke due to the increase income. People need to understand the more they buy, there is a potential of generating more rubbish which will go in the landfills.",
        "In order to reduce the increased volumes of disposed items, there are number of intiatives the governments can take. They can have a law that restricts users and communities to dispose only cetrain type of waste. For example, in India some of the local municipal governments have made it compulsory for societies with more than 100 flats to have their on waste disposal system. In the city of Mumbai, the Muncipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai has also applied a daily upper limit on the amount of thrash that goes to the dumping grounds. With such intiatives, people are forced to ensure the manage their consumption and do not waste food or products. Government authorities have the power and ability to control and restirict people actions around waste disposal.",
        "To conclude, every individual needs to be cautious when purchasing products and should not buy it in excess of what is needed. At the same time governments and local authorities can run various initiatives to control and maintain the amount of waste going to the landfills."
