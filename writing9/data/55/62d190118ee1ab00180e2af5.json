        "Peoples demand are progressively increasing day-by-day. Some individuals say that peoples who are older should work till later age. I believe that though working in older age should be hard for them, but it is beneficial in some ways.",
        "Firstly, older people should works to be self dependent. Peoples who are working at elder age, they can fulfil their all demand which reduce to become dependent to another people. For example, if an older person works, he/she doesn\u2019t depend to other for pocket money. He/she can easily bear his/her daily needs like treatment, hobby and so on. So, working till later age helps them to meet their own expenses.",
        "Moreover, older citizen can help their countries economy by working. They don\u2019t become burden to their country to earning money. When a countries older community works, their per capita income will be high to become their economy strong. For instance, we see many countries government provide enlarged allowance to older peoples who are not work. If people are work, government don\u2019t needs to give them it by which administration can do other social improvements. So, the more enlarged peoples work in a country, the stronger their economy will be.",
        "On the other hand, working will be difficult for peoples who are enlarged. Peoples loose their physical ability regarding their age. This may lead to falling many diseases resulting in they become enable to work. Indeed, there have been some recorded showed that working at older aged would be harmful for their health possible leading to create big health varrier. At older age, they turn to like a child. So this time they needs to take rest.",
        "In conclusion, the expense of people lives are far bigger than that of earlier. I think, older peoples work  are efficient for them but they can find some difficulties to work."
