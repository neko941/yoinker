        "These days, people have been categorised according to what external elements they have, like belongings and social status. However, internal characters are not essential anymore. This essay totally disagrees with this statement because humans care about their benifits, it is difficult to find trustworthy society in this world.",
        "Humans\u2019 thinking process has been changed over a period of time in this modern world, to become more selfish than anything else. People live in a hectic lifestyle and in a specific routine as a result of this, they do not have enough time to change most of the world problem, and within a specific of time they got used to it and accept the idea of forgetting the internal personality. For instance, Al Khaleej Times newspaper have recently asked the population about this statement and more than 60% say yes.",
        "However, human beings must consider the internal values instead of external one\u2019s because one day all of this material will go away while the old values remained constant without any changes. We should protect these values by transfer them to the next generation and prepare them about what they will face in the future. We can not live in this planet without trust with each other. Let us take the latest researches as an example, most of Arabic cultures reflect these concepts as on the basics stones when they raise up their kids.",
        "In conclusion, we should monitor our behaviors to enhance our relationships and make it stronger by improve the concepts of personalities and internal feelings. I would have to say that Old-fashioned values are always superior."
