        "There are some who think medics and engineering professionals must  be obligated to work in the country where they studied, other people believe they should work where they want even abroad. In my opinion, I agree that a balance between two options will benefit professional and their countries.",
        "On the one hand, professionals who work where they studied may help to increase  local development.  Currently, in many countries like  Chile, there are scholarships to pay their studies but after finishing their studies, graduates have to return the state aid working in a public system especially in poor places which permit them to develop a project that improves the quality of life of isolated towns contributing to local communities.",
        "On the other hand, it is often thought to have a free choice where working even abroad is better for professional growth. When graduates begin to work is very important to create a contact net with people from other countries as a benefit to get knowledge in their fields and could be an opportunity to get good jobs. Furthermore, the researches need different viewpoint, thus, working abroad could increase the quality of these.",
        "Finally, in my view, both options are indispensable for our society, but, the focus should depend on the professional field and the scholarship they got to contribute to the state. For instance, in some countries graduates may choice work abroad but are indispensable to help where they studied, they can be a researchers but their aid needs to be related to a problem of their countries.",
        "In conclusion, despite people having different views, I believe it would be better a balance between a free choice of the place to work and getting a job where they studied as it will benefit both personal and society."
