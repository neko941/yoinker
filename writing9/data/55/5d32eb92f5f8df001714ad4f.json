        "Recently, it is undeniable that many modern people spend their time in the house rather than outside. Some people hold onto notion that it has numerous rationales in this view while others oppose that it has no reason and also gives disadvantages. Still, personally, I completely agree with the first view. This essay is going to establish the reasons behind the idea in detail.",
        "Mostly people are staying inside their house because it provides them comfort and spend time with the Internet media for enjoyment. For instance, adults prefer to relax by watching TV after work for a long period, and children play on video games which are played on screen as well.",
        "Moreover, staying indoors are giving various points of the benefit. The first reason to consider is that it is safe to stay in the house this time. Take children, for example: it is very dangerous for children to spend time outdoors, not only risking threats from robbers that increasing huge number in currently but also have opportunities to get unexpected accidents. If people spend more time in the home, it can reduce their risk of unexpected dangers.",
        "Furthermore, there are many more validities of spending time inside the house. The most important reason is that the current air is contaminated with a lot of dust, which is not good for human health. The research conducted by Oxford University shows that 60% of the world have amount of dust in the air increasing rapidly, so being outdoors is very risky to receive the dust from air pollution.",
        "In the final analysis, it likely seems to be understandable that spending in the house have many positive things like secure from unexpected accidents and not causing the body to get air pollution. That means I am inclined to advocate that modern people should stay inside the house rather than going outdoors."
