        "There are a number of countries, where some people earn extremely high. For instance, India is one of the countries where one can see the best of both worlds. The reason behind this is more than 30% of the population is below the poverty line.",
        "There are several countries, where some people are getting richer by every passing day whereas the poor are getting poorer and have to strave. This could be for a several reasons, few might think money is money no matter how it comes into your pocket. The richer ones might not like getting their cash flow affected. Even the middle class section of the population might think the same as they do not expect any change from the government. Having a poor population might also mean cheap labour and low wages.",
        "The government should take initiatives to control the flow of money to some people. A country can only grow if the income is distributed equally amongst all the people. For example, China is a nation which managed to bring more than 800 million people from poverty. China is very much focused on the equal distribution and the development of all its citizens. You may not get cheap labour in China, but you will definitely get skillful labourers.",
        "To recapitulate, the income of a country should be divided equally and even if not equally then it should be taken care of that everyone get facilities like health care, education, food etc. In my opinion, countries following this policy can see a steady growth."
