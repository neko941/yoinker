        "Some people argue that weapon of mass destruction may end up the world, while others believe that nuclear power station can produce a considerably sustainable amount of energy. From my perspective, I totally agree that this technology would bring more pros than cons.",
        "On the one hand, it is undoubted that nuclear or atomic bombs can pose a threat to the world peace. To begin with, as they are weapon of mass destruction, they may cause the death of million people if they are exploded unintentionally in highly populated areas. For this reason, nobody wants to live near these extremely dangerous things. To illustrate, in August 1945, two megacities in Japan were bombarded with two atomic bombs, causing the death of over a hundred thousand people.",
        "On the other hand, there are some clear benefits for harnessing nuclear technology in generating electricity for millions of people all over the world. First of all, nuclear power is a sustainable energy source. This means that it can supply sufficient power for the majority of residents in cities constantly and continuously. Another important factor is that it helps to produce electricity without wasting natural resources. Hence, it is a potential energy source to replace the use of coal, oil or gas. Last but not least, by making use of nuclear generators, people can minimize carbon footprints that cause global warming.",
        "In conclusion, people can derive more desirable consequences than unfavorable ones from nuclear technology as above arguments. It seems to me that people should take into consideration using this advanced technology to reap all benefits."
