        "Recently, public health is a bebatable topic. Some believe that building more sports centres is the best way to improve public health. Others, however, opine that more sports club alone merely have any effect on public health. According to them, other measure are required to ensure people's well being. In my opinion, although, physical activity and easy availability of sports centres are effective tool to boost public health, but a healthy diet plan and lifestyle changes are equally necessary.",
        "Beyond doubt, ther are several benefits of indulging in sports activities. Most of indoor or outdoor sports require physical efforts and this in turn makes a person active and flexible. This definitly helps better physique of the body. To illustrate, a person indulging in a regulary physical activity is tend to be fitter than a one who does not participates in any major sports. In addition to that, playing sports benefits mental health and keeps a person agile and active. Thus we can see why some people are of the view that playing sports is the most ideal way to attain balanced health.",
        "However, playing sports alone is not sufficient. It is also important for people to watch their diet. I f tehy folow a nutricious diet plan and do excercise regularly, they have more chances of being fit. For example, no matter how much we do activity, it is not going to be that effective untill we folow a proper diet. Excercise helps body gain agility and lose extra calories and blanced diet makes sure necessary nutrients are replenished. Therefore, it is clear why people consider healthy eating is more effective tha physical activity alone.",
        "To conclude, people may vary in their opinion, but i firmly advocate a combination of a regulary physical activity and a balanced diet plan is an essential element to achieve good public health."
