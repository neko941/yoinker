        "At present world, Value of the person depends on the status. Most of the people give respect to the individual based on his financial background and things that a person is owning. But, I feel that the importance of the person should be judged according to his values.",
        "Nowadays, most of people have faith in cunning people rather than a genuine person. These days are not for the right people. For instance, few banks will not provide the loans to the farmers who are willing to repay it. Instead, it will give to bankrupts only. As a result, these financial institutions are collecting losses by charges from the poor people in the form of taxes. These type of incidents are killing the ethical values in this society and encouraging another financial scammer.",
        "These days values are not only losing in society but also in families. For example, When I was a kid, I have an uncle who adopted a boy from the orphanage, he treated that boy as his son and given all the comforts that every father gives to his blood son, after his son\u2019s marriage, his son went to abroad and settled there, even after hearing the news of my uncles death, his son did not come to see his father. These occurrences are not only damaging the society values but also family values too.",
        "To sum up, These days the significance of the person are given based on his standing in society. The values are not only damaging in the community but also in the family too. In my view, I feel that values like kindness, trust, and honour are more Value than things and money."
