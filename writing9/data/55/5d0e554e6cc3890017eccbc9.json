        "Nowadays, research regarding business, the academic world and sciences are being conducted to an extensive extent. There are some people who opine that it would be beneficial to share this information as much as possible while others have the view that some of the information is too crucial to be shared. In this essay, both of the mentioned views will be discussed.",
        "Giving out information regarding the mentioned fields would lead to the betterment of the world. If it is not being shared, then the entire purpose of the researches would not be fulfilled and no matter how important and valuable the data is, it would essentially be redundant, as it would be of no use. Sharing of the pivotal information would lead to further developments. To illustrate, if Isaac Newton had kept the information regarding the principles of gravity then there would not be any further researches in this and the related fields; there would not have been the inventions of spacecraft and we would not know how the solar system or the universe would work. Therefore, it is extremely vital for the information to be shared in order to make the world a better place.",
        "On the contrary, sharing every little detail of the researches conducted might be the downfall of the human race. If they fall into the wrong hands or someome with the intentions to harm others, it might be extremely detrimental for the society if they are capable of using the information in the right way. For instance, the invention of atomic bombs has lead to the deaths of millions of innocent people. This invention could have been possible only if the inventor had an idea on how atoms work and he would not have known that unless the information regarding this was shared. Hence, it is true that it is perilous to give out all the information collected through the researches.",
        "In conclusion, if the information is shared it can be used in the development and progression of the world, however it could also be deleterious to do so. In my view, it is worth it to share the information due to the mentioned reasons. In addition, if a person has an intent to harm others then they would find a way to do it and finally, the pros sharing of information outwighs the cons."
