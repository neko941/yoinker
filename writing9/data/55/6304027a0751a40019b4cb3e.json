        "As a resident of White Deer Town for 40 years, I am so glad your company is going to invest in the community by sponsoring the running costs of a baseball team or organization of a couple of concerts. Without a local professional sports team here, I am sure a local sports team, even though it is an under-11 one,  will definitely draw cheering crowds every Saturday whenever opposing teams are visiting. Not only can it improve business opportunities for shops and restaurants but it can also enable the team members to develop a spirit of competitiveness, endurance and discipline. On the other hand, while organizing a couple of concerts can also draw crowds, probably from outside the town, and boost local businesses, and let the adolescents have a crazy night, the merits are not as long-lasting as that of running a baseball team. With that being said, I would root for the idea of sponsoring a local baseball team for two years and hope your prestigious company can consider.",
