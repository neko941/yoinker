        "Schools are like a mirror in society. There are many children of higher calibre and acumen. In  school, every child can be motivated and encouraged. Nowadays, people think that children are too much leisure and they should be an endeavour to related on a school work issue. In this essay, the possible reasons behind and measures children make  full use of their free time and my views on the following points.",
        "The reasons for this trend may involve the recognition that children owe this problem to slow-moving, unenergetic, unproductive, indolent and postponing. Some of the surveys for too much free time children would level off and appear mentally problems and lack  enjoyment, happiness and satisfaction. Why are children eager for much free time? Recently, people had been competitive with others, a tough schedules and massive homework is torture for  children.",
        "Instead of children escaping this stressful situation they rather than makes exciting things, such as screen time. By contrast, the school can tend to be more independent, which is a very important factor in academic study, as well as giving them an advantage in terms of coping with the challenges of student life.",
        "However, there are certainly dangers in taking time off at that important age. Children are the best time for well-established psychological and physiological development, that avoids many mental problems. Thus, the suggestion of children should spend their free time suppose be 8 hours sleeping, 8 hours school time, 3 hours homework self-study and reaming time for free. They should choose interesting extracurriculars by themselves in their leisure time so that they would have parallel healthy physical and mental development. But overall, i think this is less likely today, when academic qualifications are essential for getting reasonable  university.",
        "My view is that children should be encouraged to broaden their horizons. That is the best way for them to get a clear perspective of what they are hoping to do with their lives and why. children with such a perspective are usually the most effective and motivated,\"Self-discipline makes one free\",  is what the world often says. If children want to have free time, they should take responsibility for their affairs first. Maintaining school work and life, studying and playing, may be the best way to gain a deeper diverse vision of themselves."
