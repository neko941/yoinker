        "Health experts point out that both regular exercise as well as a healthy diet are key for staying healthy. However, opinions regarding which one has more significance are divided. I believe that despite diet having its place, regular exercise has more advantages.",
        "It is well known that a balanced diet containing various nutrients is highly recommended to maintain good health. In the current obesity epidemic in the developed world, nutricious diet low in calorie content is necessary to lose weight. This, in turn, would lower the rates of other diseases, including coronary heart diseases, stroke or many types of cancer. Furthermore, a large body of research supports the claim that low cholesterol diet is one of the best prevention measures to avoid a heart attack. Therefore, strong body of evidence underlines the importance of diet in health.",
        "On the other hand, exercising regularly has also many health benefits. First of all, in makes us subjectively feel better in the long term. By strenthening muscles in enables performing everyday tasks, such as shopping or cleaning the house, with ease. Moreover, according to sport expert researchers physical activity causes a release of endorphins in out brain. This so called \u2018happiness hormone\u2019 helps to relieve stress and elevate our mood. The consequence of this physiological process triggered by exercise is yet another asset of playing sports. It is the fact that being more relaxed stops many from craving comfort food to combat daily tensions. Hence, engaging in regular sport activities could significantly boost the health of populations.",
        "In conclusion, both appropriate diet and exercise work synergeticly to improve out health. Although diet has its important place in prevention of many diseases, in my firm opinion, exercising on regular basis is more advantageus, as it brings health benefits not only per se but also indirectly by its impact on diet."
