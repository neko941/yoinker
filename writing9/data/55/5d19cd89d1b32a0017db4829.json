        "Nowadays, granting a person chances to help other citizens is thought to be the most crucial thing about being wealthy. In my opinion, this assessment does not contain any mistakes, furthermore, it transmits an essential moral lesson.",
        "Possessing a huge amount of property gives people opportunities to expand human knowledge, provide a satisfying life and practically hold up other people. Successful archivers have the assured future to go on their studying, which means contributing to human intelligence will be their undertaking. The more effective research and novel definitions they do, the more complicated projects we accomplish. Donation is an excellent activity that every celebrity, president and millionaire concentrates on. It is not only beautifying their reputation but also supporting orphan children, abandoned elderly communities. Money is not invaluable when it is not used for proper targets. Moreover, a majority of the population in poor countries don\u2019t need only encouragement. Realistically, they also have a common desire to be sponsored. Philanthropists with enormous budgets will not ignore them, because when people give away something, surely they will earn something else in the future. Being rich does not mean they manufacture money to use, it means everyone labours to pay them for receivers.",
        "There are many examples can prove my opinion. Syria was facing the most horrible warfare in this peaceful century. Witnessing that loss, everyone concerned about their aliveness and health. In previous March, the EU announced that the international donors engaged to sponsor approximately seven billion for people in Syria living in blood and tear. As for Australia, the champions of the competition called \u201cThe way to Olympia peak\u201d are awarded scholarship to be brought up in honourable college in the Kangaroo homeland. It contributes to nourishing brilliant people, developing human potential.",
        "In conclusion, supporting other people is a moral mission for people having giant property. It leads human to an equal life when the interdependence is dominating and peace covers the whole of the world."
