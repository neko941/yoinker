        "Most adults spend 40 hours a week at work, so it is important that they have a good sense of job satisfaction. However, while I agree that money is definitely one factor in how satisfied people are with their jobs, I definitely do not think is the most important.",
        "On the one hand, it is clear that money is a key reason why people choose to work in a particular profession. For the majority of the population, the only way to be financially independent is to have a job and, as a result, people often choose to work in fields with high salaries in order to support themselves. Moreover, any employee in any field would expect to receive the industry standard payment for the work that they do. I expect that if one employee found out that they were earning less than their colleagues, their level of job satisfaction would decrease dramatically as a result.",
        "However, although money is an important element of any job, there are other many more important factors that lead to job satisfaction. Having friendly, reliable colleagues, for example, can impact our feelings towards work in a major way. Many office jobs can be monotonous and repetitive, and, as a result, having a good relationship with co-workers can sometimes be the only reason why people choose to remain in a position. Conversely, no amount of money would be enough to keep an employee in an office where they felt isolated or bullied.",
        "Secondly, the work itself has to be a major factor, with people needing to believe that the job they do is interesting and meaningful in some way. Hoving daily tasks that you think are rewarding can go much further in raising satisfaction levels than salary alone. Take teachers or nurses for example, they earn relatively little, but would still score highly on the job-satisfaction because they generally feel that their jobs have a positive impact on other people's lives.",
        "In short, there are a number of factors that dictate how happy a person is at work, but money is only one of them. In fact, I would argue that fellow staff and the work itself are both more important than salary alone."
