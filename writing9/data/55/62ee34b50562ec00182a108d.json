        "Life is all about stages, there comes a period one needs to relax, and taking care of either by government or their children but this also depends on how early procreation took place in the aspect of children taking care of them. Meanwhile , a few numbers of individuals are of the notion that 60years elder should retire and as well stop working . I totally agree with this statement and this essay, will discuss on the need for older people to cherish their retirement age.",
        "The cycle of life comes with stages and as well one needs to untilize every opportunity seen at every spot. When it comes to retirement age which is within 50 and 60 years for some people. At this age, older ones who are government workers are advice to rest in other  not to keep stressing themselves with much work load and thus, creates opportunity for job employment for the youthful ones. Retirement does not simply means that one has to stick in door all through. NO... Other minor jobs can be created for them like opening of mini shops where they can come out each day and exercise and interact with others thereby eradicating some health issues like diabetes, osteoporosis which affects the bones , and depression .",
        "Secondly, It is of great benefit because government places them on pension allowances and health allowances as a reward  over the years of resilience, hardwork, and perseverance while on service. For example , a healthcare provider who is heading a labour unit in the health institution and has attain a retirement age can no longer handle such procedure because most ligaments is been worn out gradually and there is decrease in strength. In the US for example. The government provided a province known as OLD PEOPLE'S HOME, proper care and love is been rendered to them especially for those who do not have capable funds or persons to take care of their needs. Also , they are encouraged to practice passive exercise to avoid sedimentary lifestyle which could affect their health status and also strengthen their life span. Again , vacation can be another avenue to enjoy your retirement age with friends, loved ones and family at large.",
        "In conclusion, 60years of hard work, stress and psychological trauma that was experience while on service should no be taken for granted . And as well people should be ready to retire so that younger ones can get job and have their monthly or daily earns. Therefore retirement stage is a necessity."
