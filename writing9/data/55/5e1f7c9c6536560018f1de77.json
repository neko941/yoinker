        "It is observed that much importance should be attached to teaching young ones the disparity between what is good and bad at early stage. In order to learn the difference, punishing children will be useful. In my opinion, I strongly agree with this statement because discipline children will instil good morals and they will also end up becoming reliable adults.",
        "First and foremost, helping youngsters to learn the difference between right and wrong while they are still young culminate in making them have good morals. This is because any punishment given at this level of growth can easily correct their minds to imbibe good judgement and behaviour. For instance, the research department of United Nation International Children Education Funds conducted a study in Nigeria in the early 1900, and it was discovered that children who experienced consistent correction from their parent were able to choose the right path later in life. Hence, children with the knowledge of what is right and wrong were thoroughly taught during their childhood years.",
        "Another reason to be considered is that the act of discipline the young ones assists in raising responsible adult. The reason being that at childhood, the consequences of good and bad attitudes are known and these are avoided as growth takes place. Thereby, helping them to grow into a dependable adult with good characters.To illustrate, in my conversation with some successful leaders today, their ability to lead came as a result of lessons learnt from mistakes made while they were growing and leading in little capacity,which they were disciplined for by mentors. Therefore, training youngstars right way of living results in becoming a better adult in life.",
        "In conclusion, I totally agree that making effort to help children learn the difference between the right and wrong through punishment is absolutely important, because they end up having good morals and growing into responsible adult."
