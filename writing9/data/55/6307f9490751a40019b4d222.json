        "In today\u2019s world, a lot of elderly citizens live by themselves. This causes a variety",
        "of problems, but fortunately, there are some solutions.",
        "The biggest problem regarding the elderly living by themselves is isolation.",
        "They may have no one to talk to on a daily basis, which can lead to loneliness",
        "and depression. It also means that if their health suddenly deteriorates, there is",
        "no one there to help or take care of them. Moreover, they might feel less",
        "inclined to go out by themselves, so they might do little or no exercise, which",
        "can impact both their physical and mental health.",
        "Another challenge faced by seniors living alone is that they may eat badly.",
        "Many may not be willing to cook a healthy meal for one. They may eat frozen",
        "meals or the same kinds of food everyday with little nutritional variety. This is",
        "problematic because poor nutrition can exacerbate existing health issues that",
        "often come with old age.",
        "The best way to deal with these problems is to make connecting the elderly to",
        "others a priority. The government should subsidise internet connections and",
        "provide online platforms and forums so that seniors can learn to join in with",
        "others easily via the internet. Furthermore, these platforms could be used to",
        "organize local outings to encourage exercise. They could also help seniors with",
        "health issues and educate them on nutritional cooking or assist with ordering",
        "fresh food deliveries.",
        "In conclusion, it can be problematic for elderly people to live alone, but there",
        "are some ways to improve their situation. It is important to take action to",
        "ensure our seniors live well."
