        "It cannot be disputed that, in the recent decade, people are suffering from a great deal of weight related health issues, thus exerting a burden on the healthcare system. In order to curb this problem, certain demographics of the society believe that schools should introduce more fitness lessons in their curriculum. This essay will completely agree with the aforementioned suggestion and provide substantial evidence to support the statement.",
        "To begin with, most diseases faced by the population today are linked to lifestyle factors, namely diabetes, hypertension, heart diseases etc., putting a strain on the healthcare system. A large part of the youth is suffering from obesity, hence developing various health problems prematurely. The reason for this increasing trend of overweight individuals can be linked to sedentary pursuits, enjoyed by the youth today. Unlike olden days, children no longer engage in outdoor activities, rather stay in the comfort of their homes to communicate and play with their friends online. A study showed that among 100 children interviewed at a local neighborhood regarding the way they spend their leisure time, majority of them chose sedentary activities like watching television or playing video games.Therefore, it can be discerned that lack of proper education and awareness is a major factor for these unhealthy life choices.",
        "Schools can be the key players to address this matter urgently, by incorporating physical education as part of their regular curriculum. This will enable children to learn the importance of having an active lifestyle,as well as encourage to them participate in various sports activities, which will not only improve their physical health, but also mental development.",
        "To conclude, I believe that introducing more physical education lessons in school curriculum is essentially a great way towards shaping a considerably more health conscious society. Educational institutes should come forward with better strategies to encourage children towards healthy lifestyles."
