        "Medical science has advanced exponentially in the last century. This has resulted in vaccines being able to prevent many diseases that happen during childhood. But, there is a debate regarding whether it should be made legally mandatory for parents to complete all vaccination for childhood diseases or should it be left to the respective individual's choice. This essay supports the view that vaccination for childhood diseases should be made legally mandatory for all the parents. This essay will first discuss the possible harms that can affect the child due to lack of vaccination and then will discuss whether parents should be allowed to take this decision for their children.",
        "To begin with, there can be multiple harms that can happen to a children in case preventive vaccination is not provided. The body, due to lack of vaccination, might not be immune to common diseases such as cold, etc and it might be developing symptoms that might show over years and not immediately. For example, in case polio shorts are not provided to a child, then the child will have high probability of developing weaker or deformed legs.",
        "Considering the possible harms that can happen to a child due to lack of vaccination, the next question to be asked is whether the parents should be allowed to make this judgement for their child? Although, the parents are responsible for everything in a toddler's life, but, something as critical as vaccination should not be left to an individual's choice because lack of vaccination might result in severe deformity in later stages of life or even in death of the child. For example, latest survey conducted by medical association of India concluded that with the rise of internet, 40% of the parents prefer child vaccination solely on the basis of their own views, and not the views of their doctor.",
        "To sum up, childhood vaccination is a matter of immence importance as this can affect not only the early years but also later years of a child's body development and hence a parent shouldn't be allowed to make judgment for their children, since the repurcussions for lack of vaccinations are severe."
