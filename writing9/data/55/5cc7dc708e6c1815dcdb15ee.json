        "It is widely believed that if a country focus on improving its technology, its traditions and ways of life will be vanished and it makes no sense to keep them alive. While I totally disagree with the opinion that we do not need traditions, I believe that technology can enable people to converse their convention.",
        "There are various reasons why people have to keep and circulate the traditions. Firstly, traditions are treasure and heritage from people\u2019s ancestors so every country should be proud of its unique cultural identity. Thanks to traditions, individuals are able to have more understanding about history such as the thought of our forefathers and the ancient lifestyles. Secondly, traditions can be regarded as a huge resource of tourism attractions for a nation. By tangible and intangible cultural heritage, a country can gain its own reputation and get the lucrative profit which helps promote the nation\u2019s economy.",
        "However, technology can positively contribute to keep traditional skills and way of life alive. In most of remote areas, people do not have schools for children so their children have to leave their impoverished village since they were kids to find proper education. Therefore, they will lose sight of the customs and culture in their hometown to adapt with the rule in new accommodations. Nonetheless, with technological development, students nowadays can study at home via Internet, thus, shorten the gap between the urban and rural areas to maintain their local traditions. Furthermore, technology can help media popularize the specific customs and traditions of each country, not only attracting tourists and visitors but also helping settlers not be confused with new practices in that country.",
        "In conclusion, inhabitants have responsibility to preserve their traditions and they can utilize technology as a useful tool to help them maintain these customs."
