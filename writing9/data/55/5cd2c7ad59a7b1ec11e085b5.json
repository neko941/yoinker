For instance, introduction of online businesses  people tend to buy and sell goods without being stressed. Also transaction can be done at faster rate. Further more, some of electrical equipment serve as means of relaxation for people. Watching of various films and news can be done at comfort zone with either there phones, television or palmtops, which makes life's convent and enjoyable",
        "Despite the benefit mention above peoples sedentary life's style tend to increase on daily basis which as negative effect on health.
