        "Nowadays, education has always been a topic of debate among parents as well as teachers. Many students find subjects like mathematics and philosophy difficult to learn. While some argue that these topic are of utmost importance and should be compulsory, others say it should be optional. I personally agree with the latter side of argument.",
        "On the one hand, some people believe that all subjects should be taught in schools irrespective of children's choice. They say it is necessary to have all the basic skills to survive in this world and hence there should not be any choice or preference. Even though few find topics like philosophy and history difficult to understand, they argue that it will help children understand others, appreciate them and get to know what our past is so that they can learn from it and avoid the same mistakes. For instance, many countries like India has included incidents like World War, French revolution and freedom struggle in their curicullum to make future generation knowledgeable about our past.",
        "On the other hand, another set of people are of the opinion that everyone, including children, ought to have a choice and it should be respected and I completely agree with this. It is high time we should realise the fact that every individual is different and scoring high marks in examination is not the correct criteria to judge someone's ability. Besides, there is no need to force students to learn everything under the sun. For instance, due to technological advancements, majority of computational tasks are done by computers and high end calculators. Hence, it is not mandatory to learn mathematics if someone is finding it difficult. Some will be interested in philosophy, while some in arts. They should be allowed to follow their passion and pursue a career in that rather than forcing them to be like few others who are good at every subject. There are indeed a lot of sucessful people who are college drop outs and who has learning disabilities like dyslexia. Therefore, instead of forcing kids, they should follow their heart.",
        "To conclude, it has always been a practice and believe that schools should teach everything. In my opinion, what one should learn have to be their choice based on their interest and no subject should be made a mandate for studies."
