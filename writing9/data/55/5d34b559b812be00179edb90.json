        "One of the beautiful memories of childhood includes the presence of toys. Many people donot pay attention to the myriad of toys their child have for playing. There are both pros and cons of keeping a large number of toys for the youngster.",
        "On the one hand, you are spoiling your child if he is getting anything he asks for. It is the duty of a parent to develop a conscience in child about the reality of life. A child should know that he cannot get anything he wants and he has to earn the toy by doing something fruitful like his homework. This is the right way of parenting by using these tools to teach a child about ways of life. In addition, these innumerable toys can cause an inferiority complex in another child. Often friends play together and seeing a plethora of toys can make a child to think that why my friend has access to so many toy and I have not. This can lead to social discriminiation among your child and his friends.",
        "On the other hand, you cannot have a childhood without toys. These mesmerising memories always stay with you throughout your life. A child should be allowed to have toys and play with them as it is a healthy activity. In this way, he learns how to communicate. For instance, most girls love to have a doll and they share their thoughts with it. So, a girl outgrow a doll toy but she remembers the lesson of communication.",
        "In conclusion, having a toy is the right of every child but parents should avoid buying a myriad of toys for their child as there is no good in spoiling your child at such a naive age."
