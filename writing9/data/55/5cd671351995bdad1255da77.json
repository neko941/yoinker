        "Media has great impact on the society in recent days. The violences broadcast in media  boost the cruleity in society. In my opinion the brutality of people is increasing due to promotion of crimes in medias",
        "Firstly, the teenagers are commiting more heinous crimes because of their interest in playing horror and most thrilling games leads to accept the challenge publish by game administrators. For an example, the most popular horror game is \"blue whale challenge \"which the player has to accept the  task in step by step process starting by perform criminal task end upto killing himself or others. Secondly, young generation spend  watching cartoons, you tube videos or movie more than 4-5 hours in their daily routine and most of these entertainments have physical violence. This leads them to think that it is normal things to commit crimes. This can be illustrated by increasing no of incidents such as physical abuse by school student. Recently a case was reported in Mumbai school, a sixth standard student was killed by his senior for not sharing seats in school bus.",
        "However there are many useful and vast advanced  information available in medias especially internet including development of recent technologies  and help us to learn and update in    time fractions but there are no restrictions on availing these contents even if they contain violent feature. Furthermore ,the terrorists activities are recently advancing with the help of internet especially instant access of videos of making advanced bombs as well as recruiting freshers and training providing through video calls.They promote communal riots by floating more videos of slaughtering people based on religion in social medias and create unrest among other people by dividing among religion .For instance, ISIS group recruiting many Muslim people from India with the help of mass killing videos by the name of religion published through social medias like Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.",
        "In conclusion, by considering the fact of increasing crimical activities by young people and terrorists activities in recent days, the violence in society are more spreading and advancing with help of atrocities broadcasting through medias only."
