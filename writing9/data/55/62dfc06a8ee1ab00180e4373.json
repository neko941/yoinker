        "New types of social media deeply affect the living habits of people, it is an irreversible trend in society. Some people argue this trend only has a bad effect on youngsters while others do not agree.  I will give my own explanations according  to experience and knowledge.",
        "On the one hand, contacting each other immediately and keeping messages safe. Compared to the past, we need to spend a lot of money and time to convey messages to each other by letters or telephones. However, nowadays, people use new types of applications or social platforms to leave messages and do not worry about the messages missing during the delivery.",
        "Secondly, making friends from different backgrounds and breaking through the boundaries of national limitation. Social media works on the internet, thus people can get various news, information and send messages to other people. This is a convenient way to get to know people who are from other countries.",
        "On the other hand, other people have the opposite opinion with the ideas above. People become not good at socializing with other people in real life. Because they get familiar with texting, not talk to people by mouth. It makes people like to hide back on mobile phones or computer's screens, so  they are shy when communicating face to face. Moreover, communities prefer to talk to people on social media rather than talk to people in real life.  For example, in Taiwan, this is a common phenomenon that young people text each other, even if people are just next to them. Maybe it is a reason why young people lose their ability to socialize.",
        "In conclusion,  technology brings advantages and disadvantages to human society.  It can change people in a positive way but also can go in a negative way, depending on how people realize and how to use social media."
