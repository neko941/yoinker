        "Many youngsters change their jobs or choose different careers every few years. I will analyze the reasons for this trend in the eassay. I believe that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages.",
        "To begin with, young people quit their jobs frequently because they are bored in doing the same job for a long time. Compared with older generations who work for the same company until retirement, young people tend to try new career paths. If they cannot get promoted after working for several years, they will hunt for a higher position in another cooperation. Moreover, the economic market is increasingly changeable nowadays. Some young individuals quit their original jobs so as to work in a more profitable industry. For instance, a lot of young workers in the internet company pursue a new career path in the artifical intelligence sector, for the latter seems more promising in recent years.",
        "From my point of view, the advantages of changing jobs outweigh its disadvantages. Firstly, young people will not get bored in repeating the same work for their lifetime. They are more likely to enjoy what they do. Moreover, entering new career can improve the skills of young employees, making them more adaptable and experienced to survive in the competitive workplace. As a result, they are more likely to succeed in the job market. Importantly, many people can not only get a higher salary and better welfare but also build up more social networks by changing new jobs.",
        "In conclusion, young people change their jobs more frequently because of their passions in pursuing new careers and fast-changing job market. I think that the advantages of this phenomenen outweigh the disadvantages."
