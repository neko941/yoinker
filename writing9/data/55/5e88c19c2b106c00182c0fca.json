        "In the modern world, if people look at the diversification of the world \u2018 s economy, they can see that tourism has great power among the factors that impact on the economy. The tour is being grown without pay attention to nationals beliefs and cultures that can cause big problems  among  countries. To a certain extent I agree that we should overcome our challenges. Conversely, I also believe that we  should not destroy    the human\u2019s beliefs",
        "I accept that it is important  to  take into consideration that   countries stay   on the  column  of economy  nevertheless, governments,  tourism  agents, visitors    should   be warned  the national strings  should not be crushed. Tourists do not  generally    learn  about  local places, traditions and religions  before  reach  to  destinations. Therefore, there arise  some  disagreements   between   locals and tourists. For  example, in India,  cows   are recognized     for holy being  that helped  their  god. Although,   this  is reacted   with    ridicule  by  some  countries, they must not   humiliate   the natives",
        "In the other hand, I believe that   nationals should be hospitable   to people who visit  their countries  to acquire  experiences  about    cultures,  nature, traditional  events.  it is acceptable that  , in the some  countries  ,  residents  threat  tourists  negatively   , deceive  them  and demonstrate nationalism and  religion discrimnation",
        "In conclusion  ,although  I accept that  tourists  is shown  bad  behavior  by  dwellers   ,   tourists have  to  be  gentle  to  locals  and  do not   overwhelm  local  believes"
