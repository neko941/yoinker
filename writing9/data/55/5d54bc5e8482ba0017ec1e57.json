        "There is no doubt that most of the adults spend the majority of their day at work. This essay will discuss some elements which contribute to job satisfaction, and whether they exists or not.",
        "There are two main factors that contribute to job satisfaction. Firstly, the working environment could be considered the most important aspects of the job in the long term. The environment not only includes the physical environment of the company but also the working atmosphere. The main reason for believing this is that a well-equipped company will enable one to work comfortably and securely. Employees will feel fulfilled when their performance is being recognized and being respected by others.",
        "Secondly, good remuneration can influence their attitudes towards the job in a positive way. Nowadays, people\u2019s lives considerably depend on their income. Furthermore, financial incentives will boosts employees to achieve their personal and career goals. Conveying a sense of achievement make people feel pleased with their performance. Therefore, the financial aspects of a job are to link closely to employee satisfaction.",
        "Since individuals have different expectations, it is impossible to define whether all workers can experience satisfaction in their career. As a consequence, It is unrealistic to fix every defect of a workspace and often companies can only reach to a point which can fulfill 60% of employers or above.",
        "In conclusion, although it is impossible to be fully satisfied with a job, some common factors like salary and environment could be changed to reach an optimum state."
