        "Humans as we are we go places all the time. We go to work, school, the market etc. In order to move from one place to another, there is the need to use various means of transport such as bus train and cars. The commonest among these is cars. Many people prefer using their own cars as compared to cars owned by others and serving as a source of livelihood. So many reasons account for this. In this essay, I will outline some of these reasons and ways the authorities can make commercial transports popular.",
        "Firstly, people prefer using their own cars to travel because they are assured of their own safety since they believe their car is in good shape and they are in their right minds themselves. Unlike public transport where one does not know the condition of the cars or person behind the wheels. Moreover, most accidents recorded involve public transport and research proves mostly, the cars are in bad condition and was ignored.",
        "Furthermore, it is time consuming boarding public transport as compared to using one's own vehicle to commute. Drivers of commercial cars usually make unnecessary stops with passengers on board. For example, a driver will now stop on the way to buy fuel, inflate a tyre or even change a punctured tyre. All these activities is a waste of time. Others also make inappropriate stops to carry pedestrians who want to board.",
        "Authorities may want to encourage people to choose public transport rather than their private cars maybe as a way of reducing traffic and congestion. This can be done by education. Educating drivers on road signs and the need to frequently service their cars is a sure way. When people realize change in drivers behaviors, they will be attracted to using public vehicles.",
        "In conclusion, individuals prefer private cars rather than commercial cars because with personal owned cars, one is assured of safety and no time waste. Educating and training drivers is a good way of making the use of public vehicles popular."
