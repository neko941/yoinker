        "Nowadays, images are used more in news article and newspaper for better explaination. It is a fact that, pictures say thousands words, without writing single text, so that some people believe that, these have more impact on readers rather that words. I extremely agree with this statement. Photograps are best means of communication with readers and easy to remember for long time.",
        "To begin with, picture can summarize thousands of words. For intance, last summer World Health Oganization arranged an exhibition on the topic of \" World food and Health\". The exhibition had photographs, taken by journalists who travel around the globle. Among those photographs, all the eys got caught on a picture which was taken by reporter called \" Petter de Costa\". In his photo, there was a African tribe chide who was crying because he was hungry and did not has food. Because of attention to that image, those people received plenty of helping hands to overcome what they were suffering from through the years.",
        "secondly, compared to  words and videos, a pcture can draw more attention to the human mind. For example, a research article which was published by Oxford University revealed that the human brain is more capable of remembering picture rather than words and videos. Moreover, it can be seen in live news on TV, weather reprot always shows in graph image, so that people can understand, remember and judge that how would be the weather that day.",
        "To sum up my wiriting, images play paramount role in communicaiton since decades and pass messages for centuries without words."
