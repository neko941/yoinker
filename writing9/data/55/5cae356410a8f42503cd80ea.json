        "Subject importance has become a debatable issue among many people in the world. Few of them argue that subjects like Science and Computers are of primary importance to children because they help shape their careers in future.. Nevertheless, others believe that History is an essential subject in school curriculum. I reckon that teaching children about past  is equally important as it provides a base to learn other subjects in details.",
        "",
        "On one hand, there is no denial that world needs more doctors, scientists and engineers to make it a better place to live. But future is unknown to those who know nothing about the past. Pupils learn through exploring and experiment.Lack of knowledge on previous experiments or its implication on the society can only lead to disastrous results. Therefore, i believe study about previous discoveries, application of technology and its impact can lead to more successful inventions and strategies. Subjects like, Physics, Chemistry and Biology are all part of the  subject,History, For instance, study about our ancestors inventing wheel has given the world the fastest running cars today.",
        "",
        "On the other hand, educating children in school on nation or world history acts as an eye-opener for them. They not only just learn about an individual but a country as a whole. Past knowledge about the economies help current leaders make better decisions. Moreover, documentation of serious of events in the past and taking their examples can enhance the decision making ability of the young generation in the fields like politics and archaeology. Study of various revolutions and fights for freedom also make the present generation realize the real meaning of freedom and discourages them to take their resources for granted. Leader like, Abraham Lincoln and Nelson Mandela act as role models till date, their philosophies and approach are still into practice and inspire many budding minds.",
        "",
        "In conclusion,no amount of gained credence of subjects like Science and Technology can steal the spotlight from History. Development of technology and scientific research will continue to expand as long as their historical backgrounds are recorded."
