        "Some people think that universitie subjects should have the same amount of women and men. With this idea probably the world could be more equal, due to both genders would have the same opportunities to obtain knowledge. However, in my view, this though is utopic for the reason that male and female have differents abilities, which should have used according what is easier for them. \r\rIf colleges force to incorpore more women in careers related with math or science, the world likely would change, because the \u201cweak sex\u201d would have more chance to show their abilities in this fiels. This has as a consequence a fair planet, for the reason that femenine sex had not have an equal participation through of years. Hence, this would be a great opportunity for give back all lost years, therefore, is a way to do justice. \r\rHowever, many studies show that the abilities between a man and a woman are differents. With this I don\u2019t want to say that one gender is better than other, only I\u2019m expressing that their skills have been giving according their role in the survive. For example, women are better in empathy and comprehension, so they would be higher in professions in the health area. On the other hand, men are more calculated and good with numbers, then they could work better in careers such as engineers and maths. \r\rIn conclusion, I understand that the world want to be more equal for female, so for this cause some persons want to in every area is divide between a women and a men. However in my opinion this idea is quite utopic, for the fact that both sexs have different skills, which is demostrate with many scientific studies."
