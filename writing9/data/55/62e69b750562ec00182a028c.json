        "Generally, the development and progress of a country are related to different factors. Many governments believe that the most important factor is economic growth. However, many individuals believe that other factors are equally important for a country. In my opinion, economic progress is a complementary and supportive factor for other factors in managing a country.",
        "On the one hand, the economic is one of the main parts of managing every country. The economic growth can provide the development of a country in different aspects. In other words, if a country has a dynamic economy, it fast progress in other fields, such as employments, development the tourism industry, social welfare, international relations, and decrease poverty. For example, the USA, as the first economic power in the world, always has a good operation in the mentioned fields. So, the state of favorable economic and its progress are the most important goal for governments because it paves the way to achieve other goals.",
        "However, in addition to economic growth, there are other many factors that are equally substantial for a country. The education system\u2019s growth is one of them. In other words, the development of the education system can help the governments to train professionals in different fields based on their needs. For example, China, as one of the most successful countries in the world in order to produce electricity, has trained many experts in this field. Furthermore, progress in public health is another important factor for a country. Indeed, if a country has a high rate of public health, it has more potential to develop the country. To exemplify it, Switzerland is known for its high-level public health worldwide, which caused be a successful country in other fields. Therefore, considering progress in another factors in addition to the state of economic are important for managing a country.",
        "In conclusion, although governments choose economic growth as an important factor, paying attention to other factors is also essential. Indeed, the governments can use their economic potential as a complementary element to growth in other fields, such as educational system and public health."
