        "It is often argued that children content of programs watching  in television can influence the way children behave where as some others who think that it depends on the time they invest infront of television.This essay discusses both sides of the argument before reaching my own perspective that children manners can be affected by the programs they see in the media.",
        "To begin with,people who believe that younsters behaviour is affected by the hours spent on television is mainly because of the factors such as declined physical activities as well as lack of social interaction.Investing tremendous time infront of television can cause vision problems and overweight.They also find it difficult to communicate with peer groups for fun activities and find it comfortable to sit alone.For instance,a recent study by a medical students in India showed that 80% of younger generation  spending more than two hours of time on television is using power glasses and suffered from obesity.",
        "Nevertheless, there are a group of people who considered that the pograms on television has large impact on attitude of children  because,youngsters mind is like a glass for moulding and it can be easily affected and attracted by the visuals in the screen.Enormous programmes are available in medias including violence, history,crime,travelogues, culture, cartoons etcetera.A child who regularly watching documentary channel like national geographic will always have the curiosity to know about the general topics and tried to findout books related to it after school hours also.Similarly,those who addicted to cartoons tried to imitate the mannersims of his favorite hero in the cartoons and same can happened with those who regulary watching violence,they start doing all violence with the thought that it is quite natural to implement it in norma life.",
        "To conclude,even though spending long time for watching Tv influence the youngsters, I inclined to believe that the messages conveyed from the programmes they monitoring in television has huge impact on their behaviours."
