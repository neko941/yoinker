        "It is true that advertising have become an increasingly significant part of our society, some people claim that because of the impact of advertisements, people begin to look all the same. From my perspective, I can only partly agree with the assertion.",
        "There are various reasons why people insist that advertising discourage people from being different individuals. First and foremost, in order to promote sales, some brand have invested considerably large sum of money into advertising campaign, which have persuaded a majority of people to purchase the same products. For instance, as a result of apple's successful advertising, masses of people on the street are using an IPhone. These kind of popularity make it much difficult for us to distinguish an individual's personality based on the product they use. Furthermore, the celebrities shown on those advertisements shared similar characteristic of appearance. That could lead the public to narrow standard of aesthetic judgments. Even worse, those campaigns usually emphasize on mainstream lifestyle as well as the similar trend of fashion, which continues to make the society less diverse.",
        "Nonetheless, I believe some advertisements also have adverse effect. Technological development has brought some changes to the advertising industry. Nowadays, different people will receive different kinds of advertisements based on their internet searching histories or shopping records. Because of the personalized advertising, it is highly likely that people's taste will become much more diverse in the future. Apart from that, more and more internet influencers who are quite independently minded also encourage the public to appreciate different forms of beauty. Therefore, not all the advertisings are aiming at persuading people to follow the same trend and appear the same look.",
        "In conclusion, while I agree that some advertisements have negative influence on developing diversity, I believe that part of them promote individual personality."
