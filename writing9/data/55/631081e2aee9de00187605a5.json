        "Last summer on holiday, I  travelled to Beijing (China) with my family. The first week we went just to the tourist parts: we visited some important museums, walked through the Chinese wall, went to restaurants and tasted very different kinds of foods like insects, crocodile meat, penguin... So the first days we really enjoyed them as we were seeing just the superficial part of China.  But  the next week, we decided to change the hotel, which was located in the city centre and went to another one located on the outside of the city. Then there we started to see the reality of China.",
        "A rich country with a very poor population, kids stealing food from restaurants, adults sleeping on the streets without socks, street dogs that don't have water to drink, very old houses near to fall down...",
        "We saw some things that we could never have imagined  can happen in this century, we got really shocked so there we ended our holidays and came back to Spain.",
        "I really recommend people that don't have the opportunity to travel to don't believe always  what they see and on what they tell"
