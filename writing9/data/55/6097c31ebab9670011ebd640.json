        "Gap between the rich and the poor has been increasing dramatically.There are some people  who think that the economically- deprived countries need to be financially supported by the affluent nations. I, strongly deny this since this leads dependency. This essay shall support my view in the following paragraphs.",
        "Firstly, when poor countries are assisted by money, they would rarely work to overcome their issues as there is no  necessity to find an alternative. This attitude definitely worsens the situation even further. For example, previously many low-income nations were funded financially, now, new methods are adopted to support them, namely, skill training and education. This initiatives obviously made a huge development in those countries, where the support has been received.Therefore, financial assistance is not something which enhances the growth of the third world nations.",
        "Secondly, the developed countries itself have  requirements  that manage  its own affairs. Apart from this, the state\u2019s money is the taxes which levied from the citizens, so the people have expected to receive better facilities and amenities from the government.  If the government squandered the money for other nations could create internal conflicts, even, financial crisis as well. For instance, the Trump administration decreased its contribution to  WHO\u2019s programmes that aiming to improve socio-economic development of  the worst hit countries. However, setting a new companies in these places by the wealthy  could create  job opportunities to the local community, eventually, they would economically flourish.",
        "In conclusion, people have a different view on whether the rich nations are responsible to fund the poor. I firmly think that, the poor requires training and employment than money."
