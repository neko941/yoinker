        "Nowadays, the percentage of people who has taken the decision to have a plastic surgery has increased. The main benefits are higher self-steem and people acquiere a decent job; however, the drawbacks are that citizens have to spend a lot of money for and the death indice has increased for malpractice.",
        "Most of the people are not happy with their appearance in life, so many of them choose to have a plastic surgery to have a better physical characteristics and high self-steem. Once people got the surgery,  they love what they see reflected on the mirrow. Also, some of them will have a better life. More importantly, the concept they have about their appearance is more positive to reach their goals in life. Futhermore, there are many companies that hire people by the physical appearance, so these citizens that have had a plastic surgery will have greater opportunities to be hired. For instance, In The United States most of the individuals who work for custumer service are hired based on their physical aspect such as light skin and color of  the eyes.",
        "One of the drawbacks is that people who have experienced a plastic surgery need to spend too much money to improve their appearance. This make them  to ask for a loan to the bank that later on they will paid with a high interest. Another disadvantage is that many people have died due to mal- practice during the surgery. On top of this, many of these doctors face no legal consequences and they keep their jobs as nothing has happened. As a result, society is getting accoustum to hear that an individual has died by trying to have a plastic surgery. To explain myself further, Los Angeles is well know to have many clinics where some people look for their services; however, the university of Fullerton presents a recent study that revels that fifteen percent of these society will lose their lives by going under  plastic surgery.",
        "To conclude, wanting to have a better physical appearance is the most desire thing to acquiere; however, the drawbacks outweigh the advantages, and this is not worth it to do it."
