        "The trend of people knowing less of their neighbors compared to the past is being increasingly witnessed these days. In this essay, I shall discuss the main causes why this change has occurred and suggest solutions to cope with this development.",
        "There are various compelling reasons why this is happening and the prominent one is that people tend to have limited time to socialize with others due to their hectic schedules as people always struggle to separate their personal life from work. Additionally, the development of numerous social media, such as twitter and Facebook reduces the inner desire of us to communicate with others face-to-face. For instance, a recent study conducted in Japan has revealed that the young generation is becoming less sociable than the older generation because of the excessive usage of social media in recent years. For these reasons, most of us doesn\u2019t know too much of our neighbors.",
        "The solutions to tackle this tendency are not simple, but they do exist. In order to eradicate this issue, enhancing people\u2019s awareness of the significance of maintaining a work-life balance is critical as we can be positively impacted by the benefits of engaging with others in our personal time. In addition, it is essential for the local government to provide more recreational activities in the neighborhood which creates more opportunities for people to know each other. Take myself for example, I have met many friends in the English corner which was held in the city library regularly and it provides me many chances to socialize with people from different backgrounds. As can be seen, these measures has a profound impact on our future.",
        "To sum up, the trend of people being less sociable is ubiquitous nowadays. This essay discussed the reasons of this trend and suggested some methods to deal with it."
