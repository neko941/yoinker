        "Some people argue that team efforts can teach us more skills than individual performance. However, I think that both of them have certain benefits and drawbacks and both are equally important in our life.",
        "First of all, individual effort gives us a chance to explore each and every area of our goal. We can get immense experience and also can test our skills in different areas. Single handed efforts not only provide vast knowledge and experience but also point out our weaknesses which may not be visible in team efforts. Without doing individual activities, we cannot identify our strength and limitation. Furthermore, it also teaches us on how to give our best performance under tremendous pressure as no one is backing us. For example, tigers always live alone and hunt for food individually. As a result they have developed skills accordingly and that made them greatest predators on the earth.",
        "On the other side, team efforts provide us a chance to tackle difficult problems in more effective way. Each person gets a chance to work on specific subtask and that helps to explore our specific strength in more depth. Furthermore, we always get support from other team members and that gives us a lot of confidence. With effective team work, we can solve the toughest problem in less time with even less experience. We can learn different skills from others and same way also gain knowledge of their mistakes. For example, lion lives in a group and shares food with others. With proper planning and effective teamwork, they can even hunt an elephant even though the elephant is ten times heavier and larger than lion.",
        "Overall, team work and individual act both are equally important and we should explore each of these areas to gain enormous knowledge and to get success in our life."
