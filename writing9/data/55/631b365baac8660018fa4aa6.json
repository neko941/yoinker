        "Pollution is one of the biggest problems worldwide, some strategies had been actioned to reduce contamination. Politicians developed international car-free days which have been effective in reducing air pollution, but some other beliefs that are other ways to contest and aid the environment. This essay will discuss both views by giving a detailed analysis.",
        "Vehicles contribute to contaminating the air by once the fuel is burned, pollutants are emitted and released into the air. Governments proposed a solution to reduce these contaminants to the atmosphere, by having a day away for any type of motor transportation applied in different countries.  With this action, individuals are encouraged to use other types of transportation such as bicycles, e-scooters or by foot. Moreover, doing activities like cycling or walking either for work or for pleasure, aids citizens to be more active including children. Besides, the increase in exercise, car-free days reduce the noise pollution that is present, especially in crowded areas and highways.",
        "Despite the arguments presented above, there are other strategies that can be useful to contribute in minimize contaminants. Governments can create community green spaces. For example, in green areas where the existence of trees is massive, it  may help in carbon dioxide from the air.  Another action is conserving energy by turning off electricals such as lights and appliances when users are not using them, this could lead to a decrease in power plant energy. For instance, buyers should choose energy-efficient products, helping the environment but also individuals\u2019 budgets.",
        "In my opinion, I believe that the international method is a great idea for countries to adopt to reduce air pollution, as well as other options mentioned in the above paragraph where societies help from home or by purchasing product eco-friendly.",
        "In conclusion, politicians have contributed internationally to reducing air pollution. However, there are other methods to apply where the population encouraged by governments, can help reduce the atmosphere\u2019s contamination."
