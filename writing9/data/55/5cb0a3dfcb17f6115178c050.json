        "According to few people, teaching students according to their academic abilities is quite considerate. While others insist on teaching students of contrasting capabilities together. In my opinion, sub-groups based on interests should be carried out in mixed classes, as this caters their overall potential and all-round development.",
        "Segregating students by grades should be allowed and grouped together in schools as students learning ability can be enhanced at better levels. For instance, complex topics can be covered to make them intellectually sharper, smarter, and more capable. Moreover, in a mixed classroom, the chances of being distracted and influenced by spoilt children are more, which can ruin the academic prospects of intelligent students. Consequentially, there can be a risk of loss in their studies, which can affect concentration and focus.",
        "On the other hand, having classes consisting of mixed ability provides an improved environment for children\u2019s comprehensive development. This 2will boost competition among peers which will improve the holistic performance of the school. For example, a gifted student in art but weak in science will develop an understanding of the subject with the help of his peers, who are good at science, and vice versa. Furthermore, students show inconsistency in academic performance, thus on separating children the chances of such transformation go down, as teaching both groups together inspire the weaker to study like a brilliant one.",
        "Finally, in my opinion, further sub-grouping students in mixed class based on common area of interest must study together which in turn can lead to absolute growth. In addition to, having interest in the subject keeps them self-motivated.",
        "In conclusion, the system of filtering students based on academic ability brings a feeling of inferiority to those who are not in the group and hence, should not be promoted."
