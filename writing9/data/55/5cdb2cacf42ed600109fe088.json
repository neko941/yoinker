        "It is argued that moral values are not important anymore and people are judged based on their wealth and status. This essay disagrees with the statement because many rich people do charitable work and people prefer business ethics and trust over an individual\u2019s wealth.",
        "To begin with, it is a known fact that many wealthy people contribute large amounts of their wealth to charitable organizations. These organizations collect items, such as money and clothes, and send them to people who are unable to afford these basic amenities. For example, Tim Cook, the CEO of apple, was honored by the Red Crescent Society in 2015 for donating 30% of his wealth in support for the refugees in Syria. Therefore, it is inappropriate to judge people based only on the amount of money they have, and one should also appreciate the things they do for society.",
        "Many people choose to work with individuals who have moral values rather than how rich they are. Organizations refuse to do business with people if they have a history of cheating others, even though they are rich and famous, whereas, if person treats his business associates with respect and honesty, he would most probably be valued more. For instance, Warren Buffet Is a very rich and famous investment banker and many investors trust him to take care of his wealth over others.",
        "In conclusion, moral values are more important than a person\u2019s social and financial status because many wealthy people donate to charitable causes and people choose to conduct business with individuals that are trustworthy and respectful towards them."
