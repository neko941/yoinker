        "Regard to international tourism become so popular these days, many cities and towns have taken huge profit from tourist industry. However, some people are worried about awful effect of foreign traveller on environment and local inhabitants; although, I believe demerit of tourist is far behind of the merit of world travellers.",
        "Firstly, in my view the pro of tourist lies in the fact that it improves economic perspective and tourist industry play a vital role in many countries all over the world by creating a lot of job opportunities for people, so people rely on the income of tourist industry. For example, by increasing tourist industry offer new services such as restaurants and hotels. Consequently, international tourism enhances the standard of a person's life by bringing jobs and a source of revenue that may not exist before for them this mean younger people are encouraged to stay at in the community rather than seeking work in the city. Another advantage of tourist industry, it familiar with culture of",
        "",
        "On the other hand, international tourism has negative impact on environment and natural inhabitants, it means some people afraid that the local environment will be distracted as more people come to place. For instance, excessive tourism industry in different community needs build more buildings that could destroy natural habitats and pose a hazard on animals and plant life. Besides, international tourist contributes to increase garbage and wastage.",
        "In conclusion, the pro of international tourism provides more job opportunities and source of income for people in their communities; although, some disadvantages of global tourist that have a miserable effect on environment and natural habitats are not deniable. However, I believe the downside of tourist industry stay far behind of its upside."
