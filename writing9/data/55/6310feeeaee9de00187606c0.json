        "It is true that old residents of different communities have increased incredibly which may affect the cost of the healthcare system in the country. But, as we all know that in all the countries there are lots of people who live below the poverty line and as the ,result they cannot afford to pay the medical charges. So that's why I fully disagree with this notion that the public has to pay themself for their healthcare expenses.",
        "The first and foremost reason is that according to the statistical data more than sixty per cent of the population in the world live below the poverty line as a result they cannot able to manage their day-to-day household expenses. How they can afford the expenses of medical facilities? In addition to that,  hospitals nowadays charge exorbitant prices for their services, which is totally unfavourable for the general public and the economy.",
        "Moving to the next point, if people will start paying for their own healthcare expenses, definitely it will increase the inflation rate in the economy and the Government will lose  control of the healthcare system. In that case, people who are living under the poverty line will not get the proper treatments for their illness which may have detrimental effects on the world's healthcare system. For ,example spreading of COVID-19 and Malaria. it is necessary to take valuable steps to get  rid of problems like health expenses by expanding the public healthcare system.",
        "In conclusion, if the Government do not want any other scenario like COVID-19, they should take  responsibility for paying all the expenses for the nation's population."
