        "Stress is considered by many as one of the most actual issues for people around the globe. It is agreed that this problem continues to raise, and should be treated as relevant. This essay will firstly, consider some causes of this problematic, and secondly, describing possible solutions.",
        "Modern society is prone to be stressed about different situations, and some argue that it is mainly because of the accelerate lifestyle that is known in today\u00b4s world. In other words, the younger generations have been born in a community, in which they must know every single detail of their life, and also take care of that. An example to this can be found in the globalitation and improvement of their social media, as this tools gave the society the possibility of get to recieve information about not only personal, but also global and gubernamental problems.",
        "Therefore, what can be made to solve this issue? It is stated that stress can be attacked by focusing on the important things and not over-working to get the best results possible. This means that people should not work more than it is recommended in a desesperate attempt to get more money. For instance, the German law regulated in the early 2000\u00b4s the number of permited working hours per week for employees in the whole country, adressing a maximum of 40 weekly hours.",
        "In conclusion, in a world that is constantly changing, and that asks more and more from their inhabitants to be as productive as possible, it is important to affront this problem not only from an individual point of view, but also having a participation from the governments for their whole citizens."
