        "Even in this 21th century, we may have seen many parents that always keep telling their children what to do on their personal matters, especially their career plans. The question is raised if it is necessary for parents to determine on children\u2019s future career, or the freedom should be available for children to design their own fates. I, personally, believe that children should have a chance to decide on their future jobs and parent\u2019s duty is to support them to do so. This essay will give cases and examples to support my point of views.",
        "Allowing children to have freedom on their future careers will widen their opportunities to success earlier. The American-upbringing-style can be the good illustration for previously statement, American parents usually let their children to find money since they were young. This way of parenting motivates teenagers to explore their capabilities effectively. As we can see, American children found their talents, or know what type of work they would prefer in the future since they were high school. Accordingly, limiting their chances to explore themselves means limiting their possibilities for them to find the right job as well.",
        "However, it is understandable why many parents would like to choose the careers for their kids. This judgement may derive from their past experiences or failure in selecting their career paths. For example, many doctors might want their children to follow the same route, since they have experienced that this job will provide their kids wealth and stability in life. Even so, the undeniable fact that everyone has their own preferences and specialties, makes this judgement seems unpractical in real life. For this reason, children then need their own judgements to decide whether the job is compatible with their lives.",
        "To conclude, I still deem that children should have freedom to decide on their own lives including their future career. Parents can be their best supporters by giving some suggestions or mentally support to their children. This parenting style will allow kids to be fully themselves in their best versions, while parents still play an important role to empower their child to success."
