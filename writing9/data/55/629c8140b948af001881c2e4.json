        "Friendships are one of the most important relationships that stay with people all their life. There are some who prefer to be friends only with the people who have similar views as them while others are open to having different viewpoints among friends. This essay will walk you through the opinions of both the groups and then also provide the author\u2019s take on this.",
        "One of the possible reasons why people prefer to have friends who always agree with their thoughts is because of the fewer arguments. Arguments lead to tension and sometimes bitterness between the friends which has a negative impact on mental health. Apart from that, always having the same side helps them to participate in similar activities.",
        "Now let\u2019s talk about the group that believes in having different opinions among friends. No human being could be right in all the given situations, there is always a possibility of making mistakes. When your friend disagrees with you in some situation it forces you to look the other way round and understand the other side of the coin too, which in turn helps you to broaden your mindset. In addition to this, listening to various opinions will eventually introduce you to new ideas and help you grow better.",
        "In the author\u2019s opinion, it is always better to have friends that have opinions that don\u2019t match yours in a certain situation so you can discover and learn about new ideas. It will also help you to make better decisions in life. To summarize, It is okay to have different views among friends and have healthy discussions around various topics as long as it doesn\u2019t turn into a rivalry."
