        "Few of us think that the activities, which we do during our free time, has to be tough enough, so that we feel happy to do it. I strongly disagree with this statement, since a hobby has to easy for an individual to act as a stress buster and to become a regular routine.",
        "Our leisure hours should not be tiresome, so that we can enjoy those moments. The reason why I say so is, if hobbies turn out to be difficult tasks, requiring more efforts, it would start pressurizing us. When pressure holds you back, you can not enjoy the work you do. The best example to prove this point is a play station. A recent survey says that, play stations result upto 70 % of the stress in both adults and children. This gaming activity, which was introduced to combact our tension, does not serves its purpose now, due to its advancement beyond a certain limit.",
        "If an activity has to turn out to be a hobby we have to enjoy doing it again and again. To make this fact clear, just imagine how it would sound, if time spent for our free hours becomes tiring. Eventually, we would not wish to take it often. Hence if a pastime has to become our regular habit, it has to be easy and pleasing enough that we would like to revisit it often. A study shows that 80% of the population today opt for reading books, listening to music during their leisure time. This clearly proves that activities which do not require much effort only can turn out to be our hobbies.",
        "I would like to conclude by disagreeing with the statement, that our pastime should require tremendous efforts to keep us happy, since such kind of tasks will only shoot up our stress levels and we would not like to consider doing it once again."
