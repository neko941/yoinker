        "Although some people enjoy watching movies in a theatre ,others see it in their phones and tablets . In my opinion , I consider that to see a movie  in the cinema provides much better entertainment .",
        "On the one hand , advancement of technology has aided people to own electronic devices like phones and laptops . Consequently , most of the people started utilising  the convenience of watching a movie online. Most of the devices are equipped with features to provide visual effects like a theatre. The copyrights of films have been breached and people easily get latest movie prints within a day of movie release . The commoners find this approach cost effective and they have the provision to watch it at their own pace.",
        "On the other hand , others believe movies should be watched in cinema to enjoy it fully and I agree to this point . Although the devices have technological features , yet people feel it cannot create the jubilant  environment which a cinema room has  . In other words ,it seems the joy to watch your favourite star in a big screen , along with other fan followers, is much more exhilarating. For instance , in countries like India , movie industry is the number one entertainment industry . There are movie enthusiasts who watch every movie of their favourite actor on the first day first show in theatre. Therefore , these people will not be able to relate the thrill they get in theatre to the bliss of watching it in mobile phones.",
        "To sum up , despite people having contradicting views , I strongly believe films should be watched in cinema as it is fun to view it amongst all that shouts , screams and applauds"
