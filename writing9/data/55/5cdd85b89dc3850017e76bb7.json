        "It is debatable whether the life in an urban area or a rural area is more advantageous for a child. As both the areas have their own pros and cons, in this essay, we will further discuss this issue related to the growth of a child.",
        "Rearing a child is a vital issue as they are the future of a nation. In the city, the parents can avail a number of amenities for their child to aid their growth. Furthermore, if any baby needs assistance by hospitals or other health care facilities, they are available in cities. Likewise, the number of renowned educational institutions are more in a metro offering better education.  On the other hand, in urban areas the children are unable to feel the tranquillity of the nature. Moreover, in most of the cases, the city environment is a polluted one which deteriorates the childrens' health status tremendously. Until now, many studies have been conducted to rule out these issues. For instance, a figure published by UNESCO depicted that about seventy per cent city dwellers, who are under sixteen, suffer in bronchial asthma due to inhaling contaminated air continuously.",
        "Regarding life in a country side, a child can grow up by enjoying the serenity of the nature. They are not bothered by the hustle and bustle of city life. Since the surrounding environment in rural areas are less contaminated due to the presence of greenery, a child less likely suffers in environment related diseases. However, the opportunities like specialized hospitals, and other establishments are less in the outskirts of the city. Furthermore, to have less better schooling options, sometimes countrysides are not preffered by the guardians to live on. A study by an UN organization shows that about thirty per cent people in Asia migrate from rural areas to urban area only to have better schools for their children.",
        "In conclusion, as city life and country life both have merits and demerits related to a child's growth, it should be a personal choice of the parents, where to rear their children in a proper manner."
