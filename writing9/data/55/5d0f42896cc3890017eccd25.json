        "Nowadays, many people are moving abroad for job or settlement. Foreign countries tend to provide better job prospects and financial stability. Apart from multiple benefits, there are many downsides of moving abroad. I will discuss some of the pros and cons of settling in a foreign country.",
        "Firstly, moving to abroad gives you an opportunity to explore a different culture. You get to know about their food, clothes and lifestyle.Interaction with foreigners helps you in understanding their beliefs and perspectives towards life.",
        "Secondly, working abroad provides financial stability. You can earn multiple times more than what you are earning in your home country. Economic stability will further result in an improved lifestyle and better educational prospects for the family.",
        "Looking at the other side of the picture, you may feel lonely after moving abroad. Absence of family and friends may result in home sickness and you may have a tough time fighting all such emotions once you decide to move abroad.",
        "Moreover, you may need a hefty amount of money at the initial stage to settle yourself in a foreign country. Lack of financial resources in the beginning will put you in a problematic state. It would be a bigger problem if you move with a huge family that you have to provide to.",
        "Considering both sides of the picture moving and settling abroad is not a piece of cake. You have to deal with multiple issues in order to achieve your goals. However, I believe that the pros of moving and setlling abroad would eventually out weight the cons."
