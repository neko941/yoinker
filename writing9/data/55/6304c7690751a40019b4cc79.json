        "Nowdays, it is becoming increasingly common that more people are likely to agree that the programs on TV  would effect to their behavior. This trend has caused some controversial, about whether others support for the amount of time watching is the reasons effect to children's behavior. In my opinion, I believe it may give both effect for some reasons.",
        "First of all, it is an indisputable fact that the opinion about TV shows able to cause how children act and think in many bad ways. It is a persuade explanation, for example many attention-grabbing content such as display of violence, nudity would led to children's moral code if they parrot or mimic it. Particularly, whether children not approach to sex education in right way or many preteen audience not aware the threaten of this that will cause to their mental health or other illness if they have sexual abuse. Moreover, its convenience is clearly seen that studies prove that a huge of people who rape children used to reckon wrongly in sex education and effect in watching porn movies in early age.",
        "On the other hand, this constantly causes some drawbacks such as the amount of time they watched also cause to their children\u2019s healthy. In particular, spending much time for screen time that will create a sedentary lifestyle for children. Whether a teens act with reluctance to perticipate in physical activities that will cause bad for their healthy. For example, since the birth of smartphone, smart TV following that the increasing of users led to the rate in wearing eyeclasses raise tremendously. And nowadays, the major of people wearing classes than who non-classes. Beside that, the amount of time approach for TV than for book also cause to have less awareness in young children. A nation, weakness in heath and knowledges that is a weakness country.",
        "In conclusion, the content of TV programs are effect to children's mental health while the time how much they watch is effect to their physical health. Both of it brings many negative for us if it over-traversing. In my opinion, I opine that the things what we watch more serious due to if we don\u2019t have a stregnth spirit and a good minset that it would make our health turn down dramatically."
