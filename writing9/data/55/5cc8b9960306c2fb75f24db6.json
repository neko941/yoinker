        "Traditionally, tourists are known to visit beautiful and historic sites. However, in recent times, places with unpleasant conditions, such as, the Sahara desert and the Antarctics, are increasingly drawing the attention of tourists and as such,  are becoming sites for tourism. This essay, will discuss the benefits associated with, visiting such places as tourists, as well as the downsides.",
        "Some tourists love adventure and as a result, may go extra miles to achieve it because, it gives them a sense of fulfilment. Many tourists, may have heard a lot about the extreme conditions of Sahara desert and the Antarctics. However, visiting these places, gives them a first hand experience, of the tales being told about such places. Furthermore, it broadens an individual's knowledge and experience, about life outside their own circle. A visit to sites with extremely unfavorable conditions, can make the tourist a better person. For instance, a person that always complains, about how inefficient and incompetent the government of his country is, in handling national matters, only needs a visit to these sites, to quit the complaints and be more appreciative of his or her privileges. This consequently makes the person a better citizen.",
        "However, the downsides exists, which includes, increased risk of contracting diseases as a result of exposure to these conditions. There is also the risk of death associated with drought and extreme cold nature of these places, especially, if necessary precautions are not taken before embarking on the journey. For example, stories have been told about people who died at the Sahara desert due to drought and lack of water.",
        "In conclusion, advantages as well as downsides, exists for tourists who visit unfavorable places as tourist sites as discussed above. However, whether the experience is worth it or not, is entirely up to the tourist, to decide."
