        "To a certain extent I agree that Governments should allocate budget to railways rather than road transport. However, I also believe that roadways are essential to the nation and also plays a significant role in transportation.",
        "On one hand, there are reasons why government should spend on railways instead on roads as we as follows. Firstly, railways transports large numbers of passengers and goods every year across the nation for long distances and also carries the major burden than any other transport system. So, that construction of new rail tracks to the new location would increase the ease of transportation and revenue generation. Moreover, these are long-term establishments which are worthwhile also reduces overwhelming traffic issues. Secondly, Introduction of modernised compartments and new trains to major cities could encourage people to go by rails, in addition to this train fares are economical with comparison to roadways for a same distance wise. Lastly, trains are comfortable and convenient than others for long hours, for instance, mostly senior citizens suffer with arthritis, this is why they unable to sit for long durations. In such cases, railways offer relief by allowing the reservation of berths.",
        "On the other hand, railways unable to cover all transportation requirements in the entire nation, so that roadways are also essential to whole system and this created need to spend capital on roads by government. At first, nowadays owning a vehicle has become a lifestyle for many of us, thus traffic has increased immensely. In order to avoid or reduce traffic jam, the government should also construct flyovers and outer ring roads in cities, besides four or six lane highways could reduce accident ratio and so on. Finally, road journeys are entertaining to small families, and they can stop vehicle especially cars wherever they want, and can enjoy the personal and family space and have sightseeing opportunity, probably creates long-lasting memories for them all.",
        "To sum up, spending money on railways could yield a high return on investment to government with all advantages of revenue and employment creation. However, neglecting roadways seems to have had potential threat to the whole system of transportation in a country."
