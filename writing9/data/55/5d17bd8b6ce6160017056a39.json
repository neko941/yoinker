        "We cannot deny that books contain an enormous amount of knowledge, so it plays a pivotal role in our life. However, we also need do practice and experience in the real life. Hence, it can be said that both of them have the equal importance.",
        "At the beginning, each person has to undergo from the lowest level to the highest level. It means that we used to study from primary school to higher education. And all things we learned at these periods are from books. Thanks to that, we have the solid knowledge to experience in our lives, careers, so on. For example, otherwise we have certificates demonstrating how we studied before, employers will not recruit us because they don\u2019t know what we can do and which outstanding abilities we have.",
        "Furthermore, book is the thing that our forefathers suffered, then they concluded everything in it. Thus, when we watch, learn in these books, we will know which things we should avoid and which things we should do. A good example of this is in the past, farm workers do not know which time it is suitable to harvest. Nevertheless, they gained their experiences day by day, then they understood and knew the best time to harvest.",
        "Although sometimes we feel the knowledge between books and real experiences has a few differences, we cannot disclamate book is the most basic source that everyone has to learn and suffer.",
        "In conclusion, both of them have the same importance and will be complementary."
