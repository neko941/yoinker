        "It is obvious that borrowing money from a friend can be a debate topic among people. While many people accept that borrowing money from a friend is quite normal between friends, others believe that it gives damage to relationship. From my point of view, it doesn\u2019t harm the relations, actually, it makes strong the relationship. In these essay, my reasoned opinion about this debate will be declared.",
        "First and foremost, as a being social human, we make friends during our life, however we categorize them into 2 groups, close friends and the others. In my view, we need  friends who we can trust like we do for our family members. While we do not hesitate lending money to our family members, we need to do the same attitude toward our close friends. Because we do not know what we will face in future. We can also be a person who need to borrow money. Thus, we shouldn\u2019t doubt while lending money in order to ask for it later.",
        "On the other hand, there are some people who can not remember whether they borrow or they lend. Forgetting the money will be desired by borrower. In these situation, there will be some obstacles between friends. When the same people ask for borrowing money, you likely do not lend again. I believe that giving money back is vital for both sides, since you can not hold money that are not belongs to you. Therefore, while borrower pays the money in the time, there will be  no problem.",
        "To sum up, people fall out over borrowing money. While many of them accept it is a normal thing, the others don\u2019t. I agree with the majority group. Just consider who you lend or borrow money, is he or she close friends or just friends. We can  be lender today but we are not convinced that we will not need it from close friends. So do not afraid lending money from a friend. It deosnt ruin your relationship, also it can make it stronger"
