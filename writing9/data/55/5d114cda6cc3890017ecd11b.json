        "Learning a language in its native country is easy. studying English in a country where, people speak it\u2019s as first language is the most effective but, there are other ways to. I agree with this and this essay will discuss, that despite being best way there are problems linked with it.",
        "Firstly, learning English in English speaking country is ideal; but, it\u2019s very expensive. If you decide to learn where it is used as first language you have to pay for the cost of living, travelling and food etc. which will be costly as compared to choosing to study in home country and might outweigh the advantages of it over the disadvantages. Although, its best to study from native speaking country but, it will certainly increase the cost of living.",
        "Secondly, if one chooses to learn from English speaking country, one has to move away from home and he/she will feel home sick. Moving away from home is always hard and soon one will start to miss home and family. This can lead to a lot of problems such as, stress, anxiety, lack of concentration, which can result in losing interest and focus on studies. therefore, studying abroad is beneficial but can lead to problems like missing home and family.",
        "To conclude, despite being the ideal way, moving away from home to a native country to learn English, it\u2019s not the only option and it also has problems attached to it like, high cost and living away from the comfort of home and family."
