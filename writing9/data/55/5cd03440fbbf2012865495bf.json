        "In the past, youngsters used to follow their parent wherever they go and does everything their parents order them to. However, there are few research studies shows evidences that proof that children should be given the opportunity to do things freely and not to be cornered by their parents as this will further stimulates their mind. Although, there might be some drawbacks to this notion, however, I believe that the pros will outweigh the cons and will be discussed in this essay.",
        "Allowing the children to feel some sense of freedom will definitely help them to express themselves better. First of all, they are able to do activities of their interest independently, thus becoming more independent and increase their level of confidence. In this way, they will learn to be more responsible with their actions and in turn, helps them to become a mature person. For example, even if a child makes a mistake during solving a problem, allowing them to find the solution by themselves will stimulates their mind even if it takes time. Nevertheless, helicopter parents who does everything for the child causing the child to lose trust of themselves that they are capable of doing something. Therefore, they tend to shy away when there are hurdles or challenges that they have to face as they grew older. Moreover, creative thinking and imagination will be at loss as these parents never give them the chance for them to do it alone.",
        "On the other hand, there are few setbacks to this freedom type method of parenting. Without proper parents supervision, some children especially teenagers tend to do activities that can be risky and even detrimental for the society. For instances, those involved in vandalism and drug abuse are usually teenagers that have too much space from their parents. What is even worse, some parents are not aware of the adolescent\u2019s doing. Therefore, strict discipline and feasible boundaries need to be set in order the young from roam around relentlessly.",
        "In conclusion, in my view, I advocate that having the youngsters to be free to do things will help cultivating their creative thinking, though boundaries need to be applied by their parent to avoid them to mingle with the wrong side of the society."
