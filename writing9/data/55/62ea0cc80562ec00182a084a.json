        "Over the last years, our planet has experience a long list of environmental pollution problems that million years will be taken to compensate the resulted consequences. I am certainly on the opinion that human activities for extending their own life and scientific capabilities are the major contributions to these disastres. In this essay, several individual and global solutions will be elucidated.",
        "On the one hand, using plastic made materials, which have been produced by manufactures owing to its cost-efective nature, likely to be most important contribution to pollution problems. Since plastic materials cannot decompose and become a part of the environment, they have a detrimental effect on the area where they are discarded.",
        "On the other hand, an enormous vehicle have been producing by car factories led to release a huge amount of fuel combustion to the air. These harmful carbon based gases bring sevelar consequences for our planet for instance ozun layer depletion and so forth.",
        "However, I believe that government and individuals both have a responsibilities to address these issues. Firstly harshly fines should be legislated to the manufactures and any other campanies are contributing to air pollution. Similarly, several laws should be passed so that penalize the use of plastic in all over the world. Such laws need to be implemented an a national level and immediate steps should be taken by the central government to address this situation.",
        "To conclude, based on what has mentioned thus for, plastic usage and fuel combustions were introduced as major source of our planet pollutions, and two strict solution that should be passed by central governments were proposed."
