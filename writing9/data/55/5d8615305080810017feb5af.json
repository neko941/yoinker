        "Over the past decade travelling has become very popular due to various transportation methods that are easily available. At the same time, learning about various places has also become easy due to the frequent use of Television and Internet.",
        "In my essay, I am going to discuss my views on travelling and learning about other countries through TV and Internet. I do not oppose any opinion as it would also depend on an individual's financial ability to travel, where they would only be able to learn about a place virtually.",
        "Watching a travel channel or reading about countries on the internet would allow an individual to learn about it in its holistic sense. A TV show would have been sponsored  allowing them to visit various parts of a country or city which an individual may not be able to visit. Watching these would assist in understanding various characteristics of a place, although, this would be another persons perspective. They help viewers in developing an interest in cultures accross the world which they do not experience often.",
        "While travelling an individual would choose places that would interest them with the help of the internet or books. They are able to experience a place and feel it by interacting with the local culture and environment. This helps in learning a culture and also experiencing it.",
        "For example, I had watched a documentary on the Egyptian pyramids, where they described the history of the pyramids and how it was built. Furthermore, I went on to read about the pyramids on the internet, which gave me a detailed description of the Architecture. After a few years, I visited Egypt, while I was there I was able to see this Architectural marvel, understand its scale and also feel the structure by entering it.",
        "To conclude, I would always recommend travelling to a place. It is also important to keep in touch with the outer world by using TV and Internet, as it would help an individual learn a lot from the experiences of different people."
