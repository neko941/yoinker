        "The base of any relationship is  trust and  patience, which makes the relationship more strong although telling a truth in any relationship is important but more important is to tell it at the right time. Therefore, in my opinion, I disagree with the statement that telling the truth is the most significant consideration in any relationship between people. I think this way for two reasons, which I will explore in this essay.",
        "Firstly, as an initial point, I would like to say that to maintain a relationship one should have  patience. Of course, we should tell a truth but not bluntly and at any time, anywhere. For example, my younger sister was taking part in a drawing competition in her school and for practice she was sketching few drawings at home. Every time she ask me about my opinion and I always motivate her, although I know that, she is not making paintings as perfect as they should be, but to keep her morale high I used to praise her always. Surprisingly, she comes second in the competition. Hence, if I said truth to her, that she not doing so much great, I think she won't come second in class.",
        "Secondly, I feel that in any relation we should believe more on each other rather that saying anything for the sake of truth. My own personal experience is a compelling example of this. When I was in my tenth class, I faced a lot of troubles in math subject. I remember my math teacher was very helpful in nature, with patience she always aid me a lot in practising the math question, formula and equations. If I do any mistake or bring less marks in the class, she never punishes me, but very politely she makes me  understand my mistakes in the subject. In my final exam, I did very well and pass the subject with good grades in the class.",
        "In conclusion, I feel that  in a relation between  two people one should have  patience and should believe in each other. Hence, Speaking the truth in a relation is not always an important consideration."
