        "It is true that in certain nations, young voters apathy is increasingly popular. The primary problem associated with this phenomenon is that this  would affect democracy negatively, whereas, the most effective solution is to educate younger populations about the significance of their turnout in the election day.",
        "",
        "The principal issue associated with youth who shun ballot box is that such democracy would cease to exist. That is to say that if young people continue to turn a blind eye to their rights to show up in polling station, this will lead to sever underrepresentation of young ages in the political life. As  a result, politicians would overlook youth's needs, desires, opinions and aspirations, which have nothing to do with democracy whatsoever. A recent American report found that in Egypt where around 55% of  the under-22s citizens desert voting, there is a humongous gap between parties and young people who feel that their needs are not  being addressed appropriately.",
        "",
        "The most viable solutions of this predicament is that governments should lunch publicity campaigns in order to educate youth about the importance of voting. In other words, given that more to be done to teach them about their contribution of their voices when it comes to establishing liberal and democratic societies, this would encourage them select the best candidates and options. They would also teach their peers, siblings and parents about to voting's importance. For example, same initiative in Japan has increased the participation of younger voters aged 25 and under in the 2004 presidential elections, which is indeed a positive development.",
        "",
        "In conclusion, although young people tend to turn their backs to voting, which ends up with being underrepresented in political life, and thus, leads to undemocratic communities, this could be addressed through educating them about the consequences of this behavior."
