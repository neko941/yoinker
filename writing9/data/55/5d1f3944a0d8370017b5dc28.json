        "People living in foreign countries will have both drawbacks and benefits. I agree with the statement. However, people staying in foreign countries have to respect their cultures. In this essay, I will outline the social and practical issues that an individual may face when he moves to another nation.",
        "Social problems include language barrier. When a person goes to another country without learning their local language will face issues with the native people. For instance, it will be easy to talk with the people who can understand the global language like English, whereas it can be difficult with people who only understand the native language. In contrast, if the person knows the local language will not face these type of problems. As a result, it will become very complicated for the foreigner to communicate.",
        "Working would be one of the practical concern. When an individual migrates to another country, he may feel wrong with the behaviour of other nation people. For Example, When a foreigner works in a Hotel, He may feel disrespectful with the customers. If the person learns the culture of the native people, he will not face these issues.  In some cases, a non-native individual may hurt the feelings of the natives. For example, A foreigner working as a CEO of the company may hurt the sentiments of the local people with is behaviour.",
        "To conclude, When an individual move to another nation, he may face social problems like the language barrier, and the practical problem like working. This issues may or may not happen, but it varies based on the individual experience."
