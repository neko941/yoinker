        "In today's age technology is at peak for that many people think that science and technology are the most important subjects to teach in the schools While a few considers history as the supreme one. Considering both views each course has their own perks and every subject is important for overall growth of a student. Discussing both facts will present my reasoning in the essay below.",
        "Nowadays, applied science is playing a very appropriate and meaningful role towards the growth of the society due to which each and every guardian want their child go into this field, supposing that subject as the most important one, however by learning science students will be more intellectual and new innovations will come into existence which will enhance the overall growth of the country in this competitive era. The Young generation now uses more skills which should be used in a right direction and this is possible only if they will be taught the skills of technique and automation.",
        "On the other hand, we cannot forget the fact that whatever we got it came from our ancestors or from past, furthermore, Our civilization is entirely depends upon our history. Owing to if today history is not taught in schools the fashion will go in vain. Once the civilization or art we lost it can never be redeemed.",
        "To sum up, I would say it is very important to enhance the skills in students to deal with the modern technology, it is only possible if they are being taught science with full efficiency, however at the same time the fact cannot be ignored that it is equally significant to save our art to be drained."
