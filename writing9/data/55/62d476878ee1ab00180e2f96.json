        "A growing number of nations are becoming analogous since the public is capable to purchase the same items worldwide.Although being similar has many positive advances,the drawbacks involved are of importance to be scrutinized.",
        "On the plus side, it may appear that the alike countries prove beneficial.The first axiomatic reason is concerned with culture.Simply put, exchanging materials, exporting and importing between nations can influence the population to be familiar with the custom of the other countries.An example of this situation is China,number one ranked in trade, which is the country most people know about their culture by providing their needs with Chinese products.Furthermore, by buying these goods, both nations are enabled to have economic progress.Thereby, in terms of financial growth, they look like each other too.",
        "Having said that, however, the negative aspect of this development should not be underestimated.To begin with, while, the context is prepared that the individuals to be dependent on other regions.Take a person who just consumes Indian rice as an example; So, in terms of the special flavour of this product, one cannot cater for the requirement of other regions' types of rice from different countries.Another evident negative side is a lack of creativity. In other words, the governments would no longer rely on their knowledge,So would no longer be capable to produce the material by their own forces.",
        "On balance,the tendency of purchasing the same goods would be both rewarding and problematic. Although recognition of culture and financial progress are of importance, people are highly likely to not generate their items by their knowledge and forces."
