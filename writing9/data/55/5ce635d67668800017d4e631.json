        "Domestic waste constitutes a major portion of garbage generated and is still not believe to be treated in an effective manner. Hence, many advocates that only method to enhance reliability of litter is to legalise its recycling . However I believe that along with law there are other ways to promote reusability of garbage as discussed in ensuing paragraphs.",
        "To begin with legalizing recycling is necessary as it will provide more people to follow the rules under threat of law. Any government guidelines stating mandatory penalising for non adherence to recycling guidelines welcome compel people to put more emphasis on getting the waste generated by them to recycling bin. For example ,if our household is fined note taking garbage to waste processing plants they will certainly become more aware towards the generated litter. Thus, people will produce less waste Auroville personal responsibility for getting it recycled and thereby jaldi come garbage free.",
        "However programs promoting recycling can also help to curb waste. Idhar government alone or with help of other organisations should design programs to encourage people towards a clean society. Sweden ,for instance, is a country where government has taken an initiative under which every resident get some credit point for every trash of can or bottle they put for recycling .This makes people to enjoy recycling as it brings them personal benefits.so, such Initiatives  can also be formulated to promote reusability.",
        "In Conclusion, legalization will compel more people to participate in recycling process. However encouraging people to take personal interest in it can bring success in getting rid of garbage problems and will help creation of better world."
