        "In our human society, we have a lot of countries, each of which has different cultural customs. However, music to which everyone can easily listen is one thing bringing people from different countries cultures, and ages together. I personally agree with this viewpoint for many reasons described in this essay.",
        "It is true that music and songs appear to have no age restrictions since people tend to care for the melody instead of the language. Although every country in the world has its own kind of music as well,  people who have different backgrounds can listen to the same song from a certain county. That is an opportunity for the government of that country to introduce and advertise their country. We can easily see that in songs. Plus, they will use lots of musical instruments in their music video (MV). Above all, they can film the scenic spots in their country. It will be an occasion for them to spread the things that stand out in their cultures. For instance, in Korea, K-pop is extremely prevalent. In fact, Korean people can bring their melody and their nation out of the country through their music. Previously, people will not know about Korean culture unless you arrive there. But until now, because of K-pop\u2019s popularity, people in the world can easily approach Korean society. When it comes to concerts worldwide, there is a crowd of people part-taking in together happily no matter where they come from.",
        "To sum up, each country has its kind of music and it will change more and more in the future generations. That is the reason why music is the best way of bringing people of different cultures and ages together."
