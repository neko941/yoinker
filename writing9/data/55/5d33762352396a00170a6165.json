        "Despite the fact that people in olden times used to enjoy visiting museums, people in our modern society seem to be reluctant to come to museums. This trend is mainly due to the expensive entrance fee of museums and loss of interests of modern people's enthusiasm towards artworks and history. However, there are a number of measures that can be implemented to solve the isse.",
        "First reason why people today no longer visit museums is that the fee to enter the museums is most likely to be expensive. Although those fees from visitors tend to be used as a budget to maintain the quality of the museum, it is still unaffordable for people, especialy for the ones from vulnerable society or students. Another factor that prevent people from coming to museums is that young generations are less likely to be interested in artworks and history comparing to people from past. Schools nowadays seem not to value the History classes or Art classes but they are very keen only for science subjects, such as Mathematics and Chemistry.",
        "However, there are a number of ways to tackle the issue of people visiting museums less often. Firstly, advertisement can be a key to motivate people to access to the museums. Museums must invest money to attracts people with better modern design. If people found the museum very modernised, they will come to visit the museum. In addition, the governments also could cover the maintenance fee to keep the meseums' qualities, so that visitors will feel more comfortable coming to observe the artworks and history. In fact, there are some noble museums in the world are under the government's control, such as the Great Britain Museum in London that receive a vast amount of visitors every year.",
        "In short, a lack of people's enthusiasm towards history and costly tickets to enter the museums often demotivate people to learn in the museum. Only when the goverments assure that museums can keep the good quality without getting money from visitors, will the museums be able to receive more people."
