        "It is irrefutable that technology has helped us in many ways but as its said what ever has an advantage equally has a disadvantage. Television serves as a medium of entertainment and source of news to people, although some people say that watching television makes people lazy and social misfit but in contrary I believe that there should moderation in the use of these technologies such as television, mobile phones, internet and so on.",
        "Programs viewed in the television has reached a mammoth dimension due to the invention of cable networks that have hundreds of channels that keep people engaged thus reducing interaction with other people. For instance, Dstv offers a variety of channels that keeps the viewer entertained all day and all night. Likewise, Netflix which shows different movies and can keep one at a place for hours while watching these movies. These inventions linked to television has made most people imbalance socially and lazy. They spend most of their time glued to the television rather than having a healthy conversation with other people. And they also tend to achieve little or nothing daily due to the fact that they spend more hours on television screens.",
        "Furthermore television  has been one of the most common means of conveying news to people but then, I agree that times spent watching the tv should be moderated so as to give other necessary activities time too. In addition, television should be used for relaxation and leisure and not to interfere with work especially and communication with other people.",
        "In conclusion people should inculcate the habit of watching television during  relaxation as too much of everything they say is bad."
