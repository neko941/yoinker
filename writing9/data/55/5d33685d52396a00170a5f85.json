        "Many people tend to play sports less than they used to do when they were younger. This trend is mainly due to a lack of time and opportunity to be engaged with physical activities where they live. However, there are a number of measures that can be implemented to resolve the isse.",
        "One of the reasons why people tend to cease to play sports when they grow up is that they are most likely to be very busy for their work and parenting. Children usually have more free time compared to adult people, which allowe them to enjoy physical activities as much as they want with their peers. Workers, on the other hand, are most likely to be more committed to their family and tasks at work that keeps them occupied and, as a result, they seem to have less free time to play sports than young people. Another reason to cause adults people's lack of phycial activities is that there is no appropriate facilities where they can exercise. In fact, being a membership of gyms is usually costly and it is not often affordable for people who are outside of well-off society.",
        "However, despite the lack of time and inexpensive service that people can enjoy playing sports, there are a number of ways to tackle the problem of shortage of adults exercises. Firstly, companies should strictly limit the time their employees work a day and give them opportunities to play sports offering gyms or courses related to sports such as yoga after work. If heads of the companies set an annual competition of sports event like marathon, their subordinates will be able to more encouraged to work less than before and practice for the competition Moreover, the local government also can play an important role to motivate adults to exercise more. For example, they may be able to build free or budget-friendly amenities related to sports activities, such as public swimming pool, tennis cort and gyms, so that local people could exercise more easily that will lead to improvement of citizens' health.",
        "In short, the shortage of free time and place to exercise freely discourages adults people to play sports. Only when the local governments like prefectural office are able to ensure that all citizens can enjoy playing sports with cost-effectively, will the issue of shortage of exercise be resolved."
