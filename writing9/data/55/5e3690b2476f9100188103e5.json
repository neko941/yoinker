        "In today\u2019s world, the number of private car users increase, continuously. Many people have shifted to using their privates\u2019 cars and ignore the public transportation. However, some people assert that in order to attract the number of people to use the public transportation, the government should offer free service charges to all citizens. On the other hand, some people discharge with this policy. Both sides will be discussed, carefully.",
        "To begin with, it is certainly true that the free public transport service holds many advantages. Firstly, this policy definitely appeals all citizens to use the public transportation. The number of people will change to use more buses and subways rather than driving their private vehicles. Poor people will become more willing to take buses and subways without worrying about the price. With the accessibility to this service, the number of private car drivers will significantly decrease. Consequently, it also has a great impact on the traffic and the environment. Without the large number of car drivers, traffic will become empty and do not crowed anymore. The total gas emission that release from all kinds of vehicles will be minimized, as a result the air pollution problems could alleviate, eventually.",
        "On the other hand, exempting public transport fares also have many drawbacks. First and foremost, it is an unpractical policy. The government has to cover an enormous expenditure, if the government provides free public transportation to all citizens. Many expensive costs for maintaining the public transportation service such as employee payment, electricity and a variety of vehicles require a large budget. If the government totally supports the public transport system, other areas such as infrastructures or medical services cannot be developed. Moreover, with the tones of passengers on buses and subways, the carriages would become dirty, crowed and uncomfortable. The quality of public transportation will be downgrade, eventually.",
        "In conclusion, the advantages of free bus/ subway fares contribute to persuade many passengers and protect the environment, whereas the downsides of this measure are an expensive expenditure and destructive the quality of the service. Personally, I do not agree with the free public transportation because buses and subways will become inconvenient for all passengers."
