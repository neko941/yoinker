        "Unemployment is one of the most pressing concerns that many countries are facing. While some people state that there is no need to provide secondary education for primary students who do not want to get a job, I argue that it is essential for the government to ensure its citizens to obtain a higher education.",
        "Firstly, there are a number of reasons why students should not study only at primary education. With limited education, one can perhaps find odd jobs at an earlier age, but his long-term income will be limited.  What is more, students those finish primary education only have a manual job which affect negatively on their health in the future. Furthermore, if young generation do not educated fully, it will lead to other consequences. The whole society would not develop sustainably and the rate of crime would be higher due to lack of educated people.",
        "On the other hand, I strongly believe that it is important to receive secondary education. To begin with, although students may spend more time and struggle difficult tasks to finish secondary education, these people have a better chance to keep their jobs and earn a higher salary compared with those receiving lower education. In addition, educated people do a lot to create jobs. They set up various companies or factories to employ the staffs. Therefore, it is these people that contribute to social progress.",
        "In conclusion, it seems to me that all students should continue their studies in order to ensure a sound life."
