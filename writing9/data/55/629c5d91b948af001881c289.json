        "Healthcare is an important issue nowadays. Health is, directly or indirectly, related to productivity. Without good health, a man can\u2019t burgeon in his or her life. That\u2019s why it is reckoned the most precious wealth on the planet earth. So, a person\u2019s productivity is tantamount to a country\u2019s overall economic growth. That\u2019s why governments of various countries take lots of initiative to ameliorate the country\u2019s health care system and put public health paramount.",
        "The health care of all countries is not the same. Many countries subsidies the health care system, others don\u2019t. This trend, subsidization of the health care system, is visible in most developed countries. But the 3rd world countries are still left behind in this race, as they don\u2019t have that many resources to spend money on developing health care. Their per capita income is also not sufficient which in the long run stems from the govt. spending.",
        "There are lots of schemes in health care systems and maybe it is good for the economy in the long term as it increases productivity. But there are some discrepancies between the two groups regarding free health care for all the people. According to one group, it\u2019s the best option for the country to make their health care free and at the same time, it makes the system easily accessible and open to all the people. No people have to face any kind of discrimination regarding health care. And overall, it begets a bonanza for the economy.",
        "But according to other groups, free healthcare has many disadvantages too. Free health care to all would mean people belonging to any class get the same facility and the upper class who can buy medical facilities don\u2019t facilities pay any penny for this purpose. So, the government should make a vivid policy based on class. The policy gives the lower class the highest opportunity and the upper class gets the lowest. In this way, we can ensure equal opportunity for our people and brings phenomenal growth to the economy."
