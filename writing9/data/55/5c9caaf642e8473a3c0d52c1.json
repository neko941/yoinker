        "Nowadays, an increasing number of people has their children in a later age tan people from past generations. It is agreed that having children at a later age can provide a couple with more maturity and stability. Therefore, the essay will, fistrly, talk about some of the reason why this trend increases with the time, and secondly, discuss the most important advantage of taking such a decision.",
        "Preferences and goals in life changed always between generations, and the younger ones are putting the need to be parents at a lower relevance than ever before. This is mainly because they want to do other things first, and develop their life as individual, before taking the adventure to have a family. Moreover, young people preffer having a little finacncial stability after a couple of working years, to later on take the decision to have kids. For instance, a survey made by the University of Cologne in 2015, stated that more of the half of bachelor students were planning ahead their next 5 to 10 years without the need of having a baby or erasing a family.",
        "Even though many consider that being old as a parent presents many disadvantages, there are also plenty of upsides of it. Maybe the most important one is flexibility, as young people are not needed to rush into being parents if they do not have the time, economic stability, or knowledge. This could lead to benefits at the time to being parents, as they have a more structured path to take. or example, a poll by the German government explained that couples that had a baby at the age of 30 or older were better prepared and had less doubts about their decision.",
        "In conclusion, this essay is not requesting people to have kids on their thirties, because such a decision is very personal, but it is always good to be stable, to have the possibility of planning the future better."
