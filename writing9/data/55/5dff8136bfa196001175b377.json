        "The phenomenon of globalization has brought wonders to the world by bringing up people from various cultures closer, and thus forming a workforce diversity. Owing to its intrinsic nature, it is often easy to know the cultures of one's colleague in an organization given that the organization has branches in different parts of the world. I completely agree with this statement, and this essay supports the notion with relevant examples.",
        "Ideally, the workplace of an multinational organization provides an opportunity to work with individuals who are from different ethnic groups, and even from different countries.  In other words, employees are working in the same team regardless of their culture or race. Hence, it is more likely that they understand each other's culture well due to the bond they share. To illustrate this, one case in point would be the thanksgiving day that is celebrated every year in the USA; where workers thank each other for helping them in their professional learning.",
        "Conversely, there exists a wide range of media through which one can learn about others culture. More specifically, the advancement of technology has significantly improved the people to get access to various resources available online. For example, the YouTube platform is one of the powerful channels for learning about outside cultures.  Thus, cultures can also be understood with the help of available social media.",
        "To summarize, although there are different ways to know about others culture such as chunks of information available online, it is relatively easier to get to know about the cultures by working in an multinational organization.  Moreover, if the organizations conduct some sessions on a regular basis , it will be even simpler for the employees to know the cultures of different groups."
