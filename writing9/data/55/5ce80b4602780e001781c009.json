        "In recent years, travelers tend to pick the harder adventures first. Even though the situations of some places do not remain favorable, the visitors opt to leave the easier options behind to accept the challenge. In this essay, the pros and cons of tours with unconditional obstacles will be discussed further.",
        "Proponents of taking the difficult tours believe that the problems can be identified and explored more not only from the culture but also from the tradition. Additionally, any tourist group would learn about the sufferings of inhabitants of such hard-to-reach areas. As an illustration, there\u2019s a growing number of England citizens, who saved more than 20 litres of water every day, after visiting and learning about the crisis of safe drinking water in Sahara Desert. Therefore, resources would be utilized and distributed equally in future by these visitors.",
        "More physical and mental difficulties start rising while the travelers are making a trip in an adverse situation. Furthermore, due to the environmental change and natural barriers, most of the weak people recover barely even after the journey. For example, one/third of the people gets injured in the long expedition to the Mount Everest till today. Consequently, the survival of one traveler remains unrealistic without getting accustomed to the particular environment.",
        "To conclude with, the number of tourists would jump higher to experience new customs more deeply even though some natural risks will forever be associated with the journey. Thus, traveling places, whether it is easy or difficult, should be universal among every individuals."
