        "Since the turn of the century, Eviromentalists and scientists have advocated for protection of the environment with proper waste disposal being a key point in conservation of the environment. However, despite all the recent awareness on proper waste disposal and environmental conservation, most people haven\u2019t taken it serious and I agree that laws should be put in place that require each individual, household, company, to properly dispose and recycle there waste.",
        "To begin with, some wastes such as plastic are not biodegradable so they don\u2019t easily decompose. Strict laws should be put in place to punish anyone who is unable to adequately recycle such products. Because such waste when improperly disposed off can lead to infertile soils which will heavily affect farmers and there yields. This in turn will increase the cost of most organic products. Which will heavily affect populations that depend on organic products as a source of food. Which would eventually lead to world hunger.",
        "Secondly, some wastes are biohazards and can be harmful to both plant and animal life. These wastes such as radioactive material, blood products, if not appropriately recycled and disposed off can lead to detrimental effects on plant and animal life. Effects such as cancers, tetratogenicity, can be seen when animals are exposed to such wastes. Thus it is paramount that guidelines are issued that govern the recycling of waste.",
        "Although most wastes are not considered useful, some waste products such as manure can be used as fertilisers for the Agro industry. Therefore, appropriate recycling of such waste products will help farmers use them for fertilising there gardens thus increasing there farm produce.",
        "In conclusion, I believe guidelines should be put in place to help people recycle more of there waste. These laws which could be gradually introduced will be very helpful in proper waste disposal."
