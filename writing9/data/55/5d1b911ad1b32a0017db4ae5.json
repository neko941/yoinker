        "The behaviour of the consumers is drastically changing in last few decades, shopping from small local shops to large shopping centres and now it is limited to online shopping only. This essay will illustrates positive and negative aspect of this development.",
        "Firstly, technology has over power every area in today\u2019s world. The days of going to local shop and buy local products are gone. Nowadays customers prefer buying branded products from large shopping centres because they provide huge discounts and better quality. Secondly, online shopping has also played an important role especially among youngsters as they prefer shopping online and doorstep services at minimal charges. Thirdly, entertainment  of customers is also considered important in large shopping centres. People can spend whole day shopping and enjoying other things like cinema, different food zones, games and so on. Some customers spend time just checking new trends in the market which is termed as window shopping also. That\u2019s why they prefer large shopping malls on local retail outlets.",
        "On the other hand, local retail outlets faced huge  losses because of the change in consumer behaviour. Some of them even packed up their shops and are looking for new business.  Customers are uncontrollable these days as they run after new and latest trends without giving it a single  thought. They prefer good quality clothes with wider options and at reasonable prices.",
        "To conclude, behaviour keeps changing from time to time as technology change. Now is the time of online shopping, maybe in future its virtual shopping that took over the retail market. So it is very important to keep updating your businesses according to latest trends and demands."
