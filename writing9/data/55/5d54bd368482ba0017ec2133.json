        "Recent years, a number of people choose to be self-employed instead of working for a company. There are a number of reasons for this, including lifestyle choice. However, the self-employed could have certain drawbacks, such as lack of expertise.",
        "There are few reasons to why certain people want to run their own business. Firstly, flexible schedule allows them to have a certain degree of freedom. People will not under pressure from deadlines, and can make a balance between work and life. Secondly, creativity and talent will not be limit if self-employed. This is especially important for art-related careers, many artist dislike to be interrupt by others during creation. Furthermore, working in the art studio all day long may not be the best place for artist to find inspiration. As a result, self-run business could be the best choice for artist.",
        "On the other hand, there are some disadvantages to being self-employed. To begin with, people can struggle to attract clients which result unpredictability of income. Employed people will have a fixed income according to their contract, no matter the amount of work their employers give them. However, self-employed people highly depends on the amount of work they accomplished and how much does the client pay. Another point is that, self-employed people do not benefit from statutory rights for employees, such as minimum wage, holiday pay and healthcare cost. People will have to consider whether they are able to cover these cost.",
        "In conclusion, although there are many benefits of being self-employed, the drawbacks must also be consider."
