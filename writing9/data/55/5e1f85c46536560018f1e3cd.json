        "It is truly undeniable that the advertising industry is ruling over society in this fast paced age. Either posters or on television, they are present everywhere. It is acceptable that advertising agencies use the illogical tricks to promote products among people. This essay will shed some light on this aspect.",
        "Advertising has now been a lucrative term not only as business but also in common man\u2019s observance. It is almost impossible to avoid advertisements because of their omnipresence. People buy useless thing sometimes as the attracting commercial brainwash them. Especially women are more prone getting trapped in cheap marketing tricks. For instance, to get 50% off with the second purchase of any accessories or apparels, they may buy an extra pair of jeans or heels that they may don\u2019t actually need. Such scenarios sometimes can lead to put influence their budget for a whole week or a month. Similarly, commodities which are commercialised cheaper than other, are being purchased without taking care of their quality standard by people. This practice has serious consequences which ends up as occurring major health issues sometimes.",
        "Addition to this, celebrities who promote different products or services in advertisements, sometimes do not fulfil ones expectation in real life. They promote those things with high prices which are even not worthy. Moreover, children or youngsters are likely to follow their favourite celebrities blindly. Tobacco and alcohol commercials are most suitable illustrations here. Even though, some countries have banned such commercials but once addiction is developed, it is very problematic to get rid of it.",
        "In conclusion, advertisements provide us range to choose in different aspects of our daily routine. They can provide information that we need in actual but as it is well said that half knowledge is harmful so we should take assistance of commercials with consciousness."
