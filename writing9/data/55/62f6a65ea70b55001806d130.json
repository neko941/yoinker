        "Sports can be divided into two types according to how they are played: team and individual sports. This essay will discuss advantages and disadvantages of team and individual sports as well as provide detailed comparison. In my opinion, team sports are better, because they are more interesting to observe due to unpredictability.",
        "Individual sports are often considered better than team player sports, because single participant\u2019s victory is easier to monitor and it is easier to become a fan of single individuals. Firstly, the victory of a single sportsman is more transparent. It is clear how the sportsman won, because he is alone and relies only on himself and his skills. There is plenty of evidence in sports media that it is easier to assess an individual player, because less unpredictable factors that obscure the responsibilities are available. Secondly, it is easier for spectators to form attachments to single sportsmen rather than teams. It is evident that in each sport there are fan clubs and cults dedicated to individuals. Transparency and the ability to favorite individuals are the reasons why many feel like individual sports prevail over team sports. Although there are also many opinions on why this type of sports are considered bad and toxic. These opinions include boredom, limited cast of sportsmen and narcissism of individuals. Firstly, individual sports may be predictable and lack the diversity of outcomes that team sports have. As a result, audience loose interests in sports, because same individuals are winning the championships. Secondly, narcissism of single sportsman can be overwhelming to witness. Who else could withstand this? In mass media it is visible that sportsmen form harems of fans.",
        "On the other hand, team sports also have their advantages and disadvantages. It is often believed that team sports are more interesting, because of their unpredictability and range of interactions between team members. Firstly, team sports are interesting to speculate on. Many victory factors are impossible to predict beforehand. As a result, there is a growing number of betting communities forming on speculation. Secondly, you can see a variety dynamics and relations between team players, thus making the team play more interesting to observe. Many sports recordings suggest that some teams work in harmony and cooperation, while others can potentially fall apart in game. Unpredictability and variety of interactions within team is what team sports have been praised for. However, this type of sport has its disadvantages. Teams tend to fall apart and never come back as a union again due to disagreements. Many examples in sports history illustrate the disappointment of fans due to their favorite team not existing. In addition, if one team member fails then this may affect other players success at winning the match. Is it fair to lose when you are not the one making the mistakes? There are many fallen apart teams in sports history. Increasing chances of teams falling apart and dramatic single player contributions are often seen as disadvantages of team sports.",
        "In conclusion, both types of sports have their advantages and disadvantages. Individual sports are easy to monitor and form attachments to certain players, while also being less diverse and self-centered around the persona of a sportsman. Team sports are unpredictable and dynamic, though teams may be fragile and fall apart easily. In my opinion, team sports are better, because of the diversity team members offer and unpredictability of outcomes."
