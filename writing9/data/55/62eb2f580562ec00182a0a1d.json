        "Nowadays settling in other countries becoming increasingly popular. The majority of people with good  education qualification and relevant experience are preferring to work overseas. This essay will discuss the main reasons and side effects of working abroad.",
        "Perhaps the main reason behind many people tend to function from overseas is because of the greater pay. As their home countries pay grade is less when compared with other countries, so many people are choosing to work abroad . According to survery conducted by Fobes magazine more than 65% Indians are moving to countries like Australia, America, Canada, UK etc, because of higher salaries. Beside this, another key reason is lack of enough job options. This means in many countries people are unable to find the jobs relevant to their background education because of the increase in population.",
        "Moving to other countries has it's own disadvantage. The most common problem many people encounter is missing their family members and friends. As they will be busy in their life and can't find time to talk their families and well-wishers, as a result they will develop a distance among them. Furthermore, it has greater impact on health. Some people might fell sick as their body won't support because of of new living and climatic conditions. For instance, A Canadian newspaper published a story on how many Indian people faced health issues because of Canada's extream cold weather conditions.",
        "In conclusion, Although moving to states has benifits like high pay grade and good employement oppurtunities, people also face some of the problems like missing their family and risk their health. In my opinion, as health is the real wealth people should consider their health as priority before moving to overseas."
