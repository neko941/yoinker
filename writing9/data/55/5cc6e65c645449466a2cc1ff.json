        "Many children have extra time in-between school and lessons. Some people believe that this time should be best spent including an educational activity while others believe it is best for them to enjoy their freedom. I believe that children should have the freedom to do what they desire with the extra time they have.",
        "The educational world has been becoming more competitive in recent years. Hence, many parents and educators believe that it is necessary for a child to undergo extra classes during their free time. The more educational activities a child does; such as learning a new language or going for tuition can improve their grades which makes applying to university easier. Thus, many parents believe that by taking part in educational activities during their free time will give them an upper hand.",
        "However, I believe that during a child\u2019s free time it is important that they do what they want. By forcing children to take part in activities it shifts the importance of a child\u2019s mental wellbeing and places more importance on education. This can lead to drastic consequences in the future as the child would only measure his or her success based on their academic one rather then their personal success.",
        "In conclusion, although placing an importance on educational activities during a child\u2019s free time might improve their chances at university it can cause a child to act out and disobey their parents in the future. Therefore in my opinion a child\u2019s free time does not have to include an educational activity."
