        "In recent years,there has been an upward trend in individual car ownership in  the world urban regions which has resulted into various problems.Prohibition of private automobiles has been put forth by some urban areas.In my opinion, I strongly agree that a ban should be placed on private car ownership as it causes noise pollution and traffic congestion.",
        "One of the main reasons  why personal cars should be prohibited is its excessive noise pollution.In other words,noise pollution is one of the irritating effects of excessive motor usage in metropolitan areas and this is as a result of unnecessary utilization of automobile horns in traffic.For instance,BBC reported in summer of 2018 that 65% of noise pollution is from motor sounds.This can result in reduction in productivity most especially in companies situated in cities.For this reason,it is without no doubt that ban should be placed on vehicles that are owned personally.",
        "Another point to consider on why restriction should be on individual vehicles is high traffic congestion.Put simply,over the years,there has been an upward trend in vehicle purchase and this has resulted in road gridlock most especially by private car owners returning home after official hours.For example,Harvard lifestyle in June 2018 released a communiqu\u00e9 which showed a 75% rise in purchase of automobiles over the past five years.Consequently, avoidable road traffic has resulted from the elevated percentage of car use.This illustrates why personal motors ought to be restricted in metropolis.",
        "In conclusion,it is imperative to restrict personal automobiles so has to be able to curb the detrimental effects it poses to the individuals and society at large."
