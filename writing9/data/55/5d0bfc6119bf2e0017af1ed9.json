        "In today's competitive world, a broad knowledge is needed to succeed in any field. Different people have different mindset. Some section of society deem that teenagers should learn all school subjects, even they do not enjoy, whereas, others opine that they should only focus on those subjects which they find most interesting or they are best at. The following paragraphs would shed light on to the approaches before making the final conclusion along with my perspective.",
        "To comence with the first notion, there are myriad things to be shared in the first statement. first and foremost, student should learn all the subjects at school level. Nowadays, the job market is very demanding and the recruiters select students who are skilled in various field. Having knowledge of varied subjects during school time definitely widens the horizons for the students. Besides this, It is well known fact that most subjects are related to eact other in some way or the other. For example, a basic knowledge of mathematics is needed to excel in computer language. Finally, I believe that it is upto the teacher to develope interest of the students in any subject. For example, during my school days my history teacher was so good that a boring subject like history was the favourite subject of the whole class.",
        "However, there is an eminent adage that says, \"beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder'', likewise, others believe that students should not have to study all the subjects and should be allowed to choose the subjects they want to study beacuse they thinks thatin this case  the students will probably be more enthusiastic about their study. In addition by forcing to study all the subjects not only they will loose interest in education but also they will be constantly under a lot of pressure. For example, there was a survey done by the times of india in 2013 which stated that around 5000 students behind every million of students suffered from hypertension due to a lot of pressure during studying plethora of subjects at the same time.",
        "In conclusion, it can be said that as \"every coin has two sides'', in the same manner both aspects of studying all the subjects in school are crucial for both group of people and can not be denied."
