        "It is undeniable that there are more and more crimes committed by young people and have bad influences on society. To solve this growing problem, an escalating category of people, nowadays, try to seek solutions and some of them think those young criminals should be punished like adults. By contrast, I discern young criminals should be educated and be punished less. In the following essay, my contention will be further scrutinized.",
        "To begin with, it is widely known that compared to adults, young people have immaturity mind and body so this is more like a moral problem rather than legal issue. In most juvenile cases, because of bad growing environment and lack of education, those young criminals have no consciousness of laws and do not know where is boundary of legal which means they even do not know they have committed. So if they are punished like adults, it can have a serious impact on their physical and mental health and they will breed more evil thoughts. When they are released from prison, it is likely for them to commit crimes again. Therefore, in order to solve this issue, law trial is no longer the most useful weapon. By contrast, more morals should be added and more legal publicity is also important.",
        "Furthermore, young offenders should be given second chance. To illustrate this, in many countries, there are many kinds of laws to protect minors. For instance, in China, young criminals are sent to the juvenile prison rather than staying with the adult criminals who can teach their more criminal techniques. However, in the juvenile prison, they can get education. The living and food conditions are much better in the mean time. In this way, they can turn over a new leaf of their lives. Thus, as long as young offenders are educated well and be punished just the right amount, they will be grateful to public and thankful for government giving them a second chance to go back to the normal society. In addition, a more tolerant society leads to less crime.",
        "In conclusion, after this essay has manifested the above-mentioned points, I can reiterate that I believe that young people who commit serious crimes should not be punished like adults. They should be educated and given a second chance. As not only in this way is good for their mental and physical health, but it can also reduce the crimes in the future. Hence, I argue that governments should implement more laws to protect young criminal and the public should also treat those young people equally."
