This goes without saying that insurance industry is highly competitive industry and staying with single insurer for so long would means a lot for your organisation. On this occasion, however, your organisation has disappointed me by increasing the the monthly premium amount for the 2nd time in last 3 months.",
        "Since I have become your policy holder, I have never filed an insurance claim which is a proof of the the level of efforts I have put to maintain the vehicle. In addition to this, recently, I have also bundled up my home insurance along with vehicle insurance. Hence, I feel that the increase in the insurance premium is not appropriate.",
        "A copy of my insurance policy is enclosed with this letter for your reference, and I would like to request you to reconsider my particular case and reaccess my profile based on the facts mentioned above. As a result of which, I expect you to not increase my insurance premium.",
        "I hope you will pay heed to my concerns and consider my case favourably.",
