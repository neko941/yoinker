        "Some people believe that schools should only reward students who achieve the highest score in class, others argue that it is more significant to reward those who improved their educational performances. This essay will analyze both sides of the matter before my point of view is drawn at the end.",
        "On the one hand, there are several reasons why the best students in class deserve rewards. Firstly, rewards could create highly competitive studying environment among students at school. As a consequence, school children could be encouraged to put their effort into studying to get the highest score. Secondly, thanks to this approach, the best students are identified and they will be given more opportunities to nurture their abilities. For example, in my high school, the best students in each class are chosen for special training in order to take part in national competitions.",
        "On the other hand, giving encouragement to those who improved their studies results brings more favorable outcomes. The first benefit is that this could give equal chances for all students to receive rewards instead of only focusing on best students. It leads to all students are motivated to try harder to receive awards. The second benefit is that this method promotes learning for enjoyment and understanding, rather than gain the high mark. It plays a crucial role in reducing the pressures for the exams and cheating to achieve the high score.",
        "In conclusion, it seems to me that it is better to give encouragement to those who have improved their level of academic performance despite the undeniable advantages of giving awards to best students in class."
