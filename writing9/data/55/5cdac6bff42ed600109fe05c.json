        "Human bonding is based out of the many impressions like attitude, being honest, showing gratitude and so on. Some blood relations like parents, children, siblings, grandparents doesnot require much attention or expression directly, can easily understood as they are all emotionally attached to each other. Moreover, they can rapidly get through the disturbances, even when they occur either intetntionally or mistakenly, due to the high levels of grasping on one another.",
        "Whereas, few affiliations like friends, third parties, colleagues, neighbours, etc, require lot of time to get an idea of mentalities of both sides, specifically in the case of opposite gender, as not two persons' thought will ever be identical. Chances of misunderstandings are very high and are common between such parties, in fact, may sometimes, lead to quarrels, impacting the friendship. In such cases, it is always the honesty which paves way to strong binding, along with utmost confidence and that which shall never give a chance even, for misconceptions. Maintaining truth ab initio of the relationship, creates a level of belief in such person after certain period of time, in line with the firm presumption upon the person.",
        "Perhaps, this vitally supports, when distrubance araises, let's the focus of thinking the pros and cons letting the individual's mind know the truth. Therefore, the relationship shall last for long with a continuing veracity. At times, people tells lies or hide some facts in order to give happiness to the other person. This will continue the relation only to certain extent, until the matter comes out. But, it is very difficult to regain the legitimacy once that is dishonoured, as it is very tough task to any one to take such hard things; mainly to those who has emotional bondings.",
