        "In the 21st century, computer games and the internet become one of the hottest topics surrounding society. Children might not be interested in traditional games, they tend to choose computer games for their leisure time. Parents have much debate in this area whether online games might negatively affect in this area whether online games might produce negative effects on offspring. Let me illustrate my perspectives in the below paragraph.",
        "First of all, most parents are highly concerned about their offspring's education rather than leisure time. Nowadays, offspring might addict to computer games once they started. Children might forego their studies and homework. Parents claim that computer games do not bring any value to kids to assist in their studies. From my perspective, some games do create and bring value to offspring, as their logical thinking can be developed as users need to figure out how to solve the issues one by one. Thus, we cannot deny some computer games could bring benefits to kids.",
        "On the other hand, I tend to agree that some online games might bring negatively impact their mental and physical development as offspring lack self-discipline and time management. Kids might sit the whole day without stretching, which could harm and affect their physical development. During their development period, kids need to have regular exercise to grow up. Kids spend numerous times on online games without building up a physical social network with friends. Hence, offspring have not properly built up their soft skills in their daily lives. Because of this, kids might feel lonely and isolated from society and the community. While kids feel that they have been isolated, they might feel depressed because of. Thus, their personality might be shaped by long-term depression.",
        "In conclusion, parents need to provide proper guidelines and choose the proper computer program for their children. If parents do not offer games to their children, which might also affect kids' social networks as they cannot have any common topics with their classmates. Because of this, proper parenting is necessary to prevent damage to kids no matter their physical and mental development."
