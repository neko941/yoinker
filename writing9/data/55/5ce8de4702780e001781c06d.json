        "Having money is considered by many people to be one of the most significant contributing factors towards happiness. In my opinion, it is possible for people to be happy even if they have little money and other aspects of life can also play a crucial role in creating happiness.",
        "Obviously, individuals can survive their life  delightfully ,even if they are not much wealthy. Although having money brings happiness to an abundance of people, but it does not necessary that who have scarcity of money are unhappy. In fact, spending time with family is key to happiness. Also, if persons satisfy with affluence, which they have  now, they will live a prosperous life. Take for example the comparison between developing and developed countries, most Westerners would agree that people in developing countries are happier, since they enjoy stronger family connections and take more pleasure in the simplicities of life to a greater extent than those in the developed countries. Thus, I would like to say that people, who have not much money, can live their life peacefully.",
        "Certainly, people can gain happiness is through their work. That is to say, if everyone enjoys their profession honestly, they will be blessed one. For instance, a doctor doing volunteer work in underdeveloped countries may have very little money but the reward of helping people and doing the job they are good at, brings happiness in itself. Therefore, occupation plays a vital role to living a happy life.",
        "In conclusion, money is not essential for happiness, which can be found through job satisfaction as well as family."
