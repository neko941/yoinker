        "A big majority of students rely on the internet because it is very convenient. The internet is a very useful tool but to what extent do we use it plus you can always get your information from it but there\u2019s always fake news false facts and negative sites for young people that get their information wrong. They\u2019re a lot of benefits and non-benefits when using the internet as a student to help with your studies when you cant get a library card or can\u2019t afford a book  I agree at a certain level it should be limited.",
        "As a student that needs to get information as fast as possible, he can find wrong information and believe it to be true. The student can firstly be limited in his research due to false answers also students should visit the library because the library is a trustable source and no false answers and the student can get his information from it. Secondly, they can learn how to use it in a better way to not get misled by information lastly they can search the information from a trusted and reliable source to get their information many students fail due to getting false answers.",
        "A hand full of students can\u2019t afford a library card or might not afford it and can\u2019t reach the place due to the place they live and the distance so they are forced to use the internet and sometimes they are misled. Majority of those already know the internet so they know their ways to get trustable information but that doesn\u2019t mean all students know how to.",
        "Many students don\u2019t have the money to purchase information or the books so the internet is the only option but those who have the option should be limited and taught how to use it  I agree at a certain level with this statement that students should be restricted when using the internet for information"
