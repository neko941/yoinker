        "It is argued that it's better to have friendship with those who shares same mindset. However, others believe it's fruitful to become friends with those who sometimes make arguments. Although like-minded people shares and understand each in tough situations, people who oddly make arguments could give proper guidance and show us the real situation. In my opinion, it depends upon a person's choice. This essay will discuss both sides with a concluding view.",
        "On the one hand, friends who share the similar thought process tend to understand each other in extreme or tough times of their life. They can act as a family to each other as they try to mirror themselves with the same scenario. For instance, as per Harvard business Review, people who have identical mindset tend to recover faster from any kind of stress or anxiety when share their problems with one another. Thus, it is quite evident that like-minded personalities assist each other effectively during harsh times.",
        "On the other hand, buddies who sometimes contradict your idea or thought perhaps guide and show the reality to their friend. This kind of people doesn't support every idea or thought of their friend as they probably make a calculation whether their friend is going on a right track or not. To illustrate, In India, as per the recent survey, most of the youngsters get guidance and life lessons from their not-so-great friends if they get indulge in drug abuse and any other kind of illegal activity. Hence, it is ideal to have this kind of friend.",
        "I personally believe that it entirely depends upon an individual's preference whether to be friends with someone like-minded or argumentative.",
        "In conclusion, similar-minded people builds a kind of comfort-zone for each other to display their issues as their understanding is phenomenal even during erratic times. Nevertheless, an odd friend could scold you but keep you in a right direction. It wholly upto individual what type of mate he or she welcomes in their lives."
