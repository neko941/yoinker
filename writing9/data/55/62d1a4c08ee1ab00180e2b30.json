        "Industrialization brings different sorts of pollution to  mother nature and affects it adversely. A group of people thinks, that imposing a tax would be impactful to reduce the extent of pollution. On the contrary, another thought also exists, which doesn't agree with the statement and believes in introducing modern technologies which are nature friendly. This essay will discuss  both  views.",
        "Imposing tax is considered  one of the most effective ways because it can directly affect the profitability of the business. Therefore, the companies which are producing effluents and emerging as a threat to  nature will be forced to take preventive steps or make changes in the production process. Moreover, a study on the impact of tax also agrees about the forceful effect of tax on  companies. It can also happen that some companies might not survive the additional pressure of tax and stop running the business.",
        "On the other hand, some people support the thought of illuminating people about the adverse impacts of water pollution, air pollution, sound pollution, etc. It is also believed that, people with better understanding and knowledge can make wise decisions and be aware of the well-being of our lovely earth. Working on innovating new nature-friendly machines and technologies can also help reduce industrial pollution. Government can also attract  companies for using eco-friendly industrial machines by providing subsidies and other lucrative advantages.",
        "In this context, both  views have their own points and reasons against them. However, bearing additional tax will affect the companies directly and helps to reduce the harmful effect on the environment in the short run. Simultaneous effort should be given to educate people about prioritizing the health of  nature and provide government subsidies on  environmental friendly machinery which will strengthen the economy of the nation in the long run."
