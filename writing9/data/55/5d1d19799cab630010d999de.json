        "In some countries this days, a lot of people are overweight and unhealthy despite advancement in health care. This essay will analyze the causes of these problems and explore possible solutions such as high taxes on unhealthy foods and increased public awareness on the need for physical exercise.",
        "A major reason why obesity and poor health is on the increase in some countries is due to unhealthy foods people eat which has high level of sugar, fat and salt as seen in refined foods. These meals contain more than the optimal calorie required by the body and the excess calorie is converted to fat by the body with its associated health complications.  For example, junk foods are rampart in many cities today. As a result, more people are becoming obese and sick.",
        "Furthermore, some people are overweight and physically unfit because of their sedentary lifestyle. In other words, some individuals choose passive recreational activities such as watching televisions, playing video games and reading novels when they are free rather than involve in active programs like running, jogging and playing footballs. As a consequence, excess body calorie are not burnt out by the body resulting in increase in weight and sicknesses.",
        "However, to address these problems, taxes on fast and refined foods should be increased. This will make these meals expensive and only affordable by few people. Thus, more people will eat healthier and cheaper home-made meals. In addition, the government of various countries should enlighten their citizens about the health benefits of physical exercise. When people are aware of these merits, they would likely make needed changes to stay healthy.",
        "In conclusion,  unhealthy meals and sedentary life are responsible  for the increase in weight and lack of physical fitness of some people. Exorbitant of these foods through taxation and active lifestyle promotions will help address these problems."
