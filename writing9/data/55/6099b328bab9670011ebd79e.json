        "Nowadays many adults have full-time jobs and the proportion of their lives spent doing such jobs is very high. So feelings about one's profession must reflect how an individual feels about his or her life as a whole, and because of this, job satisfaction is indeed very important for the wellbeing of that person.",
        "Employees get work satisfaction in a number of ways. Firstly, a person needs to feel that they are doing valued and valuable work, so positive feedback from a superior is very important in his respect. A sense of fulfilment is also encouraged if a worker feels the career is worth doing because it contributes to the society or the economy as a whole. Secondly, when someone feels they are improving or developing their skills through training opportunities, for example, then there is a sense of progress and purpose that rewards a worker. The sense of belonging to a team or a working community also contributes to profession satisfaction because colleagues help each other to enjoy their working lives. achievement is also increased by a sense of responsibility for the loyal to a team.",
        "Of ,course not everyone enjoys their work. Hard economic realities mean that many people have little choice in the kind of job they can get. In some cases, an employee is working in a job that suits neither their skills nor their personality. Some jobs are repetitive and boring, and labour relations may be poor and lead to resentment and insecurity rather than  job satisfaction.",
        "However, even though it is unlikely that all workers do feel happy in their work, I think it is not unrealistic to promote more job satisfaction in any job. If the factors identified above implemented, then any job can be improved and more workers can feel greater degrees of job satisfaction"
