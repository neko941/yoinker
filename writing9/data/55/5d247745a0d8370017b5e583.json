        "The school is an embodiment of knowledge as well as a citadel of learning. Thus, students can either pick a skill from it or with its variety of subjects it can fortify school children in preparation of their various careers. This essay would elucidate both sides of the divide.",
        "",
        "On the one hand, the school teach a variety of subjects such as fine art which equip children with drawing and innovative skills. To put it another,  way children are exposed to the world of creativity early enough in school. Which  can act as a source of survival hood in future. A good example of this can be proven when the popular Italian Artist Marco Parcileni was interviewed at the just concluded 2018 world art day which he told reporters that he was first introduced to art at high school in Italy. Hence, it is no doubt that the school can also better the life of a child by teaching skills.",
        "",
        "On the other hand, the school in it curriculum has variety of subject such as basic sciences as well as entrepreneurship. This can help buttress school pupils to make informed decision in deciding their careers based on the didactic knowledge they have been equipped with. For an instance, A pivot study done by the American teaches institute in 2017 supported the view that student who have done various subjects can easily identify their strong ground, as such will be more successful in life. Therefore, children should be allowed to involve themselves in numerous subjects.",
        "",
        "To sum up, having analyzed both views I believe that their are advantages in both side. However, for children to successfully in future they must partake in different subjects."
