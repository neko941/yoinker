        "With the increased rate of the car availability there has been much debate about the ways to reduce the negative impact on the atmosphere caused by the extensive usage of private vehicles. Some reckon that inputting such rule as \u00abInternational car free days\u00bb might preserve our environment and reduce air pollution, while others state that this method alone is not enough to solve this problem and others tools should be proposed. I tend to agree with the latest statement that there should be a mix of effective instruments in order to lessen the pollution.",
        "There are strong reasons for believing that owing to being a major threat to health and climate air pollution is considered to be one of the significant environmental issues that should be urgently tackled. Implementing International car free days might remedy the situation, but it is no enough to considerably reduce air emissions. Therefore, the cooperation of the government and business should facilitate the demand on electric cars that unlike the traditional cars depend on electricity instead of fossil fuels as well as shorten the price on these vehicles. Thus, the trend on replacing conventional cars on electric automobiles might reduce gas emissions.",
        "Nevertheless, such preventative measure as International car free days is an important step towards the shorten air pollution. These days might help people to recognize the seriousness of this problem and become more informed about the negative impact of air pollution. Moreover, by not using cars during some period, there might be a significant drop on releasing of gas emissions that globally result in positive changes.",
        "To recapitulate, taken all the aforementioned arguments into account, I have all grounds to believe that being a crucial problem today \u2013 air pollution should be shorten dramatically by means of replacement the gas cars to the modern eco-friendly electric cars. There is no denying that international car free days might be also helpful for the environment, especially in raising community awareness, although, I have always sided with people who put revolutionary methods first."
