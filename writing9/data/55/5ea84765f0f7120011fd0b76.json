        "Nowadays, the consumption of convenience foods in several nations is leading to numerous health problems. Consequently, to limit this case, the authority should issue a higher tax for this type of food. Personally, I totally disagree with this statement because of the rationale following.",
        "It can be clearly seen that the fast food industry is one of the sources which contribute a massive amount of money to the national economy. To illustrate, due to the quick pace of life, people tend to use more frozen foods, therefore, the amount of products can be purchased significantly everyday which bring back a significant pay-off. Moreover, the higher the demand is the more food need to be produced, which will create the employment opportunity for lots of people, hence, can solve the unemployment problem. So if the government imposes higher tax, it may impact badly on the widen economy. Because of the increase in the price of canned food, the selling will decrease, leading to the bankrupt of several companies, as a result, more people will be unemployed. In a nutshell, the effort try to handle with the current problem will definitely lead to a bigger one.",
        "Moreover, imposing a higher tax can beget to some remarkable issue. To explain, if the associations want to have a high income while can pay all of the interest, they will cut off some stages of the food process to reduce the cost such as the companies will reject the hygiene process which is the most expensive one to invest or import cheap materials, which will significantly harm to the customer\u2019s health after eating these foods",
        ". Therefore, the origin purpose of launching a higher taxtax will be replaced by an opposite result-making more people deal with their health problems.",
        "In conclusion, imposing higher tax is a bad idea to handle with the problem since it creates numerous disadvantages. So beside this solution, there are several ways that the government can use such as raising the awareness of people through some advertising campaigns or some programs which include scientists and doctors to explain the reason why people should avoid eating fast food."
