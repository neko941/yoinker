        "It is endemic that a large number of children become offenders all around the world. More violence content in media and the lack of correct guidance from parents are to be blame for this situation, and the government should carry out policies to help juvenile delinquents reintegrate into society.",
        "Teenagers are particularly susceptible to violence in media content, and they might copycat antisocial behavior if their parents neglect their emotional wellbeing. For instance, television sometimes encourages aggressive or even violent behavior among young people, children who are exposed to those programs would tend to resort to violence when they face problems. In addition, parents pay more attention on physical condition instead of psychological situation. This is particular the case for single parents, who have to resume child-care responsibility while being occupied with a full-time job. It is difficult for them to watch closely of their kids, and prevent them from being violent at the first place.",
        "To deter a rising juvenile delinquency, the authorities should create a sound rehabilitation system in order to reform young offenders and make them become contributing members to society. To be specific, teenagers who commit trivial crimes such as pocket-picking could have a chance to retrain in facility, and hopefully they could find an employment after they re-enter the society. By the contrast, severe criminals ought to be sentenced to prison regardless their ages because they need to pay for what they have caused to victims. At the same time, they should retrain and understand the correct moral before the release in case of being a reoffender.",
        "In conclusion, an increase exposure to violent media content and parental neglect are two contributors to a crime wave of teenage criminals. The government should give penalty properly and take actions to reintegrate those teenagers into society when they are free."
