        "In 2011, the figure for opening and closure stood at about 8500 and 6400 respectively. By the next year, the opening figure had dropped sharply by 4500, but then increased gradually to just over 6000 in 2014. At the same time, the number of stores that closed fluctuated several times and finally reached the same point as opening in 2014.",
        "In 2015, regarding the opening figure, it decreased significantly to exactly 4000 and remained stable over the following two years. This number for closure had witnessed a sharp fall to approximately 500 by 2015. However, it rose dramatically to just above 5000. it remains relatively unchanged for the rest of the period, despite a negligible  fluctuation. By 2018, the opening figure had reduced by 1000."
