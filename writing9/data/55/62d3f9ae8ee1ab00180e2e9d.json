        "Economic pressure leads to anxiety, so some people believe that joy is brought by high income, while other people state that other factors will also bring happiness. This essay will investigate both views but believes the latter opinion.",
        "On the one hand, there are two reasons why being rich can become happy. One reason is that economic success can allow people to purchase anything they like. As they are wealthy, they do not have economic pressure and they do not have to worry about financial issues. They can simply purchase anything they like without thinking twice. Another reason is that economic success can allow people to undergo different experiences. When people are wealthy, they can buy experience by participating in some interesting activities that can bring happiness. For instance, they can travel to the Antarctic or national parks to enjoy the stunning view.",
        "On the other hand, there are two reasons why money is not the factor that affects happiness. Firstly, not everything can be bought by money. There are something that cannot be purchased such as family\u2019s accompany and love. Some people may be wealthy but unhappy because they prefer spending time with their families. There are so many factors that could bring happiness other than money such as friends and families. Moreover, having money does not give people life meaning. Some people lose their goals or passion after having economic success as they do not have any more life targets, and this may cause them become depressed. As a result, money is not the factor that brings happiness as there are other factors.",
        "To conclude, although money may allow people to purchase the thing they want, it is definitely not directly related to happiness."
