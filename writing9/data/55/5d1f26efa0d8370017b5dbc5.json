        "With the increase in crime rate recorded yearly,most people believe that the best way to curb this increase is to sentence criminals to death. While others say that subjecting them to  punishment should be a better way to prevent this increase. This essay seeks to discuss both views in the following paragraphs.",
        "Some people believe that death penalty is the only way of making the society crime free and making the citizens adhere to certain laws. For instance, the Arab world has placed a punishment by death for individuals who engage in crimes such as robbery, use of illicit drugs and consumption of alchol which is found to be offensive in their religion. This method of punishment has succeded in creating a high moral standard in these societies as these crimes are gradually going extinct.",
        "On the other hand, other forms of punishment such as sending criminals to prison, use of rehabilitation centers and engaging them with community services has been a helpful approach in hindering the increase in crime rate rather than death sentence. For clarity, countries like America and Britain believe so much in educating and rehabilitating criminals to help them become people to the society. Finally, these countries also believe that judgement on any criminl matter depends on the intensity of the crime.",
        "Crimes such as petty robbery and shop lifting should not have death as its penalty.",
        "In conclusion, Although death penalty is a way of  maintaining a crime free environment but then not all crime deserves this form of punishment. Other methods listed above can be used to curb crime increase."
