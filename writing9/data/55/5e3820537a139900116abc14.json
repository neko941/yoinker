        "The transportation industry has completely evolved over the last few decades. With the introduction of the first car in 1888, leading to a staggering increase of 29 million vehicles over the Britain roads over a period of 112 years. This has had a major impact over the environment in general which has encouraged us to explore different kinds of alternative transport as well as implementing new laws to control the industry. I personally, agree with the above mentioned changes and would explain the reasons for the same in this essay.",
        "To begin with, I would like to mention some of  the alternate forms of transport that could be implemented. For instance, cycling, walking, electric cars, public buses and shared cabs. These modes of transportation not only benefits us by improving our physical health but also contributes significantly in reducing the air pollution and maintaining a healthy environment, which in turn  preserves our animals which are on the verge of extinction due to the poisonous gases emitted by the engines and the side effects of global warming. For example, the recent forest fires due to the erratic climatic changes witnessed the deaths of a number of animals and humans.",
        "Furthermore, the implementation of international laws over both car ownership as well as vehicle use could help contribute towards a safer and pollution free environment. For example, the possession of a single vehicle per family and capping the mileage per vehicle could be considered along side the alternate modes of transportation.",
        "On the other hand it could also be argued, that an increase in the number of vehicles has tremendously benefited the population in general. In terms of, easy accessibility, fastest mode of communication, reliability, and safety.",
        "In conclusion,keeping all the points discussed in this essay . I am strongly inclined of the opinion despite the benefits cars provide to us that we would have to implement alternative modes of transport and undertake laws implemented in its usage as the seriousness of the side effects it emits outweighs the benefits it provides."
