        "In the modern world, there are lots of different values and meanings to being a family. In a particular group of countries, men and women decide to have babies mostly at a later age. While this trend has some drawbacks, I think that benefits are outweigh.",
        "It cannot be denied that having a child at old age can create some psychological and physical health issues for parents and children. Before deciding to be a parent at late both individuals who will be a parent should aptitude some necessary genetics analysis because lots of genetics\u2019 diseases while appears that time and can cause lasting sickness such as Down syndrome, HIV, lack of some organs, cerebral palsy and so on. The extreme cases, during the birth, even one side may confront with death. In terms of psychological effects, the age gap is bigger between parent and child which can lead to difficulties relating to each  other. Therefore, children suffering from the shortage of disagreements about a variety range of topics, especially, when they are teenagers, even they are ashamed of their parents.",
        "However, despite the aforementioned disadvantages, I am convinced that having babies late compared to early ages (is) myriad of advantages. First and foremost, more and more individuals have the hardship to earn sufficient money that\u2019s why caring for babies and even getting married is quite difficult for them recently. Some couples prefer having financial stability before having and raising a child. The fact is that rearing a child is not identified only feeding and wearing but also have to support of their educational life, mental situation, planning their private life, moreover parents should provide them with everything until the death of themselves. These kinds of propreties are not gained at an early ages, so that people prefer to have a baby when they are ready with all aspects. Additionally, the people who want to have a baby late in their life they will obtain more experience about bringing up children like caring of baby, towards them to advisable side it would be able to education, sport, art aspects.",
        "In conclusion, although I recognize that having a baby at an older age has drawbacks, I believe that it has more positive effects for both sides."
