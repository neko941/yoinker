        "The involvement of companies in the communities they operate in is an ongoing debate. However, in my opinion, as much as governments, companies should establish sports and social facilities for local communities for numerous reasons.",
        "Firstly, creating sports and social facilities is actually part of corporate social responsibility. Because companies operate within local communities and take advantage of the land and its' people, they should give back to these neighborhoods through creating amenities that benefit the residents. For instance, a fitness company could contribute to the community by installing free work-out equipment at public parks for those that cannot afford a gym subscription.",
        "Secondly, local residents are often the primary income for companies; thus, their health and well-being are imperative. Firms should always ensure that their market is healthy. Creating sports and social spaces for locals will keep the residents active and content whilst creating a healthier customer base. Eventually, caring for the local communities by establishing sports and social facilities will bring lucrative income to companies.",
        "Finally, engaging with local communities with the intention to improve their lives gives a boost to the company's reputation. Hence, more people are likely to purchase the company's products and services. For instance, Ford Motor Company recently acquisitioned the historical Detroit train station. After being prohibited to public for 87 years, the train station was reopened for free public tours. Bill Ford, the CEO of Ford, even allowed for workshops and events to be held within the train station. These kinds of initiations encourage the locals to look up to such companies.",
        "In conclusion, I agree that companies should invest in sports and social amenities that would serve the local communities. This would enable companies to give back to communities, generate healthier markets and improve the firm's reputation."
