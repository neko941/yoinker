        "Human sleeping time is not correctly followed in today\u2019s world. Currently, people from most countries tend to sleep for fewer hours comparing to our previous generations. The major reason for this is the present generation\u2019s lifestyle changes and work nature. The below paragraphs will further elaborate on the reasons and its consequences in individuals and society as a whole.",
        "People nowadays sleep for minimal hours mainly because of their working time. As the world has become fast paced, it has become a necessity to provide 24 by 7 service in most of the sectors. So to fulfill this requirement employers hire employees to work in shift timings. Many people accept these timings, as this gives them an opportunity to earn more money which eventually leads to less sleeping hours for humans. For example, people working in call centers usually either get no sleep in the night or very less sleep in the day time. Another reason for the reduced sleeping hours is mainly because of lifestyle changes. It has become a habit of today\u2019s individuals to do work at night or have late night outings or watch entertainment channels for a long time by reducing their sleeping time. As they sleep late due to these reasons, they get very less time for sleeping.",
        "As a consequence of minimal hours of sleep, the people\u2019s health and appetite are immensely affected. Its been scientifically proven that, if an individual is deprived of necessary hours of sleep, then their body functioning will be affected mainly due to the lack of rest given to the human system. In other words, the hormones in the human body need an ample amount of sleep and rest to get generated in the right amount which would help the body to complete all the necessary functions. For example, if a person sleeps for less than 8 hours then one of the important functioning of their body like the digestion process would get slower, which would eventually make a person restless and disturbed. This in effects creates a society with many unhealthy people. Another major implication caused due to the less sleeping hour in individuals is, loss in mental peace, tolerance, and intelligence. Its usually seen that, if individuals get less sleep then they tend to become more restless and this leads to impatience and anger in individuals. This eventually makes the society more vulnerable to crime.",
        "To conclude, the sleeping hours are drastically reduced among today's generation when compared to our ancestors. The major reasons are the work culture and the changing lifestyles of people, which in effect has resulted in a weaker, unhealthy and rather disturbed society with people of restless nature. Ideally, it would be good if people do follow the required hours of sleep in a day to have a society of individuals with a healthy mind and body."
