        "It is true that these days road systems have required a lot of money. While some people argue that these money should be paid by governments; others believe that it is better for the users to pay for this. Personally, I would argue that governments should take the responsibility for spending on transportation.",
        "On the one hand, there are a number of reasons for inhabitants should allocate money on road systems. Firstly, it is obvious that wider and more roads built with the aim of serving the lives of people. As a result, the commuters should bear the cost of construction. Secondly, paying for road systems discourages the use of private cars. This is because citizens want to economize their budget, so they would use the public transit more frequently. This leads to less car exhumes released into the atmosphere, which helps reduce environmental damage. In addition, a person who can afford a car is more affluent than others. Therefore, forcing them to pay for road construction is a kind of financial support for less fortunate people.",
        "On the other hand, I believe that authorities should invest in transportation and infrastructure. It is undoubted that ensuring road systems to be safe and upgraded is a part of the state\u2019s responsibility. However, national budget is from citizen\u2019s tax, eventually it should be served for their benefit. Furthermore, construction and improvement of road systems requires a tremendous amont of money, which is beyond citizens\u2019 financial capability. For example, a highway building project may cost billions of dollars. Therefore, it is governments that have enough power to appeal the financial aid from global community.",
        "In conclusion, although both views certainly have some validity, it seems to me that it is better for road systems to be maintained and erected by each authority"
