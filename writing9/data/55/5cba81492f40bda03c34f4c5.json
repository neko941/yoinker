        "It is argued that the government should increase its expenditure on defense and decrease its expenditure on social benefits. I strongly disagree to this opinion and think that social benefits have more significances than defense.",
        "First of all, I believe that social benefits such as medical facilities, electricity, food are more essential than any other thing. The poor people do not care whether the defense of the country is weak or strong. It doesn't mean that the government should stop spending on its defense, it is also important. However, giving social benefits to its people is more important than spending a hefthy amount on its defense. For instance, Pakistan has good fighter jets and strong missiles, but it is still not been able to provide the kind of facilities it should provide to its public and that's the reason why the people are unhappy with their government as many of them do not get proper facilities. Therefore, it is I consider social benefits as a necessity for every country.",
        "Secondly, atom bombs and nuclear bombs can only cause more trouble to the society. Bombs are often made and purchased for the safety of the public, however misuse of these delicacies can cause hazardous consequence for the whole world. For example, North Korean is one of the most powerful nations and because of some foolish leaders had made throttle for the whole world. That's why I strongly believe that the money spent on such bombs could be reduced and could be saved for the betterment of the society after having a decent number bombs for safety.",
        "To recapitulate, I reckon spending on social benefits are more essential than spending on defense as it makes the people happy and motivated for paying their taxes."
