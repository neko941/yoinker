        "It is a common belief that using computers were advantages more than disadvantages .I support this opinion  because  electronic products are an ever-changing world. People can use computers to work or study.Actually,it is a double-edged sword for us.",
        "My view on this issue is that the worker always uses computers to work or save important information .Subsequently,any companies have computers that make workers fast and clean finish projects.Moreover, the designer needs to use computer design fashion and patterns.Due to more businessman bring it every day. On the other hand,we can adopt a computer to send messages to the boss or client. It makes us easy to search for files and we can listen to music in our free time.",
        "On top of that, computers are really helpful for students.For ,instance more country students use computers to send homework and value email.They can use computers to check grammar or sentences.",
        "However, some children like playing with them on the computer. They are easily addicted to games. Furthermore, parents need to teach them and let children  learn knowledge as well.",
        "We can see that computers make us have more knowledge, even though it has a bad impact,but we use computers normally, it can bring happiness and helpful life. In our free ,time we can watch online videos or shows. The student does not go outside to school.This advance saves  time.As we can see people reduce using paper and pens,and  a person knows about environmental protection. Then our earth can be better  and have more trees."
