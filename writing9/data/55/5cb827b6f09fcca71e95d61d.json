        "Law plays an imperative role in keeping peace for country and society . While some argue that all authorities  should capture people  who do not comply with the legislation in prison , others think criminals can be punished with other ways . Personally, I believe that it is clement  that government has different kind of punishments to chastise  breakers.",
        "It is unquestionable that people should be sent to prison if they are guilty. This is a brilliant way to prevent offences. Indeed, prison penalty can stop people having intention to do any illegal actions because whether crimes are serious or not , they all receive this discipline.  Moreover, putting criminals in prison also a  good idea to punish them. Life in prison without freedom and happy  make  them feel repentant  and they will not have serious fault  in the future. Furthermore , capturing lawbreaker helps society become peaceful and lovely.",
        "On the other hand , there are various ways  to punish people breaking law . It is logical that government can depend on level of crime  to decide punishment  for each criminal. For example, it is not worth to capture  a one cake thieve , instead,  authorities can force him to do social activities such as planting trees or helping the poor and so on . In addition, educating people to avoid doing illegal actions is also a great method. Therefore, no more crimes happen and people are not put in prison.",
        "In conclusion, law is significantly essential for every country. Although prison  is an appropriate way for pushing criminal , alternatives can be used to make law  more flexible and logical."
