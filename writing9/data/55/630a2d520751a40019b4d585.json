        "Hunger is a real issue which needs to be solved as soon as possible. The majority of the people around the globe still go hungry, even though, many advanced changes have been made in the field of agriculture. This essay will discuss what is causing this, and what measures can be taken to ensure that hunger is killed.",
        "There are various issues which lead to the hunger of the people, despite all the advances in  agriculture. Firstly, the people who live far enough and don\u2019t get the food to meet their hunger. For example, many people around Africa are dying of hunger just because they are not getting  food. Secondly, the supermarket mafia buys all the food from the farmers, which they sell at their markets and make them more expensive, in order to make more money. For instance, if all of the food is bought by  supermarkets, what will  community around the globe get? Who are not able to afford it.",
        "Whilst the problems may seem intractable, there are solutions available. The first solution is that  the government should decide on a percentage of food that should be given to  poor society around the world. This would force all the farmers around the world to not sell all of their foods to the supermarkets only. Another solution is that the whole nation should support the poor people to grow their own vegetables and fruits  so that they would not go hungry. Proposed limitations on the selling of food and growing own food might just solve the problems caused.",
        "This essay discussed the causes why society around the globe are going hungry, even though, several advances have been made in  agriculture. While there are several solutions in hand to alleviate this problem."
