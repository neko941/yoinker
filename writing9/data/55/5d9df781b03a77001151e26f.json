        "Certain demographics support usage of revenues for providing relatively quicker public transportation. On the other hand, the rest of the population thinks there are other pressing issues such as healthcare and the environment. This essay describes the importance of the both issues and concludes upon the importance of improving public health and protecting nature over providing better public transportation.",
        "Firstly, providing fast commutes between major cities boosts the revenue generation, while decreasing the carbon footprint. The people living in relatively farther places from the major cities get access to the mainstream jobs. This facility not only increases the spending capacity of the small city dwellers, but also improves the local businesses, resulting in overall development. Moreover, affluent citizens prefer to use faster public commute services, instead of using cars to escape from the traffic and exhaustion due to the driving. This decreases the amount of greenhouse gas emissions. The Jet train between the city of Mumbai and Pune has decreased the travel time to 30 minutes and boosted the economy of Pune within five years of the launch.",
        "In contrary, There is a dire situation in government funded hospitals and the absolute lack of pollution monitoring in the city outskirts. Most of the public hospitals are operating in 60 years or older buildings, often lacking enough diagnostic tools and imaging equipments. For example, the article published in The Hindu news paper has exposed a patient's story, who died of injuries caused due to the unexpected collapse of the hospital roof in the Chennai City. Furthermore, the lack of pollution control and monitoring has made the life of people living in the surrounding industrial areas worse. In an interview, the chief of the pollution control board blames it on the lack of equipment. The government should be realistic and take actions for the issues of the immediate needs.",
        "To conclude, Though the modernisation of the public transportation has long term benefits, the government should consider immediate needs for the well being of the public. The modern infrastructure is no good without safe and healthy conditions for survival."
