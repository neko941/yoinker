        "I should first say that I love my family and I can\u2019t imagine my life without them. But only to talk about one family member I am so proud of I can refer to my sister.",

        "She is one year older than me. I can recall that we spent a bunch of time studying and playing games together since we shared the same bedroom. Besides, as I remember she had a quite carefree childhood with nothing to worry about and she was actually quite playful. Opposite, I used to be a very quiet person. I was envious of her personality a lot.",
        "She has had a very important role in my life, even though we are only one year apart. She has always been trying to encourage me to attempt everything and supported me to shine in my career and life path, also gave me lots of advice when I was confused in life.",
        "I would say that now she is 20-something, ah 26 years old, she majors in medicine and she is getting to be a resident doctor very soon.",
        "I would say I admire her because of her outstanding features. And her problems or difficulties that she\u2019s had in her life, she has never given up. I am sure she will be an excellent doctor one day.",
        "So yeah that\u2019s the reason I decided to talk it about."
