Due to state of the art, disparate humans intuch each other with different divices, and gadgets; such as cellphones internet, whatsapp, etc. As a result, in this kind of relationship, people have close communications, so their willing become convergence. Actually, I am agree with above notion, due to third reasons; I will explain them in the following.",
        "Golobalization causes mankind needs similar goods, called acommoditties. First of all, this necessity is sensed disparate goods should be available, anywhere in the world. For instance, nowadays we can find apple cellphone in each country, worldwide or we can probe Indian customs in Newyork strrets. Secondly, different import and export companies can develop the economic situation of their country by exchanging domestic productions. For example, durring corona pandemic, the cinopharm vaccine export from china to other countries. Thirdly, not only does the economy of countries enhance, but it also make a lot of job opportunities for local inhabitats. While, the economic circumstance of a country augment, the life level of its residents are also ameliorated. So these reasons cause similarity between various country be pleasant.",
        "However, some folks think it is better that each country uses its domestic productions and avoid forieng kinds. I reckon, if a country only utilizes its national kinds, likely, its procedures, will not have any international competator, and in this way they hardly increase the quality of their commoditties, or may be offer their productions more expensive than the actual worth, thus this manner may not be userfriendly.",
        "To conclude, I feel any evolution activity has pleasant and unpleasant sides, but in this issue the merits of the topic is outperform to its disadvantages."
