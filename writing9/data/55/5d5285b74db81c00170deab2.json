        "It is increasingly common that young people tend to spend more time with their friends than their families. This essay will first discuss that technology and internet are the main causes behind this trend, and parents can set family rules to maintain a specific time for a family gathering and educating people the importance of it.",
        "The main cause associated with this trend is that internet and social media are increasingly taking over young people's life. This is to say, young grown-ups are now digital natives, and they are more knowledgeable about the latest topics and trends that their parents might have never heard about before. This has created a gap between both generations, as the younger ones have distinct hobbies and interests that are highly unlikely to be discussed or understood by their parents. A survey done by Google concluded that 85% of younger generations are more likely to socialize with their mates online than to talking to their ken members.",
        "To tackle this problem, parents should set rules to compel their children to dedicate a certain time with them. This could be by adopting a family day, when all the family member gather to chat about important family decisions or have fun. This kind of practice will educate young adults the value of this gathering time, which will strengthen their ponds. For instance, this initiative was done in a small town in Egypt and has resulted in upbringing rounded individuals ready to practice this with their children.",
        "In conclusion, social media and technology are the main reason of depriving the interaction between young people and their kins; and therefore parents should find a middle ground to oblige their children to spend a valuable time actively interacting with their parent by dedicating a certain time for a family gathering"
