        "Computers these days play a very important role in everyday life ,especially for working professionals. The use of computers among children would prove positive as it would make them more familiar with the most commonly used machine and simultaneously develop their cognitive skills. Although, there could be negative effects too like being less socially active, and not indulging in outdoor activities which may also lead to risk strain injuries. However, I would disagree that using a computer every day has more negative effects than positive effects on children.",
        "Early adaption of using computers will enhance the computing skills of children. Firstly, typing speed will increase which enables them to write their letters or assignments efficiently. Children will get more familiar with search engines and how to use them effectively. Children are quick learners and adaptation in early age to use software like word processors, spreadsheets and slideshows will become their second nature.",
        "Children will also use computers for entertainment purposes. They obviously will be tilted to waste a lot of their time playing computer games. However, parents can provide them with educational games and educational videos. Playing strategy games also improves their logical skill. Online games develop a sense of competitive spirit among children.",
        "Computers can also have some negative effects like addiction to live streams of videos, risk strain injuries due to excessive use or children can accidentally view the adult sites. However, these can be controlled through parental lock features or computers to be used under parents\u2019 supervision. Children may get addicted to games and do not spend enough time in studies or the children may avoid doing physical activities altogether. Nonetheless, these can be resolved through scheduling usage time and activating parental control features.",
        "My father provided me with a computer at a young age. I used many educational games like car driving simulation games. Such games not only taught me the ABC of driving but also the safety rules for the road. Also, I've got a phenomenal typing speed of over 100 words per minute. I learned typing at the tender age of 10 by using software such as typing tutor and playing typing games. This exceptional typing speed not only helped me to excel in school, college and university life but even at my workplace. As I used to finish my assignments and reports efficiently and effectively.",
        "In my ,opinion there would be both positive and negative effects on the children to use the computer in everyday life but in my own personal ,experience positive effects outweigh the negative effects."
