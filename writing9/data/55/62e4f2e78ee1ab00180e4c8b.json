        "There is no doubt that car crush is the worst thing in the roads. There are many people who think asking driving test every year is the best way to make road transport safety. I completely agree with this statement and in this ,essay I will support my view with examples.",
        "To begin with, I will explain why people need to take a driving test every year, that because of  a certain degree of society using cars with  alcohol and sometimes very fast .To illustrate, in Turkey half of the traffic penalties are because of driving with alcohol. In addition, some countries are not detected traffic , that is the second thing  why I am positive about that thing.",
        "To continue with, In some countries driving license checks are very less despite  that, teenagers are using cars without having a driver's license. For instance, a group of juveniles used cars without having a driver's license and they were crushed by another vehicle. Moreover, big vehicles such as trucks are very hard to use and need more attention than car which is a basic form , although of this drivers are not using as I said. In other words, if we can not fix that problem that mean we need to make  real a driving test each year.",
        "All in all, what can be concluded from aforementioned remarks is that although some individuals advocate, I strongly believe taking a driving test every year is the best option for making roads safe."
