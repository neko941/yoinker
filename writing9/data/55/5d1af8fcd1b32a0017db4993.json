        "It is often believe that plastic shopping bags have a negative effect on the environment by increasing the rate of pollution not only on land but also the sea, therefore some people think that plastic bags should be banned. I completely agree with this opinion and believe that the government should should start gradually prohibit using those bags for shopping purposes.",
        "Firstly, it is a common fact that plastic bags are non-biodegradable. In other words, it might take up to hundred years for them to decompose and turn to pisces. Consequently, once the plastic bags are burried or thrown into the ocean most of wild animals will eat them causing major issues and might lead to death. For instance, a turtle may get mistaken between a transparent plastic bag and a jelly fish and eat the bag where to turtle choke and even die painfully.",
        "Secondly, some countries decide to burn the plastic bags rather than burying them, which is definitely not a solution. To state it in other words, burning plastic shopping bags increase the toxible substances in the air, which will definitely result to a gradual development of deadly diseases such as cancer to people inhaling this toxic air frequently. This fact is evidenced by the statistics published in orient news where it is stated that seventy percent of people dying from lung cancer are either living or working in locations near factories designated to burn plastic substances.",
        "In conclusion, I strongly believe that banning the usage of plastic bags is more beneficial and advantageous act to the environment in every aspect, in addition to the health of the society."
