        "Nowadays, environment issues  are the a trending topic in debate all around the world, especially the unexpected change in climate. A major  of people suggest that everyone should take actions to hold back the pace of change, while others argue that the responsibility goes to government and big firms . In my point of view, the best way to turn the situation over requires the intervention of all citizens and governments, as well as large companies.",
        "On the first hand, governmental tools and international bussiness  actions  definitely have massive effectiveness on such a global phenomenon.  We can see in this example, if a company adjust the its waste disposal method to be more ecofriendly, the local environment will witness an immidiate  positive difference. In another case, when a nation invests in the  modernization of agriculture and plant system, this absolutely benefits the nationwide air quality. Besides, proponents of this view claim that governments\u2019 ignorance and bussinesses \u2019 irresponsibility are the main reasons that lead to the destruction of climate, that is why their responses to the problem are important.",
        "On the other hand, individual involvement also plays an crucial role in solving the atmosphere issue. Because one action can spread to others and create more participants. There are seven billion people in the world, if everyone has the environmentally-friendly attitude in the way they dispose of trash, the mount of water they use and modify their bad behaviors such as using plastic bag,\u2026 then we would be giving the climate problem a massive boost.",
        "Taking both points into consideration, I believe that government and big enterprises combined with every citizen should all take part in the process of preventing the climate destruction as we all have to take responsibility for the catastrophe."
