        "Providing good education to all its citizens is the basic duty of every government. Government funding to private educational institutions is a hotly debated topic. This essay will discuss that government funding should only be provided to public schools as they serve marginal communities and often governments themselves are restricted for funds.",
        "Public schools often serve communities that can\u2019t afford education and these organisations need to be supported by the federal agencies. While private schools are located in well to do areas, public schools strategically focus on deprived classes of the society and bring education to them. In countries like India, public schools mainly focus on underprivileged caste and religious classes that can\u2019t pay fees for the private schools. Thus government should strongly support public education system as they serve the social needs.",
        "Even though governments may want to support private organisations to enhance their facilities, its financial resources are seldom constrained. In many countries governments have more priorities to take care compared to the resources available to them. For example, in developing countries like India, governments often struggle to meet the salaries of public school teachers, leave alone the support for private schools. Can nations with such limited resources fund already revenue generating private schools?",
        "To sum it up, Government grants are an important aspect to improve the education system. For governments that are financially constrained, taking care of the public schools should be their primary responsibility, as these schools serve the large national goals in education. The funding for private schools should only be considered when all the needs of public schools be taken care."
