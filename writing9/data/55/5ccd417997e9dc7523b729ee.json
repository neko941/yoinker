        "Years back, marrying before the age of thirty was the trend but these days, people are now marrying at thirty years and above. This, I feel, is a welcome development as supported by the reasons that would be discussed below.",
        "The first reason why I support people marrying in their thirties is because marriage requires maturity and life experiences are what builds this maturity in a person. Therefore, one has to give sometime to gain experiences in dealing with people, especially the opposite sex before venturing into marriage. For example, my elder brother married at twenty five while the wife was twenty one. Five years into the marriage, they got divorced. It was obvious they lacked the maturity needed in marriage as there was always conflict in their home which they failed to resolve maturely.",
        "A second reason why it is good to marry at above thirty is financial and mental stability, a vital ingredient of a successful marriage. The couple has to be financially ready to handle the responsibility that comes with marriage and at the same time, be mentally ready. Being married comes with bills to pay, school fees for the children, clothing, feeding and so on. This financial stability is likely to be achieved at age thirty and above considering the years the person has to invest in schooling.",
        "My final reason for supporting people getting married in their thirties is that it gives them time to achieve goals and milestones, which creates a sense of fulfilment, before getting married. A lot of people find that when they get married, they are not able to achieve most of their dreams anymore because of the responsibility that comes with marriage and as such lacks fulfilment in life. I, for instance, enrolled for a PhD program while single. Then marriage happened when I was twenty five, followed by pregnancy and subsequently babies. I could not continue the program because I needed time to take care of the children as my husband was always busy. Had I waited, I would have been able to complete the program, get married afterwards, and feel a better sense of achievement.",
        "In conclusion, marriage at thirty and above should be encouraged because of the reasons discussed in this essay."
