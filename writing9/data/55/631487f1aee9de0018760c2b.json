        "For as today the world facing problems of insufficient foodstuff, and many countries try to fix the problem by finding other food to substitute. The scientists think they can find the solution for deficiency of food by doing much research and trying to produce psuedomeat which has been eaten in some countries already. Some said artificial meat is not real and can't alternate the fresh meat so they prefer to eat other products instead.",
        "In my country, local people eat almost products they can find. This is because in urban areas, the income for capital is low and meat in the market is high recently so they find meat in their areas such as dogs, frogs, and geckos including insects. You can buy fried insects in the local market. As the fact said the protein from insects is higher than from other meat compare to the same weight. which is a benefit to us that we can consume food with a small amount but we get the high energy from them and paid in small money. Some people don't dare to try insects either. There was news saying that people eat insect and were dead from the poison or some contaminated element inside insects. I think insects should be editable to eat if their species has been researched and has proved that can be eaten. Insects that are not illegal to eat and are found selling on the market should be punished.",
        "Most of all people should keep watching the news and always read the research for our own good  ourselves."
