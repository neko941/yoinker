        "Does curfew will prevent young people from becoming either perpetrators or victims of nighttime crime? In recent  times curfew have been imposed is some states from the US , this means that under no circunstances are teenagers allowed to be in streets after certain time at night, there is no doubt in my mind that imposing curfew  have its positive consequences but at the same time there are some negative points that need to be mentioned.",
        "Firstly , although imposing curfew have their possitive consequences such as preventing teenagers from being robbed , kidnapped or getting drugs and so forth in easy way   there is no  guarantee that all these risks could be avoided, it should no be forgotten that a large number of crimes are commited during the day, young people can get drugs at school easily and kidnappers do not hesitate when they have an opportunity whatever hour. For instance, in past years  there have sadly been some gun shoots at schools and those attacks were during morning hours.Unfortunately, those incidents can not be prevented with curfew.",
        "Secondly, if in all cities time limit were impossed to teenagers they would started to live with fear regardless if their city was secure or not. For example, recent survey indicates that the a large number of teenager are feeling more insecure than before due to the fact that they tend to believed that they are living like a movie story where no one can leave their houses after 10:00pm because there some extrange creatures looking for people to eat and they tend to believe that protection is needed , a gun or something that can be useful for fight against those creatures. Hence, this is a huge disadvantage because teenagers are tought to be protected and consequently they believe that need a gun.",
        "To sum up, on balance I tend to believe that where time limit is impossed teenagers  could no get drugs or could be robbed easily  but in someway they start to live with more fear and imaging things that inevitably are watched on TV or videogames thus, more guns are demanded. But,"
