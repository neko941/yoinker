        "One measure that can evaluate the economic prosperity in many nations is that a considerable amount of time is devoted to their working hours and allocating long hours to working affairs can lead to have better economic growth compared with countries having short working hours. I definitely agree with this opinion, and will give my reasons.",
        "Considering productivity at work is a more accurate estimating way for an economic expansion compared to long average working hours. Since the concentration of staff can be interrupted by some destructive causes and their working time can be occupied by them, this wasted time can be calculated with their working hours. For instance, workers connect to net to seek for their working issues abruptly the notification of social media can absorb their attention. If some effective measures are utilized in working atmosphere, employees will be prohibited to spend their time on inefficient activities at work. Take practical application  can be installed on their computer which can record their loggings on computer at working hours as an example; These critical information can be reported to their boss. Boosting concentration at work, hence, can play a crucial rule in intensity of efficiency and ultimately can bring about economic development.",
        "Although spending a significant amount of time in office community can assist staff to embark the experience of expert employees in their work, their either education or capability must adapt to their duties in working atmosphere. If the workers did not have sufficient knowledge to solve the problem related to their working affairs, a long period of working hours would be allocated for seeking the solutions. Since they wanted to enlighten their mind to acquire sophistication that is mandatory for their working affairs at working hours, these time would be added to average working hours. Admin of networks of computers, for instance, is graduated in math and have not sufficient knowledge in the field of networking, so a striking portion of time in working hours must be spent to acquire related knowledge. Thus, each working position must be filled by a specialist which his competencies match with it.",
        "In conclusion, in my perspective working hours whether long or short cannot be considered as an estimating of economic prosperity."
