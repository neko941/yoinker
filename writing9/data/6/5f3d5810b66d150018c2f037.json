        "In a highly competitive world, people spend a great deal of time working in their hectic life which results in a lack of time spent for family and friends. This essay will discuss some primary causes and consequences of this pressing problem.",
        "To commence with, excessively allocating a significant amount of time for working can be attributed to a host of fundamental reasons. The first reason is that, due to the globalized world, the majority of companies face competition in the market. The relevant fact for this circumstance is that in order to complete more projects or in case of surpassing competitors, almost all employees in global companies were forced to work overtime, resulting in the decrease of time for the families and communities as a whole by meeting deadlines as well as becoming an excellent worker. The second reason is that due to the expense of the family that has been rising on a daily basis, there is a need for individuals to spend more time in the workplace in terms of earning sufficient income to afford all basic needs. According to some digital sources of reliable information, more people who work more than eight hours day-by-day can not satisfy the basic need and run their family. By consistently needing to work more, most of the people lacking the time for families and society",
        "Extended hours of work can bring a variety of serious consequences for family and communities as a whole. On the community level, busy working schedules can prevent people from having meals and taking a trip with friends. As a result, the relationships among peers can become gradually weakened due to the deficiency in time spent with each other. On the family level, long working hours have significantly affected the divorce rate. This has been proved by that many young couples chose to focus on their careers and have less time for their spouse. As a predictable result, both of them lack proper communication and relationships which are crucial for maintaining a happy and healthy relationship.",
        "In conclusion, there are various factors contributing to the issue of spending extended hours for work and leading to negative consequences on many aspects as I mentioned above."
