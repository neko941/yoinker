        "Over the years, technology has played a prominent role in making informed automated decisions for various spheres of livelihood. There's an ongoing argument that some people think robots are important to the human future while others think robots have a negative effect on society. This essay will take an exhaustive look at both views and conclude with my opinion.",
        "Robots are important to human features because of the reduction of the cost of human labor it will offer. Many organizations will reduce the usage of human resources and wages/salaries being paid in carrying out various job functions because of the digitalization and automation being offered by robots. For instance, for construction companies construction at the site will no longer be done by various human beings but rather done by an automated creature that will be built based on the role needed to be performed by it. Robots, undeniably will make work easier for different entities on the planet earth and save the necessary cost.",
        "On the other hand, robots will lead to so many unemployed human beings on planet earth. Many human resources will become unemployed due to the fact that the necessary functions to be carried out by human beings are being done by an automated resource. For instance, chefs in a restaurant will no longer have to cook or prepare a meal for any guest, this will be done by a robot once an authorization is given which may lead to complexity. Undoubtedly, robots will make a person less active and unemployed on planet earth.",
        "Conclusively, robots will make life easy for various individuals especially the business owner, and also make so many individuals jobless in society because of the alternative given to carry out their various job functionalities. However, it is invariably safe to say that robots are the future of society, especially because the world is embracing technology and its offerings which have helped in the automation of various business processes and its portfolio."
