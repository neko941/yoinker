        "Many people believe that technological advancements have shrunk the world, and people more tend to be like each other in manifold aspects. However, others opine that people will forget their culture and traditions due to internationalisation. In my opinion, integration of different nationalities is paramount for growth and development.",
        "It has been seen that some people believe that international assimilation will lead to extinction of their cultural roots, because by adapting foreign culture and values, people will tend to lose their own self. To illustrate, in developing countries, it is often seen that people follow the footsteps of western people, as they feel that this would elevate their status in the society. Rather than using their own local products, they are keen on using foreign products, and niche international brands.",
        "Nonetheless, there is a segment of society who believe that worldwide integration is pivotal for a progressive nation. No nation can progress in isolation, by establishing international ties, there will be increase in job prospects and thus lead to stable economy. The old language and trade barriers will be vanished and thus, open the window for wider opportunities. For instance, multitude of social media platforms and affordable air flights have connected the world and therefore, opened the avenues for communication and business.",
        "To conclude, although exponential penetration of social media has various disadvantages, it is still essential in the development and advancement of different countries by interconnecting them and lessen the physical distance, since no society can thrive in isolation."
