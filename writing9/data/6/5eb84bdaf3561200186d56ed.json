        "The dilemma of housing thousand of people is becoming far serious uphill among the society which gradually increase all over the word. one of the most  challenging obstacles which the greater number of countries have to deal with is the problem of providing sufficient accommodation for the in progress figures. While the  impact of overcrowded positions on the habitat should be taken to account.",
        "Accommodating the population has its own  disadvantages, in one hand, it has devastind impact on the environment, with the increase in the birth,  the inquire for having house will raise, meanwhile a majority of trees should be cut to meet such needs,cutting the trees will erode the soil and deteriorate its quality, for the long run, this area will no longer be fatalities.those area include metropolises such as New York where was pristine. And, by the time the consequence will be irreversible.one practical solution for such uphill is to urbanize  remote locations. In this case not only the deserted territories will decrease, but also by planting trees the soil content will improve.",
        "In addition, the increase the vast number of placing people is interacting with the raise in the garbage, the request for producing huge amount of  product, for instance the medical substance will advance. as a result, the difficulty in whether recycling or burning the disposal substance will be another challenge for government and the environment,  the best way is to decline the plastic goods to 100% recyclable one. But then again, it couldn't reach the expected result. Since, approaching such goal take time and financial effort. I consider,  birth rate control is the most effective way in both baking hosing supply  and protect the Forrest.",
        "To sum up, although providing a suitable house for the numbers with assent trend is an execrable dilemma.,we should know that every cloud has a silver lining, so by urbanize the suburbs and remoted zone and impose a practical politics in sneezing the birth delivery this difficulty could be passed."
