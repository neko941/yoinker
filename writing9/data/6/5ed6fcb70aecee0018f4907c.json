        "Nowadays, society of certain nations holds a  quite low number  of young adults  compared with the amount of the elder ones. This essay will discuss if the advantages of having a good proportion of young adults amongst the population are more important than its disadvantages.",
        "",
        "On the one hand, it can be considered that young adults represent the main workforce in countries, filling most of the jobs available in the market. This certainly impacts positively the economy as there are less chances of having labour shortages, helping to sustain a productive and healthy economy. Canada, for example,  has a relatively high proportion of young adults actively working,  which has helped to accomplish one of the most stable economies in the globe.",
        "",
        "On  the other hand, young adults are not as experienced as elder people and this can constitute a risk since wisdom can trace a very clear line between good and bad decisions, especially considering it in a political scale. For example, Argentina is known to have one of the youngest  ministers in the world, which comprises 25 people under 45 years. This has taken a toll on different levels, such as wrong political determinations such as the agreement between private equity funds and the government, which led to default in 1990, 2001, 2018 y 2020.",
        "",
        "To conclude, although it is important to have experienced people with good judgement and sense, it cannot be denied  that maintaining a healthy and productive society through work is vital. and this, without any doubt, outwheights the former,"
