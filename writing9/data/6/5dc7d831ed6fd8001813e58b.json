        "The graph depicts the fact of worker's or employee's taking different modes of transport to commute between home to work in the year 2009.Comparing the data with London workers separately creates a distinct visualisation for the user to analyse the fact of daily office commute of different work group.",
        "London is one of the busiest cities as we depicts from the graph with 15% of the people are taking over an hour of travel time to reach to their work place.With only close to 18% of the workers are taking less than 15mins.Further drilling down, we are about to deduce that workers are leaving in farther areas from work locations.Other parts of the UK the work place are either equally distributed over the cities or employee are finding cheaper rate houses nearer to their work place.Being expensive in London, workers prefer to stay a little farther from the work place.",
        "Mode of commute generally employee's prefers a car, might be the reason for a higher travel time in London as 35% of the employee prefer to commute by car.Most minimal is by bicycle, only 2% of them prefer.If we try to lessen the percentage the car used by workers & allow them to use public transports like bus, train and underground, then there is a high potential of reducing of commute time in London, whereas in the rest parts of the UK most that is 79% prefer a car, but due to lower rates and equal distribution of work office location around the cities making it a suitable place to live in.",
        "Concluding with the fact the most of them prefer their own transport to commute between work and office, which make it difficult in London to reduce the traffic time, but cheaper house accommodation and distributed work location can make life easier in London."
