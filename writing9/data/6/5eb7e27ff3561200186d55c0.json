        "The problem of space\u2019s development squander has recently aroused wide concern among various circles. Some people believe that space exploration is wasting a lot of society\u2019s resources because this action is not related to citizen\u2019s life; Others believe that space development can beneficial to society because it may have a lot of auxiliary impacts. Considering both sides of the argument, I totally disagree that the times of space exploration needs to be reduced because of creating some job\u2019s position and seeking other resource.",
        "Of all the reasons why space exploration is beneficial to society, the most important one is that these actions can help to create a lot of job positions. The rationale behind is that these missions need an abundance of manpower to achieve. As an example, the spacecraft may need a lot of scientists to design. In this way, the employment rate can be increased. Without these missions, a lot of specialists may hard to get employment in somewhere.",
        "It should also be noted that space exploration can benefit to humans. On the grounds that these missions may help to create a lot of auxiliary products. For instance, the pencil is an auxiliary product that came from space exploration. In this manner, people are easily to writing then ancient times. Without space exploration, people may not get a benefit on writing handy.",
        "Some people may argue that missions to explore space is wasting the natural resource. This, however, is not true. There are many examples that these missions are seeking more resources to the people from the space. Moreover, the earth\u2019s resources are not infinite, people may need to find more resources to the earth for the future. These reasons eliminate the concern of the resource\u2019s squander.",
        "All in all, it is reasonable to conclude that missions to explore space can create a lot of job positions and may help to solve the problem in the earth\u2019s resources. Taking everything into consideration, I believe that the number of these missions does not need to be reduced."
