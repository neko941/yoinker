Unfortunately, such development is not good for children. In the young age it is often hard to keep their attention on education, since they have laptops or phones with the Internet access. Take the case of Europe, for example. In 2017 german scientists conducted a research and revealed that schools where were allowed to bring devices inside became the worst in regions.",
        "However, there are benefits that people are capable to find any films or games on their gadgets.

Moreover, not only do devices assist to spend time, but also they suggest a good way for education. Currently, there are a lot of training games and films, which persons can find online.

Thus, people are really capable to study, using their tablet computers, laptops or smartphones.",
        "To conclude, taking everything into account, the disadvantages of such phenomenon are real, but the benefits above outweigh the drawbacks. Our world and society have been developing extremely fast and people should use technologies effectively."
