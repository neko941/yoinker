        "Every citizen has the responsibility to pay taxes for the wellness of their country. People argue  that paying taxes is a sufficient contribution. While others believe that a person has much more duty despite  only pay taxes.",
        "Many people think that only submit the tax to the government is enough for them. The predominant reason for this thinking is that most of the countries are collected a large amount of taxes from their residential. People work day and night to get a standard life for themself and for their family. They give taxes from their salary to the government according to their law. In spite of this, they also pay taxes on grocery, clothes, and many more products. From these taxes, the government utilize for the welfare of the society. For example, every country needs a maintenance such as roads, building, employment and also does some community works for the who are unable to do work, for sick people.",
        "Others, however, including myself, believe that people responsibility is more than just only paying taxes. A person should do some community work for  society. This will help other people and motivate  others to do the same thing. In addition to this, it will create a good relationship with the community. To illustrate my point, in the city, many NGO's and charity workers  helps the needy people. A reliable person should join them and contribute to this charity work.",
        "To conclude, running the country is not an easy task. It needs a contribution of all the citizen in every field. People pay taxes to the government which they use for the citizen of their country. However, people should look after each other in spite of paying taxes only."
