        "These days, in certain countries, they construct a new law about prohibition of child labour, this law enacted that any individuals who is below 16 are not allowed to join the full-time workforce, and this approach might be remunerative for a nation. Thus, I will discuss the objective via further explanation.",
        "Firstly, it\u2019s a fatuous decision to join a full-time vocation in lieu of education. Many folks of Nigeria are inception the movement and revolt against government to modify the law. But, in this matter, the nation\u2019s decision should be judged wisely because it\u2019s a thing about education. For instance, if someone do full-time work and not focus on studies, it can be form a misery for him and also for his household members in future. It\u2019s a disadvantageous for the nation. In addition, an employer can allure folks with their fascinated advertisement skills. They could disburse fewer wages to the minor and give extra work.",
        "Secondly, education is integral part of everyone\u2019s fortune. Cognitive skills & ability to tackle any issues are coming from studies. For example, when one obtains a degree in a particular field, he can easily get his favourable work in a certain sector and he can perceive the significance of inculcation. If one\u2019s m\u00e9nage is suffering from financial crisis, he can support them via doing part-time job, but leaving education behind to do a full-time job, it\u2019s a stupidity. It can be harmful for your fate.",
        "Finally, I totally assent with the objective. It's a good thing to gain education. The Government should tighten the law via some preventive measures. It can be beneficial for students and for their kith and kin."
