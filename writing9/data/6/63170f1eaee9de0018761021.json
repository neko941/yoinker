        "Currently , online classes are increasing rapidly rather than in the past , due to the advanced technology , therefore this essay illustrates the advantage and the disadvantage of the statement.",
        "First of all , it is time-saving activity , owing to students can learn any time  , whenever they want to study or have spare time at that time they watch it , For example, a plethora of pupils work with study so that  manage their schedule. Moreover , its fees are lower than the coaching centre, therefore students give opportunities first to learn from there , For instance , a survey suggests that classes take far more fees than online education , consequently , everyone left it and wants to study online.",
        "On the other hand , pupils become lazier and during a lecture , they do not attend it but play games on devices , which impacts  their study , For instance , thousands of people west their time on a particular game , consequently , it will destroy their future and increases the rate of unemployment. Furthermore , they do not get  amazing feedback from online education , due to the thousands of students learning there , For example , there is a lot of difference between them , in addition , live and recorded are different and we all know about.",
        "In Conclusion , I think that offline is far better than online , due to the above reasons , on the contrary , it is very useful for pupils , whose parents are not able to pay thousands of capital on education."
