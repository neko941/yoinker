        "Some people believe that we should help our society rather than other countries and communities, when we have too many people who need help and support. I partly agree with this view, because I believe that helping people is the most important issue among different countries.",
        "On the one hand, there are alot of people who live in each country that need help. You can see that disadvantaged and impoverished people in every societies, even in the wealthiest countries. These people may be not have any food or clothes and the rich can support them easily. For example, by donating this food or clothing we can solve the initial poor's need. People can also spend a little amount on this problems to charities.",
        "On the other hand, I believe that boundaries should not be an obstacle for helping poor people all over the world. In my opinion, in some countries may be exist some individuals who need the simplest things such as pure and clean water or even food. For instance, in African countries children suffer from curable diseases or they have malnourish. It is clear that we should priorities our people and our society, but in these cases we can help people beyond our borders with donating some money to international charities in order to solve such simple problems.",
        "In conclusion, I believe that we should support everyone who needs help whether they are our fellow citizens or they live in other places over the world and even in our neighbourhood."
