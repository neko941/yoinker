        "Dear Sir,",
        "I am writing to cite my concern over the recent cancellation of work placement programme which was earlier part of Business English course. I am currently studying Business English in your school. One of the major reasons for opting for this field was its placement programme. However, I was informed in our last faculty meeting that this programm has been cancelled.",
        "I would like to draw your attention to the grave issues associated with cancellation of this well designed program.  This program was planned to equip students with practical experience through placements in esteemed organizations. Absence of such initiatives will result in breeding a generation of students devoid of market exposure.",
        "Upon inquiring from administration office about the reason of this cancellation, I was informed that student attendance was marginal. To address this worrying problem, I would request you to keep the program open for students desirous of availing such opportunities. This step will not only ensure that attendance is up to the mark but will also give us a chance to explore the market trends and polish our skills by learning from the industry experts.",
        "Your kind consideration over this important matter will be highly appreciated.",
        "Yours sincerely,",
