As I know this long free time is a unique opportunity, I've decided to travel for random destinations around Brazil.",
        "The journey will begin in Fortaleza, which I'll stay for two nights in an astonishing hostel. Then, I'm planning to ride a cheap car to start driving all over the Northeast coast of the country. The stops will include Natal, Recife, and the priceless city Maceio.  The entire journey must last for fifteen days, finishing in Salvador, where I'll take a direct flight to Vancouver.",
        "Because you've once told to me a huge fan of soccer as well as the mind weather of the place, I thought that would be a great idea inviting you to go with me. Besides, you are such a lovely person to be around; our last experience traveling together was memorable, and I'd love having it again.",
