        "It has been a dream of mine as a teenager to continue my studies abroad where I can live freely and independently. I have believed that the quality of education available abroad has always been above standard and the calibre of students that the international schools have produced are exemplary.",
        "If given an opportunity, I would work hard and save for my children\u2019s education so that they will be able to gain experience and learning outside our current environment\u2019s norm. The learning and quality of education are just few of the factors that they could benefit from but the main contributor that I consider is being able to live independently. Having a life away from their comfort zone will allow them to grow as an individual and discover the extent of their capabilities alone by not relying on the things that they can easily get from home. Experience has always been my greatest teacher and I want my children to create and learn from their own experience without being complaisant that they will have someone to back them up as I want them to be responsible for all their actions and decisions.",
        "The outcome of sending my children to continue their education abroad will not only give benefit to them as a person, but also to the community that they are involved in. Though living abroad could also entail cultural influences and a change of perspective in life, but I believe that a child\u2019s foundation of values will always be with the child wherever path he takes. Unavoidable circumstances may take place, but I always put my trust and faith in God that his protection and goodness will be with my children wherever they go."
