        "Some people believe that to excel in sports it is essential to have a strong physical body, however, others opine that the most essential part is to have a mental composer. In my opinion, although, physical strength gives an upper hand but, in the long run only mental stability matters. In this essay, I will examine both of the aspects.",
        "On one hand, some of the sport requires physical strength and big muscles, such as weight lifting, javelin throw, and shot put. Having a strong physical structure is an advantage, however, it demands more maintenance and hard work. For example, the great khaali, a famous WWE player revealed that he has to take a lot of food which should contain a high level of protein(the intake of protein should be high) so that the muscles will not be degraded. Moreover,",
        "On the other hand, Physical strength does not matter if you don't have the good mental strengthstrength. Hard work and perspiration are the output of a mind that has great mental stability and to do well in sport it is very crucial to possess a stable mind. For instance, in a study, it was found that successful sportsmen have greater mental stability towards their goal. Furthermore, a person can achieve any goal if he is internally strong and works continuously for goal accomplishment.",
        "To encapsulate, to become good a sportsman, it requires more effort than having just a physical body, it may be an advantage but it is surely not the only criteria. Although, I believe having a calm and focused mental state is much more essential. Society should understand the importance of mental health which in turn creates a good mental strength."
