        "There has been a major shift in how people communicate with each other. Mobile phones and the internet play an integral role in day to day communication among people. \u00a0I believe that the benefits of this development outweigh the drawbacks.",
        "To start with, increase In the usage of mobile phones and internet for interaction among people has various merits. It helps us to communicate with loves ones who live miles apart.\u00a0For instance, these days, many people live in different countries or go travelling in different countries. Cell phones and the internet mean that parents can easily keep in touch with their children who are on holiday and people who immigrate to live abroad can easily communicate with their loved ones when needed. In addition to this, the internet means that people also interact with strangers and increase their knowledge of other cultures because through such things as Facebook, people connect to all sorts of people around the world, becoming friends and also discussing and exchanging knowledge.",
        "However, there are downsides to this. \u00a0Nowadays people may have become disconnected in relation to conversing with each other face-to-face. People now tend to use their\u00a0cell phones or the internet to communicate, but rather than actually speaking, they send a message. Some of the most popular applications are WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and Line, all of which encourage messaging. The result of this is that people may lack the benefits of engaging with others in conversation and the closeness this brings.",
        "In conclusion, \u00a0although a disadvantage of the internet and cell phones is the lack of face-to-face conversation, they have improved the way we can stay in contact with loved ones and exchange ideas with new people. Overall then, this is a positive development for society."
