        "People have different views about who should shoulder the responsibility for the maintenance and upgradation of road systems because of an increasing number of private cars used. While there are some benefits when car owners are responsible for road projects, I would argue that it is better if the government have liability for this spending.",
        "On the one hand, drivers should pay money for the improvement of road construction because of some advantages. Firstly, as individuals have to spend money on these projects, the demands for using car would reduce. That increases public transport usage instead of private car, which positively affects air and environment. If people do not have to cover these costs, it might cause the unlimited use of cars and serious pollution. Secondly, commuters could increase their awareness and responsibility for protecting road system. That decreases the number of damaged road.",
        "On the other hand, there are some reasons why the authority should take responsibility for this investment. The first clear reason is that residents have to pay taxes to the government, which allows them to have rights to access good infrastructures including transport network which are supported by the government. Another reason is that since the authority\u2019 liability is ensuring the lives of their residents; they should spend national budget on these constructions to serve to their dwellers\u2019 lives. Furthermore, the investment in road infrastructure requires the large amount of money which is beyond citizen\u2019s financial ability. Consequently, only the government could be responsible for such massive costs. For example, many country have to get foreign loans that need the government\u2019s commitment to invest in the enhancement of road systems",
        "In conclusion, while placing the responsibility of upgrading road systems for citizens is beneficial to some extent, I strongly believe that the government should be responsible for covering this disbursement."
