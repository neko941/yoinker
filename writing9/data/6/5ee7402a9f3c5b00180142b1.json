        "Never before have children been bombarded with an increasing amount of advertising which is often believed to have an adverse influence on them. In my opinion, playing on a child\u2019s vulnerability is immoral and inappropriate advertising should be banned, however, advertising can be sometimes beneficial and used for the benefit of children.",
        "When an advertisement targets children, it takes advantage of their inability to discern what is good for them. This is because young viewers believe in everything they see in commercials, not realizing the difference between the factitious presentation of goods and the reality. As such, being lured by these commercials, they pester their parents to buy absolutely unnecessary things. To illustrate, MacDonald adds low-quality toys to their Happy Meal packages to persuade children to eat these unhealthy snacks.",
        "However, social advertising can be used to foster children\u2019s wellbeing educating them about recycling or developing healthy habits. Social advertising strikes a chord in children\u2019s hearts, leaving children\u2019s think of environmental issues that are faced at present. Therefore, social commercials are part and parcel of nurturing an environmentally conscious generation and therefore very beneficial. To illustrate, having launched the promotion of sorting domestic waste aimed at a young audience, Norway has doubled its recycling rate.",
        "In conclusion, advertising can be used to educate children according to the challenges of today and should be encouraged so long as it is benefitting the child. Therefore, it is only a problem phenomenon if it fosters negative habits and behavior such as excessive consumerism."
