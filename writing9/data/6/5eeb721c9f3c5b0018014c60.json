        "In certain nations, people are getting heavier, unhealthier and more physically unfit. Firstly, this essay will discuss the sedentary lifestyle individuals now lead that has led to the above issues. Secondly, this essay will discuss a possible solution which aims at encouraging people to exercise more; followed by a reasoned conclusion.",
        "One principal cause as to why people are becoming more obese and unhealthier is due to their sedentary lifestyle. As more people now work office jobs, they spend most of their day working by their desk without much movement. There is then no way for these individuals to burn the calories they take in, leading to them gaining weight. For instance, the obesity rate in Singapore has increased over the last decade as more people land in white-collar jobs. Moreover, a staggering 1 in 3 Singaporeans is at risk of contracting diabetes due to the inactive lifestyle people are leading.",
        "The solution to address this should be targeted at encouraging people to work out. This can be done through giving monetary incentives to individuals who exercise, and setting achievable goals so they are more inclined to lead a healthier lifestyle. To address the problem of rising obesity rates in Singapore, the government has introduced the 10,000 Steps Challenge whereby anyone who clocks in 10,000 steps through their tracker can redeem shopping vouchers. This challenge has served to stop the obesity rates from rising.",
        "In conclusion, the main cause as to why people are getting more fat, unhealthier and more physically unfit is due to their current inactive lifestyle. To tackle this cause, incentives should be provided to encourage people to change their lifestyle for the better."
