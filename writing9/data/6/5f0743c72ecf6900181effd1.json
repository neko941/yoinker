        "It has become apparent in recent years that the extension of working long hours is being common than ever before. It is argued that the government should limit the working hours, due to an adverse impact on the employee\u2019s individual, their family as well as the community. In my opinion, I strongly agree with this statement.",
        "In the past, a person normally worked 8 hours per day. Average daily working nowadays, however, have increased significantly to ten or twenty hours. To the employees, this issue deeply effects their health, and the productive. Workers who are so immersed in their job have a tendency to live a high pressure and stressful life style. This situation rises a risk of suffering from physical as well as psychological problems, such as anxiety disorders or stroke. These illness lead to more sick leaves and low performances at work, and the low productivity. The workers, therefore, are likely to loose their opportunities to promote.",
        "The frequency of long working hours also has a negtive drawsback on the families and communities. When the employee spends a lot of time in their worlplace, the time for their family will be reduced. Thus, the relationship among the members are greatly weakened and the conflicts as well as the musunderstanding are likely to appear. In terms of the society, many studies pointed out that a person\u2019s productive and concentration in a day is limited. The workers, therefore, cannot pay attention to their job after working long hours and it affects tremedously to the company as well as society in generall. Besides, overworked people do not devote time to voluntary activities which brings benefits for the society.",
        "In conclusion, I strongly believe that the authorities should restricted the time of working because of its severe impact on employee, their family bonds, and their community."
