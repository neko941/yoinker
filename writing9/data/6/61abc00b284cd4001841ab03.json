        "some people  of the view that Cellphones are related to social,health and technical issues nowadays and they can take either of the forms.Although there are  benefits as well as drawbacks of everything.I am not agreed with the demerits of mobile over merits.through this ,essay we would conclude.",
        "To begin with the Sociological aspects of  telecom technology  we can see people using mobile in their every walk of life from chatting to watching youtube,web series to engrossing in social networks.there are several implications of this like the use of mobile phones  while driving can cause an accident. there are also some health and technical  related problems associated with the use of mobile phones as well as public use mobile while listening to music while commuting using  earlids ,due to prolonged usage  this may cause damage to the ability of ears and also cause accidental collisions.",
        "On the other ,hand Mobile technology has revolutionized the world as  the   distances have vanished and the world  is turning into a small village,nowadays anyone can interconnect with anybody can see his live on video,can know his current status.apart mobile users can watch movies on the web series app like Netflix and prime and can do online shopping through  commercial sites like amazon.Nowadays world  can get info and news within a bit of second. can deliver and receive messages,share data, pay bills and receive and make  payments instantly. cellulars   being handy can be  used for  multipurpose tasks.",
        "So I don't agree that mobile problems can outweigh its benefits and  in , the contrast would want to go in favour of its benefits which are quite a many times higher than its demerits."
