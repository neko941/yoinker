        "Exercise is making people healthy and fresh in their life. It makes them feel better. Working people devote less time to exercise. As a result, they have  health problems such as heart disease and obesity. This essay will discuss the reason behind this issue and how to manage it substantially.",
        "To begin, there are several reasons behind this and the major one is the sedentary lifestyle and getting tiredness after work. People Have to work hard for a long time to support their costs nowadays. Also, in some families ,usually everyone has to work on weekdays. Although  they work hard for a long time, they do not have physical activity  most days, they are behind their desk because there are many jobs that envelop by new technology such as pc in cyberspace. So, usually people are tired after their work and have rest. Moreover, digital devices have a strong influence on people's lifestyles. These devices are quite addictive and sometimestime, they spend lots of time on their social media or searching online. As a result, it leaves no time for them to do exercise.",
        "These problems can be solved with different measures. The most important is that employees have enough knowledge about the risks of physical inactivity. This information makes working people pay more attention to their health. In addition, Companies that force employees to work more than the allowed hours should be punished. the second one is that employers have to use fit and work methods for their employees. There are lots of methods  are designed for working people to have some useful exercise during their work to keep healthy. This practice takes a little time. For example, in this method, working people have to  walk for 5 min every  hour during their work time.",
        "To recap, there is no denying the fact that many working people get little or no exercise either during the working day or in their free time nowadays. In order to deal with this issue, Companies should provide more information about the risks of physical inactivity to their employees. Moreover, working people who cannot spend enough time on exercise should use fit and work methods."
