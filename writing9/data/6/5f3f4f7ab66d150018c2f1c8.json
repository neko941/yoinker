        "Air pollution is one the most dreaded man-made side effect to the environment. The combined effect industrialization and modernization have acted as a catalyst in the rise of air pollution. An increasing number of cars on the road, definitely is a major contributor to it and a car-free day can definitely alleviate some air-pollution, but there are various other ways also which could be more effective.",
        "As cars are one the largest contributors to air pollution, a day without them on the road, could help us see the difference in the environment, and also inspire people to use much more eco-friendly ways for their daily routines. Concurrently, a car-free day, will reduce a the carbon emission on that day. Although one day seems less, but small changes like this could help us transition towards better choices. For instance, many countries in Europe, use cycle as their main mode of transfer and it all started from a car-free day.",
        "On the other hand, people do like convenience in their lives, and cars have been a vital part of it. A single car-free day won't help us resolve air pollution and there are numerous other  way to solve the problem. In the capital of India, the government started an odd even plan, which allowed only odd numbered cars to run on odd dates and even numbered cars on even days, this resulted in improving the air-index quality by 30 percent. Also stricter laws on harmful emissions not only from cars, but also from industries, moving towards options that don't cause air pollution such as electricity could also be considered effective ways of resolving the problem.",
        "In conclusion, if a single car free day could make all the difference, we would have been in pollution controlled environment by now. But a car-free day can only act as a starting step and we need to look into much more effective and permanent solutions to reduce the pollution and to sustain that change."
