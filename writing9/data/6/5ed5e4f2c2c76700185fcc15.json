        "With the ever growing economic in this modern era, there are growing controversy over the outlooks and the quality of employees. Some people believe that employees should put more attention on their outlooks while some people believe that quality of work is far more important. In my opinion, work quality outweighs appearance.",
        "On the one hand, it is generally thought that first impression is essential. Since people tend to value someone\u2019s appearance rather than their capacity when they first met. Therefore, some company believes that having a good personal image and leaving a good impression for other are crucial because many jobs required to contact with clients and provide professional ideas for them. For instance, if a banker dress with a suit and tie the clients may have a sense of respectful and believe that the staff concern about he/she, and who is trustworthy and with professional skills.",
        "While, others believe that ability of a staff is more important since it is directly related to the profit of the company. It is true that, appearance cannot reflect one\u2019s ability. Even if one dress smartly, it does not represent his or her inner ability because people use their ability instead of appearance to provide quality of work. For instance, social workers handle the problems of the clients by their counselling skills but not their appearance. Moreover, no matter how the employees dress, only those who are with ability can finish the work productively and benefit the company.",
        "In conclusion, people believe that appearance is more important since leaving a first impression for the clients is important to the work, while some believe that one\u2019s capacity outweigh appearance as only those with capacity can provide quality of work and benefits the company. I believe that staff ability is more important in order to heighten the profits of the company and provide a good quality of service to the clients."
