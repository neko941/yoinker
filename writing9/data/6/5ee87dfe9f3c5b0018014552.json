        "It is true that use of computer becomes popular in educational fields. Some people think that this technology dives can bring more benefits to the school while others argue that this trend will become an unpredictable crisis. I believe that uses of computers are obviously essential for every student to practice it for educational purpose.",
        "On the one hand, some people think that computer can cause health problems because students are spending too much time on it. Some students are overused the computer to do their assignments and the result can cause of physical damage such short sight, back pain and headache. Most students are addicted to using Computer in order to have fun so they normally spend more time on it. Therefore, there are some benefits to use of computer but it also can cause negative results if we ever use it.",
        "On the other hand, Computer is essential that can use in a variety of educational research, such as doing assignment, present the presentations. Teachers can use it to present a diverse style of teaching and the class will be more interest that can attract those students to focus on the lesson. For example, in the past, most students felt bored in a history class because it is difficult to imagine what had happened in the past from the tutorial. Nowadays, teachers can use computer to do the presentation of present the historical images in order to attract student\u2019s interest on it. I believe use of computers is an unpreventable trend that going to change in the educational system and the result certainly brings more advantages to this field.",
        "In conclusion, although use of computers can cause some physical problems in our body, I believe that in educational field certainly have more advantages outweigh its disadvantages."
