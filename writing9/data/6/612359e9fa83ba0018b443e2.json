        "Nowadays, teachers  are struggling with students behaviour which has an impact on the school education system. This essay will examine the main cause of bad conduct from students and possible solutions to this problem.",
        "The two main causes of students bad behaviour are Poor home education from parents and a lack of relationships between students and teachers. Education is the key for oneself to survive in a society  which also has an impact on our behaviour. Our education determined who we are . Because based on  that, we make choices and decisions and also build our principles. Students who lack education from their parents learn from bad influences or from school .For ,example a student, whose parents main priority is work, gives less attention and spend less time with his child .This can push the child to get his attention elsewhere, like with friends, spend more time on the internet which can affect his behaviour. The second point is the lack of relationship between teachers and students. Students spend most of their time in school, that means  teachers also impact  their life  . A negative attitude from a teacher can push the student away. This can make the students to lack  confidence or to rebel because they are not treated as they wish. For example , a student who is always treated wrong gives a negative attitude.",
        "Some possible solutions to this problem is first, parents spending more time with their children. This will help parents to know more about the children behaviour. The way they think , the mistake they make and when to correct them , which also give  certain self-confidence to them. Secondly, teachers are to be good listeners and pay more attention to students. Some students face certain issues at home like  Parents divorcing , some are been raped and also morally abuse. Teachers who build a  strong relationship with their students can easily detect when their attitudes change. This can help the teacher to find out solutions in order to help his students to get him out of his situation.",
        "To conclude, our parents and teachers behaviour affected students lifestyles. Parents and teachers should pay more attention to students conduct to easily detect if there are been influenced positively or negatively."
