        "New modern technologies, especially mobile phones are invading our lives and impacting our lifestyle. While some people believe giving mobile phones to their children is advantageous, others trust the opposite. In this essay, I will discuss why it is beneficial to handle a cellular to a child, but after a certain age and following some restricted rules.",
        "",
        "These days, mobiles are simplifying many aspects of our daily lives, such as communication, search of information, shopping... In addition to many other services. Giving a cellular to a child will mainly improve his communication with his parents. Whenever they need, they can call and check on their children, thus relief any doubt or stress regarding their status. Another advantage is simplifying data acquirement. Whether it's for study purposes or for general knowledge, mobiles will help children to reach any needed information. To result, with no doubt, mobile phones simplify some daily tasks in children's routine.",
        "",
        "Moreover, mobile phones give access to its holder to much more serious information and may breach his personal data and private life. Children with such accessibility may read crime news or watch dangerous videos like 'MoMo' challenges or even can open access to any stranger to their personal data by clicking on spam links. The best solution is to define a minimum age to handle a mobile for teenagers with implementation of restricted rules on applications and accessible websites.",
        "",
        "Although handling a phone to an adolescent can facilitate some aspects of his daily life, this may also arise some serious problems. In my opinion, it's good to give a mobile phone to a child, but certainly after an age of fourteen and preferably with parental restrictions applied."
