        "In this era of globalisation,multinational companies play a vital role to enhance  job opportunities.Few masses presume that bigger multinational organisations gives advantages to the revenues of developing nations  while others assert that these corporations are negative effects.This essay shall delve into both perspectives before commenting on my opinion in subsequent paragraphs.",
        "On the one hand,there are a plethora of pros of large multinational companies to the developing nations.Firstly,it brings a lot of job opportunities to the younger generations.It influenced the youngsters by giving higher wages and promotions.As these organisations are famous worldwide and it boosts the economy of the country.For example-Tata is the largest multinational company in India and it also gains popularity in other countries by expanding its business.",
        "Secondly,these companies work for the welfare of the nation as well as by gaining experience of work in large multinational companies masses are able to establish their own business.It helps to flourish our nation as most folks are employed and there is less rate of unemployment.",
        "On the other hand,there are some negative effects of these organisations.Today,the competition increases so these companies attract more and more people to do jobs so employees are not ready to work in small scale industries.It affects the growth of global corporations.Moreover, due to advertisements and promotions of the products of huge companies people prefer to buy things from these corporations despite  price and quality.So it has a bad impact on the economy of that nation because people are not buying things from them and they are not earning  any profit.",
        "To encapsulate,in my ,opinion multinational companies provide employment opportunities to people and it helps to become developed ,however,people also need to work for small industries to boost their economy."
