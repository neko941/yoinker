        "Education plays a great role in an individual's life and people have the right to education. Some people think that  the public has the right to university education and the government should make it free of cost for all irrespective of student's financial background. I strongly disagree with this statement and I think that the authorities should help only poor children to complete their education. I will explain my reasons for it in the following paragraphs.",
        "To begin with, there are many reasons why the government should only offer free education for poor children education rather than rich people, this is because wealthy people have the capability to afford their education with expensive college fees but poor backward classes individuals cannot afford that education. Firstly, the government should help  poor children's education by providing scholarships and grants which help them to finish their university and college studies. For example, developed countries like Singapore and the USA offers fund and scholarships to their poor students to finish their education, which will also be beneficial for the country's growth.",
        "Furthermore, the government should offer free courses for lower backward class students who are eligible to study in prestigious universities but due to lack of financial support, they failed to admit to these colleges, so the authorities should only offer these students to finish their courses for free of cost. Also, it totally wastes  money if the government offer free study for rich children, this is because they can afford their education, so the authorities should help other people who are suffering from accommodation and food problems.",
        "To conclude, I think that the government should only provide free education for poor backward classes students rather than wealthy people, it will beneficial for the countries to develop their economic and education sectors more effectively."
