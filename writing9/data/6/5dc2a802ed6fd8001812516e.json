        "In recent years the government investing money for  development sports facilities. Even though some argue that this  amount should  be allocated for school sports centres,  Others think that general public and professionals must be benefited from this. In my opinion, I support the former\u2019s  viewpoint, because school children are the future.",
        "First of all, the school goers, who require to be trained properly with  various sporting activities, because they  would be  the future sports stars of the country. In other words, whatever training and practises they receive at very age have a long lasting  positive impacts on them. Since this creates an  interest towards in sporting activities among these groups,  they put an extra effort to master in. Currenty, many latest equipment and  technologies are developed  in this field that can be incorporated, otherwise, they may not be able to compete with others from different countries.",
        "Another point  is  taken into consideration is that  well established professionals have been not only  received a sufficient amount of training, but  they are successful in their career as well. Therefore, they have enough fund in their hands  to develop themselves. Next, regarding general public, they require more health care institutions than sports centres because people are suffering from many deadly diseases. By contrast, if the government constructs  sports facilities to both professionals and the general public,  children would be neglected, this can lead serious repercussion to the  country\u2019 sporting field.",
        "By way of conclusion, while several people consider building sports centres for sports  personals and the common people, I, personally, again reaffirm that children be trained with sports facilities, than anyone else."
