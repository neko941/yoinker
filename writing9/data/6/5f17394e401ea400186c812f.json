        "In the contemporary era, every character is busy in their work.Some expert thinks it is due to the latest technology and it effected on the relationship of the people.All the time they are busy on their mobile or computer.I think this has become a negative effect on the person's behaviour.I will discuss my opinion in subsequent paragraphs.Firstly, in the hectic life people are busy in their work and they have no time to meet with their friends and family member.for example, If a life is ill they have no time to  go their home to greeting to know about their health.They call on their number and ask about their health instead of going to physically.This a bad effect on the relationship.People feel lonely and they are going to in stress due to the other customer behaviour.They have no interest with other people, what they are doing in activity.Everybody makes his own rules and regulation of the heart.For example, in a home we have no idea what the other somebody is doing.Nowadays, people thinking are changed.They have no taken care the other body.ON the other hand, they meet the people on some occasion specially birthday parties and wedding ceremonies.The latest technology also reaction the domestic activity since husband and wife marriage effect this.Children have no idea about the importance of the affair.They make his own heart.Our new generations are very effected and their parents have no point to describe the important to other people.To recapitulate, I would like to say that the  latest technology is a negative impact on the human soul.AS a human being we care the other soul.We go to their home.We take a moment and visit the house of our relatives and make a strong marriage with each other."
