        "It is sometimes argued that students ought to be engaged in managing their schools. Although some might oppose this practice, personally, I do agree with such a scheme since students would reap immense personal benefits provided that they were allowed to make a contribution to their school programmes.",
        "The first reason why I do believe that students should be given an opportunity to manage their schools is rooted in the enormous impacts of such practice on their personality development. Having been involved in decision-making process at school, students would develop invaluable personality traits, positively affecting their adult life. Students, for example, would learn to bear the responsibility of negative consequences of their poor decisions; thereby, a sense of responsibility would be fostered in them.  They would also boost their assertiveness and absorb the significance of discipline in their lives.",
        "The other positive aspect of permitting pupils to decide for themselves is their higher awareness of the needs and interests of their age group compared to institute managers. Coming from a different generation, principals tend to overlook factors students are more passionate about. Therefore, by involving them in academy management, in particular when organizing institute programmes, principals could ensure that their interests are fully respected and taken into consideration.",
        "However, I do appreciate some might think differently, saying that so immature are students that they lack the ability to make wise decisions. They also feel that students would be distracted by management issues, potentially preventing them excelling in their lessons. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that students are not required to manage their schools independently, meaning that they can be supervised by teachers and principals to ensure resolving issues in the most constructive way possible. Furthermore, teaching, managing skills should not be regarded as a distraction, but a virtue in educational programmes, as the more able the children are to manage their surroundings, the more prepared they would be to succeed in their adult life.",
        "In conclusion, while I understand some might believe it is unwise to involve students in faculty management, I do believe that it is such a practice that would nurture positive personality traits in youngsters and ensure that institute programmes are tailored to the their requirements and desires."
