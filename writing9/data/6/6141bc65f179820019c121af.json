        "At the present time, a number of individuals prefer to work freelance than they used to work for a company or organization. As a result of working alone, we might feel happier and creative because they are no one interrupt us in working hours, while I believe that cooperating one another is the best method put yourself into society and make many good friends in our related work environment.",
        "On the one hand, the opponents of this view think that it will be invaluable time to be productive and will not waste time for anything apart from official work. Doing job at office, there are many people whom we know very well tend to ask questions about daily works and like to talk about life issues, which will be resulted in working hours even success. Take for example, in some Asian countries, many companies are ruled by state to work employees to themselves at home and office. As they work for continued long time, they eventually created great benefits. Moreover, most of them agree and say that if they had been worked for many hours, they would have spent unnecessary time.",
        "On the other hand, the world is changed as we develop technologies. Consequently, people are being isolated and separated from their loved ones. Moreover, if they live from the family, they might put themselves to suicide and depression. Although working from home has many advantages such as feel and understand ourselves more, this kind of a new habit brings us negative outcomes. For instance, during the pandemic, there were many people who selected to do work at home. However, after several months, there had been harmful incidents occurred when people were living at home alone. Therefore, many individuals are demanding that they will have more chances if they go outside and work with others.",
        "In conclusion, we know there are many possible ways to implement if we work alone. Nevertheless, we have to understand more that what will happen in the future without the people who work in the same workplace."
