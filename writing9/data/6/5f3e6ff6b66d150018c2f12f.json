        "Today, each and every child is at a risk of receiving poor education on account of television as it has become a primary source of information rather than books. I strongly, agree that a book is irreplacable and its in-depth knowledge can never be equated with information imparted via TV.",
        "Firstly, a TV has become mandatory in every household. Owing to that, children are exposed to it at such an extent that they are addicted towards cartoons, movies or other channels which then profusely distract them from studying and inculcating the habit of reading books comprehending them. Meanwhile, they are using the television as a primary source of information, consequently resulting in poor intellectual and holistic development of a child. In addition, studies have shown that 80% of children tend to  complete reading their school books in front of LED, just for the sake of grades, thereby they gain zero knowledge that leads them to become a less educated one.",
        "Secondly, I believe that a TV acts as an extra source of information to see visuals of biopics, documentaries, animals, languages etc.But only a book can give you in-depth knowledge of the subject. For instance, if a child wants to choose surgeon as a career, he will succeed in becoming one until he reads the relevant books and build a foundation of his chosen career, despite watching tons of surgery videos. In addition, only by watching tv,it is impossible to pass school and become an intellectual.",
        "Therefore, I agree to an extent that, television will always be pale in comparison to books with regards to providing quality education.Hence, in order to wane the effects of TV on a child, it is imperative to allocate strict watching hours by the parents."
