The current statistics, warning in the near future, space will be not enough for the human living on the earth. In this situation, most of the governments showing interest in research to check human living possibilities in other planets. But the research needs more money",
        "The main reasons for checking ways on other planets are Population increase, not enough resources on the earth for the future generation, increasing technology. Most of the countries taking like pride for their nation when they invent new things and this is most competitive everyone to invent new things. This is the most popular one in the current situation in all the countries.",
