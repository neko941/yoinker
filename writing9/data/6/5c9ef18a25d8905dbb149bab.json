        "People have differring views with regard to the question of how to make our road safer. In my view, both punishments and a range of other measures can be used together to promote better driving habits.",
        "On the one hand, strict punishments can certain help to encourage people to drive more safely. Penalties for dangerous drivers can act as a deterrent, meaning that people avoid repeating the same offence. There are various types of driving penalty, such as small fines, licence suspension, driver awareness courses, and even prison sentences. The aim of these punishments is to show dangerous drivers that their actions have negative concequences. As a result, we would hope that drivers become more disciplined and alert, and that they follow the rules more carefully.",
        "On the other hand, safe driving can be promoted in several different ways that do not punish drivers. Firstly, it is vitally important to educate people properly before they start to drive, and this can be done in schools or even as part of an extended or more difficult driving test. Secondly, more attention could be paid to safe road design. For example, signs can be used to warn people, speed bumps and road bends can be added to calm traffic, and speed cameras can help to deter people from driving too quickly. Finally, goverments or local councils can reduce road accidents by investing in better public transport, which would mean that fewer people would need to travel by car.",
        "In conclusion, while punishments help to prevent bad driving, I believe that other road safety measures should also be introduced."
