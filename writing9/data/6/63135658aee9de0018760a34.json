        "A number of the public think that music should learn in school , while others do not stay with this statement , in addition, in my point of view it is not too necessary to learn it .",
        "First of all , they have a plethora of subject  , which is important for them as science, mathematics and other subjects , those only will helpful for them in the future , for example , due to the advanced technology , science is more important than other subjects , as a result , which is the only book  , they give technical knowledge as well as social.",
        "Moreover , music is an art , therefore everyone is not able to learn it  , in addition , most children have no interest in this subject , for example , 30 out of 67 students choose a physical training program rather than others. Furthermore , in his field no prestigious opportunities, while another side , they can get a huge range of options to select side their career, such as , after graduation , they can join any kind of company, which they want , therefore they feel internal satisfaction to join it.",
        "On the other hand , some children have a hobby to becoming a musician  , therefore it should be there , due to the passion , many schools arranged it for them  , for instance , numerous schools organized music competition , where they learn music the whole year in the campus and last doing a competition between them. Secondly , music as  art we should respect it and take it as a subject in school, there it encourages children to join the field, such as    the competition market  , many schools include it.",
        "In conclusion , I believe that everyone is not interested in it but it is becoming for those, who are interested in music and it is beneficial for them."
