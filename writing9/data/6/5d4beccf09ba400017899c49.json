        "It is irrefutable that, school is a place where  one can learn a  variety of subjects. Therefore, a certain Segment of society opine that history should be the compulsory subject in Alma matter,so that children learn about the culture and  traditions. However, a counter argument that it is a waste of time to teach about the past. Both  the arguments need a proper Scrutiny before forming an opinion.",
        "To begin with, history tells us about the culture and  traditions so it should be mandatory In school subject in  order to teach the children about the past. For example, children are able to learn about their  ancestors that  how  they survived at that time. Moreover, with the help of history subject they grab more information and broaden their knowledge in that particular subject. Apart from It, they feel proved and more  energetic because  they inspire from their ancestors and try to  become as   like their idle person. So it is beneficial to teach about the history in school.",
        "On the other hand, no doubt history subject is fruitful for pupils,but other subjects such as: English, Political, and mathematics have more value to become a successful person in the new modernization era. Because history  tells about ancient time, which may not necessary for the future. In addition to it,  to achieve their goal or aim offsprings have to  focus on new  subjects which helps them to learn  social and basic skills that how to speak with others and how to calculate rather than post date.",
        "In conclusion, no doubt history is like the backbone of every nation, but the importance of other subjects should not be neglected because history not helpful to make the career of children."
