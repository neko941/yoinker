        "It is argued that our lives were more fulfilling when technology was less complex. This essay disagrees with this statement and believes that computers and the internet have made life much better because smartphones save us time and the internet has improved education.",
        "New phones, such as the iPhone, have made our daily lives much less laborious and have given us more free time. Jobs that required lots of energy and time can now be done at the touch of a button. For example, if we wanted to communicate with one another in the past, we had to write a letter, take it to the post office, and then wait for it to be delivered, whereas these days we can simply tap the email icon on our touch screen and send a message to whomever we want to communicate with in seconds.",
        "The internet has also enriched our lives by providing us with more information than we could ever dream of, and this has made us more independent and effective learners. In the past, students had to rely on a teacher and physical books for their education, and these were often either unavailable or in a format that most people did not want, but now we can pick and choose what we want to learn. For example, there are now thousands of free online courses available on YouTube that anyone can watch and learn from anywhere in the world.",
        "In conclusion, this essay suggests that life has been greatly improved by technological advancements, particularly labour-saving phones and the learning opportunities provided by the internet."
