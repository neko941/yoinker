        "Crime has become a concerning topic in most countries and many people have their own opinion on tackling this problem. Some people think that longer jail sentences are the best way to reduce crime while others think there are other ways to tackle it. In this essay I will discuss both views, and give my opinion as to why offering jobs to criminals and keeping them on probation is the best way to decrease crime.",
        "Many people believe that giving criminals longer prison sentences will reduce crime because when they get longer sentences the streets will be with less criminals, hence, less crime. This will also deter other criminals from commiting the same crime as they know what consequences to expect. For instance, if robbers are put in jail for a longer period of time, the streets will be safe until they are released from jail. This will not gurantee that the criminal will do the same offence again. This is why alternative methods should be introduced to decrease crime.",
        "Some people, including me, think that shorter prison sentence and offering criminals a job like community service will reduce crime. When a person goes to jail for a long time, he or she will have to handle the lawyer charges as well as help their family with an income. It is more likely that this person is going to rob again. Therefore giving criminals small jobs, for example, enviornment maintainace will decrease crime while helping the criminal's family and pay off any debts.",
        "In conclusion, crime is indeed a hot topic around the world but many people think that longer prison sentences will decrease it. Alternative methods must be implimented into the law to help both the community as well as the criminals. This will lead to a safer place to live in for all of us."
