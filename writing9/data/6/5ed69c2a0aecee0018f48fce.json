        "Plastic money is very popular and in trend nowadays. In the modern world, almost everyone has their own cards from various banks. People are overusing this money and do not think twice before using it and not able to pay on time. Due to the reason, all finance related companies should do the proper investigation of card owner's financial background in order to minimize the defaulters list. In my opinion, finance companies should always check the person's history before providing them card. I will share the reasons in the following paragraphs.",
        "The primary reason to agree with this is the statement is the irresponsible behaviour of young generation. People who have credit cards do not spend wisely and mostly do the impulsive buying. Due to the happy-go-lucky nature of the young generation, they do not think about paying back at the time of spending and eventually will fall into the trap of finance companies. For example, I recently read a report in the Guardian, which published the report mentioned that more than 70% of people are less than 30 years of age in the non-payer\u2019s list.",
        "Another persuasive reason is the financial status of the people. Credit cards should not be given to the people who cannot pay back money in case of unforeseen circumstances. Banks should always choose people whose financial background is strong and can repay money even in adverse situation such as loss of job, loss in business. Individuals who are strong from finance point will settle the amount in any status."
