        "A controversial issue relates to whether students should be recognized for their scholastic achievements or for their merits in extracurricular activities. This essay explores both points of view and explains why I lean towards thinking that fulfilment in sports, music and art is of bigger value when it comes to reward.",
        "",
        "Some people think that outstanding academic accomplishments have to be applauded because every student\u2019s primary goal is to get educated and cumulate knowledge, which will be transferred into their future careers. Motivating pupils in pursuing high results in studies benefits them in adulthood, as they are better prepared and trained to be more competitive within the labour market in their area of expertise. Furthermore, it also helps receiving a better-paid job offer from employers if a student demonstrates abilities to learn fast and effectively by presenting the awards, diplomas and certificates of achievement during interviews.",
        "",
        "However, others tend to think that success in athletics, art and other extracurricular activities are to be honoured more when compared to attainments in education. This belief is supported by an idea that it is essential to encourage students to balance their lives by widening the interests and spreading the focus on a variety of life aspects. As a result \u2013 students become stress-resilient and live lives that are more interesting, by avoiding the pressure to score the highest in the class or to be on the honour roll, which is certainly stressful. Another good reason to support students, passionate about their hobbies is that there are plenty of examples of people succeeding in life having no educational achievements, while being enthusiastic about their interests and aptitudes, such as the Silicon Valley billionaires, famous Hollywood celebrities, and professional sports athletes.",
        "",
        "In conclusion, it is a fact that stimulation of educational excellence benefits graduates in future career. However, people should understand that there are much more components to happiness and a content life, such as development of one\u2019s strong suit, which are encouraged by recognition and acclamation."
