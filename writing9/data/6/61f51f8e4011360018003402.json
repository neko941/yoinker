        "Nowadays Updating is mandatory for everything whether it is for a person or for the country. As time passes everything is changing across the world like technology, laws, thinking, pricing, living style etc. Let's take one example of an iPhone, every year in  September month Apple Inc company team launch the new version of the iPhone and the older version become outdated so we also change the phone  sometimes because we have to upgrade to the latest technology.",
        "These same things also happen for the country too. As the population and technology are growing rapidly the country must adopt the new changes as per the requirement. As I have seen nowadays pricing of petrol and diesel is costly than ever and for this , the reason a lot of people can't afford it. What government is doing about this? My answer to this question is now the government is trying to switch the types of vehicles into CNG & Electricals. There are plethora benefits of this types of vehicles like low pollution, environment friendly, Cost-effective etc.",
        "There will be more changes taking place in the future like currently the government doing all works in softcopy(hard paper) and now this all paperwork will switch into the online so everyone can save their time and track their status online.",
        "Let's talk about another example , ,currently the electricity price is also high because we are generating electricity manually by water but now only a few people have started to use solar energy direct via solar panels. Solar panel cost is high but it's a one-time cost only. Once the solar panel is installed then we never have to pay our electric bill. The government is also helping to install solar panels by providing subsidies to everyone."
