        "Nowadays, the infrastructure of medical care are well developed in many countries, this make people have an ability to expend their lifespan.  I think the benefits outweigh the disadvantages.  In this essay I will discuss the advantages of this development and why this is advantages more than drawbacks.",
        "There have some advantages for people can gain the benefit from the improved medical care.  If people are living longer they will have more times to do the things they want.  For example, they will have much more time to share happiness with their family and friends.  Some parents have their child in their 40s, so if they living longer, they will have an ability to educate and stay with them.  Additionally, many people earn more money in their whole life in order to pay to living cost, as a result, if they can expend their life time so they can travel everywhere when they retired to pcik up their quality of life.",
        "Moreover, in the wake of technology advancing, the care of medical development level have an enormous increase.  This means if we have some problem of the body, this can be improved through operation or take medecine, consequantly, the patient can pick up their life in healthy way.  For instance, some people get cancer and they receive a chemotherapy, for that reason, they can live longer than before.  So they have time to do something they want and some case can be cured completely.",
        "In conclusion, I strongly believe that the improved medical care make people having a longer life, and this is outweigh the drawbacks.  Such as people can have much more times to do something they want to do, and also they can have a quality of life because they can receive a more high level of the medical care."
