        "To have own home is very important for persons than to rent one in some countries. There are many reasons why it is so, for example history aspects or personal causes. As I think it is, definitely, a positive situation.",
        "So, why is it really might be the case? First of all, I assume that historians have developed over many centuries the principle that everyone has a personal place to call home, a place where they feel safe, surrounded by comfort and warmth. People have been building their own homes and arranging them in their own way since ancient times. Also, a person needs to have something of their own, to possess it, and home is the first thing that really matters.",
        "From my point of view, having your own home is much more convenient. If you are an owner of a home, you can furnish it as you like, you can make any changes you want, in a rented home it is necessary the landlord's permission. A person who owns a house can have any animal they want whenever they want, which is not the case with tenants. Owner of a house or flat, also, do not have to worry that their rent may be increased, or they may be evicted from their rented homes as they have personal one.",
        "If you look at it from a different point of view, there are some disadvantages. For instance, if you own a flat or house you have to pay a monthly mortgage in case you have not saved up yourself. It could be difficult and stressful because you need always to think about it and to have enough money.",
        "Taking into consideration all I have mentioned above, I would like to say that, in my opinion, owning your own home is much easier to live in as it offers security and comfort. Also, the main reason for being an owner of a flat or house is that the person wants to feel at home."
