        "Sending your child to school is everyone\u2019s dream. And to fulfil this, most of the parent\u2019s send their wards to attend school for their overall development as a human being but there are some people who think that keeping your kid at home and teaching is better than sending to school for the minor\u2019s growth.",
        "Teaching is a two way process where the teacher gives the knowledge to student\u2019s and on the other end the children receive and grasps what a teacher is teaching. Moreover, through this the adolescent can clarify his doubts when their is physical presence of a person teaching them and is ready to clear the doubts at the same time. And this can only be done when we send our ward to school, which will automatically lead to his development due to various concepts followed by school\u2019s to make the minor learn through theoretical as well as practical methods.",
        "However, in spite of the above theory few people still think that keeping your ward at home and teaching is better for a juvenile\u2019s development rather than sending to school. And this is because of so much of the information which is available on different websites related to the syllabus being followed by the school\u2019s for almost all classes and due to this they think it is better to keep the youngster at home than sending out for study and being at home will lead to a better growth as a human being.",
        "To conclude, I would say that it is totally a choice of a parent to send their ward to school or not, but if I speak of myself, I will definitely send my ward to school rather than opting to keep my offspring at home and make him study through this process. As according to me, a kid can only develop as a good and a better human being when he goes out of his comfort zone and see in life through his view point and understand his needs as well as of the society."
