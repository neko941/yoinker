        "It is widely argued and many people believe that their children ought do course work, besides school duration even in their free time. This essay will discuss how a child should spend his free time and what are the disadvantages of doing schoolwork all the time.",
        "First of all, children are the most sensitive part of the society, because in the future ultimately, all the burden will be taken by them including world's economy, politics, advancement in technologies etc. Generally, they will become the future leaders and all the world' situation will be on their hands. So, it is very crucial for the parents and teachers to pay special attention to them.",
        "Some parents consider that, a toddler should learn whole day. They show strictness and extreme, rude behaviour which leads towards many mental and physical health problems of a child. It can also make a child very annoying and influence on their behaviour. However, in this modern age, people are realizing that it is equally important for a toddler to do physical activities parallel with their routine work. But in order to engage in these activities, children need free time as much as possible. Without doing this, a kid will never be able to fully develop all his skills and abilities.",
        "It is also very necessary for a child to do schoolwork and give some extra time for their studies, if they are lacking in some subjects. Childhood is a such period in which the interest of a child is in developing phase. In the free period, parents should engage them in some physical and extra co-curricular activities. Such things will help to realize the parents that in which field their toddler can excel and make a good career. For example, if an adolescent is much fond of playing cricket and whenever he got spare time, he goes to the playground and starts playing. This thing is the indicator that he can become a very successful cricket man. Also, it is very necessary for a kid to sleep regularly. Lack of sleep will also influence on their health.",
        "It is concluded that a toddler should be given free pace as much as possible. Nevertheless, school work is also important, but for an infant free generation means a lot."
