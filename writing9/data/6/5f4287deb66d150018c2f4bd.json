        "Thanks to the Internet and a wide range of online communication platforms and softwares, we can nowadays connect with people around the world easily without having to travel over a long distance. This emerging means of interaction brings both benefits and drawbacks, about which will be further discussed.",
        "On the one hand, online communication both expands access to a wide range of learning opportunities and increases the efficiency in organizations\u2019 operation. Firstly, the accessibility to education has been significantly widened thanks to this technology. To illustrate, many schools and colleges these days are offering professional certifications or degrees through distance learning. This allows students to stay at home and make direct interactions with teachers or trainers without having to go to school or study abroad. Secondly, exchanging information online via telecommunication applications are now widely used by businesses to save costs and minimize administrative tasks. For instance, companies utilizing Instant Messaging can enjoy instant access to colleagues and partners based in various geographic locations. As a result, they will operate more efficiently by allocating money and time, once lost to commuting, to generate more productive outcomes.",
        "On the other hand, online conversations also have some disadvantages. To begin with, when the network connection is poor or unstable, the auditory or visual quality of Internet exchange will be substantially affected, which might potentially lead to annoyance and misinterpretation. Moreover, there are certain limitations in human interaction which online communication simply cannot address. To give an example, a salesperson would opt for seeing clients in an appointment to better understand their psychology and expectations so  they might stand a higher chance of winning the customers\u2019 trust.",
        "In conclusion, online communication has made it possible for individuals and organizations across the world to stay connected. Despite the cons it may have, its pros are far more inevitable."
