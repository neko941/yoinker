In this context, the population tend to transmit their learnings to the next generations. For example, people learned and record how can cultivate plants; recorded production seasons of the agricultural products, climate conditions and their influences, because the recorded information provide sustainability of the process. \u0130f they did not ensure data to us, we would suffer from problems numerous times. \u0130n addition, they documented information about the natural catastrophes and challenges to cope with them. Moreover, scientists have been experimenting with the found treatment for the diseases. Obviously, if they did not save results, humanity would have to struggle to  experiment with solutions myriad times.",

Literally, the past does not have a contribution when individuals come across challenges because the problems humanity experiences change depending on circumstances and time."
