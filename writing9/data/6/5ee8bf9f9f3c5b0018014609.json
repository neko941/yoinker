        "According to some people's opinion, maximum school age should be until 18. However, the opponents of this group think that pupils should be educated till the age of 14 and this is enough. I'm convinced that, the former thought is more sensible because of opportunities to do experiments and gain a lot of knowledge.",
        "In these days, most of people think that schools are not necessary to spend life till the age of 18, instead, it can be enough to study till 14. This can open them way to start  working from early years. However, schools provide students with proper knowledge which cannot be taken in other places. For instance, in the lessons of Physics or Chemistry, pupils' interest can be kindled by experiments with elements and substances, or they can make mechanisms. All of these are taught only at high school because at that point students have more confidence and appropriate information of theories, I guess.",
        "Moreover, when they become adolescent , at school they will study further life related subjects, psychology or others for example. These subjects are taught due to changes in behaviour of students, I think. By studying those subjects, they can possess ability to hold their temper in any case and they are highly likely to avoid being of victim of robbers or killers. This is because they will be trained at their school by masters of self-defending courses. According to recent change in educational system of French schools shown that, all students have to be ready for their further life by pursuing knowledge , simultaneously with physical education.",
        "To conclude, it is optimum choice for students to study at school till they become adolescent. As a result they will be taught in various fields."
