        "With increased earning of people, number of toys for children are being purchased by parents is also accelerating. This essay will discuss the pros and cons that owning large number of toys has on children.",
        "One advantage children have from toys is that they will most likely not be addicted to technological gadgets. With large number of toys around them, children will constantly be engaged in playing. While it is often seen that parents, when busy give their child an iPad and continue working, this will not be the case when the child has many toys to play with. Additionally, this will boost children\u2019s creativity as they will have to create their own games for the toys they have been provided with.",
        "On the other hand, being tied to numerous toys can be harmful to children due to the lack of physical activity. While playing with toys there is very little physical movement as compared to playing outside. Most children who own a lot of toys, for instance, do not prefer to go outside and play causing harm to their mental and physical growth. In addition to that, the quality of sharing is learnt by children only while playing with others, which will not happen if they are isolated due to their toys.",
        "In conclusion, buying large number of toys though only seems to be benefit the children, it also has some disadvantages. Although children are prevented from being addicted to technology and allowed to flourish their creativity, they are also being deprived of physical exertion, which is required for their sustained growth, as well as development of crucial qualities like sharing. Hence, buying the adequate number of toys is essential for the right growth of children."
