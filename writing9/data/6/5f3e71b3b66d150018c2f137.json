        "The tourism industry has been booming for several decades, thanks to budget airlines and cheap accommodations. Some countries rely heavily on tourism, as it contributes hugely to their economy. Although, some may argue that they are many benefits to international tourism, however others may disagree, as there are several problems that can arise.",
        "To begin with, many believe travelling to other nations can result in spread of fatal diseases. For example, Covid-19, this virus started in a small city of China in 2019, and spread extensively across the planet. Due to the high contagious nature of the virus, almost every single country closed down the borders to contain the virus, and slow down the outbreak.",
        "Moreover, nowadays most people can travel abroad due to cheap flights and therefore, this is contributing to the global warming.  A recent study, calculated that a flight from New York to London emits close to 980 Kg of carbon dioxide per passenger. This has been a major concern, as humanity has increased carbon footprint by 11 fold since 1981.",
        "On the contrary, there are many advantages to travelling across the world such as exploring different cultures. Millions travel abroad to either learn about the history of the country or just for a vacation. With reasonable ticket prices, many can travel without any difficulty. Furthermore, many nations depend on tourism to bring in the money. Not only tourism creates jobs, it also decreases poverty in their countries.",
        "To conclude, though tourism is creating more jobs and giving holiday makers a chance to explore different traditions; nevertheless, it is also having a negative impact on the environment, and risk of transmission of deadly infections."
