        "It is believed that public museums and art galleries lost their value in the nowadays world with an increasing growth of the Internet access. Despite this common idea, I completely disagree with this statement and insist on supporting and preserving these facilities.",
        "The first reason to support my opinion about this issue is the fact that public museums and art galleries play a crucial role in education. They encourage people to learn more about their heritage and culture by presenting real artefacts and masterpieces. For example, school tours to such facilities allow students to see different types of collections by their own eyes and feel the reality of the past. Furthermore, students eager to ask more questions and make their own discoveries. It leads to significant increase in children\u2019s interest in education.",
        "The further aspect of this issue that I would consider is the fact that historic and art artefacts keep countries financial stability, by creating jobs. The growing unemployment rate is the biggest concern all over the world, and it is extremely important to preserve as many jobs as possible. Art and history sectors provide many jobs for people with different levels of education that help them to have regular income.",
        "In conclusion, public museums and art galleries has to exist in our world. Not only do they make people be encouraged in educational process by receiving first hand experience, but also, they are vital for the governments as a great tool to decrease unemployment rate by maintaining job offers."
