        "To overcome stress some   psychologists say that, one should take a small short gap from the daily hectic schedule or do nothing for some time in the day, and some may also think that it's not worth it to take a break. I am concerned with the given statement  and will be talking about the benefits of doing so.",
        "firstly, it's been seen nowadays that many people suffer from stress due to pressure or tension because of their workaholic life. just to overcome this problem some psychologists ask them to take a break in the daily routine this will make them fresh to concentrate or  divert the pressure or burden.",
        "for example, many big organizations have nap rooms in their floor plan just in case the employee feels a little stressed then he/she can go to have a power nap.",
        "secondly, talking about the theory they suggest will degenerately work in case burden or tight work schedule, that is why it is implemented by many companies.for instance this culture comes from Japan their they believe that after taking a gap person gets refreshed, there it is meant that if a person takes a break then he/she is working so hard that they needed the gap.",
        "Thirdly, the study says that after a break man feels released and gets back more efficiently to work,this is  one of the main reasons why its followed by many countries. I would like to suggest that if an individual feels sick he or she must take a short break."
