        "Nowadays, there is a sudden increase in the number of students showing interest in international studies. While there is some drawback to this trend, I firmly believe that benefits outweigh the drawbacks.",
        "On the  brighter side, the international studies help the student pave a better career path by nourishing them with healthy academic curriculum. Consequently, this will  help the student to grab high position jobs with fatty remunerations. For example, a study by Oxford university has proved that student with abroad studies earn more as compared to others, studied in home countries. Furthermore, due to the poor educational facilities of some developing nations, the student decides to move to other country for gaining education. In addition to this, they develop many other valuable skills by  mingling with people of diverse cultures, resulting in improvising their overall personality and broaden the horizons of their knowledge. For instance, a survey by the Canadian university has revealed that student become bilingual when they mixed up with other cultures.",
        "On the darker side, there are few disadvantages. Lately, student moving to other countries can face language barriers. To exemplify, many student in Germany find it difficult to understand and communicate with natives in German dialect. Secondly, few of them will feel homesick and develop depression. However, all these concerns can be easily curbed by taking counselling session run by almost every international educational institution. For example, there is a separate counselling department in all the abroad universities to deal with the problems of international students and provide them better solution to make their stay comfortable.",
        "In conclusion,  it is evident that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages. Although there are few demerits, university counselling session can help student to overcome all the troubles."
