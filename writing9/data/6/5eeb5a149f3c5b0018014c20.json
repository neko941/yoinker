        "Some people argue that choosing a job with high wage is more advantageous than doing a job, which appeals to them, but does not bring decent money. I completely disagree with this opinion as I believe that job satisfaction is far more valued than high income for several reasons.",
        "To begin with, happiness with the job gives people a sense of fulfilment that no money can guarantee. People who receive high salaries, but feel tensed and struggle with their own conscience, will probably not enjoy the life no matter how much money they earn. On the flip side, pursuing one\u2019s interests will result in pleasure and contentment in most cases. According to a study done by two economists from the University of Basel and published in the Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization revealed that wage increases do not have a persistent effect on job satisfaction. It was found that job satisfaction was positively influenced by wage increases, but it was only temporary, typically lasting four years. This was due to the fact that people adapt to their new wage level over time and end up desiring more money, which makes it a never ending race.",
        "Furthermore, the relationship between job satisfaction and work performance is solid. In other words, doing what you enjoy keeps you focused and thus contributes to a career development. People who love their jobs will easily succeed in their fields of work and perform better than those who put salaries first. For instance, Joanne Rowling, best known for writing the Harry Potter fantasy series, went from struggling single mom to the world's most successful author because she persisted until she eventually found a publisher for her first book. This happened because she fully devoted herself to the writing career and did not consider changing it for something more profitable at a certain point. Therefore, the benefits of the job that keeps you contented outweigh the downside of the low wage in a long-term perspective.",
        "In conclusion, I firmly believe that job satisfaction is more beneficial for the person\u2019s well-being than high wage, because it helps people to be at peace with themselves, stay motivated and achieve more in the long run."
