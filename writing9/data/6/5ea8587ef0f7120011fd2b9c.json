        "In the last two decades, there have been enormous changes in the technological information industry such as internet and E-mails. Although, these technological breakthroughs might have more disadvantages than merits down the road.In my opinion, I disagree with this statement.",
        "",
        "On one hand, it is significantly clear that technological innovations have a myriad of positive effects on societies.In other words, the way of communication has become easier than ever before. Therefore, nowadays the vast majority of people prefer telecommuting and studying from home.For example, According to a survey that administered at Tokyo university showed that 80% of students who live in Tokyo city prefer online interactions with their professors to avoid traffic jams while they are on their way to the university.",
        "",
        "On the other hand, it is undeniable that technological advances have dreadful drawbacks such as social isolation; Using online chatting for a long time will definitely lead to social distancing as youngsters enjoy online communication more than face to face interactions.However, it is indispensable talking to other people from other countries, ignoring real relationships may lead to depleted communities. For instance, According to an article published in the New York times, 90% of the elderly suffer from depression due to the poor attention and affection they constantly receive from their offsprings.",
        "",
        "In conclusion, It is imperative that technology has changed people's lives to be more simplistic,",
        "But it also has negative influences that should be addressed properly by the leading authorities."
