        "All governments provide necessary facilities and infrastructures to make their people well educated. There are two different views prevailing in society about sending students to educational institutes. According to some people girls and boys should be given education in separate schools. Whereas others think that studying together will bring more benefits to both genders. This essay discusses both points of views and I shall share my own opinion at conclusion.",
        "Co-education has always been a debatable topic especially in some Asian countries. The ideology of separate schools for young students exists more in these countries. Although building separate campuses could have a financial burden on governments, however parents follow the principal that boys and girls should not mingle with each other at the age of adolescence. It gives students the opportunity to focus more on their studies as they wouldn\u2019t be distracted by the presence of the opposite sex. It also helps to avoid many social problems which parents and teachers foresee if pupils are given education in the same premises. Some of the Mideast countries observe this practice at a larger scale.",
        "According to the second point of view, studying together gives more confidence to young students as they learn how to behave with each other and what are their social responsibilities. As they study some science subjects like mathematics, physics and chemistry together, it creates a healthy competition among male and female students. In this way they train themselves for practical life where both men and women perform together in the same working environment. Furthermore, governments don\u2019t have to construct separate buildings and don\u2019t have to employ management and faculty to functionalize these institutes on a gender basis. Hence, we see that co-education is common in most countries of the world.",
        "In conclusion according to my own point of view, giving education in separate schools doesn\u2019t have any remarkable impact on society. However, studying together will not only bring financial advantages but also shape the personalities of young pupils by creating a gentle and responsible approach for the opposite gender."
