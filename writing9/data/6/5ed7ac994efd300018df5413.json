        "When discussing with the education, the technology has a positive impact on it. Today's modern education system carries through with the online teaching method and there is a lot differences could be seen with the method of the traditional education system education system. Now, many of the students are able to carry their students via on online tutorials, online quiz, online lectures and online discussions. In addition to this, students are carrying their lectures via Zoom. Moreover, this will facilitate to carry their lecture with video calls while students will have opportunity to discuss their issues with the lectures. Despite of the traditional teaching method, the online teaching method allows to study with the soft copies, ebooks and will not do the studies with hard copies and printed textbooks. So, the students can refer their lectures via on prerecorded lecture slides.",
