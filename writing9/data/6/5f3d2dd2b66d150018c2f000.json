        "A bunch of people believe that, behaviour of professional sportsmen or sportswomen does not matter whether its on field or off the field until they are performing well on the ground, is it so? I would partially disagree with this statement.",
        "What makes a professional sports person, a good sportsman or sportswomen, is it just their skill they have acquired over a period of time they have spent on the ground? No only the skill set they have acquired won't make them a good sports person as skills won't help them to bind with their fellow teammates, it would be their character which would help them to connect with their fellow players and if a team does not have good bond or connection, their chance of loosing a game increases drastically.",
        "How important is connection between players, could be easily seen in a team game, For examples, if there is some kind off miss communication between the two players while they are batting in a game of cricket, then, there are high chances of a run out, therefore, one should not only focus on their skill alone as this, won't benefit them in a long run, one of the greatest example of bonding and success, would be the present Indian cricket team.",
        "Therefore, in my opinion, a sports person should also focus on his or her behaviour both on field and even off the field as this, would not increase their success rate, but could even help them in improving their relations with other teams and their players."
