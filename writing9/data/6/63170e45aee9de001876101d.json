        "It is essential for people to take risks in their both professional and personal lives, which has some benefits and downwards. In my opinion, the advantages of taking risks outweigh the disadvantages and I will explain my reasons in this essay.",
        "Firstly, taking risks enables you to meet new opportunities in your life and you will face many Challenges that are pivotal to becoming successful.For instance,one of my friends who live in Iran got a job offer from a German company. He spent all his savings and allocated a large amount of his time to learning the German language.He quit his",
        "job and migrated to Germany and now, he is quite satisfied with it. If people aren't able to take risks, they will always be in the same position and will never make progress in their life.",
        "Moreover,lots of successful people have achieved their goals by taking risks in their lives.for instance, Steve Jobs risked losing his company introducing Apple to the market or Bill Gates risked quitting  university to start his own business.",
        "most of the successful are risk takers who were capable of working under pressure and stressful conditions to pursue their dreams, while others who can not bear taking risks, usually work for other",
        "people, and remain simple workers.",
        "one the other hand, there are some drawbacks to takings risks in some areas. for example,you have seen a lot of people who have lost an enormous amount of money on financial markets like forex or Crypto.",
        "In conclusion, despite losing money in some areas due to taking risks, I think that if risk-taking is managed in a good way, it can be quite beneficial and the ability to take risks helps people succeed in their life."
