        "There are few people who believe that the students of the university can take their subjects whatever they like as their own choice in contrast others regard that students should allow choosing their subjects with regard to science and technology which will be benefited for the future.",
        "However, in spite of raising controversial issues I recommend those subjects which should be taken by the students in order to select independently so that they can build up their skills and contribute to the country as well as society freely by their own through individual competency based on their efficiency which can be developed by their own through the discussion above topic has both views.",
        "Moreover, different students have different choices and people vary in their skills and taste. Provided that we force a student to take his subject and if he has no own choice, he/ she can fail to contribute and also lag behind. For instance, some guardians compel their children to take their educational subject choice such as forcing them to be doctors and engineers but mostly they fail and can't achieve their goals.",
        "On the other hand, students who have their own choice to choose their subjects are more creative than any other students who are obliged to get their subjects to have no independence to select their own subject.",
        "To be balanced all are keeping contribution for the sake of welfare from their particular position and situation.  In this ,circumstance students should have rights and we should not force them to be obstacles to emerge and apply their own innovation and cognitive power which are the behind scene to be development."
