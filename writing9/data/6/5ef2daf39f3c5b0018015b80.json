        "It is widely said that the most effective way to boost the safety of road system is raising the legal age in using some vehicles such as cars and motorbikes. In my opinion, I totally disagree with this viewpoint due to many reasons.",
        "On the one hand, it is undeniable that the application of the least legal age permitted using cars and motorbikes has certain benefits. Firstly, when the authorities raise the legal age in controlling these kinds of means, a greater number of citizens have the awareness of using them, which helps transportation system restrict significantly accidents. For instance, in Vietnam, while the Prime Minister, Nguyen Xuan Phuc, is more and more proposing a wide range of monetary punishment on car and motorbike users who do not comply the transportation rule, this decreases considerably a lot of serious accidents caused by users not bringing helmet. Secondly, with the increased legal age of drivers and riders, these days, many young children, particularly students who are under 18, can not using these types of means, especially motorbikes comfortably like they used to. Therefore, the roads around school areas may not have to encounter a high traffic density at peak hours, which leads to the safety not only for these areas but also for students.",
        "On the other hand, I believe that this is not the best solution because there is another one is better. First of all, because many parents in society, nowadays, have to allocate the large amount of time for their hectic life, they could not have enough much time for picking up their offspring whenever they have finished at school. Hence, when the governments enact this measure, several other problems will arise significantly, especially, the movement of school children in households. Second of all, rather than doing that, to raise the safety of road system, the authorities can encourage residents to use public transit more such as bus and train. For example, the local authorities may subsidize for the cost of buses, which would cause the inhabitants to use buses commonly for daily move to their workplace; therefore, this reduces serious traffic congestion in the main streets and ensure the road safety considerably.",
        "In conclusion, the higher legal age of people allowed to use cars and motorbikes may have a number of beneficial effects, but I am of the opinion that it is not the best option."
