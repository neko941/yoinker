In the past, these form of exams are the only way to assess a student's knowledge in a subject. Formal examinations are the effective way to find  how alert a student in class or a student's interest in various subjects. For example, a student who is an expert in Mathematics and interested in numbers get high martes in their exam.On the other hand, the same student got a low marks in his Science exams because not only he is not interested in that subiect but also he got a favourable mark according to his hard work .In this way, we can find out a student interest and that may increases competition to get high marks in all subjects.",
