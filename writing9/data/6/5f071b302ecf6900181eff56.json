        "According to statistics, at least for some developed countries, life expectancy experiencing a rising trend.  Even though, this change is to be assumed as a positive sign of better overall health and life condition, still there are some backlashes.  describing number of drawbacks of this trend, such as post retirement services needed and the decline in overall production which may lead to lower GDP, some solutions which may be duly applicable are presented in this essay.",
        "Indeed, an increase in overall life expectancy is a positive factor in a society which shows a strong and healthy lifestyle accompanied with appropriate economic and social support.  However, the change also can be translated to higher number of retired people who served in the society and would require economic and social care privileges such as a sufficient retirement payment as well as health insurance support. As an example, economy of the countries like Japan in which people are expected to live longer, shall carry the burden of the health system for elders; These supports, which they undeniably deserve, would be a monetary load on the government's budget. regarding the solution, noteworthy to mention is the fact that preparedness is the key; Insurance policies and long-term Investments financed with the money people pay for their retirement insurance can guaranty a win-win situation for both government and the people.  For instance, requirement insurance system in Sweden invests the money acquired for retirement insurance in long-term investment projects, normally in developing countries where the interest rate is higher than Europe.  Hence, investing in long term projects on behalf of the people and savings the interest for their retirement, when they will definitely need the money and services back, is the key for the problem.",
        "Another difficulty with this trend lies within the mere fact that higher life expectancy means longer the people will not be productive.  In other words, people who are not working anymore will be economic weight on the society.  It may be claimed that they will cause a serious decline in GDP.  it is to be understood that higher life expectancy shall also be coupled with stronger overall productivity with the condition that people work longer than they are supposed to work. For instance, the new administration in France introduced a law in which retirements are to be postponed to more than 30 years. Despite the huge protests in which people stand against it, it seems totally reasonable. People who are expected to live longer after retirement, shall be supposed to work longer when they can. Therefore, longer working years before retirement is another solution which can simply tackle the issue of a possible lower GDP.",
        "In conclusion, longer life expectancy, higher the social economical and health support people will need. So the long-term profitable Investment projects and postponement of retirement to above 30 years are among solutions which can be implemented."
