        "Nowadays, more people doing more than one job and also shifting their jobs several times in their entire life. This essay will discuss the pros try and cons of this factor in the forthcoming paragraphs.",
        "To begin with, people are doing more than one job. It has some benefits of doing more than one job.",
        "Firstly, Now, people are becoming more modern and they want to change their lifestyle. They like to wear branded clothes and shoes. To fulfil their needs they are doing an extra job. Extra jobs make them financially strong. For instance, one of my friends is doing day and night shifts . Now, he has his own house and car. Moreover, people interact with different communities. It makes more contact and builds a relationship with many people. Hence, they become more socialised.",
        "On the other hand, there are some drawbacks of shifting positions frequently and doing multiple jobs at a time. First,  multitasking makes a person tired. Sometimes, it generates some health issues.  Doing multiple works means more tension. Furthermore, people who work more do not have time to give time to their families. It creates relationship issues. In addition, they get no job promotion in their life  due to several times changing their jobs. They are also  not eligible for taking incentives from a company. For instance, my cousin John has shifted 5 jobs in the last decade but never gets promoted in any company he considers  a junior employee in every company.",
        "To conclude, from the above paragraphs it is clear that this notion has some advantages and disadvantages. People can get more connections and become financially strong. On the other side, there are some issues of health, relationship and incentives."
