        "It is true that electronic newspapers and books are become more popular nowadays. While I agree that reading through portable devices brings substantial benefits, I believe that paperbacks and magazines will not be superseded easily in the future.",
        "On the one hand, I agree that integrating technology devices in reading offers numerous advantages. Firstly, it allows readers to access to the internet and the digital resources which has wider range of category compared to the traditional method. As a result, besides users can read unlimited content at the same time, there is no additional cost for buying these items. Secondly, in comparison, online news is more convenient and frequently updated. For example, breaking news is announced immediately while traditional users have to wait for the next day.",
        "On the other hand, I believe that both papers and books are replaced completely in the future. To begin with, paper journals are announced by publishers with high reputation and they are all official. Consequently, this can prevent from misunderstanding important information, which can lead to the misconception among the individuals. For example, tabloids, which are usually appear on the internet to attract readers, can bring imprecise information while newspaper owns a reliable source. Furthermore, expose to technology gadgets frequently can harm to users\u2019 health seriously. For instance, these devices not only damage victims\u2019 eyesight but also increase risk of obesity or heart disease in long-term since people nowadays are usually accompany with sedentary lifestyle.",
        "In conclusion, while e-books and online news allows readers to gain unlimited knowledge from any aspects around the world, I do not believe that it has the opportunity to alter all the printed books and magazines in the near future."
