        "People hold different opinions about the the relationship between university education and tution fee.Many people reckon that students may not charge for tution bill in university.For my perspective , I am partly agree with this statement for many convincing reasons.",
        "In fact ,education fee is becoming more and more expensive to fund as universities grow in size. Therefore,It is believed that If univiersity is in the stage of finacially independent by making students pay to maintain standards and ensure the quality of the teaching ,It will be the greatest way to reduce the burden on goverments ,especially in the developing countries which have got a tight budget . In addition, it is believed that most students benefit from university in terms of higher paid jobs in the future, so it is fair that they pay for at least some of the cos.Last but not least, in many countries,it has been maintaining the stage of too many chiefs, not enough Indians. It mean is a shortage of people to do manual jobs such as plumbing and carpentry, so making university more expensive may encourage people to take up these jobs.",
        "On the other hand , many people agree to make university education free for everyone. Firstly, it will encourage more people to attend university and break the wealth gap . The opportunity to access the university education will divide equally to everyone no matter their family\u2019s background. This is because it will lead to a more productive and educated and even fair workforce. Many people has generally believed that those countries that have a better educated labor via university have higher levels of innovation and productivity that is more benefit for sociaty.Last but not least,the more university graduates seek the high-paid job ,the more money tax they should to pay for goverment.To the gorverment authorities ,It is a bussiness to worthly investigate without the high-rate adventure.",
        "In summary for the mentioned above ,It can be affirmed that the effect of financial factor on the university education .Thus ,it is highly recommended that.Not only the leader of universities but alsoauthorities of gorverment calculate to receive the low-paid tiution fee that make all of the student afford to pay for that."
