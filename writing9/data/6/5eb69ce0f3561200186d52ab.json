        "It is argued by some people that university or college education is the most significant gateway to high-paid\r Occupations. However, others think that students should spend their time working and integrating the real world after their high school graduation. As the supporters of each views have their own justifications, I side with the advocates of the second opinion.",
        "On the one hand, one argument that put forward in favour of pursuing the further education after school\r Graduation is that university education is the key factor to securing a stable career. As a matter of fact, the current job market requires a relevant background in academic competences. Therefore, it is undeniable that the acquiring a university diploma have better employment opportunities in comparison with the high school degree holders. Furthermore, in certain specific study fields such as science, physics or information technology, organisations require a great deal of professional skills. In other words, the graduation from a respectful tertiary education can be a deciding factor in getting a high-salary job.",
        "On the other hand, it would be naive to think university education can guarantee a successful career path. Contrastingly, there is the greatest number of university graduates who have problem of unemployment due to the lack of experience. Consequently, having work experience and soft skills such as leadership, time-managing and the other interpersonal skills can throw the balance in favour of the applicant. As a consequence, an excellent working experience and the expertise in useful soft skills that can be valuable to a company can put one ahead of\r The game when applying for a competition.",
        "In conclusion, in my opinion, although university education is associated with beneficial impact on academic\r knowledge of people, people should make sure that their skills and competences reach the demand of a position which they apply in order to be sure of success"
