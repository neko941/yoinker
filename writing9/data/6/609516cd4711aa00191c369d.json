        "There are many different opinions on the best way to reduce crime. Some people say that long term pritoe the only way to curb crime, whereas others say that education, vocational training and rehabilitation are better This essay intends to analyse both perspectives. I believe that long term imprisonment is the answer for heine criminals, but on the whole, alternative methods are better to combat crime.",
        "There are many arguments given by those who advocate longer terms in prison to combat crime. They say that there are criminals who are a risk to  society, such as murderers. They cannot be made to mix with society There are also mentally insane people such as serial killers who should be kept away from the people. If such criminals are set free soon, they will re-offend and so should be in penitentiaries for longer terms.",
        "On the other hand, there are many convincing arguments given by those who are against long-term imprisonment. Firstly, in traditional prisons, petty criminals learn a lot about crime, and so when they leave prison, they commit even more crime. In other words, prisons act as universities of crime. So petty offenders like shoplifters and pickpockets should be given some vocational training and education. It is a well-known fact that the basic causes of crime are poverty, illiteracy and unemployment. If some form of employment rehabilitates criminals, then they would certainly not re-offend. I believe that alternative methods are better than  conventional prisons, because prisons are expensive to maintain. The government can spend that money on other important matters such as education and healthcare. This would ease some burden off the government's shoulders. The petty and minor criminals can also be employed in some community service projects after providing education and vocational training.",
        "Summing up, we should hate the crime and not the criminal. To fight crime, the focus should be on fighting the causes of crime and on reforming the criminals. Education and job training help to rehabilitate the criminals Longer terms in prison is not the answer to curb crime."
