        "People have different views as to whether the knowledge and experience we learnt from the past will be beneficial for our current lives. I personally believe that we are benefited from previous studying.",
        "Those who support the idea that previous study will not bring any advantages for our future lives may present following arguments. Firstly, they might consider that modern knowledge updates frequently and our understanding towards new challenges refreshes rapidly. Thus, the knowledge and ideas we learnt from the past will be no useful now. For example, the latest model of iPhone 12 has fundamental changes compared the first generation of iPhone 3. The operating system and appearance were changed largely to fulfill the new demands by different consumers. Likewise, it is argued that our knowledge from past might be incorrect. People believe the earth is flatted a century ago; after a while, they concept the earth is rounded. The previous study does not provide them with meaningful information.",
        "Conversely, there are various reasons that people believe experience and knowledge from the past were beneficial. They declared that we learnt almost everything from our ancestors, such as building house, hunting food and making clothes. Tall buildings were based on the idea of small and flatted old houses built by our ancestors. People followed the experience to build up stronger houses now, leading us to explore further for our lives and improve the quality of life. Furthermore, medical treatment is one typical example for advantages from our past experience. Scientists research new antibiotics medicines to conquer different diseases based on previous study. They studied previous experimental investigations and learnt from the mistakes.",
        "In conclusion, although people might argue there were some drawbacks from previous study, I believe we all benefit from past experience and knowledge."
