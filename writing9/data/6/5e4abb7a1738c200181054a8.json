        "It is a fact that selecting a right career pathway is crucial for the youth's future life when they graduate from high school. Some youngsters\u00a0\u00a0prefer to travel around the world or working\u00a0in workforce to gain experience\u00a0before entering universities; while, others enrol themselves in post-secondary education right after high school. Both of these two pathways have advantages for the youth and the\u00a0essay will discuss these two selections\u00a0separately.",
        "To begin with, firstly,\u00a0\u00a0Spending time travelling or working will provide\u00a0opportunities for high school graduates\u00a0understand themselves better. It is a true that the majority of the youth\u00a0may have lack of workforce knowledge or self-awareness; therefore, gaining work\u00a0experience\u00a0will assist them to become acknowledgeable\u00a0enough to select a suitable career.\u00a0For example, one-year travelling and working experiences will expand their horizontal knowledge and learn more about themselves. Moreover,\u00a0\u00a0they can also earn some money for their tuition as well.\u00a0\u00a0As a result, the youth may be mature enough to select their careers to pursue.",
        "However, some new graduates prefer to\u00a0attend universities right after high school. Firstly, they believe that travelling and working not only will waste their precious time,\u00a0but also will increase the risks for the youth to incline towards negative habits, such as smoking, drinking, doing drugs, and so on. In addition,\u00a0some of them may never return to colleges again due to minimum payment.\u00a0Directly pursuing university education will assist students to keep concentrated\u00a0in their academic study without distraction from working places.",
        "In conclusion,\u00a0\u00a0whether having a short period for travelling or working or not depends on a high school\u00a0graduate individually. I opine that they should make a serious decision after consulting their parents or mentors.\u00a0Travelling and working may not be suitable for all students due to \u00a0the above reasons. However, pursuing advanced academic educations in universities will assist learners to prosper."
