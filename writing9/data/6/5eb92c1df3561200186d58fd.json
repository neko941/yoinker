        "In spite of having other mode of transportation usage of cars are increasing day by day, as it provides flexibilities towards their life and work.However there are a wide range of problems, identify due to heavy usage of cars and also have possible solutions to tackle it. Both problems and solutions articulated in trail paragraphs.",
        "To commence with,car is most favourable means of transport among people around the world. Paradoxically,there are plenty of problems associated with it,first and foremost one is the emissions of toxic gases like carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide from the cars not only pollutes air, but also trap the heat from the sun which is ultimately increase the overall temperature of the earth,it is also known as greenhouse effects. Apart from that,today as much as people drive to work rather than walk, cycle or take public transport as a result traffic congestion is more common every day at rush hour.To cite an example, it is clear from the survey of California university that road traffic is counted one third of all harmful air pollution of the world.",
        "On the flip side,there are numerous solution to solve this phenomenon.Firstly,the manufacturer would be design environmentally friendly cars, which runs on either solar power or hydro power.For instance, one of the most renown car manufacturer company Tesla introduces their solar car. Secondly government should make strict rules and regulations in order to reduce cars on the road. Likewise,Delhi government introduced a scheme of the odd and even carcar to reduce the use of cars and pollution. Lastly, built more underground tunnels and parkings to solve the traffic problems.",
        "In conclusion,as there are a wide range of problems with the use of cars, but it can be also solved by taking some action by governments and car manufacturer."
