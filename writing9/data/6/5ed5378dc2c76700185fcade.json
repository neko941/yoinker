        "It is often argued that most corporations provide employees their uniforms that they must wear at any given time. This essay argues that although wearing uniforms causes discomfort to the workers, I believe that wearing a uniform gives a sense of identity.",
        "",
        "On the one hand, wearing uniforms shows a unique representation of the worker as an employee to the company. This means that employees wearing uniforms have a feeling that they are part of the organization. It will give them the spirit of oneness wearing the same clothing in the workplace. Also, wearing a company uniform provides easy recognition whenever workers are outside the company. For example, a doctor wearing a medical gown in a public place gives immediate recognition of being a part of a medical organization. Thus, wearing a specific uniform gives a unique identity.",
        "",
        "On the one hand, wearing a uniform at all times gives an uncomfortable working condition. This means that workers find it difficult to wear a uniform for a longer period. As a result, the employee will not be able to work efficiently because of the discomfort in wearing an annoying uniform. For instance, a lady security guard wearing a tight above knee pencil cut skirt and high heels standing at the entrance door of an office finds it difficult to handle the discomfort of the tight skirt and leg pain from the heels. However, wearing a uniform is a factor that affects the working performance, but I believe it is important for an identity and recognition.",
        "",
        "In conclusion, although wearing a uniform will not always provide a comfortable working environment, but wearing it at all times gives a unique identity of belonging to a company."
