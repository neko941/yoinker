        "There is no doubt that an increasing number of people tend to do shopping from malls rather than local shops and this has resulted in the closing of many traditional shops. In my opinion, this trend has both positive and negative impacts on people and society. Visiting shopping malls tend to save time and money while being not able to support family is its negative impact.",
        "",
        "On the one hand, saving time and money is the predominant factor to consider visiting a mall is a positive development to some extent. To elucidate, consumers can get all required things under the one roof, such as kitchen appliances, electronic gadgets, groceries, branded clothes, home d\u00e9cor, children's toys and many more. Hence, it saves time of them, whereas, before the opening of malls, they needed to do shopping by visiting one shop to another which was extremely time-consuming. Moreover, often this shopping centre, woo end-users by keeping discount and different offers, particularly on special occasions. Hence, they attracted towards them and this results in saving money on them.",
        "",
        "On the other hand, being bankrupt is the inevitable cause why I believe opening  new malls is a negative trend to a certain extent. To elucidate, for many shopkeepers, their shops is the only source of income. Irrefutably, myriads of people have switched to the mall over visiting local shops due to having many discount offers. Therefore, end-users are less inclined to visit local shops, and this has adversely impacted on their earning. Hence, not only they are not able to support their family, but also cannot provide education for their children due to lack of funds, which has resulted in them becoming bankrupt. For example, in the recent article by the Times of India revealed that there are many bankruptcy cases found on local shop vendors due to the opening of many malls in the market and this has resulted in increased illetracy ratio.",
        "",
        "In conclusion, although doing the shopping from the mall allows the customer to save their time and money which matters a lot in this modern life. Nonetheless, reducing a source of income adversely affect shopkeeper family and children and eventually becoming bankrupt is its profound impact."
