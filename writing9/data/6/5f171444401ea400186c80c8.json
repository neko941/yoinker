        "People have different views, whether tourism should be banned or not in order to promote local culture. In my opinion, there are some possible ways of encouraging local culture to the residents rather than banning tourism industry.",
        "On the one hand, there are some reasonable arguments for why some individuals support prohibition of tourism, to take advantage of the local cultureculture. The first argument is social behaviour. It is common knowledge that foreigners have their own culture which is completely different from another country\u2019s heritage and this factor might negatively affect people\u2019s manner when they see quite unusual custom. As a result, when they try to follow to another country\u2019s customs in their homeland, local people would separate them and consider these kind of people as a freak.  The second argument is that some tourists would underestimate the local people\u2019s cultureculture and this might cause great dispute between countries by spoiling public relationships. Therefore, supporters claim about banning tourism are acceptable.",
        "On the other hand, in my personal standpoint, it would be unwise if the government disapproves of tourism industry, for two reasons. Firstly, in the majority of the country's tourismtourism contributes most to the countries industry. If the government prohibits the use of tourist attractions, many more people will become unemployed and this will lead the country to the crisis, especially developing countries. Secondly, tourism is the key driver of peace among nations. Thanks to the tourist destinations that are exist in every country, people are able to go abroad and learn about other nations lifestyle and their cultural heritage. This is great chance to enhance our understanding about other nations and strengthen relationships between countries.",
        "In conclusion, although there might contributory factors for some people\u2019s assumptions about banning tourism, it seems to me that prohibition of tourism is unimportant action and there are no any benefits of doing this for local culture."
