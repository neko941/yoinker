        "Many divergent views exist on the importance of accessing information online or from libraries. A great number of people, including myself are of the opinion that, libraries are no longer needed since facts can easily be gathered online. In the following paragraphs, I will provide the rationale for my viewpoints as well as proffer justification for my own opinion.",
        "The primary reason upon which my belief is based that internet has as much if not more information readily available. It goes without saying that, nowadays, the internet is updated daily resulting in it being current and relevant. For instance, newspapers articles and other reading materials are posted online daily to make it more accessible. Unsurprisingly, a 2019 social experiment conducted by a group of researchers from the University of Toronto, Canada found that internet is most valuable source to get up-to-date information about the world. Needless to say, some websites are more worthy of access information than libraries.",
        "Not only does the internet lead to quick access to up-to-date information, but it also only takes us a step away to find anything such as books, encyclopedia, and dictionaries. It stands to reasons that more and more students are buying reading books for their classes or for leisure time from using online search engine like Amazon and eBay. My university course mate, Ben, is a shining example of this, Ben, who came from a remote town, where he did not go to the library. He was using only e-books for reading materials. Consequently, he got 1st position in class",
        "To sum up, I hold to the opinion that libraries are outdated and not suitable to meet the challenging needs of young generation. Conversely, the internet is a best way for everybody to access necessary resources because it provides convenience and cost effective"
