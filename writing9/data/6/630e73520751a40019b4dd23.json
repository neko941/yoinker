        "It is widely believed that people should take a risk in their occupational as well as private lives. While this offers a few benefits, there are also some drawbacks which are worth considering.",
        "There are two major upsides to taking risks for an individual. One crucial benefit is that people may achieve considerable promotion in their careers. Working on risky projects has always been a key approach to demonstrating one\u2019s abilities and competencies in a competitive company. Consequently, this would be a reliable evaluation for managers to place their employees in higher positions. In addition, adventurous people take risks in their personal lives to gain invaluable experiences. For instance, living or studying abroad is a great risk that is mostly taken by young adults in order to advance their academic and personal lives. This, in turn, teaches them valuable lessons on how to take advantage of the opportunities so as to decrease the possibility of loss they may encounter in the future.",
        "On the other hand, there are some downsides to this matter that can make trouble for risk takers. One significant drawback is financial threats for people who gamble their money in insecure ways. One clear example is spending money on betting websites or investment in certain unreliable projects. As a result, they often lose their fortune due to an incorrect decision. In addition, some people struggle to immigrate illegally to another country with the hope of having better living status. Nevertheless, they face many problems in this way and sometimes lost their lives before arriving at the destination.",
        "In conclusion, in spite of the fact that taking risk make progress in one way or another, this may cause detrimental impacts on people\u2019s lives. Consequently, it is of paramount importance to weigh the benefits against the drawbacks carefully before coming to a decision as to whether take a risk in their professional or personal lives."
