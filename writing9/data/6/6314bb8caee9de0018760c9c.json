        "There are individuals who believe that handling cash should be taught when they were young. In my opinion, teaching offspring how to spend money is the way that makes them more mature and helps them avoid problems in their forthcoming.",
        "One of the reasons why i support the idea of giving heir money, despite the fact that giving kids money may contain possible issues such as they may be involved in crimes like being robbed or stealing money, those still can be solved by teaching them the way to react when dealing with possible problems that may happen in both present and prospective, as a result, it may give the experience to overcome the following challenges. For instance, when it comes to a undergraduate student whose graduation is coming near, he or she may have to deal with many problems in the future such as being married and spending money on many projects or personal life and demand or saving the money which may not be taught at schools but their parents who have many experiences that have been saved for years.",
        "Another reason for my opinion, not only helping children prepare for the future but also teaching them the value of cash and being hard work. This is because money is not always available to be gained for free like what parents do for their heir but they have to work hard to earn it. Consequently, children will teach themselves lessons about how valuable money and being hardworking is and also form a saving habit to support themselves and their parents. For example, children in Asia are taught to open a small shop that sells stuff that is not in use or juices and parents will let them spend their earned money to buy whatever they choose to buy and their parents will help them sort out the unnecessary items, this may help them gain more knowledge of what they should buy or not.",
        "In conclusion, some individuals think that helping the little ones manage their money. I believe that teaching children the importance of handling funds effectively will provide them with the knowledge of managing funds as well as the value of money"
