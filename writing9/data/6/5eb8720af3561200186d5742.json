I would like to join my son and other students because my hectic and busy schedule I would not able to go for our pre plan trip last month. But, next month I have a time so this is a great opportunity for me to spend some quality time with my family.",

First is that \"do we have to arrange accommodation facilities when we are staying in USA\"? Second one is that \"does any other parents are coming on this trip\"?",
