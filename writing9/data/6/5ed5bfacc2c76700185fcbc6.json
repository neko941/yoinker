        "It is argued by few that kids behaviour should be the parents' responsibility while others think it should be a primary goal of schools and government. This essay will discuss both the views and agree that it should be a combined effort to teach children",
        "On one hand, it is said that parents are first school for any child. According to psychologist,  children imitate the behaviours of their parents. For instance, it is scientifically claimed that the majority of human traits are developed at a very young age. This age is mostly spent with families before starting academy.",
        "On the other hand, people argue that Firstly, kids spends maximum time in schools and it is a real place to teach. Undoubtedly, the institute is the place to enable overall growth of children. Children at that age will be able to comprehend well about the learnings. For example, at the institution they will interact with their peers and teachers. Secondly, government can help create awareness to develop good manner. This can be done by organising seminar in schools or role play.",
        "In conclusion, I believe that  teaching appropriate behaviour in children is not a sole responsibility of either of them. It should be a joint effort by parents, schools and government."
