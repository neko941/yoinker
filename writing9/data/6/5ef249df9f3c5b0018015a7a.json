        "There is no doubt that these days, working for a while after cycle 3 is a perfect way to get some practical skills. The question is it will affect young people to get a career for a few years before going to university in their life? In this essay, I am going to discuss both views and draw my own conclusion.",
        "In terms of advantages, on the job experience is one of the important requirements to secure good work. The main reason given to support this appeal is that helps students obtain more know-how by learning better about the work environment. To illustrate, many students in America have tried to find a job before going to university because help them to pay their education and get experience. In other words, they will have a big opportunity to be accepted in a company if they have the related work practice to the offered position instead of those without training any experience.",
        "However, young people who take a job for a few years before going to university will face some problems in their life. Firstly, they probably forget the basic knowledge which had been taught in school. Secondly, they need to improve their important information in their major by completing their study at the university. This is because work could become a large distraction and chances of keeping working is far greater than to the continues their study at university.",
        "In conclusion, although it is said, the academic incentive will decrease to complete their study at the university. Work experience is important to get a good job after graduating university. Therefore, I believe that chance to work between school and university is very important because this way will define me to the chosen major right for me."
