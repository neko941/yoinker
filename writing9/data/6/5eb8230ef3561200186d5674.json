    "question": "For some people, the ideal holiday is to get away from their normal routine by staying in a hotel or camping in the countryside. Others prefer to stay at home and do things they do not normally have time for. Do you think the benefits of going away on holidays outweigh its drawbacks?",

        "People have different ways to enjoy their holiday, some will go for spending the whole day finishing off pending works at home, some choose to go out of the trivial round by staying in a resort or travelling. While I accept that going away from home has some downsides, I still believe that its benefits are greater.",
        "For many people, being in familiar places and doing things they like to makes them feel healed and peaceful. They can have fun and take care of family members, which they may not have enough time to do on working days. On the contrary, being out on a trip means that they would be busy trying to take all the surroundings and amenities that take them away from bonding and spending quality time with others. Moreover, travelling is also quite expensive for accommodation, food, service charges while staying at home already eliminates all fare and hotel expenses, save on food costs because it is cheaper to cook and prepare the holiday feasts at home.",
        "On the other hand, a few temporary changes in daily life may bring tremendous  benefits. Having the chance to make time for refreshment by going to the countryside, staying away from home and office can make people isolate from routine worries. This is also a way for many people to take treatment for stress and then show higher mental abilities and increase productivity when they return to work. Moreover, getting away from the normal routine can help them broaden their mind. While going to a new place, they can meet new people and explore new things which increase their social skills and give them a new life prospect.",
        "In conclusion, although many people still think savorning the vacation by sojourning in a hotel or going for a tour is consuming and making family members separate, I am convinced that it is much better compared to staying at home for above reasons."
