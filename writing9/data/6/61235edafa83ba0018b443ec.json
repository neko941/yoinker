        "Nowadays, the world is developing rapidly and the people's living standards are improving a lot than the previous time. Therefore, some people believe that the youth generation have too many choices in their lives. In my opinion, I partly agree with this statement, but there are some backdraws of this. In this essay, I will give some opinions about this statement, especially in studying.",
        "On the one hand, people have lots of choices to decide what they learn in university because the youth have the chance to access many sources of information and explore their hobbies in the early age. Therefore, they able to make their own decisions to learn in higher level. That is different from their parents' s period, many people had to give up their studying to find a job for earning money, or get married to obey their family. In addition, nowadays people can choose to start up their own business or not. There are many organizations to provide money for the creative ideas from the youth.",
        "On the other hand, some people do not have the right for their choices in studying. Many younger people live with their strict parents who want their children to learn what parents want. Students can not pursue their dreams because they have to satisfy others' desires. Moreover, some women in the undeveloped countries are unable to go to school due to the religious rules. For instance, many Afgan girls are not allowed to learn in schools and they are forced to stop their studying. These girls have no choice except obeying the rules, but they are fighting for their right.",
        "In conclusion, people in the twenty-one century have may choices in their lives which compares to their parents, but in some cases many people are still struggling with their rights, especially in getting the permission to go to school."
