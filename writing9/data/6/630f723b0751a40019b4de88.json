        "Learning non-native languages can help children in many ways. It is believed by a few professionals that learning a second speech in the junior school is better compared to the senior high academy. I believe the limitations are greater than the benefits.",
        "One of the main advantages of learning a second tongue in primary schools is that it will help the student with their improved mental performance and will also boost their learning abilities. To explicate, young ones have uncooked brains which means they will learn quickly with a lasting impression. Secondly, mastering a foreign language can be beneficial for those students whose parents are planning to send them abroad for better opportunities because they will be given privilege over people who are not aware of the local dialect.",
        "On the other hand, the primary disadvantage of this approach is that learning a new vocabulary in grade school will add up an extra subject in the curriculum. This will take up more time for students in tests and tuition, leaving them with a short time for entertainment and games. Moreover, children may lose their ethnicity and might forget their mother tongue, this may cause the eradication of an ethnic group in the long run. Furthermore, it may not be necessary that the foreign language which they are taught will add up to their profession. To explicate, a student learning Spanish in school and later opts to become an IT professional in India, then the foreign language that he learned would not benefit him in his career."
