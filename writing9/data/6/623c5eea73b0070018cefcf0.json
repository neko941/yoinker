        "The fact that the world of work is undergoing many rapid changes has been problematic for the workforce to keep up with. The nature of work surrounding has indeed significantly been modified, but there are ways to get used to these \"modifications.\"",
        "Firstly, humankind has made many remarkable advances in technology and science in recent years, which help boost labor productivity. In detail, there is a tremendous amount of work requiring the use of technology to be finished, especially those involved in heavy industries such as oil refining, steel making, or shipbuilding; thus, the enterprises have applied mechanization in their business as a method to increase the revenue because it will multiply the production output and reduce the labor costs. Additionally, with the help of leading-edge technology, the service industries have been completely transformed; for instance, the invention of online shopping and E-commerce websites has elevated the consumption market to a new level for its convenient use and functions.",
        "However, I think that technology cannot replace human resources if the workforce is well trained and highly qualified. There are ways to make it come true; a typical approach is that the workers join more vocational courses or long-term training periods to update and master the essential skills in working environment. Next, the employees need to be equipped with knowledge and growth mindset to capture the needs of the labor market to fit in the suitable position easily. Furthermore, being technology literate is of great importance, as more and more works require the proficient use of technology; like in IT, the more you are competent, the more money you make.",
        "Although the world of work is increasingly changing, we can create our chances by following the steps to upgrade ourselves and make us suitable for the jobs."
