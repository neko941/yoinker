        "There is no doubt that art galleries have a significant role in providing much useful information to the visitors of the culture and heritage. Even though i is sometimes thought that  access to these institutions need to be free for all, in my opinion, personally believe that visitors would be charged the fees since this is essential to run these establishments smoothly.",
        "Firstly, by collecting an entry fee would be used to maintain and restore the galleries and artefacts, which may be perished due to aging. In other words, if the maintenance may be carried out by the government, this would, later, result in a huge financial burden to its taxpayers. Eventually, the vital areas of the society, for example, health care, education and infrastructures may lack funding. This may hinder the overall growth of the country substantially.  Alternatively, the amount, which would collect from the people who visited the museum can relieve financial strain on the authority.",
        "Secondly, by paying a charge  to enter these places would inculcate a feeling that  the value of these. It is often seen that the viewers  rarely understand the real intention behind these establishment. Furthermore, interested visitors take their journey seriously do all possible way to preserve these without causing any damage for the future generation. This is because the artefacts in the museum tell the cultural and historical background of them, which probably a new idea for the visitors and make them feel that they are part the system.",
        "In conclusion, although people have different views on whether visitors would be asked to pay entrance fees, or this must be free for all. I support in collecting the payment as this can be better utilizes for the development of  the country."
