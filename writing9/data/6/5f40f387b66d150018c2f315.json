        "Modernization has made nuclear families a common phenomenon in comparison to the previous century, where people used to have large families and extended families used to stay together. With the brimming competition around the world and overpopulation, the answer to, small family or large family, is contextual to a person, depending on his options at hand, feasibilities and burden baring capacity, making the selected option prone to some merits and demerits.",
        "On one hand, small families could be easier to manage financially as well as emotionally, as parents prefer to give more attention to their only child, allowing them to make unbiased decisions for him or her. Concurrently, the cost of education, is increasing day by day. In a recent study, the average cost of education from school to graduation can sum up to 2 million US dollars, which could be very difficult to bear in a large family. Also with a gender equal society, both the parents tend to work, and if they have multiple children, it could be difficult to plan their careers.",
        "On the other hand, lack of siblings, could create an emotional void for children. Children learn from what they see and a lack of siblings, robs them from a similar aged role model, bestowing that responsibility for their parents. Also larger families help children discuss certain issues with their siblings, which they are too scared to discuss with their parents. Not to mention, if someone in a small family, unfortunately dies, it could create an emotional and financial trauma in the family which could take years to recover from.",
        "In conclusion, it all depends on the planning of the family based on the financial and emotional resources they can afford to spend. There isn't a thumb rule for small families or large families, but irrespective of the size of the family a happy family is definitely what the aim should be."
