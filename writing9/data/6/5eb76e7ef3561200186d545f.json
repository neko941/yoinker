        "It is certainly true that the use of e-mail has greatly changed the way we communicate with each other at work as well as socially. However, it is my belief that not all the effects of this innovation have been positive, although there are certainly some advantages.",
        "There are several drawbacks of using e-mail. A common criticism of e-mail in the workplace is that it causes extra work and stress. This is because employees receive more messages than they can answer every day and since e-mail writers expect a quick response, this further increases pressure on employees. Other negative aspects are that e-mail for both social and professional users include the way it encourages people to spend even longer at their computers and also the danger of incoming messages allowing viruses into your computer system.",
        "In spite of these negative effects, however, e-mail has brought important benefits as well. One obvious advantage of using e-mail is that it is a fast and easy way to communicate with family, friends and work colleagues wherever they are in the world. Another positive effect is that it not only allows people to stay in touch with each other, but it also allows them to send all kinds of information (such as pictures, photos, diagrams, texts, etc. Very quickly, cheaply. This is a huge advance on earlier communication systems, and the low cost of e-mail means it is very widely used.",
        "To sum up, while there are some obvious drawbacks to using e-mail, this fast and ever-friendly technology has greatly improved our ability to communicate both professionally and socially. It seems to me that e-mail has brought us more benefits than disadvantages level."
