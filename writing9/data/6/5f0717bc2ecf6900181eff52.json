        "Living the life with no plan for tomorrow gives a sense of freedom at least in the short term period.  In this regard, some people wish to have a plan-free life in which they could decide what to do spontaneously, while others tend to have goals and vision in their life, accompanied with daily or weekly schedules.  Indeed, there is a surrounding controversy between these two approaches to life; I believe one may enjoy his/her life without any objective but at the end of the day no one can leave everything to faith and will definitely feel empty inside.",
        "In the current era of information, it is hard to find someone without desire to have something or be in some certain status; people live to achieve their goals.  As an example, almost every guy on planet loves to have a supercar, so, is it possible to own one, without the hard work?  This hard work requires punctuality, consistency and discipline which should be Incorporated in micro and macro schedules. Planning out your tomorrow is the very first step of being successful. Therefore, it is evident that a holistic approach for the people who their moto is\" Time is Gold\" will eventually lead them to success and long-term happiness. Hence, planning for the future not only is not pointless but also is essential and the key to the success.",
        "On the other hand, there is a belief that after the industrialization age, the system created this tendency for people to work like a machine, the notion which they argue gained gravity with capitalism. For instance, industries dictate the culture of consumption and production, so that people shall work almost all the day to reach to their long-term desire of a new car or a better apartment.  This trait of \" Bigger the Better\" somehow pumped the rush in people's life and forced them to work as scheduled.  Noteworthy is the fact that, success is an introversive feeling and a guy with no plan for his entire life may enjoy more than a CEO in a big enterprise Who his/her daily plan is packed with details. Thus, it should be borne in mind that despite the positive aspects of being on route to your goals, the life itself shall not be sacrificed for the mere mortal desires.",
        "In conclusion, no one can deny the real long-term happiness and success, people would probably get having their life planned, but the very notion of freedom Charlotte the ignored as well."
