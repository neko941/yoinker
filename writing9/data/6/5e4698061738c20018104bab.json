For instance, the customer id and savings account linked to it are on the welcome letter, which is also missing from the package. This credit card was linked to my personal savings account and I have a deep concern that whoever gets access to it, gets access to my saving account details. This is a very old account and I dont intend to close it. I know there are various covers for the credit card frauds but the savings account does not have any fraud protection.",

I also want an enquiry with the courier service to understand what precautions do they take to avoid such thefts at their end? May be its time for your bank to reconsider courier vendors.",
