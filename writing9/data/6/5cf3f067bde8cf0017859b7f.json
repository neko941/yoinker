        "When I checked the details of the coaching, I suddenly realised that our team lacks the advanced security handling of the servers, which is the key aspect of this training and it will be beneficial for our company if any person from the networking division joins this course. As you know, last year, we face the security threat due to some third party attack on our servers and our organisation also suffer from severe loss, so, in my opinion, this can help us strengthen our firewalls and networks.",
