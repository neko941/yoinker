        "It is believed by some individuals that big establishments and the government are the only ones who can influence the society to be better and not the citizens of such country. In my opinion, I totally disagree with this idea because the people own the environment, they live and work there, so it is their responsiblitity to either make or mar their environment.",
        "Firstly, a community comprises of individuals living or working together, hence, the responsibility of caring for the place lies on them. Furthermore, adopting simple attribute such as avoiding dumping of refuse inappropriately or preventing the emission of air pollutants from car engines and domestic fumes will contribute to the overall maintenance of the surrounding. For example, Malaysia became one of the neatest countries worldwide because every home was mandated to have minimum of 2 garbage bin and every of the street corners within the city was also provided with refuse bin. Thus, the earlier the indigienes stand up o their responsibilty, the better for them.",
        "Secondly, little drops of water makes an ocean. In essence, if everyone constantly imbibe an attitude of cleanliness constantly, it will culminateinto having an enviable society. For instance, it is a rule in my community that every household  must be involved in weekly sanitation in the neighbourhood and this simple practice has paid off for us due to the fact that in the last 5 years, there has been no need for the authorities to repair or replace anything.",
        "In conclusion, waiting for the government of large companies to make a difference in a geographical location is synonymous to laziness on the part of the dwellers. Hence, maintenance of a locality should be done by the locals themselves."
