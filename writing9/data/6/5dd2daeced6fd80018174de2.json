        "I am writing this letter to share my testimony for the short cooking course of making Punjabi curries, which I completed from your school last month.",
        "First and foremost, I liked the duration and practicality of the course. Although, there were many dishes to prepare and learn, curriculum was extensive enough to cover all. In addition to that, I enjoyed learning new ways to prepare same curries from other team members and learnt to give personalised touch of making dishes spicy.",
        "Post completion of the course, I moved to Europe.. Here I need to cook myself  everyday due to my dietary restrictions, but fortunately, because of what I learned from the course, I enjoy cooking every day. I try to prepare different dishes every alternate day.. I spend 45 minutes cooking daily.",
        "Since I enjoy Indian sweets, I am excited to learn to cook deserts especially made from chickpea flour, sugar and condensed milk. Hence, I request you to conduct a course on the same.",
        "I recommend this course to all cooking enthusiasts and look forward to learning new dishes in future.",
        "Yours faithfully,",
        "Mr. Manan Trivedi."
