        "Technological advances have a profound impact on the way people work. With the advent of high-speed telecommunication and videoconferencing systems, employees can now work from the comfort of their homes rather than travelling to the office daily. This essay argues that a remote work option has not only eliminated the commute time and reduced employee work stress, but also increased the communication gap among the team members.",
        "Through remote working, employees can save their travel time and also maintain their work-life balance. Travelling to work consumes a major portion of an individual\u2019s time, and through telecommuting, they can use this time for personal and professional benefits. For example, through a remote working option, companies like IBM not only enhanced their employee job satisfaction but also significantly reduced workforce attrition. Work-related stress will automatically reduce with less time to travel and better job satisfaction. Furthermore, happy and productive employees lead to better customer satisfaction and more profits for the organization. To confirm this, in a recent Harvard Business Review study, organizations with remote work option for the employees are 20% more profitable compared to organizations that don\u2019t give a telecommuting option. Thus, work from home not only enhances employee satisfaction, but also increases profits for the organization.",
        "On the contrary, distributed teams working at different locations result in communication gaps and the remote working option doesn\u2019t suit all kinds of job profiles. Teams that don\u2019t work together at a single location often have difficulty in resolving verbal and non-verbal communication issues. Unless there are clear tools and processes defined, remote working will cause a massive drop in productivity for the teams. Moreover, customer-facing roles like cashiers, shop floor employees, top management of the organization, etc should be always available at the location and can\u2019t have work from home option. Thus, if not properly planned, remote working can result in a tremendous drop in productivity and customer satisfaction.",
        "In summary, the digital era has significantly transformed the way people work. While telecommuting has significant advantages as improving employee satisfaction and reducing employee travel time, it can also result in drastic communication gaps among the team members. A well planned and the co-ordinated remote working option is beneficial to both the employees and the organizations."
