        "Human beings are always remained curious to know about history because it is the only way to search how human life has progressed from past to present. But some thinkers have opposite views. Here, In this essay, i will discuss both these views with my opinion.",
        "On the one hand, those who believe that learning from past is useless in the present life give some supportive views in favor.First is that life scenario has changed to a great extent. So, past knowledge is meaningless in today\u2019s life. For example, To a study of 13th century has no use because now we are living in 21st century and have different needs and demands that can\u2019t be fulfilled by the reading of 13th century. Secondly, It is a wise saying that we should forget to past to move forward so in this stiff competitive world, to reach to heights and to grow in future the learn of present is in demand. In addition to it, there are many subjects like science and mathematics that are far more useful than history. Therefore, wasting time on history, it is far better to study these subjects for future inventions and developments.",
        "On the other hand, I acceded with them but everything has its own importance and the same thing applies on history.\u00a0 History gives us clues about how life develops from different stages and reaches the present. Moreover, from past it can be learned which mistakes our ancestors had done and what results they had faced. For Instance, world war first and world war second. The knowledge of the reasons of these wars can be useful to avoid to the third world war. Nobody can forget the destruction caused by atom bombs . It is massage for this generation how dangerous can be the use of atom bombs.",
        "In the conclusion, Though people believe that learning past has no use in the today\u2019s life but we can not neglect the benefits of past history because it only way to know how we reach in present."
