        "Everybody wants to achieve some balance between their work and life. However, they may not unfortunately be to manage to do this. There are several reasons for this. There are also some solutions.",
        "Having the right priorities is essential for achieving work life balance. For example, people who put their family above work must not commit the mistake of accepting a job that requires them to spend long hours at the workplace. Hence, for people who really want to find some time for themselves and their family, it is better to choose a job with reasonable working hours and salary. In other words, it is essential to set our priorities right before we can even attempt to achieve work life balance.",
        "Time management is also crucial. Every person wastes a lot of time in a day doing things that are useless. For example, most people these days spend inordinate amounts of time on social media. They are just wasting this time because there is nothing that they can accomplish by updating their social media status on an hourly basis. Another factor that hurts work life balance is the employee\u2019s tendency to bring work home. This must be avoided unless it is really important.",
        "To conclude, knowing one\u2019s priorities is the key to achieving proper work life balance. Time management is crucial. Having realistic goals and ambitions is equally important."
