        "These days, most of the people like to celebrate any special occasion by inviting a lot of people. The discussion that throwing too much money to hold parties like birthday, marriage or any other special events is a debatable one, with strong logic provided by supporters of both views. A few argue that the special events need to be celebrated grandly, as it happens a few times in a lifetime. For instance, marriage is considered to occur once in a lifetime and people want to have the memory of that event until their last breath. This is possible only when the location is well decorated and all of the friends and neighbours are invited. By spending limited money, it is almost impossible to achieve something special which will be remembered forever. Thus it is obvious why some people incline towards this point of view.On the other hand, some people believe that it is not right to spend a huge amount of money on personal celebrations as there are a lot of people across the globe under starvation. For example, in most of the African countries, many people do not even have food to eat for a single meal a day. In this case, the money spent on celebration can be sent to the people who are really in need, definitely, a lot of lives can be saved. Hence, it is clear why a few individuals refute high spending parties.Considering the memories of special occasions as well as starvation, spending much money for parties has been supported and refuted by many. Even though memories of some special events are important, saving of human life from starvation is more important. Hence, in my opinion, it is necessary to cut down the spending on parties and spend that money on poor peoples' food."
