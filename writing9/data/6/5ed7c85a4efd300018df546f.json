        "In recent decades, the quantity of adolescents with obesity has drastically increased.While some people claim that ministry is liable for the infants' obesity, others believe that children overweight is the parents responsibility.In my opinion, the latter approach appears more liable for adolescents.",
        "On the one hand, it is clear that authority should take a responsibility of obesity in children.Firstly,  these days more and more people rely on fast food or pre-prepared meals, which contain too much fat, salt and sugar.To be more specific, these foods are attractive to children because they are cheap to buy and very easy to prepare. As a result , an unhealthy food can cause various problems such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease and cancer as well as obesity. Moreover , a paper published by Dr Robert Watson, a world renowned specialist, reveals that the reason for infant's obesity is that more than 58% of children are eating fast food in schools.",
        "Parents, on the other hand,  should care about the weight of their adolescents. First and foremost, the philosophy about everything begins from home, it make sense that environment of home reflect to infants habit.For instance , mostly overweight children have uncontrolled eating habit by their parents, so infants prefer consuming unhealthy foods without knowing the dire effects to their body.Secondly , parents are really busy with working, so they cannot manage well about their children meal  as they just provide some money to theira children for having a lunch.In additional, infants choose to lead a sedentary lifestyle.In particular, in their leisure time, they watch television or go online as well as play video game instead of doing outdoor activities.",
        "To sum up, both the ministry and parents can play an indispensable role in preventing Child obesity.The ministry should regulate the food industry and parents should serve healthy home cooked meals, and encourage to play outdoor sports."
