        "Although many believe that educating girls and boys in the same schools is beneficial, others, including me think that separate schooling is a better option.  Mixed schooling at times creates embarrassments while attending separate schools improves confidence in answering questions.",
        "On the one hand, mixed schooling is said to be effective for both genders because they pretend to behave well in front of opposite genders and study beforehand just to show off their talents. For example, In India many schools are mixed gender, both girls and boys prepare their lessons beforehand to be able to answer questions asked by teachers, thus to create a good impression in front of other gender. As well as to this, they participate in sports to win and get girls attention and hence behaviour is noticed to be well mannered. Thus mixed schools have only attention seeker impact on each other and not suited for actual learning process.",
        "On the other hand, separate schooling develops confidence while answering to questions asked by school teachers. As, they do not have to fear for facing embarrassments in front of opposite gender if answers go wrong. They confidently ask questions if not understood and they seem to feel more comfortable in asking more clarity on unclear subject. For instance, Science practical conducted in mixed gender schools in regards to learning function of human private parts could create embarrassments and questions are not asked to clarify detailed information on it. Thus separate schooling is more effective in educating girls and boys.",
        "In conclusion, although mixed schools are thought to be effective, it could put students in awkward situation at times. Whereas same gender schooling is indeed very beneficial for both genders as discussed above and I strongly agree on this notion."
