        "Most people would agree that all animals species in wild nature should be protected. There is a different of opinions, however, others consider that only rare wild animals ought to be keep safe in the wildlife. In this essay, I will examine both points of views and then state my own opinion.",
        "Those who support the protection of every wild animal claimed that loss of species could break a balance of ecosystem, and of course this activity might affect environment. It means, every creature is linked each other like chain. For example, if one species of animals are getting  wipe out even they are violent animals, undoubtedly this process may contribute to be extinction among other types. Hence, these supporters always want not to disturb on biodiversity and they suggested that illegal hunting or poaching should be restricted by low.",
        "Meanwhile, opponents of them claim that the government should protect some animals that are entered \u201cRed Book\u201d because of their number is declining extremely. There are numerous illnesses which are incredibly dangerous for human life. This is because an animal testing is one of the affective way to save lives and create new treatment. That\u2019s why some type of animals are crucial factor such as rabbits, rets and so on, in laboratory.",
        "In conclusion, there are convincing argument on both sides of the discussion, but I believe that an appropriate way is testing on animals and sacrificing them for human safety. Not only humans but also animals might be wiped out because of infectious diseases like COVID 19, unless this way is used."
