        "Many of the skilled professionals such as doctors and teachers are likely to work in developed nations. In the following essay, problem and solution for the migration will be discussed respectively.",
        "Firstly, shortage of skilled professionals like doctors and teachers will be the major consequence of such migrations, which further results in lack of medical assistance for the unhealthy and academic assistance for the students. in such scenario, as these two sectors play a vital role in the society, the life of common people will fall short of these requirements. For example, if a particular resource is abundant the costing of that service will be affordable, which can be served to one and all.",
        "And there are multiple solutions to this problem. One of the solutions is to provide a good grade of pay and allowances to the professionals with respect to the quality of service provided. Furthermore, the thought of unsatisfied skilled doctor or a teacher with the current salary system who are opting to moveout of the country can be vanished which further helps the system to use their services. For instance, the quality of life depends on pay scale and standard of living, therefore this solution will clear the major part of the problem of migrating professionals.",
        "In conclusion, the increase in the problem of migration of skilled professionals to the developed countries from their own will show and significant impact on medical and education systems and can be avoid by providing good salaries and allowances as per the quality of services provided."
