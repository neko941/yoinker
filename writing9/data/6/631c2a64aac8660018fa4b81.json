        "Nowadays, with the development of technology, scion tend to watch television in their free time. They prefer watching television to playing some outdoor activities. So what are the benefits and drawbacks of being friends with television? In this essay, I will discuss some pros of watching TV and some harmful effects if children spend too much time on this activity.",
        "Let\u2019s start by looking at the advantages of using television to entertain. One of the main positives of watching TV is that children can obtain plenty of knowledge and skill even learning and giving information from around the world. Today, so many programs are a source of information about news, culture, science and nature, \u2026 For example, if one person wants to learn about some countries\u2019 culture but cannot afford to come there, he or she can give information and experience by watching some travel programs. Secondly, watching television is also an activity that family members can do together, bringing an opportunity to narrow the generation gap. Any family members can talk, share and comment about the movies or the programs that they are watching therefrom family will become more and more harmonious.",
        "Turning to the other side of the argument, spending so much time on TV can lead to some eye diseases. For instance, on the weekend, children may spend all day watching TV because of the attraction of interesting programs and movies. This activity makes eyes overworked, which is the reason why children may disease such as eyestrain and short-sightedness, \u2026Another major drawback is that can be isolated children from other friends or people. What I mean by this is that children only use their time for watching television but do not use this for playing some outdoor activities with their friends. They may become more and more have distance from other people and even meet trouble with some social communication.",
        "All things considered, watching television can bring two sides to the problem. The parent should let children watch TV for a specific period of time, and avoid watching too much. Personally, I believe the benefits in terms of broadening knowledge eventually outweigh any negatives."
