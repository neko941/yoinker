        "It is widely opined by vast majority of individuals that governments should levy a tariff on junk food because the number of health risks associated with consuming this kind of food is on the rise. Personally, I consent to the hilt that a higher rate of tax should be paid by fast food companies. Notwithstanding, this discourse will delve into the fact that alcohol and tobacco companies already pay higher taxes, and subsequently explore how higher taxes could raise prices and lower consumption.",
        "Apparently, higher excise on liqueur and cigarettes has proven to be successful at curbing the harm caused by these substances. Not only restraining this harms, but this revenue also has been used to treat health problems associated with these products and has proven useful in advertising campaigns warning people about the dangers of alcohol and tobacco abuse. Tax from fast food could be used in the same way. Taking United State of America for instance, where money from smokers is used to treat lung cancer and heart diseases, while at the same time, pumped into health campaigns in schools to warn children about the dangers of smoking.",
        "Conversely, increasing taxes would raise prices and lower consumption. Fast food companies would pass on these taxes to consumers in the form of higher prices and this would lead to people not being able to afford junk food because it is too expensive. Junk food would soon become a luxury item and would be less harmful to the general public's health. To illustrate, the cost of organic food has proven prohibitively expensive for most people and that is why only a small percentage of the population buy it regularly.",
        "In conclusion, I reiterate that junk food should be taxed at a higher rate because of the good precedent set by alcohol and tobacco and with such high tax rates, the amount of fast food people buy would reduce as a result of the increased cost of those junk food items."
