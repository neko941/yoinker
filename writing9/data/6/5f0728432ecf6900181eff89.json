        "In recent years, the lifestyle of workers has never failed to attract people attention. At the heart of matter is the discussion of whether the government should limit the working hours or not. In my opinion, I strongly agree with this policy.",
        "Working long hours has an adverse impact on employee life. Workers are so immersed in their jobs that they have a tendency to live a high pressured and stressful life style frequently and overlook the recreational activities. This lifestyle increases the chance that they suffer many physical and psychological problems such as splitting headaches, Alzheimer\u2019s disease or even feelings of isolation. Besides, because of spending most of their time working, they miss out on the joys of life. The only time they can enjoy their life is after their retirement.",
        "Over working staff not only puts them at a disadvantage but also hampers the development of companies and society. Many studies have pointed out that a person\u2019s productivity and concentration in a day is limited. Employees, therefore, cannot pay attention to what they are doing if they constantly experience long working hours. In many cases, this leads to the shutdown of production line and causes tremendous damage to their company as well as to society in general.  It explains why a lot of successful firms do not force their staff to work overtime.",
        "Disadvantageous as it is, working in long hours still occurs in many countries. Owing to various different backgrounds such as deficient finance, many employees work until midnight. Therefore, the authorities are recommended to have appropriate policy to address this issue. (We will work on this paragraph later)",
        "In conclusion, everything has its double-edged impact. However, based on the above-mentioned facts, I believe that its flaws always outweigh its benefits. The government should accordingly have further consideration on it."
