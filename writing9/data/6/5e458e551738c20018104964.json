        "In the modern world, science has played an important role in our lives. We can see the wonders of technology all around us everyday and we use them in order to make our day better. There is no denying the fact that Science and technology have made our life easier and this essay will discuss about the same.",
        "In the past, travelling from one place to another took days or even weeks, but after the invention of Trains, Buses, we can reach to our destination within hours. These inventions not only helped us in travel but also brought employment and became the source of income for many people. Apart from that, the most important invention of technology is the Internet. The Internet has now become an important aspect of our lives. For instance, we used to wait for weeks in order to know the welfare of our dear ones and now we can simply email them in seconds.",
        "The technology is advancing day by day, as a result of which we are able to see more and more inventions everyday. We are living in the world of robots and artificial intelligence and we can see both in most of the machines now. For example, Tesla motors, a world famous car manufacturer, build auto driver electric cars. We don't need a driver in order to drive that car. We can now order food online and pay for the same online.",
        "In conclusion, science has improved our way of living and help us in everyday tasks. The advancement in  technology not only creates new products but also gives employment to a large number of people. We are using machines for almost all things and thus it concludes that science and technology has made our lives easier."
