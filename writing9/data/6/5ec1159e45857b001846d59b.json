        "There is a point that parents should teach kids about humanity and the most common ways to be an essential and appropriate person among others. Nevertheless, there is another point that studying at school and getting a knowledge about humanity from school teachers is the best place to carry out this. In my opinion, it is a good idea that kids should get educated about society from their parents. It would be superb to get experience from people who grow up you because they passed a great way in order to be an important individual among other people.",
        "",
        "The first view, in terms of getting much more knowledge about society a few people consider that it would be better parents to educate their kids about moral and culture. Because, in their point of view, parents have a great experience and they know much better than whoever how to behave among public and how to be a person who will contribute to the development of mankind. For instance, they can tell their kids about the mistakes which they had done in the course of their life and share invaluable experience which they have.",
        "",
        "The second view is that teachers or someone else in educational organizations should teach kids how to avoid mistakes, and develop their own sense of being a good individual among public and contribute as much as possible in order to build a bright future. They think so because school might be the best place to learn it, for instance, kids will read literature which is playing an essential role in developing a sense of decency, civilised behaviour.  Or while they are studying at school they can make a mistake or they might have a bad behaviour which will be corrected by the teacher and they will be told about the rules of behaving in public. Teachers will help kids develop their skills and point out on mistakes that they have made.",
        "",
        "In conclusion,  I would say that both of this views have their benefits and drawbacks, however despite this fact, In my opinion kids had better to get an education from parents because no one except parents will take care of kids, and they will do their best in order to grow up an ideal individual. Although teachers will teach kids how to be a helpful person in public as well, however it is not enough, because there a lot of kids who study at school and teachers will have no time to each of them and it can lead to some bad consequences."
