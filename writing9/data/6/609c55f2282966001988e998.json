        "Some people believe that parents should encourage a teenager to do more physical exercise, even though this possibly means less time spent on studies. Considering the declining health of many students, I agree with this opinion.",
        "Indeed, because the juvenile is silly and naive, parents should guide their adolescent to do something. Many times youth are influenced by their peers, and they will do something about mishaven. At this time, parents should intervene in the exchange or encourage children to do not.",
        "Of course, the kid really spends too much time  learning. At any age, primary or secondary, they have endless homework or assessment to complete. In addition, they need another day to preview and review. In this way, children will not have time to participate in social activities such as community exercise, sports sports sports games, etc., which is not conducive to their all-round development.",
        "In addition, even if there is time, students are not willing to be relevant to do sth to participate in sports because they think it is too time-consuming, But in fact, physical activities are very conducive to children's physical development. For example, running can exercise students' cardiopulmonary and respiratory functions, Even endurance stamina. and sports activities such as basketball and football can cultivate social skills such as communication skills and leadership skills of children, which are lacking by those busy with being taken with the study."
