        "The wealth gap separating the rich and the poor is growing. This might lead to several effects to the country economy and social security. However, once we understand these causes, solutions can be devised to counteract them.",
        "There are some problems which were the result of this widening gap. First of all, The income inequality is closely linked to economic crisis. People who are under the poverish line cannot have as many opportunities in jobs and services as wealthy people. As a consequence, this might lead to the high rate of unemployment and poverty, and later could have a negative effect on the economic growth of the country. Second, without having enough money to provide their basic needs, poor people may turn into criminal paths to steal other people\u2019s properties or sell drugs, which could help them have an amount of money to live.",
        "Since these issues are serious, the government should have the responsibility to improve the poor\u2019s life and decline the crime rate. Firstly, they should invest in better education for poor people such as vocational training so as to help them find a stable job in the near future. The leaders can provide more scholarships for students who cannot afford the tuition fees to encourage them attend to higher education and gain higher positions in their jobs. Secondly, the head of the country should tighten the security of the nation. They could reduce tax for low-income residents like in Vietnam, famiy who has lower than 10 million per month doesn\u2019t need to pay personal tax. Furthermore, strict laws should be placed to prevent the poor from committing the crimes.",
        "In conclusion, an increase in crime rate and economic chaos is the consequence of the wide gap between the rich people and poor one. However, there are still several solutions for the government to take action to reduce the bad effects caused by this gap."
