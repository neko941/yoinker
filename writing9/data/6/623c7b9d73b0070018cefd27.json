        "Most people would opine that most sportsmen and artists become successful due to their natural  talent.  however , another group would oppose this opine ,claiming that any youngster can be taught to become a good sportsman or artist even though they do not have any inborn talents. Although some people may inherit their talent genetically , most children who have enthusiasm about these fields can become  good artists or sportspeople, this writer opines that any person with good ambition would teach these talents .",
        "To begin with,  the talents such as music , arts , dancing and sports  are not commonly present in every person in the community . Moreover, some young children  may express their  talents at such a young age may be inherited from their parents , because  most of the parents of these talented children were known artists and sports personals .  For example , most of the young singers who participate in the Derana little star , a Sri Lankan reality show were  children of known singers in the country . hence, we have to accept the fact that  talent can naturally come to a child.",
        "On the other hand, most talented people in the fields of sports and arts came from mainly by practising rather than using their natural talents . Furthermore , they all have significant enthusiasm about these fields and most of the time they were taught by one of the good teachers in the field. For example , great Sri Lankan cricketer Kumar Sangakkara was once said , that he has become a good cricketer due to practice rather than using his natural talents . Hence , we have to accept that, any young child can become a talented person by teaching.",
        "In summary , even though some people argue about  the requirement of talent over the  practice to  become a good sportsman or artist , there is enough evidence in the world that , talented personals can be generated by teaching . Hence this writer believes that  any young person with a good target and  commitment can become a pioneer in sports or arts ,even without an inborn talent ."
