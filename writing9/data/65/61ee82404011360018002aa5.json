In my opinion, I strongly agree that almost people need to eat healthy food or drink and behave gently.",
        "On the one hand, I assure that eating unhealthy food or drink causes an unhealthy body. For instance, food containing more cholesterol is bringing to a lot of threatening diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, and some kind of food or alcoholic beverages may cause cancer diseases. In fact, we require to choose food that is good for health like fish, fruits, non- alcoholic beverages,...",
        "On the other hand, I believe that we will become a good men when we behave gently. For example, many people don't like the man that always takes the cigarettes in his mouth or uses a lot of alcohol. Besides, all people always love the man that likes to help everyone, on working or ordinary lifestyle. Moreover, avoiding unhealthy habits and doing exercise regularly will bring to us a wonderful life.",

That means when we consume healthy food or drink and do the best habits, they will do like that things. As a result, our life will have plenty of beautiful things."
