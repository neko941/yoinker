        "Nowadays the modernization of cities attract people from the rural area. In urban ,areas peoples get everything easily accessible. The plethora of reasons  to explain this attraction and also a few causes that are happening to this trend also.This essay will articulate the notions in the coming paragraph.",
        "Let's begin with the reasons, Humans prefer to live in  advanced places because of the advancement of technology and  the smooth access to their  basic  amenities like jobs,Education and so on. Most of the reputed educational sectors are  held in metropolitan cities . Moreover, Many companies prefer their candidates  to  stay in the city side also because of the uninterrupted communications. Teenagers  also like to accommodate in those fields because of their progress in their studies . For Example, In the rural , areas there has the limitations to the internet, transport and so on Because of this reason students do not achieve their ambitions properly so they transfer to live in cities. The facilities are more accessible in urban areas than in rural",
        "As a result, The cost of living in the cities surged and also the traffic  increased. Due to the increased use of vehicles on the road ,  air pollution have also increased. This cause many health issues like  allergy,asthma and so on. Moreover , the majority of people leave their agricultural job ,As a ,result there is a shortage of food in the markets. Because of this lack of food sources, the government should import food from  other states. These are the results that we have seen in these migration trends",
        "To conclude,These days people prefer to stay in the metropolitan because of the advancements in technology and the easily accessible  amenities. This tends to have some positive and negative consequences. Although this will manage by our government authorities"
