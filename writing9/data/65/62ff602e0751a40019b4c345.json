        "There is a thought that says education in a second language should be initiated at primary school. I can't entirely agree with this idea, and I think the drawbacks of this method overshadow the benefits.",
        "Early learning of a new language can be confusing for many students. Children may not have enough learning capacity to learn a new language at primary school. As a result, they will be discouraged from education. On the other side, there certainly are some talented students ready to learn a foreign language early in their lives, and these exceptional students can go to foreign language classes separately, so it will be a good idea to have optional foreign language classes at primary schools. As a result, it will help both types of students not to be pressured and not to be wasted, respectively.",
        "On the other hand, learning a second language in the early years of life is more manageable. There needed less energy for children in the first years of school to get familiar with another language. We also know that knowing a foreign language boosts one's career. So by teaching a second language earlier, the children will be more successful in their future professional life. In Iran, the study of the English language begins in secondary school. Had our generation studied English earlier, we would have gotten more successful in our jobs. Consequently, earlier education in a foreign language helps the next generation to have better careers.",
        "For the reasons mentioned above, I believe that it's not a good idea to start teaching primary students a foreign language, generally. But because knowing a second language can be beneficial, there should be options for exceptional students to take second language classes separately."
