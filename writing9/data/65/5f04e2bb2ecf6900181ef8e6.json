        "The world we are living in is growing into an enormous melting pot. As we all know that nuclear energy is one of the main kinds of energy used in our lives. Although there are drawbacks of nuclear technology,  I believe that the benefits of nuclear technology outperform the disadvantages. This is because the energy produced by nuclear means is both affordable and clean.",
        "There is actually one common drawback for nuclear energy among people: the use of this energy in nuclear weapons. Nuclear weapons threats the humanity all over the world.People continue to hear from the news many about many nuclear bombs that destroy a certain place. For example, terrorist attacks mainly use nuclear weapons and bombs which can kill millions of people. Nevertheless, these incidents can not be a reason to say that all consumptions of nuclear energy is bad.",
        "To my mind, nuclear technology has two main advantages among many other benefits. First, nuclear power offers a very clean energy compared to other forms of energy. By this way, our environment will not be polluted through the use of this energy. Second, this energy do not cost a lot of money. For example, nuclear power plants provide fuel for cars to work. As a result, this kind of energy is sustainable and important for the humanity.",
        "In conclusion, there are both advantages and disadvantages for nuclear technology. However, I wholeheartedly think that the benefits surpass the drawbacks. Most importantly that it saves our environment from air pollution."
