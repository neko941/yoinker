        "According to some people, voluntary work is needed to be included with the major courses in the secondary school curriculum. Although I believe, it will benefit the students by extending their practical knowledge, that should be added as an optional subject as this might hamper studies for a number of students.",
        "Performing social work will broaden the level of student\u2019s horizons. While commuting such tasks with aid, health, social or educational organizations, the pupil is likely to be introduced with life-oriented issues such as, health care, process of cleanliness, socializing, knowledge sharing and so on. Gradually, these participants will not only grow a sense of responsibility in them, but also become empathetic to others. Moreover, volunteers will also achieve work handling competencies, which they can use later in their life. Thus, community service helps the youngsters to grow as a person. For instance, it has been observed by many business organizations that the employees, who were assigned to voluntary work in their early life, are more managerial at the office and home than others.",
        "However, incorporating community service as a mandatory subject in the school syllabus might restrain the main purpose of the education. It cannot be denied that, not every child have the same capacities in terms of physical and mental specifications. Moreover, the secondary school syllabus is already filled up with an extended number of text books and other learning programs. Therefore, associating with unpaid work will let them overburden and less time remain in hand to complete their studies. Despite this, it would be appreciable if the pedagogues thought to add this as an elective course with the main one. This will relax the children to choose with their own interest and give their best. For example, a survey conducted by monster.com reveals that those adolescents usually are the best performer in extra-curriculum activities, who are keen to do that by their own.",
        "In conclusion, including social service with the core learning program will bring advantages for the youngsters as their knowledge will be expanded with practical experiences. Nevertheless, in my opinion, students should be given the freedom of choice; this will make them better executer at extra activities and not hinder their education."
