        "While many people recognize the importance of having access to public parks, others argue that this space could better serve communities by being used for housing or business developments. Although it is undeniable that such initiatives would create jobs and boost the local economy, I would argue that the green space in cities serves an equally important purpose in local people\u2019s lives and that neighborhood parks can be maintained while also being used to generate revenue for cities.",
        "",
        "First of all, access to green space is essential for human happiness, and this is especially important in crowded cities. Parks offer people an escape from crowds and traffic which is beneficial to individuals\u2019 health as well as to the well-being of a community. One could argue that having a collectively healthier and happier society would increase productivity in all facets of commerce and help create and maintain a robust and sustainable economy.",
        "",
        "Moreover, in addition to providing a place for people to relax, local parks can be used to generate revenue in several ways. Cities can use their parks to stage events such as art fairs and music festivals and allow local shops and restaurants to sell do business there during  such events. This would directly benefit local businesses as well as bring the community together. City governments could also establish community gardens in their parks and rent individual plots to local residents. A project such as this would benefit the city economically while providing a community garden to supply a farmers\u2019 market in the park.",
        "",
        "In conclusion, I strongly disagree with the argument that city parks would be better used as housing or commercial zones. My belief is that parks play an important role in human happiness and can also be used to boost local economies while creating a sense of community."
