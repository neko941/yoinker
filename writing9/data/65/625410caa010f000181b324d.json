        "Let me explain how things turned out. I have finally been accepted into an accounting program at Canada College and my classes will start on September 22 TH. My program is a two-year full-time course but, I won\u2019t have classes on Friday. My family is not following me in Montreal. I rented a studio  downtown. I have saved some money to pay my tuition and my cost-life only per six months. So, I\u2019ll need a part-time job to help me pay my bills after this period, because I don\u2019t want to spend all my parents\u2019 money.",
        "I was wondering if you can help me to find a part-time job. I tough that you can give me some useful tips as I don\u2019t know how to create a curriculum in the Canadian model, or what websites or places should I look for a job. I\u2019m willing to work in restaurants, stores or offices. I really appreciate it if you can help in this initial moment in my life.",
