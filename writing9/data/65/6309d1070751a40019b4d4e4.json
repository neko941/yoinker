        "\"Any can do it\"; Everything is possible in this world. Some communities believe that genuine talent is not a required thing to become rich and famous in the arts meanwhile genuine talent has  important in this world to be successful in their life. In this essay, I will discuss this matter and then I will give my opinion on this matter.",
        "On the one side, Genuine talent will never spoil the life of any person. Genuine talent has its own importance and builds a significant career. People with talent will be strong and express their views naturally. Nowadays, multiple TV shows are being conducted around the world to filter the people with real talent. For instance, ETV in India is one of the famous channels where Telugu singers are filtered. And another good example is, India's Best Dancer is one of the best dance shows to know the talents of the best dancers.",
        "On the other side, Without talent in arts, most people are getting settled well due to their glamour and influence on  society. For instance, In Korea, there are many dancers and singers who have  importance in  society based on their outlook and fame but not on their talent. Without genuine talent, these people are becoming famous and getting settled well in their life.",
        "To sum up, In my view, Both talented and untalented people are getting famous and building their careers in the arts. But genuine talent has  great importance and people in society have an admirable opinion of their talents. Genuine talents will  never be replaceable with other talents."
