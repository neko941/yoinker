        "It is true that delaying childbirth has become an increasingly popular trend among many spouses. This problem happens due to some reasons, and it can have a serious negative impact on not only family but also the community as a whole.",
        "There are two primary reasons why some people do not have the intention of embarking on(can thiep vao, ba tay vao)  parenthood when they are in the early stages of their life. The main cause of this problem is that they desire to enjoy their life to the fullest as a couple and follow  their leisure pursuits. If they become parents, bringing up their offspring will be certainly their top-priority. Therefore, these couples have to spend most of their time staying at home and taking care of their babies instead of chatting or going shopping as they are still single. Another contributing factor is that it might be a huge challenge for newly-wed couples to have a baby while they are not able to support their family financially. In fact, raising children is costly so that they will wait until they can accumulate enough money to ensure a better life.",
        "However, this tendency could have negative consequences in terms of family and society as well. The first impact is that having children late will result in a significant gap between both generations. For example, children may find it challenging to communicate with their parents due to the age gap, which can eventually weaken the family bond. Another negative effect is that children will be less physically healthy when they are given birth late. Some health experts claimed that getting pregnant after 35 years old sometimes carries potential health risks for both mothers and babies. Consequently, this exerts a negative impact on the future workforce.",
        "In conclusion, deciding against having children when they are young is caused by several factors and this problem might bring about several damages which should not be overlooked."
