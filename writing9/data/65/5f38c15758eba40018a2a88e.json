        "There are currently a significant number of TV channels that broadcast men\u2019s sports instead of women\u2019s games. Several factors may contribute to this trend; I would argue TV channels should balance the amount of time spending on men\u2019s contests program and women\u2019s competition show",
        "In the one hand, there are some reasons why this tendency happens. To begin with, games played by men have more viewer than women, which might make TV stations give men\u2019s athletics show a higher priority. For example, regarding football, men\u2019s match attracts millions of people to watch, while the figure for women was remarkably lower. As a result, TV broadcasters would focus on men\u2019s sports show to increase rates. If TV channel networks, pay more attention to women\u2019s sport, they could earn less profit. Additionally, because many people think physical competitions which need strength, stamina and agility, sports suit only men. This might lead to a reduction in the number of women participating in athletes compared to men. Therefore, the figure of the game played by females is not enough to disseminate.",
        "On the other hand, I believe TV transmitters should proffer equal attention for women\u2019s sport and men\u2019s sport. Firstly, these days, many viewers are interested in games played by women. For instance, exercises on the apparatus is an attractive show and many people like this. As a result, TV enterprises should pay more attention to these shows in order to satisfy their viewers. Furthermore, broadcasting companies need to balance the programs for both women and men to avoid gender inequality.",
        "In conclusion, while TV channels spend more time on men\u2019s sport is caused by some elements, I believe television should give equal time for both."
