However, tourism has some key factors which will increase the amount of visitors to the overseas or decrease.",
        "These days, clearly evident that tourist sector can get top place in the list where economy develop because of tourism and due to the amount of people who come to see the country. Moreover, developing tourism in the country opens variety work place for them who cannot find a job. Developing overseas, such as Turkey, Thailand, Egypt focuses more and more, hence the majority of income comes from tourism into country budget. Firstly, how tourist choose convenient country for a holiday, what criteria and requirement should be covered. In my point of view, that condition and services are crucial for human. If countries do not demonstrate good services and condition those countries will not get rely from tourist.",
        "Nevertheless, tourism sector can bring potentially grow up in education facilities. Local people can get change to improve knowledge, language due to flow of to international tourists. Although, people start to focus learning languages for getting nice job.",
        "In conclusion, tourism industries provide many advantages as for countries as for local people. Consequently, if humans will use current sector for right way the economy of the countries will be increased dramatically and have reached top developed countries in the world."
