        "Nowadays, more and more people work longer hours and for that reason, they do not get more leisure time for their own activities and for family also. Some people think that long working hours do not reflect the modern lifestyle needs and It should be reduced to give individuals more free time to stay with their families. I strongly agree with this notion and I think that a long working week should be deducted. I will explain my reasons for it in the following paragraphs.",
        "Firstly, the lengthy job hours should be reduced so that people can find more free time to spend with their parents and families, this is because due to hectic schedules employers do not get sufficient amount of time to stay with their families. Secondly, nowadays people are suffering from health problems like overweight and diabetes due to less exercise and yoga. For instance, If the companies and the government will reduce the working hours of individuals from 9am to 5pm to 9am to 3pm then it  helps individuals to spend quality  time in exercise and yoga, which are more crucial for people to fit and refresh their mood along with their job.",
        "Furthermore, it is necessary for every person to keep a balance between their professional and personal life. To illustrate this, due to hectic working schedules they do not get more time for their own hobbies and that is also one reason they fall in stress. For example, the German government allow their citizen to work only 28  hours  a week as a result, people can find more time for their own activities  and can also spend  quality  time with their partners and families.",
        "To sum it up, lengthy work jobs should be avoided and reduced which helps individuals to find more  free time to refresh their minds and can spend quality  time with their partners and parents along with fit mentally as well as physically."
