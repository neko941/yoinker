        "People have different views about which method is the most effective to make our roads safer.  While severe punishments contribute tremendously on lowering traffic accidents rate, I would argue that there are still a range of other measures proved to succeed in improving road safety.",
        "On the one hand, strict punishment plays a crucial role in encouraging people to honor rules and drive more safely. Firstly, penalties such as small fines, large fines and license suspension can act as a deterrent, stopping them from making the same offence again. For example, individuals who run a red light will have to suffer a penalty of $200. Furthermore, a more extreme penalty as prison sentence will act as the highest punishment for who have made a serious offence, causing negative consequences on both their lives and potentially innocent people\u2019s lives. As a result, drivers will become more disciplined and follow the rules more attentively.",
        "On the other hand, I believe that safe driving can be promoted in several different ways, other than just punishments. Firstly, as human error is often considered to be the central element of traffic safety, educating citizens adequately as early as before they start to use transportation should be the top priority. This could be done in driving schools, where the mandatory driving and written test should be even more difficult in the process of driving license acquisition. As a result, all traffic members will be fully aware of both the rules and consequences. Secondly, the government should pay more attention on better road design. For examples, stop signs can be put near any neighborhood\u2019s crossroad to stop unwanted accidents caused by fast driving, speed pumps or speed cameras to calm the traffic. Another thing that the government can do is invest more on cheap public transportation, which means few people would need to commute by their cars or motorbikes.",
        "In conclusion, while punishments might help to reduce bad driving, I believe that other road safety measures aforementioned will be a more effective solution to this problem."
