        "Drugs sale has been increased enormously around the globe over the decades. There are many reasons pointed out by the social activists, such as more habitual among youngsters, particularly from the modern society. It is important to mention that they are consuming legal as well as illegal drugs. Many Countries have taken severe action against the drug sale and consumption, but still the consumption is at an increasing rate.",
        "First and foremost, why drugs popular among youths? , teenage people are more aggressive and want things to experiment around them, even it was thought as a bad habit, during childhood. Most of the Countries have strict laws on illegal drugs, still drug dealer has strong network. As an example, some of the states in the USA, such as Alaska and California, it is legal to consume marijuana, while in other states it is forbidden. Such loopholes in the system, makes easy available. We have to come up with a stringent law & no flaw system, which could help reduce the availability, which can lead to less consumption.",
        "Secondly, Parents should always monitor their children and teach the self discipline. Always have an open discussion with your children. Let them open up their mind, by treating them as a friend. For example, take them on a monthly trip, which could provide a valuable family time. Depression is one of the main causes and to divert minds, some youngsters choose the wrong path. As a conclusion, to avoid drug, self discipline plays a major role with the proper guidance from the parents and supported by the strict law, altogether will help to reduce the widespread usage."
