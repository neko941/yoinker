        "It is often said that students should be able to choose whether they want to attend art-related classes or not. I strongly agree with this view, and will give my reasons below.",
        "First of all, focusing on other subjects tend to be way more beneficial for a student\u2019s career path. Arts subjects only support people who aim to be artists, while other classes, especially the STEM education system, serve as a foundation for a wide range of majors. For instance, math is the prerequisite for engineering, business, technology, and the list goes on. This gives the high school pupils many possible selections for their future. Moreover, globalization and the upcoming Industrial Revolution require a tremendous number of high-skilled workers majoring in science and research-related fields. Therefore, concrete fundamentals of non-artistic subjects will make wonders for the younger people\u2019s future holds.",
        "Another reason is that drawing is a special thing that requires innate talents. Imagination and other artistic skills are not easy to develop as social skills like critical thinking, management, communication or team work. However, imagination and color accuracy are undoubtedly the sole prerequisites in order to be a successful artist; as a result, only people who are born with those skills will be able to progress further. Hence it is not worth it to force people who are not meant to be an artist to join in art-related courses.",
        "In conclusion, I do not believe that it is a good idea to make the art subjects appear in the timetable of all high school students."
