Others believe the money should be spent on improving existing public transport.\n\n\nDiscuss both these views and give your own opinion.",

        "For many people around the world , the preferred method of transportation is high-speed inveigh . Commuters travelling to and from work rely on  safety and efficiency , while tourists appreciate the convenience and novelty that trains provide . Others believe that highways , buses and regular lines should be improved before new , high-speed lines are added .",
        "Safety is chief among concerns for those who travel to a job or school on a regular basis . If one drives a car , they have to concentrate on the road not only to avoid accidents but also to prevent other drivers from causing a problem on the road . The high-speed rail allows the communter to leave the driving to the professional controlling the train , allowing them to get some work done while getting to work safely .",
        "In addition , people tend to move further and further away from city centres , where land and houses are more affordable . The high-speed rail allows these commuters to travel greater distances in a shorter amount of time . There is a flow-on effect here  because if we can reduce the number of cars on the way , we can also cut down on traffic jams and road delays .",
        "On the other hand , high-speed trains are expensive , and some believe this money could be spent on repairing motorways which are used by cars , buses and motorcycles . Another possibility would be to use this money to build more regular commuter trains and busses to service the ever-expanding urban populations . Moreover , boats and ferries could benefit from a budget which focuses more on existing forms of transport .",
        "In conclusion , public transport is an issue which affects us all . The taxes which we pay should be spent on the type of transport which will have the most benefit to all citizens . In addition , we need to take into account how much the environment is damaged by fossil fuels and pollution . therefore , I believe in order to move forward , we need to embrace the idea of the rail so that future generations can continue to live safely and efficiently ."
