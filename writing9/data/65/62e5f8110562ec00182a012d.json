        "who does not want to connect with the world through media ? Television programs, nowadays ,  are broadcasted by producers for the whole day. It is believed by a certain section of  society that telecasting the programs for 24 hours has some advantages however others considered it has disadvantages. Both views are easily comprehensible . I  am going  to discuss these two views and elaborate on them from my perspective in the upcoming  paragraphs .",
        "Undoubtedly, the predominant merit of  tv programs is that individuals can  gain knowledge of what is happening around the world. To exemplify,   when \u0430 person watches the news or serials which contain  content regarding  social issues or global issues and this content is telecasted repeatedly , then persons cannot miss the opportunity to imbibe knowledge regarding  current affairs. Consequently, they can  do their work on time or  get adequate information to stay connected with others.",
        "However, broadcasting tv programs put an adverse impact on the health of people. Because",
        "masses spend a significant proportion of time  watching television programs and they are reluctant to do physical activities ranging from Yoga to running .  Consequently, individuals will become victims of various health disorders such as weak vision  , obesity and many more.  for instance, Had the individuals of India not spent their long hours watching television , the percentage of obese  people will never be inclined.",
        "To conclude, without a doubt and people watch the news and serials on  repeat which are broadcasted on various",
        "channels. Although,  television is a great source  of acquiring knowledge ; we cannot neglect its detrimental impacts  on an individual's health."
