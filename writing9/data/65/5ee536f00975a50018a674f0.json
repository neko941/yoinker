        "People have different opinions about whether the approach of charity organisations ought to be limited to their own nation or to all over the globe where there is a need. While, there are some benefits of working in a particular country, I believe that there should be no boundaries to lend a helping hand to the people in need.",
        "On the one hand when charity foundations work in their own nation, it becomes possible to execute the plans more precisely and accurately on the ground level. Because there are more number of workers who are connected to such organisations in the different parts of the country and can help more needy people.There are so many such organisations working in my country, India, like being human by Salman Khan, you we can by former cricketer Yuvraj Singh, Khalsa foundation. You we can foundation, for instance, works in India, they help the cancer patients who cannot afford treatment and other medical facilities. According to a report this foundation has helped around 20,000 patients in India. Therefore ,it is more precise and fruitful for charity organisations to work within the country.",
        "On the other hand, for the sake of humanity, charity organisations should help people in need regardless of their country. As there are no such organisations in many of the underdeveloped nations and people in such countries are reeling under hazardous ailments. Moreover, when charity foundations works in other parts of the globe, it spreads positive message among the people and helps to strengthen the bond with other countries. For example, when tsunami hit in the countries like Indonesia, whole world came together to help and donated money, food packages, medical equipment. These things unites the whole world. Obviously, charity organisations should offer help to people in every nook and corner of the world.",
        "In Conclusion, it is more practical when charity organisations works within the country. However, as humanitarian, every possible help should be provided to the people in need wherever they live"
