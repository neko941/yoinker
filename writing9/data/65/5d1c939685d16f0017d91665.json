        "A problem of modern societies is the declining level of health in the general population with conflicting views on how to tackle this worrying trend. One possible solution is to provide more sports facilities to encourage a more active lifestyle.",
        "Advocates of this believe that today\u2019s sedentary lifestyle and stressful working conditions mean that physical activity is no longer part of either our work or our leisure time. If there were easy to-reach local sports centres, we would be more likely to make exercise a regular part of our lives, rather than just collapsing in front of a screen every evening. The variety of sports that could be offered would cater for all ages, levels of fitness and interests: those with painful memories of PE at school might be happier in the swimming pool than on the football pitch.",
        "However, there may be better ways of tackling this problem. Interest in sport is not universal and additional facilities might simply attract the already fit, not those who most need them. Physical activity could be encouraged by installing exercise equipment in parks as my local council has done. This has the added benefit that parents and children often use them together just for fun, which develops a positive attitude to exercise at an early age.",
        "As well as physical activity, high tax penalties could be imposed high-fat food products, tobacco and alcohol, as excessive consumption of any of these contributes to poor health. Even improving public transports would help as it takes longer to walk to the bus stop than to the car.",
        "In my opinions, focusing on sports facilities is too narrow an approach and would not have the desired results. People should be encouraged not only to be more physically active but also to adopt a healthier lifestyle in general."
