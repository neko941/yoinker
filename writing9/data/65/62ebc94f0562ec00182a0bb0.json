        "I am a regular customer of your cab services but this time, I am extremely displeased with the addressal of my issue. It does not feel safe to me booking any further ride in future.",
        "Not only the driver arrived late at the pick-up point but also on asking the reason, he replied in an angirly manner and started driving rashly to scare me off. I warned him to raise a formal complaint but to my surprise he remained ignorant and kept on arguing throughout the ride. I called your customer care instantly but nobody picked the call then. Thus, I had to record and send the message to an automatic message reciever bot of your company.",
        "I would like you to take action against the driver promptly as it could put travellers on risk. Moreover, as a suggestion please create a proper forum for the clients to raise their issues and to provide updates on the statuses. This way customers will have more faith with your services.",
