        "Science and art are two strong pillars of the ultra-modern society. While scientists and technological experts are thought to be valuable assets and much appreciated by society nowadays. I ponder that musicians and other artists are equally valued in our society.",
        "On the one hand, technological advancements have made human lives more convenient like never before. Also, day by day ongoing research in science field has resolved many mysteries around the universe. Further, the team of scientists are continuously working in medical science thereby developing more vaccines and medicines to curb diseases and eventually increasing the average lifespan of human lives. For instance, discovery of quinine for malaria was  a revolution which help in controlling  the pandemic. Therefore scientists and experts seems to be of greater important to the society as they have influenced almost every aspect of human lives.",
        "On the other hand, musicians and artist are no less valued by society. In fact, tlhey are acting as a great stress buster for human  in this hectic lifestyle schedule. Although the way of appreciation and taste of music and arts have been changed over the years, people still love stalwarts of these fields, as it clear example is given by the huge fan following of musician A. R. Rehmen and painter M. F. Hussain. In addition to this, the surging trend being part of reality shows Showcasting art forms like dancing and singing rather than being spectators of these programs, shows that public values art and music same as other fields.",
        "In conclusion though the contribution made by scientists and technical experts are significant for developing societies but for cognitive development of human minds the role of art and music cannot be ignored. According to me, all fields likescience and technology., a rts and music all have  their own value and own place for the betterment and development of the society."
