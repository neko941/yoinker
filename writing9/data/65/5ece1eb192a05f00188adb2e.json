People were loosing their lives and the family member did not get a justice as police were unable to catch criminals.",

Hidden camera has been developed so that sting operation can be done successfully. In the matter of being offensive, the camera plays an important role and by means of the camera, the lawlessness ratio has been prevented at a certain rate. There are some strict rules have been made by the government, so that people afraid of doing the scandal. The security system has been done strictly. To avoid an accident, traffic signals are there, which is a part of protection system too. For instant action, emergency number, a mobile app has been developed, my means of that, people can save their lives and police can reach there on the spot.",
