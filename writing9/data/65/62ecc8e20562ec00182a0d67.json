        "While international car-free days are thought to effectively reduce levels of air pollution, some people believe that there are other alternatives that are more effective. This essay will discuss both of these views.",
        "It is true that exhaust fumes from cars are a major cause of air pollution as they contain a relatively high proportion of pollutants such as CO2. By having some days without cars on the road, no harmful smoke will be released into the atmosphere, and this will therefore improve the air quality. This policy is extremely effective in big cities around the world, such as Beijing, which is well known for its dirty air smog filled atmosphere. Since this car-free day policy has been introduced, the air quality of the city has greatly improved.",
        "On the other hand, local governments should try to further encourage the use of public transport, such as subways and buses, as they effectively produce a smaller quantity of pollutants, which in turn is less likely to impact the air quality. In addition to this, the disposal of waste, especially plastic waste which emits toxic fumes if burned, should be closely regulated and monitored. The final and most effective way of reducing air pollution is to use sustainable and environmentally-friendly energy sources, such as solar or wind power, to replace fossil fuels in the long term.",
        "In my view, these measures are all effective in addressing the problem of air pollution, but only to a certain extent. Such a problem needs to be dealt with by a number of different approaches and I believe that only implementing one approach will be ineffective."
