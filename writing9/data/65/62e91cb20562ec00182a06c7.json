        "I'm writing this letter to inform you that two weeks ago, I borrowed a book so I can use it as a reference for my essay assignment. I was supposed to return it three days ago, but it slipped my mind. The name of the book is \"How to cook everything\" by Matt Bittman, and all I can say is that the author was a brilliant fellow. We had a cooking class this semester and, for some reason, I became fond of cooking. I want to learn how to cook different cuisine so I keep coming back to the library to borrow all kinds of the cooking handbooks.",
        "As I'm doing my essay, I also try to follow the instructions written there. There are all kinds of food written in that book, and I wanted to try all of them. Hence, it's probably the reason why I forgot the deadline for its return.",
        "If possible, may I know how can I hand this handbook back to the library? Are there forms I have to sign up for or fines if I didn't hand over it on time? Please do let me know about the process.",
