        "It has been argued that people need to eat only vegetables rather than meat because it can damage their health systems. It disagrees that consuming meat can deteriorate your organs' functions. This essay will discuss  the reasons why we should eating meat and the impacts of humans bodies.",
        "Humans body are complicated. Every single organ has its own needs, and of course, we have more than 5 organs to support our lives.\u00a0Those needs must be fulfiled from food. Based on my knowledge, every type of food material has incomplete essential substances to maintain our organs' functions. For instance, most of vegetables only contain vitamin B1 until B10. However, our body needs vitamin B complex, which included B12 that is not appeared in plants, to support our activities. Therefore, we can not eat only one sort of food, otherwise, our body can not perform well, and we are easy to feel limb.",
        "The main benefit of eating meat is getting healthy. Since meat provides essential substances for human, it can help human to stay fit. For instance, a vegetarian person usually lacks  vitamin b12, namely folic acids because it is only appeared in meat, this vitamin is needed by a human to produce red blood cells. If the availability of vitamin b12 is not sufficient, we have a tendency to suffer from anaemia, the condition when our body has not enough red blood cells. Eventually, it can cause dizziness, and the worst case, we can pass out.",
        "In  conclusion, It is very recommended that we need to eat both vegetables and meats to support our metabolism system and to perform properly."
