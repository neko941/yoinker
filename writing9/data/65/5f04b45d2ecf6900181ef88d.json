        "Recycling of waste is an important option to sustain resources as most of everyday wastage  as polythene, plastic and paper are purely recyclable materials as well as organic waste can be easily converted into compost. Though it is commonly believed that the legislations should be passed in regard to make it mandatory to recycle household waste, in my opinion, it should have done by increasing the awareness of the recycling to the public rather than passing laws.",
        "It is impractical to monitor an ordinary household consumption and waste volumes in order to determine the amount being recycled. As an example, to maintain the law, it will be required to monitor whether household waste being recycled or not and in order to do such will require a great deal of manpower and resources. Rather imposing a legal burden on the public, it would be important to increase the awareness and the benefits of recycling by publishing educational program for households to practice.",
        "Moreover, recycling will add value to the domestic economies with many financial benefits such as waste paper and plastic can be easily sold to paper recycling factories. Furthermore, Laws are needed in order to reduce dumping of the waste as well as reducing the collection by the authorities as by doing such will certainly compel households to proceed with alternative options such as recycling at their households or sell them towards recycling factories. These steps will increase everyday practices of handling  effectively and recycling will occur effortlessly.",
        "In consideration of the above, the laws are required to increase the frequency of waste being recycled. However, such laws should not be set to penalize households, but should be set in a manner to change the traditional approach for collecting and dumping household waste."
