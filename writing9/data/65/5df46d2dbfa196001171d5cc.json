        "My perspective, about homeschooling should strictly forbid, never correspond with those who reckon that. This essay is subject to examine the advantages and disadvantages of the phenomenon and provide a logical conclusion.",
        "Admittedly, homeschooling offers a wide benefits. It can maintain to form a strong emotional bond as well as bring the families far closer. For example, well-nigh 75% of all homeschooling families say that a period of teaching their children and the time children spends learning together can foster a loving relationship in the family. Another key to the advantage of homeschooling is that parents and children no longer have to work their lives around homework and school hours. These could be done by hands-on learning, homeschool children can do away with homework. To illustrate, they usually accomplish their home tasks in a few hours each day what typically takes a week or more to complete in a classroom setting.",
        "However, this type of schooling sharply criticized it in some quarters. School is a critical time for brain and social skills development. Recent research indicates that children who are deprived of the chance to form friendships and socializing with children are twice as more likely to suffer socially in later stages of their life compared to those who are not. Furthermore, there is a public health risk that should be taken into account. Children are more susceptible to the disease against which immunization gives you some protection. From this point of view pupils who attend public schools are required to have immunization to begin classes. But it is hard to see it in homeschooling children. Thus, health diseases are much higher among homeschooled boys together with girls according to objective factors. A final drawback is time, parents need to set aside time to make it work. The task of a homeschooling child is certainly not easy that they have to take time to organize and prepare lessons. For example, average preparation time is raged from 3 to 5 hours, which could be used for working and earning money for their child.",
        "Suffice it to say that, although there convincing arguments, on the contrary, I firmly believe that, public schools can create a more desirable result for a child's overall development."
