        "Modernization and globalization have made employee migration a banal factor of ones work life. As a part of migration adapting the local practices and customs is an opinion that locks horns due to various factors. Although  the efforts put in to adopt the native cultures are often questioned for its worth, I believe the benefits of the former outweigh the efforts.",
        "Even though it isn't mandatory to comply with regional customs, familiarizing with the culture  definitely helps one to gel in with the society, understand their mindset and learn different cultures. If an ex-pat alienates himself from the above, he may start feeling lonely and aloof from society, which may eventually cause depression. For instance, migrants usually miss their local festivities a lot, creating a void in their life, so if he takes efforts to be part of other cultures, local friends might reciprocate by celebrating migrants regional festivals as a gesture friendship and humanity. So accepting cultures can definitely bolster a healthy society making it much more tolerant about cultures around the world.",
        "On the other hand, the length of an ex-pats visit is a crucial factor. If a person is visiting a new place only for the short term, it may deem futile to spend much time to adapt to the local culture. But participation in such cases would also turn out a fruitful new experience that would be worth cherishing and sharing once the ex-pat is back home. When one adopts local practices and customs, he might also explore improved ways of dealing with certain mundane tasks. For example, coffee which is a widely consumed beverage, is made differently across the globe and we often see people preferring the non-local way it is made.",
        "Conclusively, I would agree with the efforts that we put in to adapt local practices and customs, which more likely than not, will reap benefits that allows a person grow and make experiences that one could cherish for the rest of their lives."
