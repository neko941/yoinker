        "Some people argue that using a living animal for an experiment is unacceptable due to moral and animal right while other debates that. This essay will discuss the abovementioned and provides the reason for both views to analyse this argument.",
        "On the one hand, many consider testing an animal for science which should carry out because they believe that the sensitivities of organs such as skin, eyes, and blood might relevant to the human body. This result leads to various researcher's desire to use experimental living; for example, testing how the vaccine response which is required the sample of blooding test from dogs or rabbits to observe how the medicine is responding to their bodies ,especially the immune system which is analysed by counting on the white blood cell. If successful, it will develop into pills or vaccines. It is undeniable that human lives are depending on them too.",
        "On the other hand, they might also consider that it cannot be accepted to use creatures for their purpose. The reason why they are concerned about this issue is that they think that animals should have the freedom to live their own activity without the obligation to hold them or the right to choose. Furthermore, they should recognise that they cannot operate any life for supporting their desires or trying to use them without permission. Meanwhile, if they are able to have a chance to threaten our life and other ecosystems which is also the right way to do so?",
        "Although the purpose of science using animals for their research might play a significant role in  human well-being, they also reconsider the fundamental decency of them too. In this case, this statement should be not judged because both reasons that are mentioned shall be equal and must be carefully used in future."
