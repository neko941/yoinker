        "I am writing rgearding the amount of noise from the canteen which just opened near the boys hostel. The canteen is opened until late night at 1:00 AM. This is the reason why there are lots of noise till late night of considerable talking and of motorcycles and other vehicles until 2:00 AM.",
        "This causes me and my neghbour serious issues. We are students so we have very hectic schedule day and when we go to sleep at night due to noise, we can not sleep very well. Also, sometimes I have to do late night study either for completing my assignment work or preparing for my exam but due to this unavoidable noise. I can not concentrate on my study.",
        "I would like suggest to college authorities to reduce canteen open time to 10:00 PM on weekdays, and leaving as same as now on weekends. I propose that we have to stick the stickers of minimum voice locality in canteen. These steps are really helpful to us.",
