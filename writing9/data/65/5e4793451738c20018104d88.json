For instance, most of the investors, such as Einstein, Newton, Edison and Graham bell. They were geniuses and had genetically intellectual capacity much more than the other people. Furthermore, this kind of successful people could be seen in sports and music also. Messi and Mozart are the good examples for achieved sportsman and musician. Thus, some people could be more capable than the others in certain areas.",

The abilities that people have do not provide a differentiation on the achievements of them. The difference among the people\u2019s success is derived from the quality of education that they got. Thus, any person who were the same position and had a similar education would be able to indicate awesome performance.",
