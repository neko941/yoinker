        "This essay is about the job satisfaction, todays in our society. Its main purpose is to elaborate the reason behind the unsatisfactory job in our lives. In which we will discuss on different parameters relevant to job satisfaction.",
        "The main idea behind our discussion is to find out the actual reason to overcome this issue in our professional lives. There could be several reasons\u2019 of not being satisfied with the job. Especially while you will be handling other parameters in life a long hectic routine life.",
        "Hence, it\u2019s extremely important in everyone\u2019s life to be satisfied in their professional life because as I believe it has a direct impact on our personal life. It\u2019s very realistic and common in most of our lives, when we are not satisfied with our jobs either in terms of salary, environment or strict office environment\u2019 we could not live healthy and happy life with our families. Because the unhappy job makes us depressed and always tensed and we will be always thinking to move on to other jobs, to rid of the problem. In general, many people are losing hope and their determination to work. So firstly, to be satisfied with their job environment I believe we should spend the required time in office as its expected from the employers, and apply our maximum efforts to complete our job on time. Secondly, we should be ready for rapid changes to adopt, in the fastest growing industries to survive and compete the required skills.",
        "To conclude, Although, it\u2019s primarily important for adults to manage their professional life in a balanced way. As we already have discussed about the different factors which are quite important for job satisfaction. In my opinion, the obvious factor is not being satisfied is, unscheduled work, delay and sometimes non-competencies in the workplace. Which are definitely fixable by giving attention on the employers, and providing them required training"
