Moreover, the school structure is very old now, and it requires strength testing of key support pillars. Although it is not my forte, my younger brother can help in this regard.",
        "As I have taken a 2 months sabbatical from my work, I would be available for the work all 7 days a week. Also, I would be more than happy to offer my services free of cost because I was the a student in this school fifteen years back, and whatever I am today, the credit goes to this school only.",
        "My younger brother and I work together as we both have expertise in related field. He is a civil engineer and can be of great help in school's renovation project. Whenever you require any help, both of us will visit the school as we live nearby.",
