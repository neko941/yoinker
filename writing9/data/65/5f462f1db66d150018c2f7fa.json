        "Punishing people who commit crime is important to maintain law and order in society. Some people believe that there should be a fixed punishment for all crimes.Others disagree.In their opinion motive behind the crime is also considered. I will discuss the  benefits and drawbacks in the following paragraphs.",
        "To embark with, If there is same punishment for each crime all people who commit murder and rape will punish in the same way.This will definitely increase the judgement efficiency.Since the punishment is already given in the law books it will take less time for judges to pronounce the verdict. Also,  when punishments are consistent there will  be less law conflicts.",
        "On the other side, the above argument in the favour of single punishment at all, is not as logical as it sounds. To illustrate, human behaviour is always influenced by circumstances.Crime is no different. So, it is possible that two people who commit murder can have two entirely different motives. For example, one has perhaps committed the act because his/her intention was to kill while others have tried to save himself from the attacker who committed the murder accidentally.If there is a fixed  punishment  for murder, they both will get the same punishment which is unfair.Additionally, it is also unfair to give juvenile the same punishment as adults.",
        "To sum up, While awarding the punishment judges should consider not only the crime but also the circumstances in which they have committed it.Therefore, this is not at all fair to treat all crimes same and give them the same punishment."
