        "Technology accessed all our daily life, at home, work even in schools. It changed a lot and helped this generation, in education and especially in handwriting skills. Some people think that handwriting skills aren\u2019t important to be learned these days, others believe that handwriting is still necessary and helps a lot.",
        "Way of writing changed in several institutions and jobs, it turned the way of studying and working to be easier with less errors. First, the appearance of laptops, the internet or smart phones, facilitate the way of communication, workers\u2019 life is more flexible, he/she can send any email with free mistakes and not by handwriting, also they can find sample emails online. Second, handwriting needs more concentration to know the correct word, without doing any grammar or spelling mistake, this will waste the time of the person or student, in order to erase and write the sentence correctly again. For example, schools these days are transferring to e-learning system, this way is much easier and assist the student to know the right word quickly and without the assistance of others. In my opinion this way of handwriting won\u2019t help the student to write the word correctly, if he didn\u2019t write it down on a paper.",
        "On the other hand, people are using the internet to search for any information, copying and printing out without understanding it; that\u2019s why some think that handwriting is still important. First, till today during a conference or a meeting, you can find pencil and paper for the person to take notes, this way is still significant where it helps the one to know the meaning of what he / she is writing. Second, handwriting skills, aid man/woman to know how to write correctly, improve their skills, even when they need to send an email, to avow any mistakes or refer to auto-correction, this can also help during an oral conversation to know what they are saying and how to pronounce correctly. For example, when I started my job and began using the email, till today I still write down my email on paper to be sure is it free of errors before forwarding it. From my point of view, handwriting still important and must not let technology take over it.",
        "As a conclusion, handwriting must be kept and used in all sectors, where some people believe it is still necessary; others think that technology will replace it soon and life will be much easier. In my opinion, we can\u2019t stop technology and return back, but we can control and don\u2019t let it take over our lives and our way of studying."
