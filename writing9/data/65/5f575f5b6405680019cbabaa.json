        "Although it is thought by some people that advertising has great benefits, while others believe that it provides many problems. In my opinion, I consider that having sponsorships on sports helps to avoid financial worries.",
        "On the one hand, some people think that companies which sponsors sport events or sportsmen by providing equipment and with other demands are good, and I completely agree. In other words, players can focus on their sports instead of being distracted by financial problems because most part of the money related works are figured out by sponsors. For example, during the international competitions many companies offer to join tournament as a sponsor by providing accommodation and travel expenditures of competitors. Furthermore, people would be able make informed choices about products. To illustrate, sportsmen who use products of sponsor companies give information about the quality and prices of goods.",
        "On the other hand, it is often believed that some companies advertise products harmful to health. That is to say, there are a lot of brands which brings many health problems with them. For instance, tobacco companies, among others, should not allowed to sponsor sport events because it might encourage many people to consume those products. Moreover, if player is unsuccessful, it might affect product sales. This is because the companies\u2019 reputation can be tightly linked to a players\u2019 reputation and when players drug or misbehaves will have a negative consequences for the company.",
        "In conclusion, while people may vary in their opinions, I think that if companies are encouraged to be sponsorship, it can bring many benefits such as reducing money related worries and provide information about their products."
