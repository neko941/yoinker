        "Many countries accept an increasing number of tourists due to the availability of trips abroad. This essay will analyse the advantages and disadvantages of this problem.",
        "The main disadvantage of tourism is the impact on the environment, especially on natural beauty. Many tourists are drawn to the most stunning areas of the country, but they rarely consider the long-term consequences of their visit and contribute to environmental pollution. One of the most famous example of this phenomenon is the Great barrier reef, which is gradually being destroyed due to tourists touching corals. Another drawback associated with the development of tourism is the inflated prices at tourist points, which can make it inaccessible to local residents. This problem is more serious in developing countries, where local restaurants often raise prices to accommodate the higher purchasing power of tourists.",
        "Despite the problems associated with travel, there are many positive aspects, including from a financial and cultural point of view. As for the economy, tourists provide economic growth in the regions by spending huge amounts of money and providing jobs to local residents. To illustrate this, the travel industry in Thailand accounts for almost 20% of their GDP, and without this industry, their economic development will suffer. From a cultural point of view, people visiting other countries can reduce racism and develop a deeper understanding. Other culture. If travellers spend more time learning different religions or customs, they may well improve their tolerance and understanding, which is crucial to creating harmony in the world.",
        "To sum up, the growth of travel has contributed to certain environmental and financial problems for popular destinations. Conversely, host countries have potentially significant economic benefits and opportunities to develop a more harmonious world. Tourism is inevitable, so tourist destinations should be aimed at enhancing positive results and reducing harmful consequences."
