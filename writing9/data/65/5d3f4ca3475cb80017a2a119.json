        "The table compares the number of millions of viewers who enjoy four types of movies (such as action, romance, comedy and horror) in four different countries (India, Ireland, New Zealand and Japan). The table also shows the total number of audiences in four specific countries.",
        "To begin with, it can be clearly observed from the given table that India has the highest movie viewing number of action movies, and 8 million people choose to watch this type. Followed by Ireland, New Zealand and Japan, the number of 7.6 million, 7.2 million and 7.1 million viewers respectively. In addition, India offers the largest ratings for romantic and comedy movies, with 7.5 million and 6.5 million viewers. Although the smallest person in Ireland has ever chosen to watch 3.8 million romantic movies; at least 3.9 million people like to watch comedy movies in New Zealand. However, New Zealand and Japan have the same number of romantic viewers, with 4.5 million, while the second largest audience for comedy movies is 5.5 million in Ireland.",
        "On the other hand, India has only 2.5 million people watching horror movies, and Japan has a historical low of nearly 2.2 million in the same category. Despite this, Ireland has the largest audience rating of 6.4 million terrorist types. In addition, it can be noted that action movies are the most popular category, with 29.9 million viewers, followed by romantic [20.3 million] and comedy with 19.9 million viewers. However, horror is the least popular category, with only 15.8 million viewers choosing to watch.",
        "Therefore, it is concluded that India has the most movie viewing figures, with 24.5 million people in movies and 17.8 million people watching movies. There are 23.3 million viewers in Ireland following India, while New Zealand has the third highest number of viewers, with 20.3 million."
