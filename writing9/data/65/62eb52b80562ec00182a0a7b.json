        "In general, developing countries tend to have more young people than the old, which is usually regarded as a preferable situation for the economy. In fact, India where its population is dramatically increasing with a high rate of young nations  is experiencing an enormous economical rise. However, some experts in non-governmental organisations often argue that the too high birth rate in a country causes many serious issues. In the following paragraphs, I would like to discuss the positive and negative sides of being a young country.",
        "On one hand, a young nation has to handle so many social issues that it might not have enough time and money to maintain public services at a high level. For instance, a large number of people in southern African countries are suffering from well-known diseases for the poor national health services. In such a country, social issues are tackled in the order of prioritisation and issues of the majority, young people, can be overlooked.",
        "On the other hand, compared to an ageing society like Japan and the USA, a country  full of  youth can make a remarkable economical flourish. More and more entrepreneurs start their new businesses in such countries as China and India, seeking  its low salary and rich labour force. Young workers may welcome automation and digitalisation, which encourages innovation.",
        "From these points I mentioned above, I would strongly insist that a younger society is more advantageous than disadvantageous. Nations with a large youth population have a considerable potential to be a major economic power. It may be true that public services are not good enough for everyone in a developing country, but  economic development can cover that in time."
