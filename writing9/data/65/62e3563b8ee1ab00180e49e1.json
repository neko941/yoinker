        "Undoubtedly it is true fact that in cutting -edge era the economic level is totally changed. Few masses believe that it is good for  province finance for individuals to spend funds, whereas",
        "Other thinks that it would be best for folks to save salary . This essay will discuss both views as far as I am concerned I am in favour of the letter notion .",
        "To commence with , spending remuneration is a good path  for the region's economy . To explain it , the masses have a chunk of the treasury in the modern era . So they spend it on  further trade . And they get easily make more wealth with the help of work . For instance , a headline of Danik Bhaskar is about big employment Ram Partap . He is the biggest trade in his district with the help of spending income . Hence , it  proves spending capital is a good way for regional finance .",
        "Shifting towards the remaining notion , saving the remuneration  , is a benefit for the individuals .",
        "I mean to say that money is the source of life . In future without funds soul will be can not expect. For example , in the public ,sector most masses lead a miserable life . Because they cannot save the fund for the future so then individuals lead this poor life . Hence , it is clear that without saving life cannot start as well with any money and no food . Life is made a part of the like an animal . So money saving must be essential for the soul .",
        "To sum up , the masses have spent some funds on essential work but overspending fund is not worth it for them . So I fully support the latter notion it is the key to success in life"
