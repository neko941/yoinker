        "I am privileged to have a chance to get familiar with you, an international businessman, who is also a down  earth person. I would wonder if you remember me, an Italian girl who negotiated for an aisle seat on an Italy flight. Having an invitation from you for the opening ceremony of a chain restaurant, surely delighted me. But, I was enforced to return to  France immediately and thus I have decided to write a letter.",
        "This is to say, as you have announced for a professional chef I would say Making Italian authentic dishes around 10years is my main skill. Not to mention, I have been training a range of online courses within the framework of backing cookies, as well. Your well\u2014known restaurants in the European countries would be an opportunity not only for me but also for all chefs to reach a dream job.",
        "Therefore, I kindly request you to give me a chance for being a part of your team serving Italian cuisines. If you had any vacancies in France, I could be there as an executive chef. This is because I have enough experience and certifications to be qualified for this.",
        "Thank you for your consideration and hope to hear from you.",
        "Yours sincerely,"
