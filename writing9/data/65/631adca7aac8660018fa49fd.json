        "I have noticed that some of night duty staff sleeps inside the rooms or quarters instead to be at duty.  Literally, I and Lindsay- who is also a new employee, work and manage everything at night. They even do not bother to come to the reception area at busy hours when we have an influx of guests - usually on Friday nights. I believe this is against the rules.",

        "I look forward to hear from you as soon as possible.",
