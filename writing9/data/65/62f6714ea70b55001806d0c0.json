        "Museums are functional all across the globe for different reasons according to the local and social norms of every country. It varies from person to person, as some of them believe that education is flourishing, while others believe it can also be a cause of enjoyment and fun. This essay will explain and compare both segments of the community in detail.",
        "The first and foremost focus is on those people who see this a helping hand in education because they have benefitted in this field themselves. For instance, the Art and Craft activities of handmade products at such places and someone who is doing a bachelor's or master's in arts will surely benefit from the museum because the person will surely get assistance in comparing theoretical work to the actual work. Whereas, one who thought it can also serve a great purpose of entertainment is in no way wrong because the enjoyment part is one of the best things for someone who is doing hectic studies or job. For Example, a university student has spent his whole day  studying, If a fun activity is planned  after that is some museum nearby he will for sure like to attend this to kind of have  stress relieving therapy.",
        "There are many persons with different beliefs as mentioned above, Contrary to that some people strongly reject such thoughts.",
        "In this essay, different opinions and contrary arguments are presented regarding people's thoughts about  viability. In my opinion, various regions of the world arrange creative activities, so they are becoming a positive development for education."
