        "Every people has a dream to live in a big city as it provides better life. Although, it is sometimes thought there are more advantages to living in the city rather than the ruler area. In my opinion, I considered that  life in a city is much better, but  life in the countryside should not be neglected.",
        "There are many reasons why people prefer to live in metropolitan areas. The first and foremost important thing is that it gives all facilities. The transportation system is very good. It has all types of transportation such as trains, buses and trams. Moreover, the medical facilities are also available with advanced technology and they have all the necessary equipment for surgery. The Children are more educated in cities as they have  quality education. hence, there are abundant facilities in the city.",
        "Another point to consider to live in a big city means people have more entertainment. people can go to the theatre to watch movies. Furthermore, they also have different types of nightclubs where they can enjoy  dance and music. For example, in  one survey  conducted in the Uk, people who live in metropolitan areas  have more options for enjoyment compared to people who live in regional areas. Therefore, the city has immense benefits.",
        "On the other hand, countryside areas have also owned importance. Firstly,  people who want a calm and peaceful atmosphere  choose to live there. Secondly, villages have more greenery in  comparison to cities. In addition, people get fresh air and they do not have to face health problems.",
        "In conclusion, the city offers tremendous benefits because it has all the advanced technology and essential tools to give all facilities. While  countryside areas can also provide basic necessities."
