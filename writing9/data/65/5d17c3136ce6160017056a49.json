        "Whilst some people are diligent and industrious in study and work, others seem to be relaxed and satisfied with what they are having. Personally, I believe that there are various reasons leading to hard work ethic, and it is desirable up to a point, but too much work exerts detrimental effects on health.",
        "One fundamental reason is that people are pressurized by the expectations of their families and the society. In Vietnam, for example, without attaining excellent grades at school or exhibiting spectacular academic performance, students may be penalized for such failures. Another reason is due to a thirst for escaping from the poverty and creating a completely new life. Leading an impoverished life is incredibly challenging, which is a stimulus to the diligence at the workplace and school. The last reason is that they have found their particular interests and love in the fields in which they are working. This explains why they feel considerably more motivated, enjoyed, and willing to dedicate the whole life to exploring what they deeply love.",
        "People can reap a multiplicity of benefits from being hard-working. In the realm of education, students with studious habits are more likely to be academic high-flyers and be admitted to top-notch institutions. Likewise, in an employment setting, industrious and committed workers stand much higher chances to rise to the top and become the leaders of the teams or managers of the companies. Nevertheless, the strong desire for hard work has become an unhealthy obsession among some people. Indeed, taking an excessive workload can result in somatic and psychological problems such as headaches, backaches, and distress.",
        "In conclusion, people in different situations have different reasons to work hard to raise a high profile or boost prolific productivity. Although working hard is beneficial in some aspects, too much of it can result in the deterioration of our physical wellbeing."
