        "Over recent years, the rate of crime has dramatically increased in many countries around the world. It has been suggested that the reintroduction of the death penalty would be an effective deterrent against the growth of serious crime, but it can be argued that capital punishment is unacceptable in our society for several reasons. In the following essay I will examine this issue and then give my own opinion.",
        "Firstly, capital punishment does not seem to reduce crime rates. The most recent survey of the relation between the death penalty and homicide rates was conducted for the UN and concluded that there is no scientific evidence that capital punishment deters people from committing crime. In fact, death penalty states continue to have higher crime rates than states that have abolished it.",
        "Secondly, the death penalty is an inhuman and degrading punishment that violates human rights, in particular the right to life. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that everyone has the inalienable right to life and should not be killed by another person nor by government. However, capital punishment is still practised in many countries, such as the United States or China, where the death penalty is regarded as a highly effective measure that provides a sense of justice for victims. It is certainly true that victims and their families have the right to justice, but executing somebody because they have committed murder is revenge, not justice.",
        "Finally, capital punishment entails the risk of executing innocent people. Although criminal justice systems are supposed to be perfect, they have serious flaws and prosecutors as well as jurors can all make mistakes. A recent study has found that in the USA over 150 people had been released from death row because they were innocent of the crime for which they were convicted. This is a clear evidence that such mistakes are not only possible in the criminal justice system, but they are also reversible when death penalty has not been practiced. On the contrary, had they been executed there would have been nothing to do and the state would have been guilty of killing innocent people.",
