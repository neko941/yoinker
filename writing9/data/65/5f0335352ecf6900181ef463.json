Alternative forms of transport should be encouraged and international laws introduced to control car ownership and use. To what extent do you agree or disagree?

        "Nowadays, people are becoming more dependent on cars for transport. By 2000, there were approximately 29 million vehicles on UK roads. I strongly agree with the step taken by the international legislations  to limit car ownership and use , and that other forms of transport should be implemented. This is because roads will be less crowded , and the environment will suffer less from air pollution.",
        "With the growing population nowadays, more people tend to opt cars as a way for their movement. As a result, public transport should be encouraged more by the Uk government to mitigate the crowdeness done by this paramount number of cars.Building more ,new railways for high speed trains is a very good idea and more convenient for people. So, laws that limit car utilization in the way of facilitating more convenient public transport will encourage people to favor more transport done publicly. For example,I had a read in a newspaper that the huge number of cars in Britain lead to many traffic accidents as a consequence  of road crowdedness.This is one of the two reasons for why alternative approaches for moving should be obligatory.",
        "Moreover, environment plays a very important role in this issue. As the number of people having cars increase, the air becomes more polluted. Consequently, the UK should control the use of these vehicles for people to live healthier lives and enjoy the fresh,unpolluted air of their country.One day, for instance,I have read a report stating that Mumbai is one the countries that suffer the most from air pollution as a consequence of cars,as they are thinking now to put regulations for vehicle's ownership.",
        "In conclusion, in my opinion, dissuading British citizens from car ownership and use will benefit both the individuals and their environment. To my mind, the introduction of such laws in the UK is a very clever step toward a better life."
