        "Dear Sir,",
        "I am writing this letter in reference to the advertisement I have seen in the Aussi Times for a babysitter position. I am a student and ,currently I am doing my master\u2019s degree at  Kingdom university. This is my final semester and probably I will complete my study after six months. Due to some financial issues, I cannot afford to room rent so I am looking for a part-time job. When I saw this advert, I thought this job could be the perfect opportunity for me to earn some money and save on accommodation expenses.",
        "I am the eldest child of my parents and I have three siblings  their ages are 5 years, 8 years, and 12 years  usually during my parent's absence I take care of them, so I have acquired some skills to handle children. Also, when I was studying for my bachelor\u2019s, I worked as a babysitter to look after 3 years boy. I believe my past experience makes me the perfect candidate for this post.",
        "I am not a socialized person, so I do not go out very often with my friend, however, I am a football player and I am keen to play football. When I get some free time from my study, I prefer to call my friend for a match because this game keeps me energetic and active. Sometimes I go to the cinema with my peers and mostly I love to watch ROMCOM genre movies.",
