        "Dear Sir/Madam,",
        "Last week on twenty-fifth of July, I travelled from Banaras to Delhi as a passenger on the train Jan Shatabdi express PNR number 425-0034612 in A-class compartment presumably under your management. I experience several inconvenience and problems throughout the long and strenuous journey.  I would like to make an official complaint.",
        "Firstly, the train was delayed one hour due to malfunction with the door. In addition to this, train had to stop several times throughout the journey due to technical issues. Due to this, I reached to Delhi four hours late than the planned. Secondly, the train was overbooked, and my respective seat was broken, and I was shifted to second class compartment which was not clean as per the prescribed standards, doors locks were broken, and washroom smell were spread all over the compartment and on the top of it people were spitting on the floors.",
        "I hope that you can appreciate that I have had a terrible experience with your company, and I look forward to reading in your reply about what action you intend to take.",
        "Yours sincerely,",
