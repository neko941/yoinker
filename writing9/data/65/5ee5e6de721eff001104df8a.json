        "It is believed that having a freedom to choose which subjects to pursue and gain knowledge in, is important for a student. These people argue that subjects like Mathematics and Philosophy which are not easily understood should be made optional. I moderately agree with the view that certain subjects be made optional due to several reasons that I will discuss in greater details in my essay.",
        "On the one hand, it has been observed that children find subjects like Mathematics and Philosophy trivial and tend to avoid studying them. They are not able to comprehend the subjects well and this leads to development of fear of those particular subjects. Furthermore, due to not being able to perform well in assessments, the confidence of the student is shaken. Owing to these reasons, people opine like certain subjects should be made optional rather than compulsory.",
        "On the other hand, basic knowledge of subjects like Mathematics is essential for students and useful in certain walks of life. Rather than making them completely optional, such subjects can be taught up to a certain level of education to equip a child with preliminary understanding. Based on the ability to grasp and interest development, the student can opt to study the subject at higher level or opt to discontinue the study. A pupil will be able to make an informed decision on the basis of having background knowledge of the subject.",
        "After considering the arguments hitherto, I believe that the most logical solution is to give a choice to student only after they have learnt fundamentals of the subject. Thus, I moderately agree with the view and advocate that making tough subjects completely optional is not a comprehensive solution."
