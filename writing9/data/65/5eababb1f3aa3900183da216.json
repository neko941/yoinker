        "In today's age, common public generally makes efforts to copy the styles of the glorious personalities as they get so much affected from the magazines or tv shows they are watching owing to attraction towards the luxury life of their favourite ones. Stating my view I would say there is no vulnerable affect of the same until it goes up to an extent. Discussing the reasoning in the essay below.",
        "Firstly, there is no harm to copy styles or to follow the well established personalities as people are much attracted towards their lifestyle. Many people want to copy them just for the sake to look good as they watch them either, some want to opt to show off their wealth to their friends or society, however there is also the public who wants to copy them just to be happy and satisfied. Sometimes there are also other facts which make audience to image another, such as their experiences, their losses and of course their sayings about life also people came to know about life experiences and much more.",
        "On the other hand, every person who wants to be like well known personalities should not forget about hard work, determination, and also the sacrifices they made to be that kind. There are many things towards which an ordinary person is not familiar with as to be honourable people sacrifices their time or family sometimes. And of course we can copy them up to an extent because normal person has not well earned as any great living and to copy Can make them compromise their living standards.",
        "In conclusion, I would say any common can copy the styles of the famous personalities, but that would make them vulnerable if they will be attracted to copy their standards of living."
