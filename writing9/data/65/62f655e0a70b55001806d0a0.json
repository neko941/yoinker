        "On coming Sunday, I am going to have a student concert at my university. I and my friends will perform 3 songs that I wrote for the lecturers and our fellow students. The concert is held only once a year and it is our only chance to express our talents to our professors from the music department who can also be our potential producers. Some of them are used to producing albums for our senior students and letting them explore their successful careers in the music industry. So, this is our highest chance to prove our potential to get on the professional track.",
        "I fully understand that we are making some noises till late at night these days and I'm truly sorry if it makes you any inconvenience.",
        "In order to avoid disturbing situations, we will limit our practice hours to 7pm at the latest. Besides, we will also turn the volume down even in daytime. However, the concert date is also approaching and all our practice sessions will be over right on the coming Sunday afternoon.",
        "Again, please accept my sincere apology for your inconvenience and thank you so much for your understanding.",
        "Best wishes,",
