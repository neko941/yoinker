        "The age at which children should commence formal education is of considerable debate nowadays, in some countries this starts at four years while in others at seven or eight years of age. In my opinion, schooling should start at age of four as children are more adaptable in this age.",
        "In some countries around the world children are sent to school at four years of age and I agree with this action as children can adapt to school environment in a far superior way. In other words, the earlier the children are sent to school, the better they will accept it as part of their routine.  As the child grows up, he becomes accustomed to home atmosphere and it becomes extremely difficult for him to adjust in school environment away from parents. A recent research, for instance, has demonstrated that the incidence of crying amongst school children, when their parents dropped them at school, was higher in older children in the same class. Hence, they should be sent to school at an early age in order to reduce the alien feeling at a later stage.",
        "On the other hand, some people believe studies of children at school should start when they are seven or eight years of age as the chances of learning are increased in this age. They believe that four years is a very tender age, when the children have stranger anxiety and learning the social and interpersonal skills. According to them sending the child at a younger age might aggravate this anxiety and consequently result in failure to cope with the unfamiliar environment. This may result in a permanent aversion to school atmosphere in the nature of children. Hence, they believe children should be sent to school when they are seven or eight and early years should be with parents who can nurture their abilities at home.",
        "In conclusion,  while people may vary in their opinions, children should be sent to school at age of four in order to inculcate studying habits at an early stage. They will eventually turn out to be productive members contributing towards prosperity of society."
