        "Learning foreign languages is becoming increasingly popular among people. Some people state that travelling and doing work in foreign countries are the main reasons for learning international languages. While  some people argue that these are not the only reasons for learning international languages. This essay will discuss why work and travelling are not the only possible reasons for learning languages of other countries.",
        "First and foremost, a lot of people say that going to some other countries for a visit and start work there are the only purposes of learning foreign languages  because most people want to visit some beautiful places all over the world and they also want to build businesses in different countries. For this purpose, people need to learn foreign languages. For example, it is very necessary for a person to learn the language of the country where he wants to start a business. To sum up, foreign languages are very important for exploring different parts of the world.",
        "In contrast, some populations believe that  there are  more reasons for learning different languages other than travelling and work. The most important reason for learning international languages is getting an education in different foreign countries. For example, language is the first requirement of different universities  all over the world. Additionally, Students can use languages as a tool to make money online. For example, a foreign language is very essential if someone wants to work in an international online company. In short, foreign languages are very important to become successful in all aspects of life.",
        "In conclusion, this essay discussed both statements in detail. In my ,opinion foreign languages are not only important for travelling and working but  also these languages are essential for getting a high-quality education in different countries and also for doing online jobs."
