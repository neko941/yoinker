        "Environmental pollution is the greatest global challenge ,although a number of steps have been taken by the nations,the issue remains as it is. the possible reason may be a speed difference between efforts and the problem itself,not enough resources involved or not being implemented properly.Probable solutions can be from limiting fossil fuel use to finding alternative energy resources. I will be discussing the causes and remedies in-depth in the next paragraphs.",
        "At the global summit, developed countries come up with  zero carbon footprints and environmentally friendly transport initiation to solve the pollution issue but implementation dates are starting from 2025 or 2030. so practically nothing will be done,just boasting with empty words.on other hand ,small countries like Netherland started on the eco-friendly cycling program for its citizens and the prime minister himself lead the country by providing example by riding to the office on a bicycle.so commitment and it's implementation produces results.",
        "Another solution can be the use of solar,wind and turbine energy and replacing the present sources of energy with them ,the quicker the replacement the sooner  will be the results.Use Hydrogen and Solar power operated vehicles and instruments as well as deducting fossil fuel engines will provide faster results.Even combination models can be used  as an electric car with solar panels as a roof so will get charged during the daytime and can be re-charged if needed during the night.",
        "In,conclusion. environmental erosion is a global issue and can only be solved by all directional efforts with a cent per cent commitment from all the member countries of the world by combining the above-mentioned solutions as well as adding more where and when needed."
