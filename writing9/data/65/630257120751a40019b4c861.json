        "Although boys and girls study at separate schools in traditional countries, there are a lot of mixed-gender schools where boys and girls are educated in the same class in many countries . This kind of school has both advantages and drawbacks. I will discuss both in this paper.",
        "There are many advantages to educating boys and girls in the same class at school. One of them is more preparation to be in  society. As we know in real life, men and women are together. They should be able to communicate and work with each other. In the mixed gender schools, boys and girls study and do their exercises together. in fact, their school is a small community. So, they prepare for their real life in future. The next one is gender equality. When boys and girls are educated in the same environment, it means that they have similar educational conditions. For example, they have the same teachers, laboratories and teaching methods. Hence, they learn there is no difference between males and females.",
        "On the other hand, there are also some drawbacks to educating boys and girls in the same class. At first, it can lead to a series of sexual problems. Nowadays, children are conscious and have information about everything. They know the gender differences between males and females. it is possible that Some of them be naughty. So, they may harass their opposite sex with sexual jokes or movements. This problem is more common in third-world countries. Moreover, controlling students in mixed-gender schools is more difficult than in single-gender schools. When boys and girls are together, they have more challenges for their teachers. They make a lot of noise. Thus, teachers should spend more time controlling them.",
        "In summary, studying boys and girls in the same class has many benefits and problems. More readiness to be in the real world and gender equality are its benefits. The disadvantages are sexual problems and the harder control of students."
