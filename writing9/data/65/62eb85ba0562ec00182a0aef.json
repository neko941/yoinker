        "I think it is beneficial that goods such as food, clothing, cars and furniture which are produced in certain parts of the world are available in other parts of the globe too which is leading to an increasing similarity in countries.",
        "People have now access to commodities which they could not use before. There are some articles which are produced in certain parts of the world owning to the geographical factors as a result of which they cannot be accessed by individuals living in other parts of the world. For example, fruits such as banana and pineapple are grown in tropical regions, which when exported to colder countries such as Canada and Russia makes it feasible to experience the taste of these fruits inhabitants living there.",
        "Furthermore, people can migrate to different countries with less fear of becoming homesick as nowadays almost every product from around the globe is available. For instance, earlier Indian immigrants were not able to make a range of Indian dishes due to the non-availability of some specific Indian spices and vegetables. However since now different products are exported and imported among all the countries, people do not miss the significant part of their cultural heritage, and can live and work more productively.",
        "Some may argue that the global spread of similar merchandise and increasing similarity among countries would reduce people's motivation to travel to different parts of the world, decreasing tourism and its revenue to the countries. But i think people will still travel to experience the natural features of different places such as mountains, forests, and wildlife.",
        "In conclusion, although the increasing spread of similar goods is leading to growing similarity among countries, I believe that it is a desirable development as people from different parts of the world could have an access to all the products, even the ones which are not produced or grown in their countries making them feel satisfied and immigrants less homesick."
