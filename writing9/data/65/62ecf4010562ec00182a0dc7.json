        "It is undeniable that museums are  places that are full of knowledge and full of history. Some people believe that museums are the places for fun however, some people think that the purpose of museums is to educate. In my opinion, museums are the places, which enhance our knowledge by their diversity and also educate us. I think this way for two reasons, which I will explore in this essay.",
        "To begin with, the diversity, which we used to see in a museum is incredible. Placement of different cultures depiction at one place in itself is an outstanding notion, which helps us to know about the  history of many things around the world. My own personal experience is a compelling example of this, as in my final semester I have to submit a project on ancient culture in the college. I found the museum, the best place to do my research work on the history project. It helped me to understand the ancient culture and people very easily. Hence, with good ,grades I completed my project on time.",
        "Furthermore, some activities in museums are very much attractive for the children such as short movies to enhance their knowledge with high-quality sound. For ,kids this will a learning with fun, and they feel motivated to go there again and again. Some displays are also very attractive with lights and sound both for knowledge and entertainment.",
        "In conclusion, I believe that museums are the best place to know about our history, culture, and people of a particular time or era. Everyone should have a visit to such a knowledgeable place and children must see them both for fun activities and for the knowledge."
