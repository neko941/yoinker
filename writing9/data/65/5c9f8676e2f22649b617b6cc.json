        "Some individuals argue that raising the minimum legal age for driving car or riding a bike is the most effective method to increase road safety. While I accept that this policy is good in some ways, I believe that there are better measures to reduce traffic accidents.",
        "To begin with, I agree that it is a good idea to increase the minimum age required for driving. Firstly, when they are young, they are less mature and responsible for their behaviors, so they may not be aware of the importance of following the rules. Therefore, it is reasonable to ban them from traveling on the street in order to prevent them from breaking the law and causing accidents. Secondly, because older people are usually experienced, they can know how to react quickly to handle dangerous situations on the road, while younger ones are not able to do so. To illustrate, if a brake suddenly stops working, a younger driver may be panic, and an accident is likely to occur.",
        "However, I believe that there are better methods of ensuring road safety. The first one is to have stricter punishments for driving offenders. For example, those who break the law should be banned permanently from commuting on the street. This may help commuters be more likely to respect the law, and traffic accidents may be reduced. Another solution is to encourage residents to use public transport rather than private vehicles. This can be done by reducing ticket fares and increasing the frequency of buses or tubes to make them more convenient for users.",
        "In conclusion, I argue that apart from increasing the legal age for driving, there are more effective ways to make sure that traveling on the street is safe for everyone."
