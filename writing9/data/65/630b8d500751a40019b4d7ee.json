        "Nowadays the importance of the internet has been increasing. I completely agree The internet replaces   traditionally libraries. This essay will discuss    the reason and conclusion of this circumstance.",
        "",
        "On the first hand, most people thought internet is cheaper than   traditionally libraries.  Money is Significant stuff for the community.  People do not want to spend money on books. An extensive survey conducted by CNBC revealed that   70% of people prefer using the internet to reach information instead of traditional libraries because they can access every piece of knowledge without paying. Peoples save money. Such as my friend does not want to spend 20 euros per book, therefore he will use the internet and would not pay.",
        "The Second idea is the internet is unlimited, but   Traditionally libraries are very restricted. Crown wan to access all knowledge instead of narrow-scoped information. Research conducted recently indicated that the amount of information on the internet equals 500 libraries. People can access so every website and information on the internet but if they cannot find every information. Such as   I am searching for average salaries in France. \u0130 cannot find it in the library however \u0131 can easily find it on the internet. \u0130f people access much information they would be open-minded and knowledgeable. I agree with this idea because the internet is the biggest knowledge source in the world. People do not go to traditional libraries.",
        "To conclude, Internet will replace traditional libraries. I agree with this idea because the internet is faster than libraries, Also the internet is unlimited you can find whatever you want.  \u0130n the Future libraries would be empty because people prefer to use the internet."
