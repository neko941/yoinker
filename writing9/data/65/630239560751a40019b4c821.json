        "Dear Sir or Madam,",
        "I am writing to reply to the purpose of sponsorship from Besty Company. It would be so nice of you to donate funds to our local community.",
        "The local children\u2019s sports team is currently short of funding. With your generous sponsorship, a professional coach can be hired to guide the training of the sports team. There are several talented students athelets, who have the potential to win in the national contest. Moreover, the school stadium can be refurnished with the donation. As a result, more students will join the sports team. I knew that another option is to pay for two open-air concerts. This event will attract thousands of tourists to visit our town. From my point of view, I believe that sponsoring the local children\u2019s sports team will be more beneficial. This sponsorship will not only promote sports acitivity among children but also improve physical health of the local students.",
