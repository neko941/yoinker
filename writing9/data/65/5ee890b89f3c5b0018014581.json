        "Every country is investing a substantial amount for research and development work nowadays. While many may argue that medical research should be prioritized over environment, I disagree. According to me, understanding our environment more can truly be beneficial and can even help in evolution of medical field.",
        "Firstly, it is well known now that human activities have been affecting the world environment adversely, because of which, at recent times, there is a rise in natural calamities like draught, flood, cyclones etc. There are numerous news of many more, coming from all over the world. For example, a few months ago, there was Australian wildfire and then a few months prior to that we heard of Amazon wild fire. Hence, we need to study our environment and find out how we can reverse the changes, which will help to stabilize the entire system.",
        "Secondly, if we do not carry out research on our surroundings, we will fail to discover new elements or biological bodies in our environment. New medical discoveries or new medicines can be invented based on these researches as well. For instance, leaves of many plants can cure even the harshest diseases. Thus, it is also necessary  that we invest on studying our nature as well.",
        "To conclude, although medical research activities are of utmost importance, we should not forget our environment as in the times of pandemics and new viruses, there is no doubt that mother nature holds a lot more secrets, which are yet to be discovered. That is why, as per my opinion, environmental studies should be prioritized more as this may also help us on achieving medical miracles."
