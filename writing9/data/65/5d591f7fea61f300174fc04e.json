        "Learning a new language from textbooks and applying grammar rules, which are the essence, but not necessarily enough. Using it with a native speaker is what ensures language fluency. I strongly concur with the need for an extensive period of the language used in context.",
        "",
        "To start with, using the language is a skill you can acquire, which is crucial to understand the cultural aspect of a country, but it is not enough without living a couple of months and use it with locals. For instance, in Italy, people there use their non-verbal to express themselves. Although you will be using the appropriate verbs or sentence structure, but not enough to fluently speak the Italian dialect without using hand gestures. Therefore, living and communicating with citizens is essential to have a natural flow of language.",
        "",
        "Another reason for the need to use the language in the original country over a period, which gives the opportunity to use the correct terminologies in context, permit gaining fluency. To illustrate this, being able to use the language to purchase your daily products or using it in a professional setting by using the appropriate word aids in verbal fluency. Thus socializing on a daily basis allows better acquisition of verbal communication.",
        "",
        "In conclusion, I strongly agree that culture builds an excellent way to use the appropriate word in a situation that is better than that taken from any course. Living in a region that uses that language you will know and understand how people use their native words in their daily life. Moreover, using the correct word in context while daily communication a key to ensuring language fluency."
