        "Dear Robert Johnson,",
        "The reason I am writing to you is to bring to your attention  the need for having a cafeteria in the workplace. This is a matter that was raised by some of the organization members and they would like something to be done about it.",
        "",
        "There was several feedback on the need of a cafeteria, that I thought you should know. One from Mike, our technician said that he had to travel 15 minutes to the closest fast food store. Another from Sarah, our accountant, stated she did not have an option of being able to get in the work and had to prepare it beforehand. These were the few that had common feedback rest by others.",
        "I would believe that it would be in the interest of the organization to have a cafeteria for the staff. As mentioned in the earlier feedback, I support to allow work personnel to have the option to easy access to food within the complex. Furthermore, the cafeteria would also support the organization in terms of having a place for closeness in bonding with other team members and possibly a source of revenue for the company to look into as part of supporting the team.",
        "I believe that the cafeteria could be either set  up in the foyer outside or converting the old storage room behind the place. Considering, the foyer would be ideal but there is the challenge of  having cover during the rain and cold in winter whereas the storage is enclosed but the space available to house all the employee at once is limited. I would consider the warehouse because it would be upgraded to the under-utilised space while there is the potential of just allowing the foyer for a sitting space.",
        "I hope you would look into this matter.",
        "Yours sincerely,",
