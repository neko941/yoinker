        "Dear Mr. Biden,",
        "This letter is writing within the framework of an issue, clients\u2019 complaints, you have mentioned in the latest meeting held on Monday. We have received a range of dissatisfaction with reception area including inadequate chairs, inappropriate environment and receptionist responding. I fact, one of our receptionist, Bella has been in maternity leave since 21st October and so it is important to hire a temporary employee.",
        "To commence, although our corporation has enough global popularity, there is a lack of appropriate reception area as the bulk of the office. This is because a spacious equipped area can help clients be convenient and calm even if their work postponed. We are involving with a wide range of chairman who come from different regions and thus they need to take a break, fill the form and enquiry. The reception area is more than just important as it would be a corporation\u2019s perspective.",
        "Herein, I would like to let you know my suggestion. Relocating the front desk to the upstairs give us an opportunity to use a rounded-spacious are to place a set of sofa, chairs and desk. Taking into the action, an executive employee could request equipment if you provided a payment-letter. Besides this, providing an announcement for a part-time receptionist should be in our list.",
        "Thank you for your consideration.",
        "I am looking forward to hear from you to making modifications as soon as possible.",
