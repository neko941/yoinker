        "I am aware that mountain experience is extremely amazing since I used to hike before I started to work. It has been more than five years that I gave up climbing but I would like to participate in your walking tour. My doctor recommended me that I need to walk more frequently and get a fresh air. Therefore, your program is what I was looking for, and I would appreciate if you could send me travel itinerary so I can take a vacation from work. Additionally, I am on a tight budget and I would be thankful if you could give me a reasonable price.",
        "Finally, since I have not been in a good shape for long years, I have a real concern that I could not handle the difficulty of mountain. Please let me know that mountain is suitable for beginners.",
