        "Despite the fact that social advances have brought about many benefits to people\u2019s daily lives, the rate of crime has not efficiently been curbed, but rather been aggravated. This essay will first analyze all the possible causes of the problem and then come up with several feasible solutions that could be adopted in order to avoid the aggravation of the situation.",
        "The main causes that may lead to this problem can be listed as follows. The first cause of the increasing number of juvenile delinquency might be the wrong values of the younger generation. Compared with the past, the gap between the rich and the poor has widened to a big difference. According to this phenomenon, more inequities will occurred. Therefore, youngsters who are immature, are partial to committing a crime to fight injustice. This is the inevitable result of social development. Besides, the lack of companionship of parents might be a second culprit for the growing number of juvenile delinquency. It is very common that in some rural regions of China, due to lack of work opportunities, parents prefer to get out of this underdeveloped rural region and migrate to big cities for the purpose of finding an excellent job, which leaves their children alone or living with the elderly. However, children who lack parenting and companionship of parents will be easier to go astray and that is why nowadays teenagers are committing more crimes.",
        "Several methods can be adopted in order to solve the aggravating problem. First of all, for the light circumstances, there is no doubt that their parents should pay the penalty so as to warn children do not to commit crimes. Second, under any circumstances, criminals should be reeducated. Moreover, If the juvenile offenders between sixteen and eighteen years old and had serious circumstances, such as killing someone, would go to the correctional institution.",
        "In conclusion, parents and the public should pay more attention to their children\u2019s mental health, and in order to avoid the growth of the juvenile delinquency."
