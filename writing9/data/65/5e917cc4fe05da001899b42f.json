        "These days, on the network, people are looking for the latest news, events, playing games, chatting on social networks, watching movies and much more. However, one often has to think about how relevant and truthful the information presented on the Internet is. All informational Internet streams should be divided into official ones, which include the largest agencies or mass media, websites of companies and institutions, and not official ones. You just need to more careful approach the choice of source, as well as independently analyse the situation, making the right conclusions.",

        "In an addition to this, on a wider level in this situation, the media and journalists should control everything, double-check their data and resources that they want to post on websites on the Internet. Double-check the relevance and correctness of the information and only then release it so that there are no problems and incorrect sources.",
