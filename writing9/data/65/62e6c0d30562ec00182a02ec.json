        "Some cases show some people consider part-time work and earning money is an excellent idea for teenagers to be learned and become responsible individuals in society meanwhile, some other men and women opine working for the teenager will lose the time of resting and after school project.",
        "To begin with, a part-time job is a proper strategy for the person who has major activity and still has time to earn some money. Students are great examples of this manner especially teenagers. Students mostly are spending 6-8 hours in school and after that, there is a period of time that they can do some out-school activities like a part-time job. When teenagers earn money at a young age, the belief shows how it is hard to earn money and never waste it, will be happened in their mind. In addition, working as a member of society even working at a part-time job mounts responsibility, expertise, and experience in this manner. Furthermore, the most crucial thing is it might be the light for discovering their own talents.",
        "However, they should never forget to not take things in their stride which can have serious consequences on their lives. Schools are meant to be the first and most suitable places for children to become responsible, literate, and achieve scientific information. After school, there is a lot of homework and lessons exit to take care. Involving in a part-time job may postpone after-school activities which makes school lessons worst. According to recent studies, teenagers who were contributing to a part-time job illustrated weaker physical and mental conditions than did those without a part-time job. This definitely will be harmful to the health and major activities of teenagers.",
        "Taken together, it is believed juveniles have the opportunity to become responsible and expert people like adult individuals only with involving in a part-time job. Although, some consequences are inevitable. I believed teenagers with an appropriate long-term plan, can get through school, entertainment, rest and work altogether."
