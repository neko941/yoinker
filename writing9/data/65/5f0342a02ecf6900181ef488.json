        "It is undeniable that bookstores or newspaper stands are not as exciting as they used to be. Many proponents opine that free online news are being captured by myriad individuals and as a result, traditional newspapers or book publishing firms will go extinct. I tend to agree with the statement and will discuss my opinions with pertinent examples.",
        "On the one hand, top media companies and firms are anticipating to observe the transformation because of the digital advertisement. That is to say, as readers usually pick a free version, companies usually put and enable digital commercials through the websites as a new way of income. For an example, every five out of eight leading newspapers in South Asia have their virtual versions of their contents which generate revenues only through Google Ad network. Conversely, if people start picking printed copies, they will be losing financially because they might get one for free on the internet.",
        "On top of that, there is a growing number of e-readers because people have become aware about the environment. This is because everyone is suffering from the climate changes happening in the world. According to a recent study in the University of Cambridge, one online newspaper viewer is approximately saving three trees in a year as he/she decides to avoid the traditional solutions. Numerous forests, however, will soon be diminshed if users keep encouraging to buy any paperbacks or hard copies.",
        "To sum up, in spite of having printed books and newspapers for so many years, people have transformed and geared towards reading free online editions. In my opinion, behaviour change is not only saving money, but also saving the planet."
