        "I hope you\u2019re doing well. I\u2019ve received your message asking for the details of the English course I attended last month. Therefore, I\u2019m writing this letter to give you the information about the course.",
        "As I\u2019ve already told you, the name of the center is Zim academy and it has two locations in district one and district three. You could sign up at either branch, however, the second office seems closer to your house.",
        "About the course, you and I are on the same level so I highly recommend the intermediate class organized every two months. This course teaches four English skills including listening, reading, writing and speaking. The class only gathers three to five students at a time so that tutors can efficiently track your progress. Personally, I find this class fun and motivated to study resulting in a massive improvement in my English. More importantly, this course helped me reach my target in the last IELTS exam.",
        "As for you, my friend. I believe this course will suit you well because not only the price is reasonable but also the schedule is quite flexible.",
        "Again, just give me a call if you need any more details.",
