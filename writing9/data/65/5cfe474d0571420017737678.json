In addition to this, celebrities like sport stars or actors often receives their fame and fortune by the general public views in the media.",
        "The news media has more of a positive impact than a negative one. On one hand , cyclones can be forecasted by the news channels where government takes proper action or saves lives of the endangered  people like that happened in coasts of Odissa, India ,last year, where several inhabitants were moved to a safer place due to a hit of \u2018feni\u2019.Through the news , people can be motivated to increase awareness regarding crime rate or violence. On the other hand, people can also misjudge the products which comes with a celebrity tag and may lose their original identity.  Similarly, spread of fake news can be sudden and people may get panicstricken hearing the news ending in a chaotic situation.",
