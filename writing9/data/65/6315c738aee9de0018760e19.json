        "I Partially agree with this statement, however sports facilities somewhat help to increase public well-being. Different other measures are required to put people in front to improve physical well-being.",
        "To Begin with, People said the best way to improve public strength is by increasing the number of sports facilities. Whereas to increase physical fitness requires sports premises. Everybody in this world community is working more hours by degrading their health and they are not focusing on their fitness or doing any playing activity. Every Individual people cannot afford sports premises. The government is organising various events for the nation to participate in different competitions, so that crowd will keep interested in participating in playing events and they will keep themselves fit as well as healthy.",
        "Moreover, only sports stations will not help public fitness. It will require different measures like moving to the GYM for doing various exercises and Yoga is the best exercise to make yourself fit and put your body in an extreme position in which you will feel relaxed . Moving to the GYM and going to various sports stations increases your endurance power and stamina and creates more impact in your body to regain your strength. For,example now a local municipal corporation opened an open-air GYM for all the community to do exercise and it is  free of cost.",
        "Lastly, Health is the most important thing in which you can keep yourself fit. Doing daily activities makes you stay strong and creates a good impact on your body."
