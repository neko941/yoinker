        "Multimedia games containing violent content are liked by many across the globe. A section of the society believes that they should be banned because of their negative impacts. Others opine that computer games are a way to relax and should not be banned. I agree with the former opinion as violence-filled computer games alter the psychology of humans besides being a waste of time.",
        "On the one hand, playing computer games is regarded as the best pass-time activity. People have a hectic routine with very little time to enjoy themselves. As such, computer games are played by a number of people to soothe their nerves after a day\u2019s hectic routine. Moreover, playing computer games is the easiest leisure activity to undertake. Unlike outdoor or arcade games, one can play multimedia games on a screen without having to arrange other players at any time.",
        "On the other hand, the psychological and individual impacts of violence-marred multimedia games can only be seen as negative. Firstly, computer games alter the psychology of the people, making them indifferent to violence. As blood and gore is fed over a period of time, the brain develops a sort of immunity to it. Eventually, people lose conscience and act indifferent to violence in actual life. Secondly, computer games are unproductive and a number of people waste their time on them. The learning opportunity in violent games is almost nil and people, especially youngsters, waste a lot of time which could be spent at a rather productive task.",
        "In conclusion, and in my opinion, although computer games are thought to be of importance for people\u2019s entertainment, their gory content castes a very bad psychological impact on people. Also, computer games are a waste of time and therefore, they should be banned for masses."
