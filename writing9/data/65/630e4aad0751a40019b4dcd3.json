        "Nowadays, the demand for the right news sources has received a great deal of public attention. One school of thought opine that the optimal way to know the news is through printed newspaper, meanwhile others pick up media-based outlets as their best choice in terms of learning the news. This essay will disscuss both views and showcase my opinion.",
        "On the one hand, the reason a number of people count on newspapers may be due to its high authenticity compare to other news sourses. First, the printers and publishers do not want to lose prestige so they have to make sure the contents are thoroughly edited, censored, checked carefully. In addiction, news from newspaper is well-written and researched by professional journalists before publishing, making it the most reliable source for people to read. Second, as newspapers have been introduced for a long while, they have become an indispensable part of people\u2019s day-to-day reding habit, chiefly the senior citizens. Looking up to our previous generations like our parents, grandparents, we can easily recognize that they stored tons of newspapers in home.",
        "On the other hand, there are also resons for those who support receiving news online. To begin with, this method makes the news become more accessable since the news media outlets deliver information nearly immediately through different platforms and, the key factor, is that people do not have to pay to read them. With the widespread presence of the internet, people with portable devices, such as a smartphone, can get access to the news storage with just a few clicks. But it sparks out concerns when, unlike news from newspaper, news via social media is mostly uncetificated, plus its tremendous spreading speed, all can create serious controversials. Like last year, a fan page established news with the title: Bille Eillish committed suicide. As a concequent, it became a hot news and caused detrimental effect on the singer\u2019s personal life.",
        "In conclusion, despite all the advantages and disadvantages of receiving news online. I strongly believe that people can enjoy easier access throught new news sourses."
