        "Sometimes it is argued that, freedom of speech must be given. I will shun some light on this topic in my essay below.",
        "Firstly, freedom of speech means, generally those countries are democratic countries, in which people will have this right.  India and many other countries in the world are democratic countries and we are fortunate to have this opportunity. In my opinion, it is a must. Everybody must be respected, must be given equal rights, regardless of whether he is a rich or poor, black or white, young or old, male or female. Thus, we will have a good and healthy environment. This is at country level. Secondly, freedom of speech must be given at home also, to the female and to the children also.  Nowadays, this is followed in the big cities at homes. Unlike to cities, freedom of speech is not followed in rural area. Male and elderly dominate the house. Generally, females and children are suppressed there. For instance, my friend is from a rural area. He said his personal incident. After the death of his father, he was shivering even to touch his father's dead body.",
        "Generally, in the cities, ladies and children will have freedom of speech.  For example, one of my friend's son, because of freedom of speech, he was arguing at early stages.",
        "Later on he reached to the heights of not obeying at all to his parents. Unlike, democratic countries, there are countries who have kings and dictators. For example, China has dictatorship and has no freedom of speech. Thus, people are suppressed there. Some people argue that, there should be dictatorship for the development and growth of the economy and the country. In case of democratic countries, always there are opposition parties interfering in each and every matter where the government cannot take the bold decisions.",
        "Finally, to conclude, in my opinion, freedom of speech must be given but it should be balanced."
