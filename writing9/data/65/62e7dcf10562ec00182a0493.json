        "Education is the main key to prosper in life individually or as a nation. Some individuals say that to become enrich, government should spend more money in studying science related subjects than other subjects like arts and commerce. However, I think that authority should invest currency in teaching other subjectsas much as teaching science subjects.",
        "To begin with, teaching science is very beneficial for a nation because in todays world all the invention which makes people\u2019s life or a nation faster is due to well-being of modern science. Peope use science all the walks of their life. All the important things that advent till now is just because of studying science. So, when a people getting knowledge about science that means he/she grasping information about the earth. If a person advent a new things by studying science which can be possible is beneficial for the nation where he/she lived as a result this country can make progress by using this invention. This has lead to make a country valuable towards the other nation of the world. In USA, for example, they have a great fame about science and technology. Because of this, they become the headman of the world. Therefore, the more students studying in science in a country, the higher possibility there will be to become progress.",
        "On the other hand, governments should also invest capital in teaching other subjects such as arts and commerce cause a country can not improve their status by only improving science departments. How developed a country depends on how well their all education sector. Studying arts and commerce subjects can improve a person\u2019s position as well as a nations. Many countries produce famous businessman who gave their country a huge amount of VAT every year from their business and most of those people were not studied in  science, they were studied in other subjects. For instance,  Zakma- the founder of the most growing e-commerce site  \u2018Alibaba\u2019- his country (china) earn a plenteous amount of money from his e-commerce site. Due to his reputation, china gets lots of investment from the world. Hence, spending money on other subjects can be being a way of development for a nation.",
        "In conclusion, without developing education system, a nation can not progress his value in-front of the world. For this some people say, a country should invest money more in science departments than other sectors. My opinion is to spend money on both devision equally."
