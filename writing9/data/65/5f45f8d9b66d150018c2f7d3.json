        "To begin with, the appearance of music in each and every society has changed a lot. Previously there was not such influence about the music but in the 21st era, it has great influence on people. But according to some people thinking that nowadays music plays a marvellous role in the society but there is also some group of people who thinks that it is just a kind of entertainment. Let's discuss both the view in appropriate manner and give an opinion on it.",
        "Firstly, in today's world music has changed a lot and it has great impact on people, long time back there was not such influence about music which we know now. Lately people were only influenced by classical or traditional type of music and there was no different type of music exists. In our olden days musician uses the very least amount of instruments to form a simple kind of music. An instrument like sitar, flutes were very popular in the olden days, but nowadays many new different instruments have invented and it has great impact on the musician as well as the music industry too. According to some group of people, music plays an important role in the community and yes, it's true, because music has great importance in almost every field like for example: - these day's music is used to cure many diseases like cancer, stress and many other.",
        "Secondly, there are also some people who say that it is just a simple form of entertainment. According to their prospective it might be true because usually, people listen to music to refresh themselves or they listen for the entertainment purpose and as claimed by them, music also doesn't play an important act in terms of development of a person.",
        "Lastly, in my opinion music has a great impact on people, but again, it depends on person to person where they are using it for entertainment purpose or they are using in terms to achieve their goals."
