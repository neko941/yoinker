        "Around us, we notice\u200b \u200bd\u200b many people are using social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter. It is considered by many that social networking site has many advantages, while some believe \u200b d\u200b that social networking site encourages criminals. I partially agree with both views, because of technology, people can stay closer to the world with cheap and efficient communication.",

Because of social media, many old and new friends can chat easily, share the information about their lives. Also, those peoples who migrated in another country, they can stay connected \u200bthrough \u200bby\u200b social media like a Facebook video call. Moreover, many people \u200b with similar interest can form a group and learn from each other which increases their knowledge in that particular field\u200b. For example, some people like to know more about the painting, so they follow the painter\u2019s community and \u200b get more idea about different painters who work around the world.",

Nowadays\u200b,\u200b people are \u200bvery \u200b addicted from these social sites, which \u200baffects \u200bon their physical and psychological health. For instance, many students, who\u200b are \u200b neglect\u200bed\u200b \u200bby  their friends. \u200bTake revenge \u200b by \u200b \u200b  accessing \u200b the \u200b \u200b \u200b friend\u2019s \u200baccount \u200b and threaten them. Many people create the fake account and chat\u200b. There are many people \u200bwho \u200bover\u200b share their\u200b personal \u200b details on the social site\u200b,\u200b which \u200bmakes it easy for criminals to hack into.",
