        "I have some exciting news, I have been granted an opportunity to participate to a short training course in Adelaide by April of this year. I'm  thrilled to see you and experience living in your lovely place.",
        "What excites the most, apart from meeting you, are the many wonderful adventures I have yet to try while I'm there.  I'm looking forward to go to Glenelg Beach after training and on weekends, I would like to travel a bit father away and explore Mount Lofty. Are there any other destinations you might be able to recommend? How about food? Where do you usually go for dinner? I like Vietnamese and Thai food, do you have any good restaurants that I might be able to try?",
        "I'm also anticipating to meet with you shortly upon my arrival. When do you suggest we catch up? It's been ages since we were able to hang out over a cup of coffee so we definitely have to make up for lost time. Let me know so we can arrange the time and date for our meeting.",
