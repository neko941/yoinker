        "In this contemporary epoch, it has been observed that the population of people who tend to use alternative medicines and treatments are increasing, and they less resort to visiting doctor and using professional treatment. Although some aspects of this issue can be profitable for society, I think the demerits of self-curing are far from the merits.",
        "There are inevitable side effects of this issue, but the main reason that treats people is using imperfect cure that drives them to worsen their heath situation. Firstly , using the wrong dose of medicine may damage the body and in some cases not only can not help the improvement but also leads to long term horrible effects. Secondly , there is a verity treatments for one disease that needs a perfect diagnosis . For ,example in diabetes and blood pressure a person who decides to take some pills to release their pain or bad feeling may choose a kind of pill or diet irrespective of scientific principles. As a result , due to self-curing, people may find themselves a victim of pills and they should pay twice after that.",
        "On the other hand , in some special conditions like flu and simple cold, if people had these diseases and got some feasible advice from their doctor, they could use alternative treatments. Moreover , by the time people were accustomed to the right self-treatment , they had gotten the immediate results . Hence , this method saves money and time for them in process of curing.",
        "To conclude, the proportion of people who use alternate way to cure is increasing. In some conditions can consider this phenomenon positive development. As mentioned, saving money and time and faster and more practical results . On another side, using medicine and lack of awareness from dose of them lead to calamitous consequences."
