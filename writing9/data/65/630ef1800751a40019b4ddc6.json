        "Although study main subjects and finish all the examination is crucial for the future of the students, I do belive that less important subjects should not study from others people instead of teachers.",
        "To begin with, friends and family are not professional to teach students the right way and the correct theory to practice their cookery, dressmaking and woodmaker skills. Therefore, students should learn those subjects from the experts at school so that they can avoid accident in woodmaking. In accdition, students might found their talent when study sub-subjects and that will be their memorable experience. These subjects may not useful at the present but maybe in the future they will be able to use it, for example when your shirt is broken, you will know how to fix it because you had studied dressmaking before.",
        "On the other hand, athough sub-subjects is helpful and fun, but students should spend limit time with them to have more time for academic subjects. Learning math, history, philosophy and others main subjects can training studens\u2019 mind and they will have a good foundation to hunt a good scores from every exam. As a result, they can have more achievement to decorate their CV for a better future. With all the knowledge students collect from their education path, they will have a extensive knowledge and wide vision of the world to develope themselves. For instance, study a lots help us improve ourselves and closer to success.",
        "To summarize, not only students should learn sub-subjects in school if they be able to, but also they should spend more time for the main subjects to pass exams. However,  they should balance study between crucial and less important subjects."
