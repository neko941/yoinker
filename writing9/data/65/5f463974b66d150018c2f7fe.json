        "It is argued that everyone should follow higher education to academic learn, other people stimulate to engage in vocational training with a target of providing a well qualified employees into society. In my opinion, I totally disagree with this view because I believed both obeying college and job teaching be vital the same",
        "There are several compelling reasons that it is integral for students to adapt to academic study at university.Firstly, following higher education provides qualification. Because, in society these days, a myriad of recruiters have trended to choice candidates with a university qualification. For example, a plethora of foreign companies only recruits their employees who possess academic qualification and English degree. Moreover, tertiary education offers an enormous amount of deep knowledge which facilitate them to high expert work such as doctor, teacher, engineer,...Take Vietnam as a telling example, By conforming university education, a huge array of students stands a better chance in order to have a well- paid job, leading to promote significantly worker\u2019s living standard and employees\u2019 living quality",
        "I am in favor of the idea that vocational training courses bring a large variety of merits. The first perk is that occupational teaching is a great way to save more time and money, which extending higher education had to pay so much. For example,Take Vietnam is a telling for this, those following higher education paid 30-40 millions VND tuition fee each year, which was three to four times as much as working training courses.In addition, job training creates a tremendous amount of opportunities to conquer various useful and practical skills. Because they tried out different fields such as grab, financially manage, Telesales,... Which helps them learn a huge array of valuable lessons like how to work more effectively with their employers and colleagues, how to make wise decisions or how to deal with difficult customers due to which play an essential role in any jobs",
        "In conclusion, I believe that people should be learned academy education. But I also advocate the idea that there is a rich diversity of positive things if people decide to get a job straight after graduating high school"
