        "It is true that economic progress plays a vital role for any particular country, this is because all countries mostly depend on their economy, however, some individuals think that other sectors such as education, employment and medical sectors development also play a vital role for a country. In this essay, I will discuss  both views and I think that other regions' growth is also important for a nation along with economic progress.",
        "On the one hand, economic growth is the stronger section of a nation's improvement. To illustrate this, it helps to make the country  stronger economically, hence, many chances of getting foreign investors in the domestic country. Also, the advancement of any nation is usually measured on the basis of the growth of domestic products (GDP). For example, the United state of America's economic sector is much stronger compared to other nations, and for that reason, the USA know as a great economic power country in the world.",
        "On the other hand, other sectors such as educational, medical and employment sectors progress play a vital role in particular nation advancement. Firstly, the literacy rate of any country makes the nation more technical and digitalised. For example, Japan's literacy rate is 80% and for that Japan is the world's greatest technical advancement country followed by the USA and China. Secondly, employment is much important goal for every nation because without employment it will be difficult for people to manage their household budget, and as a result, the crime rate will increase rapidly. Furthermore, the medical sector is a basic need for people, with  good medical facilities we can save billions of people's life.",
        "In conclusion, after considering all, I think that other sectors such as educational, medical and employment are also crucial sectors along with economic development for the nation's improvement."
