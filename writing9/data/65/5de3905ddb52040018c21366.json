        "Dear Sir/Ma\u2019am,",
        "I am one of the loyal customers of SBS Transit and always travel with its buses and trains. I am writing this letter to you to report some issues that I have in a couple of weeks ago.",
        "Every morning, I take bus 856 in front of my block 209 to Woodlands Bus Interchange. Last two weeks ago, the bus reached to my bus stop ten minutes late even though the bus arrival application showed that it was coming. However, I understood that there might be some traffic on the way but it did not happen just for one day. The bus kept arriving late the next morings which was really inconvenient for me. My office hour starts at 8.30 AM normally and I reached at 9.30 AM due to late arrival of the bus. Another problem is the bus arrival application to check the buses status online. I noticed that this application does not reflect the real time bus coming updates, so that I could not trust the application status no matter what time the bus is coming.",
        "I would like SBS company to take actions on these problems and make sure that the buses run the exact time without getting late and an application shows the correct information for customers as well.",
        "I hope to hear from you once you receive this letter and feel free to contact me if you need any further information.",
        "Yours faithfully,",
