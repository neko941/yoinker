        "Studying patterns have been changing rapidly due to the evolution of the education system in the current world. Ample amount of countries believe that children\u2019s should do their assessments during their free time apart from regular study hours while some nation\u2019s condemn it by saying that this free time must be used for engaging infant\u2019s in outdoor activities. This essay will completely agree, why it is essential to study even in non-regular hours and I addition it also provides suitable examples to support this statement.",
        "The first major reason for encouraging this practice is because of the current education structure. During the class hours children\u2019s are only taught concepts, but they aren\u2019t practiced and moreover this phenomenon makes them hard to memorize things that they have been preached earlier and studying after class helps them to recollect things easily. For example, From my personal experience if I don\u2019t study after my school, I forget the concepts and in the end I used to struggle getting good grades. Hence, Doing homework helps to be updated with the course work.",
        "The second major reason is related to success factor. In order to excel in the course, one must put more efforts and time on it apart from the normal hours. Doing homework helps students to devote more time on the subject and help them to reach greater heights. For instance, Elon musk used to study more about physics after class and now he is enjoying the fruit of all the efforts that he had put earlier. Hence, over time studying will help one to succeed in life.",
        "Although, involving in physical activities is important, but devoting more time to studies outweigh the benefits derived from outdoor activities. To conclude, infants doing homework after class helps them to recollect what they learn in class and moreover it also help\u2019s them to succeed in life. Hence, this essay has successfully discussed about the importance of doing homework and also supported this statement with real life examples."
