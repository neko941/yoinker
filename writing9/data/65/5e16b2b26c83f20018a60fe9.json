        "It is argued that volunteering for community work should be made part of the high school curriculum. I completely agree because of the benefits it brings to pupils as voluntary work can help students develop soft skills, and these extracurricular activities are valued by universities and employers.",
        "Education should not be limited to strictly academic pursuits and those in",
        "education should also develop life skills, such as teamwork, empathy and selfdiscipline. In my view, one of the best ways to hone these aptitudes is through community service. Serving those less fortunate than ourselves  teaches us many lessons including how to work with people from other backgrounds and the value of hard work. For example, I personally volunteered to spend 5 weeks in Botswana teaching disadvantaged children and this led to a much higher work ethic when I returned to my studies.",
        "Many colleges and companies are increasingly looking for this type of experience. Most school leavers have the same grades and charitable works can help set them apart from the rest of the crowd. For instance, Cambridge and Oxford receive thousands of applications from straight-A students every year and can only accept a small percentage of applicants. The experience a young person has outside the classroom is often the thing that differentiates them from everyone else and helps them attain the coveted position they are looking for.",
        "In conclusion, I believe teenagers should be made to participate in unpaid work as part of their schooling as it will help them learn things they would not ordinarily learn from their teachers, as well as boosting their chances of getting into tertiary education."
