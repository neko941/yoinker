        "It is common that many conventional techniques and lifestyles gradually disappeared due to the modern technology. Some people agree that it is useless to keep them alive. I personally agree it under certain condition; however,\u00a0I opine that it is important to carry on\u00a0conventional skills for future generations and the essay will discuss my view.",
        "",
        "To begin with, firstly, customary skills and old fashioned\u00a0lifestyles may be outdated due to the introduction of modern devices; however, they are extremely valuable for\u00a0human beings' civilization histories. Moreover, some traditional skills such as cooking, guarding, sewing, and etc. are essential for people to master as survival skills. Although the advance in agricultural\u00a0and industrial sectors provides all daily life items to meet\u00a0inhabitants' demand, learning customary skills and living old fashioned lifestyle will provide a chance for the youth to learn human history. Finally, certain traditional skills are considered as part of valuing cultural activities. For example, printing is essential in all economic sectors; however, traditional Chinese writing and\u00a0painting are\u00a0still\u00a0many Chinese's favours. Many Chinese are fond of practicing them. Many customary skills provide profound economic opportunities to earn money as well.",
        "",
        "However, some traditional skills should be allowed to disappear in terms of the social selection.\u00a0Some may also cause negative impact on human societies. For instance, raising poultries in living places in cities may put\u00a0inhabitants' health at risk to catch infectious diseases, cooking with wood\u00a0in inner cities may worsen\u00a0air pollution, and riding horses in the road will disturb the traffic system on the roads. As a result, some conventional skills or old fashioned lifestyles should be allowed to disappear.",
        "",
        "In conclusion, the advance of technology provides novel and modern products to guide\u00a0inhabitants to have a better life. Meanwhile, conventional skills and old fashioned lifestyles may not play the same role in the contemporary era as in the past. Some of them\u00a0still are precious content in our societies due to the above reasons. Therefore, keeping them alive will\u00a0 be precious gifts from our descendants in order to have a better understanding of our ancestors."
