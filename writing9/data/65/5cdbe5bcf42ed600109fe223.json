        "I am writing to you today to provide my feedback about the decision of your company to use the money for the benefit of our community. I would like to put forward some of the benefits of sponsoring the children's sports team. Sports is the one of the best ways for children to develop skills like team building, planning and handling difficult situations effectively. If your company sponsors the local children's team, it will be motivate more and more number of children to participate in the sports activities. It will truly help them for their overall development.",
        "However, there are few benefits of having open air concerts as well such as the local food vendors can put up the stall and earn some money. Local bands can participate and showcase their talents. It will help them to get some promotion and bigger opportunities.",
        "In my perspective, your company should sponsor the local children's sports team as it will drive more children towards sports. It may inspire another companies also to do the same. Having the open air concerts is a good idea but the community has already had five concerts in the past two years. So to sum it all up, benefits of sponsoring the children's sports team outweighs the benefits of paying for open air concerts.",
        "Thanks you for your time and consideration.",
