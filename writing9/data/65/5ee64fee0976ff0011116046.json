        "The tourism industry is highly trending in the growing world of globalization due to easing of travel restrictions by several countries worldwide. There are valid arguments while considering its merits and demerits, however in my view, I agree with the notion of supporting the tourism.",
        "First and foremost, the development of the aviation industry and its affordable prices have encouraged the numerous people to explore the new places, cultures, heritages, cuisines, and languages. In fact, this gives an employment and businesses to the local industries such as restaurants, hotels, travel guides, cabs and local shops, and thus boost the nation\u2019s economy by generating the revenue. Additionally, it reduces the unemployment rate and hence, escalates the living standards of the public. Secondly, the government has generated various reforms to spend the specific amount of budget to promote the tourists. For instance, the money is used for the maintenance of historical museums and monuments which attracts tourist and further helps in preserving the nation\u2019s culture and heritage. Thirdly, several countries have eased the travel restrictions by simplifying the visa rules and even providing the visa on arrivals to the citizens of some countries.",
        "Contrarily, some people think that an inflow of the large number of visitor results in the crowding of the local places and thus overburdening the city services such as public transportation, beaches, art galleries, food and shops. In addition to it, some travellers don\u2019t practice the cleanliness measures, and openly dispose of their trash on roadsides and in the local trains and buses. Moreover, some even bring them with communicable diseases such as acute respiratory infections or viral illnesses.",
        "To recapitulate, I opine regardless of few negative effects, the tourism should be promoted in terms of its benefits in the form of generating employment, flourishing various businesses and growth of the country."
