        "In contemporary society, it is generally believed that people should work in a field in which they feel interested. However, others argue that making a living to meet their daily essential needs is more vital and thus people are highly advised to look for a stable job. Personally, I am more convinced by the former statement.",
        "For a variety of reasons, it would be more effective if people choose to work in their desired profession. It is evident that when employees hold a passion for their jobs, they tend to exert more efforts and time to their assigned tasks. As a result, they are more frequent to achieve high levels of productivity with outstanding work performance. In addition, as people\u2019s interests escalate along with their performance, they will labour around more in order to find the way to improve both effectiveness and efficiency levels. Such dedication will produce a high sense of motivation and the boredom at work will no longer exist.",
        "Apart from the aforementioned practical concerns, it would be justifiable for some people to claim that having a permanent job should be their top priority. As a matter of fact, all human beings must satisfy their physiological needs, including eating, clothing and sheltering, prior to any other personal demands. In this scale, making sustainable earnings from a secure job plays a much more pivotal role and job satisfaction is considered as just a secondary criterion to achieve happiness in life. Under the same circumstances, people who place high value on job satisfaction have a tendency to engage in resignation until they manage to find a satisfactory workplace. Such frequent changes are usually perceived as lack of organisation loyalty and task persistence in some culturally-conservative societies. Therefore, this might have detrimental effects on their future employment opportunities.",
        "Taking everything into consideration, this reinforces my perspective that persuasion of job satisfaction is likely to produce more positive outcomes in terms of productivity and motivation compared to having a permanent job."
