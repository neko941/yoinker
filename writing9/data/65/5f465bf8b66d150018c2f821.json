I am worried about the possibility that card is in the possession of other people and will be misused for irrelevant transactions. If that happens, that will put me in the unfavourable and inconvenient situation. In addition, my old card was expired and I am waiting for the new one since I am leaving the country for a Dubai trip next week. I am planning to use it when I am there and I am very disappointed with what happened.",
