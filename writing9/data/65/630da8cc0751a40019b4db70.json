        "Agriculture is the backbone to develop the nation economically. Some communities believe that local farmers will get security by implementing some policies related to taxes. In this essay, I will give my opinion on this matter and then we will see some relevant examples on this matter.",
        "To begin with, Farmers are the people, who produce food in every country. People in  society can eat healthy food, which is produced by  local farmers. For example, People buy food items from local farmers because they bring the food items like vegetables, honey, etc to the market freshly. Imported food items are stored for many days so, people choose some food items freshly from local farmers. Because they produce the food using natural manure in their cultivated fields.",
        "On the other side, Some people choose imported food items to acquire more proteins. But, Community should apply some policies to these imports. These policies are like special taxes. By adding some special taxes to the imported food local farmers will get some benefits to sell their local products. Most people will choose to buy products which are cheap and have good quality. But during some health issues like protein deficiency, etc people try to buy some imported foods. For instance, Noni fruit, which is the most imported food because it deals with the reduction of cancer and improves the immunity power of  unhealthy people.",
        "To sum up, In my view, I agree with the given statement that it is admirable to add some special taxes to the imported products this is beneficial to local farmers to sell their local products."
