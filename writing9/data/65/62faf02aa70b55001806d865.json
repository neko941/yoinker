        "More young people enter into university nowadays, and this arouses extensive discussion in society. Some people reckon that this is definitely beneficial to the country, while others argue that this is a major problem causing the graduate unemployment. In my opinion, I think there is more pros and cons when talking about people going for college study.",
        "Admittedly, in university, students will be taught many useful lessons, which are proposed to help them with their future career and then contribute to their country. For instance, if students learn about city geography in campus, they will probably take jobs about urban construction after graduation. They are equipped with profound knowledge and skills in their colleges, so they have adequate ability to give advice on solving certain society problems such as traffic congestion and housing shortages. Moreover, more young students in university means that they will be cultivated to more qualified people, and this will make for the promotion of nation virtues.",
        "On the other hand, because of the increasing number of college graduates, social competition for jobs has become more intense. Most companies are desired to recruit staffs with higher education background which is a symbol of a better capacity for work. Meanwhile, others who are not so highly educated will suffer from a hard time to find jobs, leading to graduate unemployment. But this cannot blame on the growing number of college students. Essentially, the lack of jobs is a major reason, and even some university students are victims. Especially in recent years during the epidemic period, many companies are under financial pressure so that they have to lay off workers, which makes the unemployment even worse than ever.",
        "In conclusion, I believe that more people going for study in university will benefit to the society for its current problems and future development. Although the unemployment is increasing now, this is not the fault of graduates. Only providing more positions can release the issue."
