        "According to some news reports published , the number of wild animals  all over the globe has reduced drastically in the last half-century. In my opinion , both individuals and government can collaborate into protecting these animals by taking appropriate measures . I will explicate my point of view in the upcoming paragraphs.",
        "Commencing with, pollution and human activities performed for manufacturing practices have impacted our environment. Consequently, numerous animals die in their habitat . Thus protecting the climate is essential for saving wild creatures, For instance , fumes generated by vehicles pollute the air and animals cannot breathe properly which leads to the end of their lives .Moreover , Cutting down the forests for business purposes affects the life of creatures found in wild areas. Government should enforce a law against illegal activities of cutting down the trees for personal profits. A survey conducted by the Forest commission society showed that disappeared 30 per cent due to the destruction of forests .",
        "Apart from this, the Illegal activities of poachers and hunters should be restricted. Although  the government have banned unlicensed hunters to go into forests and hunting  wild animals  still ample  people destruct the animals for commercial purposes and for personal benefits also. To exemplify, humans sell animals skin for various purposes and consumption as meat for a nutritious diet, Government can pass a law on illegal hunting of wild animals and poachers which can be subject to the imprisonment of 2 or more years. In addition to this, awareness should be spread among people about the precious life of animals and alternative foods of meat which contains proteins must be founded out .",
        "To conclude , recent reports have stated that creatures found in wild areas rapidly declined in the last fifty years. I believe that stopping hunters from illegal hunting and poachers can protect wild species."
