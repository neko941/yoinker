Apart from this, large buildings are a good source of air as well as lighting resulting in making the best choice for youngsters resulting in enjoying the panoramic view of the city.",
        "However, a few municipalities have more independent houses because of having more safety features  storey houses . Nevertheless, open land can be utilised for commercial purposes such as making more flyovers , supermarkets and also growing vegetables which helps in creating many employment opportunities ultimately leads to the development of the nation. For instance, the countries which have excess production of foodgrains are doing export to other nations and helps in establishing good bond among countries ultimately making  flourishing the nation.",
        "To conclude, although the independent house has more safety features , it is a good way to curb the issues of housing as everyone can easily afford it, helps in staying healthy and also provide employment to many individuals that cannot be overlooked."
