        "It is believed by some that art is an important subject at school while others think learning art wastes time. This essay will discuss both sides of the arguments and explain why art is an essential subject to learn at school.",
        "On the one hand, some people consider art as a useless subject that children should not learn. People find subjects like science, history, and maths are more useful for children. By studying general subjects for, such as maths and science, children can apply the on a daily basis. Even though learning general subjects like science, maths, and history has several benefits, children also need to learn other subject like art and music. How can learning art benefits children?",
        "On the other hand, art is a useful subject for children to learn. Art helps children develop their creativity and imagination. Furthermore, by learning art, children can learn how to be creative, how to create their own art, and how to use their imagination and creativity into a good use. For instance, children can pour their thoughts and emotions into drawings, paintings, and comics. This way, they can learn how to express themselves more. Moreover, by learning art, children can obtain a new skill that might be useful for them in the future. For example, if a child wants to be a designer, they can apply the knowledge they earn when they learn art, even though they also need to master maths.",
        "Finally, in my opinion, even though many people believe that learning art is useless, I believe that learning art is beneficial for children.",
        "In conclusion, learning art is very beneficial and useful for children, despite the facts that many people think it is useless."
