        "Language is most essential aspect for a human to carry their conversation, However people from a different nations talk into their own language. Although, experts believe that a large number of people prefer a single language in upcoming days. I think this would be the most desirable aspect of human being. As it will reduce the most complex thing from human conversation.",
        "To begin with, it is assumed by the scientist, that there will be a common language for all the countries in a few times. As all masses talking in a same language, it would be open the international boundaries for the trader to make a hassle free trade. Therefore, it would boost the economy of the nation. This lead to an improve the standard of living of a particular nation. For instance, If there will be no language barrier and all people speak in a same language, this would be turn into a more income for the city as at lead to directly benefit to humanity. Additionally, the country will face neither a communication problem, nor a relation, as same language speaks by everyone.",
        "On the other hand, there are several detrimental effects of this worrying trend. Such as, a nation lose their own native language, which were spoken from ancient time. This way they get away from their own culture and tradition. Apart from this, if language is not same it is quite difficult for individual to identify someone background through their words. For Example, In India there are 29 states and each state have their language so it is an easy to recognise someone through their language. As every person from different city speak different language.",
        "To conclude this, There is a plethora of adverse effects of the same languagelanguage in the world. However, there is an immense benefit of the same languagelanguage in all parts of the word. Which opens a boundaries for business. Moreover, it improves the way of communication."
