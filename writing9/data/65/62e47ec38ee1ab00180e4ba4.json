        "As the number of private cars has increased in the world, the level of pollution has become a very serious problem. In response to environmental concerns, we need to find solutions. This essay will focus on some possibilities for reducing the amount of pollution.",
        "One possible solution to this problem is that the government could provide subsidies to encourage people to purchase electric cars. Many people are already aware of the eco-friendliness of electric vehicles, but some are concerned about initial vehicle purchase costs. If a number of incentives were available, electric vehicles would be more appealing to consumers and businesses.",
        "Another potential solution could be to discourage the use of private cars by raising taxes. In other words, taxation on petrol and diesel fuel could be increased to very high levels that people would give up using private vehicles. If the cost of buying and running cars increased, many people would consider using alternative forms of transport such as trains, buses, and even walking.",
        "Improvement in public transport also offers some scope for curbing emissions. According to a certain journal, car travel is at present diminishing in some urban areas where the local government tries to provide lower fares, special concessions, more frequent services and bus priority lanes. By contrast, in rural areas where not enough public transport is provided, citizens have no choice but to drive cars, and in such places, governments should provide a major part of the overall financing volume for developing transport infrastructure.",
        "To conclude, it seems that there are various approaches to making the problem less damaging. Most of them are expensive, but the pollution is so serious that the problem can not be ignored."
