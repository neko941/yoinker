        "Addressing the constantly changing weather issue has long been a challenging task for many scientists. However, there are some who think that people should make adaptation to climate change in lieu of developing an approach to stopping the effects of it. In my opinion, I do not completely agree with this viewpoint because I believe it is not too late for us to deal with this problem.",
        "To commence with, several measures could be taken by both Government and individuals to hinder climate change. Firstly, Government should incentivize people to use public transportations instead of private vehicles. This would decrease in the amount of vehicle exhaust which comprises a tremendous carbon footprint. As a consequence, the amount of carbon emissions would be reduced, contributing less to global warming which is a part of climate change. Secondly, people, as individuals, could utilize products made from non-plastic to reduce the amount of plastics. Plastics cannot be completely destroyed, it could remain beneath the earth and pollute the soil. Furthermore, when burning plastic-based products, a large carbon footprint would be dumped into the air. Therefore, by using non-plastic products such as paper bags or paper straws, we could limit the amount of carbon dioxide which leads to global warming.",
        "Additionally, trying to live with climate change might lead to several disastrous repercussions. Take Australia as an example, there were forest fires which destroy a large area of Australia land and kill thousands of animals. This disaster is due to the considerable increase in the temperature which is unprecedented in the past. Another serious disaster is the high rainfall patterns in China, making Government release tons of water in hydroelectric dams. As a result, many houses and villages were destroyed, and thousands of people did not have the accommodations. Those disasters are due to the climate change. Therefore,  accepting and living with it is not a good idea.",
        "In conclusion, although some may have opinions that people should try to adapt to climate change, I believe we should stop it."
