        "It is irrefutable that the progress of communication technology and transportation allow now anyone have more autonomy to work and live wherever they want it. In my opinion, the advantage outweighs the disadvantages.",
        "Firstly the most important benefits of communication technology are that now people are able to have a conversation with friends, family or work colleagues which live in different places in the word. As an example is what happened due the world pandemic, which made a huge number of people worked from home and had meetings online via zoom. Another benefit of the development of communication is that this technology is not expensive. This means that, the cheapest internet company plan cover calls to anywhere in the world.",
        "The improvement of transportation has brought many advantages at all, the main benefit is the facility that now you can move between two places in less than two hours, such as is the duration between Brazil and Argentina. Secondly, the air ticket prices are more affordable due to the high competition between airline companies. For example, you can easily find a flight for only 100 dollars from Australia to New Zealand. Modern technology, such as personal computers and the internet, have made it possible for many people to do their work from home at least part of the time instead of going to an office every day. What are some of the advantages and disadvantages of this situation.",
        "In conclusion, the high advance of technology for communication and the progress that makes easy to travel between cities along with the low cost for those development has brought the opportunities to people live anywhere in the world."
