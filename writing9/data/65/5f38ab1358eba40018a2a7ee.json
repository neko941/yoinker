        "In the contemporary world, a hugely-popular issue of juvenile delinquency has never failed to attract citizens\u2019 attention. It is thought that immature humans who break the law should be punished as same as mature individuals . From my perspective, I totally disagree with the statement.",
        "Firstly, we should not treat juvenile criminals and adult ones the same, because a majority of those children are not educated sufficiently or correctly in schools. In other words, in these days, schools have focusing extremely on academic knowledge, such as maths or physics without teaching students about morality and philosophy. As a result, those pupils are not able to distinguish whether what they do is right or wrong. Taking Vietnamese young student as an example for that, most of the minor crimes have been caused by the youths who do not receive a good education in schools.",
        "Secondly, the reason why we ought not to give a fair punishment between youngsters and adults who have anti-social behaviors is those juvenile criminals have been affected negatively by the social media, such as Facebook or Youtube. In the modern life, an increasing number of young individuals use social networking websites and they are likely to be captivated by sensations stories and breaking news which relate to violence. Consequently, those people tend to imitate those illegal actions. For instance, young citizens will fight their classmates or even commit a murder if they watch or read excessively violent topics on the social media.",
        "In conclusion, there are two main reasons why juvenile criminals are mature ones should not be punished the same."
