        "Nowadays online reading is being more common and some people think that , libraries are not being integral part of readers . I , however believe that even though technology has reduced our need to go to the libraries , our traditional libraries can never become redundant .",
        "As a result of technology majority of students are not going to libraries who have own mobile phone or computer . Because , they prefer to read online and they gain information or books they want when they connected to the internet . As a qonsicuence , this way prevent spending extra time . For example , he or she can read online a book from a loong distance without going to the libraries and even it creat some benefits such as students do not spend extra money to get libraries if the library is far away.",
        "Howeover , in my belief , libraries are best choice to cencentrate . For instance , it is quick and easy to understand when reading a book because libraries have a comfortable and peaceful environment . Additionally , it is very difficult to always read books from the computer monitor. Traditional books are not harmful to the eye because it does not emit light by itself . Another point is that , the acces to vertual libraries can be affected by power cuts and network failures . Moreover , in a traditional library no one faces such problems .",
        "To conclude , it can be said that advancement should be welcome in every field but the importance of the libraries can not put aside ."
