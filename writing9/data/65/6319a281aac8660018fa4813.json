But if you want to stay in hotel, that would not be a problem as there are two three very nice hotels in our area where I can book for you. You must visit the local museum and then the sea beach. The foods near the beach cafeteria are excellent. You can book for fire camping and mountain hiking that would be a great experience for you. I would also recommend you to try to local library that has a good collection of books. As a book lover I am sure you will love this place.",
