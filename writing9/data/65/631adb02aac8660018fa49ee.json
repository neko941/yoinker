        "Dear Sir,",
        "I am studying in your institution and doing short term course of Diploma in Mass communication. I have paid fee including accommodation also. I am from Ireland and hardly have knowledge about housing and apartment in Australia.",
        "I am sorry to say that arrangement which is provided by you is not satisfactory. I have mentioned that i am looking for single and spacious room. Unfortunately, I was given a shared room that I have been sharing with another student for the last couple of weeks. The room is not enough to support the healthy life for two persons and room ventilation is dreadful. Fresh air and sunlight can hardly get in. It is far from academy and takes 35 minutes to reach by walk. In addition to, there is no power back up which disturbs me in concentrating on my studies.",
        "I thought I was getting a single room with enough sunlight and airflow and which would not be far away from the campus. Instead, a shared accommodation was arranged for me that has a poor ventilation system. So, I requested you kindly change the room or solve the above problem which assists me to complete my course successfully.",
        "I am looking forward to getting your support regarding this matter. Thank you in advance.",
