        "Like every other industry, tourism has also contributed to environmental pollution, although, many have suggested to forbid it  there are many parts of the world which completely rely on the leisure industry. In this essay, we shall  view the impact of tourism on the economy and what measure can be performed the environment.",
        "Firstly, tourism is the main source of income for nearly 30% of the world population, when people visit a certain destination, they contribute in several ways to enhance the standard of life in that region. Adding to this, sightseeing increases employment opportunities, there various novelty product available at the local market, thus business thrives, and tourist needs accommodation, hence hotels industry operates to serve them. For instances, South Asian countries are most visited by tourist. The gross domestic product of these nations is steeply increased during peak seasons. Nearly 80% of the population residing here are completely dependent on traveller\u2019s footfall. Therefore, imposing a prohibition on tourism will hamper the lives of large populate.",
        "Secondly, hampering the location which is abundantly rich with natural ecosystem will reduce the destination rating. Moreover, governments should intervene and impose policies or regulations to conserve the heritage of the country. For example, Andaman and Nicobar Islands is favourite tourist spot especially the newly wedded couples. During course of time visitors destroyed the beauty of this tiny island hence, the government had to come up with a plan to save its economy and its beaches, so they imposed a ban on plastic as well as litter on beaches, which will entice hefty fines. Consequently, the beaches revived its beauty back without losing on travellers.",
        "In conclusion, every problem should be addressed in a micro level to find a feasible solution, just enforcing a ban on certain parts of the world will not solve the problem. Thus, necessary actions should be carried to ensure there is no impact on both the economy and the cosystem."
