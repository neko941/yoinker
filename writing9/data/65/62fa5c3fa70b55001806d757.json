        "It is believed that the key factor to solving issues related to the environment is to raise the price of gas. From my perspective, I partly agree with this statement, as I argue that there are other effective solutions to this problem.",
        "There are several reasons why people might believe increasing the price of fuel is the best method for solving environmental issues. This is mainly because raising the costs for fuel decreases the number of vehicles on the road significantly. Therefore, the carbon dioxide emission, which is the main contributor  to global warming, might also decline. As a result, this could be the best solution to air pollution, potentially saving the habitats of human being and other species in the future. For example, developing countries like Vietnam have implemented this method in order to reduce air pollution. This decreased the usage of vehicles significantly, helping to improve the air quality effectively.",
        "Despite the above arguments, I still believe that raising the price of fuel is not the best method, and there are many other effective solutions to environmental-related problems. The main reason for this is because there are way many other environmental problems that can not be solved by simply increasing the price of fuel. For instance, the explosion of population is one of the major concerns nowadays, mainly contributing to global warming being at an alarming rate. This can not be solved by raising the fuel price alone. Therefore, more effective measures need to be taken to tackle with this problem. children should be educated about family planning at a younger age, and population growth should be integrated into lectures in colleges. As a result, people might have the full awareness of family planning in their later lives, when they are married.",
        "In conclusion, while raising the price of fuel could be a good method to solve some environmental problems, it is not the best."
