        "Advertisement plays a significant role in attracting  viewers to anything, which needs to be displayed.  For viewers, it becomes easy to know about things and places and also about the Nation. In my opinion, I agree, with the statement that advertising always tells us a lot about the country, and I think this way for two reasons, which I will explore in this essay.",
        "Firstly, to begin with, during the festival season of any country, commercials tell us a lot about the culture, and the people of the country. Further, going through a advertisement during the festival time we can easily have an idea of that festival of a nation. Holi, for example, is one of the main festivals in India,  seeing the advertisement for this festival with pictures of the people playing with colours, it gives us some idea about this festival.",
        "Subsequently, not only about the culture, festivals, or people advertisement also tell us a lot about the places in a country, which also aids a lot in increasing the tourism of that nation. For instance, every year in summer I and family always make a plan to have visited  some tourist place around the world. To which place we should go, this we always decide by exploring that place on internet and by seeing the advertisement about that place. Advertisers help us a lot to know about the place to be visited.",
        "In conclusion, I believe that advertisements are always helpful to know about the culture, people and on the whole about the nation."
