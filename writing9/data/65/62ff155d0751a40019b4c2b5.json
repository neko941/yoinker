        "Film Industry plays a vital role around the world. Some communities think that the objective of films is for entertainment while others argue with this matter and say that films should have educational values. In this essay, I will discuss both scenarios and then I will give my opinion on this matter.",
        "On the one side, In this modern era, most people are spending their time  watching movies in their leisure time. People are watching movies on mobiles, laptops, etc. Even children are also very excited to watch movies. Making Film is one of the great arts to entertain people. Entertainment is one of the reasons to watch films. For example, A movie, which consists of good characters and entertains  people more than that movie will get a good rating.",
        "On the other side, Some communities believe that the film industry makes films which have educational value. Films are also sources to provide good knowledge to  society. Because almost every person tries to watch films to gain some knowledge on something like about army services, politics, technology, etc. For instance,in  A film which describes the true story of  real heroes like warriors, then people will get knowledge of their hard work and how they saved the world.",
        "To sum up, I think both views have their own importance. Films play a crucial in both entertainment and  educational values. Entertainment is to spend time with family and friends happy and when it comes to educational values it gains knowledge. And finally, I think films are an admirable source of both entertainment and knowledge."
