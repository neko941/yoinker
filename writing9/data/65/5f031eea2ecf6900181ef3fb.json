        "t is true that global warming is one of the most pressing problems for many nations because it poses a serious threat to our environment. In this essay, I will outline some primary causes of this problem and suggest several possible solutions.",
        "There is a wide range of reasons for the heating up of the earth's atmosphere. First and foremost, a greenhouse lets sunlight in and keeps carbon dioxide and other gases from getting out. Although these gases are of necessity as they serve our lives, too much of them would trap more heat from the sun, which causes global temperatures to rise. Another cause of global warming is the excessive consumption of fossil fuels. In this day and age, a large amount of fossil fuels is burned to power factories, run cars and produce electricity. As fossil fuels burn, they let carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Thirdly, many forests are cut down to pave the way for the massive construction of factories, and this would lead to global warming. Given the fact that trees use carbon dioxide when they make their own food, fewer trees mean that less carbon dioxide is taken out of the atmosphere.",
        "Fortunately, there are several measures could be implemented to mitigate the problems arising from global warming. Firstly, the government should encourage power stations and plants to use more environmentally-friendly sources of energy such as renewable energy instead of fossil fuels. Secondly, raising social awareness of environmental protection should be high on the agenda. For instance, schools could offer more natural courses to their students, so they might have a profound understanding of the consequences of global warming and realize the importance of protecting the environment. Additionally, television programmes could be used to incentivize people to participate in environmental protection campaigns.",
        "In conclusion, the main cause of global warming is the acceleration in the use of fossil fuels. However, several measures, as listed above, could be taken immediately to solve this problem"
