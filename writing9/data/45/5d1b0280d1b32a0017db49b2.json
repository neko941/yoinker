        "Rich nations should accommodate the large number of refugees and help them out by providing basic life entities like proper food and shelter. I am totally agree with above context as developed countries are abundantly enriched, have moral duty and in return their economy will also grow. In the forthcoming paragraphs, I will discuss this in detail.",
        "Advanced countries have abundant resources and financially strong enough to afford all the expenses require to cater refugees who fled their countries because of some unwanted reasons. And infact, the government budget would not get affected because developed countries have good reserves. In other words, they are well established in every sector.",
        "Moreover, it is a moral duty of industrialized countries to lend helping hand to refugees so that they can also live a healthy life without fear. No doubt, humanity is the first fundamental people should follow and come forward to accept refugees, when they are fully equipped with everything to run a smooth life because refugees already been suffered a lot and condemned their life's.",
        "Furthermore, the financially strong nations can get return reward in the form of hard slog labour because refugees also work for the country and fortunately, the country economy will grow at fast pace. For example, a recent study by World Trade Organization showed that \"In German after the acceptance of large number of Syrian refugees, the country economy has grown by 30% from last year.",
        "To conclude, it can be said that rich nations should come forward to help increasing number of refugees because of good financial structure, their moral duty on humanitarian grounds as well as their economy to develop with intake of refugees."
