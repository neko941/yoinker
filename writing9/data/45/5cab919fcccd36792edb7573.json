        "Recently the number of people using social media has increased considerably. Although social media brings a couple of dangers of leaking personal information, I believe the benefits it causes is much more than drawbacks.",
        "In the one hand, it cannot be denied that the users information of social media seems usually to be stolen. When using social media, people are asked to be given their information but the websites usually make agreements with customer that they will not leak your personal information and will protect it. However, just minor prestigious websites do it. If the people do not take a careful look in what they do, they will receive risks. Therefore, using social media sometimes has an adverse impact on people.",
        "In the other hand, there are more advantages for users in social media. Firstly, social media helps people popularise. In each country or even each ethnic group, there is an extreme cultural varieties that people want to discover. Thanks to social media, foreigners or people who are living in different areas have an opportunity to approach and experience culture. Moreover, with social media, scientists, doctors and firms can promote their new products, research or even news kind of medicines. This leads to the significant wide spread of technology. Thus, there are sufficient evidences to believe that social media benefits human almost entirely.",
        "In conclusion, social media is likely to affect human negatively. Otherwise, I completely suppose that the positive effects it brings more than detrimental one."
