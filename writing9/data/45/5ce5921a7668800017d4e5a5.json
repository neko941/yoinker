For instance, people these days have become so  stressed or lazy that they generally prefer to offer a mobile phone to their kids, just to make oneself relaxed, but it hampers their kid's health adversely. Hence it would make upcoming youths to follow the same lifestyle.",
        "While the problems are not insurmountable, there are solutions to overcome. The first solution is that, one should try to include a couple of household chores in their day to day life that involves no or minimised usage of technology. For instance, washing clothes manually rather than using washing machines, the motive is to enable some movements in the body regularly. Another option would be, an individual should play games  that involves physical activity instead of giving children a liberty to play with mobile phone so that, it become a good habit in themselves, hence it would encourage next generation to maintain an active lifestyle; therefore their health would improvised certainly.",
        "This essay discussed the problems associated with sedentary lifestyle people these days are following. While the issues are evidently clear, if the appropriate measures are taken, the problems can be solved precisely."
