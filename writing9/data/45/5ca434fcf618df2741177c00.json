        "With the increasing of many criminal activities in public area, Camera surveillance has been adopted as an effective way to reduce crime rate in many places around the world. It has been argued that although these devices help fight back against unwanted crimes and increase the level of securities, some people still believe that their personal privacy have been violated. In my own point of view, the advatanges do outweigh the disadvanatages for these below reasons.",
        "Personal freedom or privacy is considered to be one of the require rights for citizens of countries around the world. In some part of the world, Government agencies are forbiden from taking photos of each individual without permission.  One of the problems that cameras bring to people is that there is no guarantee that personal data about our behaviors and activities is kept away from third party agencies. The number of hack activities aiming at local authorities information storage facilities is increasing tremendously without any proper measurement to due with. Our personal data might be sold to advertising agencies, hackers for the purpose of establishing marketing strategies or scam actions. For example, one of the facilities in China which responsible for keeping data from survillance cameras was hacked by annonymous who then later sold these information to third party agencies.",
        "On the other hand, video recording devices play a crucial role in the world today as to elimate any risks of being attacked by terrorism and tracking criminal who is hiding from the police. Paris and London are two citites that were suffered servely damages from recent terrorist actions. As a way to maintain security and order in public or tourist attractions, cameras have been established which prove to be extremely effective in fighting against these crime. Other benefit would be that video cameras can help police department uncover many hiding criminals by using AI in video analysing. This benefit helped Chinese police to capture a criminal who has been hiding from authorities for almost 20 years.",
        "In conclusion, although our personal freedom might be violated due to the establishing of videos recording devices, this method help us to stay safe from unwanted crimes or any actions by terrorists. In my personal view, this technology gadgets offer benefits that are outweigh its disadvantages respectively."
