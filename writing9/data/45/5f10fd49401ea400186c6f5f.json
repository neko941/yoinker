        "Some people believe global warming is the most major ecological headache, which we facing right now.  Otherwise, others assume deforestation has more risk to the earth. Despite the arguments of others, it's my personal belief that both of those problems have an equal effect on our world",
        "Global warming is a complication which is causing many impacts. For instance , greenhouse gas generated by unlimited car usage, traditional energy sources such as burning coal or heat or any sort of electronic device which emits carbon dioxide. Therefore , this is affecting every one of us in the world by an increase in average temperature, melt the ice of the Antarctic, the rise of sea level.  Also, it could cause health problems for any age of humanity. Always breath in the enormous carbon dioxide and minuscule oxide air might cause cardiovascular system diseases for elderly human, as , lung cancer and bronchitis for adolescents and infants.  This , innumerable dilemmas on our planet are caused by the greenhouse gas effect.",
        "At the same time, desertification has ,also, negative risks to the earth. In fundamental evidence, deforestation created by the erroneous procedure of trees for building and furniture industry and other main impacts. Therefore ,this is affecting species which are inhabited single species by a decrease in the average number of oxide. Furthermore , it could result in major famine in human history. Destruction of the earth's surface, soil erosion, break the balance of the rain forests in tropical zones might cause agriculture complication, such as nine growth the gain despite the chemical pesticide.",
        "On the other hand, desertification and global warming are equally influencing us. Logically, inhabiting organisms like a human being cannot live without forest which includes enormous biomass, also, they cannot live in extreme boiling temperature of the atmosphere. In addition, both of them  2 sides of one complex economical problem.",
        "To conclude, we cannot separate these problems. Both of them have negative impacts on our world."
