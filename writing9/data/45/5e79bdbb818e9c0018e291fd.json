        "Overall, what stands out is that deforestation causes four main problems, which eventually leads to floods and less biodiversity.",
        "",
        "Firstly, knocking down trees in a forest can cause fewer roots holding the topsoil resulting in soil erosion. Furthermore, deforestation can increase the risk of fires, both deliberate and accidental, leading to the loss of micro-organisms feeding on waste and wood obtained from logging. Additionally, this can also result in drought due to less precipitation caused by lesser amounts of moisture being returned by the plants into the air. All of these problems can result in the degradation of vegetation and an increase in the pioneer species, ultimately leading to less biodiversity.",
        "",
        "Finally, heavy logging equipment used for clearing the forests can compress the soil, making it hard and baked. As a consequence, rainwater runs off from the soil leading to floods."
