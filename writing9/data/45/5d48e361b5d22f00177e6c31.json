        "It is claimed that the proportion of aged people will be more than young people in near future.Personally, I feel that it has a number of  positive consequences.I am going to explain my reasons in the following paragraphs.",
        "On the one hand, In the first place, it will be a favorable expansion for the companies and society. elderly people are more experienced compared to youngers.In this case, there will be more practiced individuals in the labor market thus, companies are enable to take advantage from their experience due to making more money. In the second place, it can be useful for government.if elders will be more than youngsters, government wont have to create much equipments for young individuals such as schools or job opportunities.Thus, governments will be capable of save the budget for more important works.",
        "On the other hand, it will be has a negative outcomes for society and people. Firstly, due to some statements if the proportion of old people will get more than jouveniles, companies and firms will faced with the shortage of young workforce.Young people have more power and faster than the elders so they are highly likely to increase the the income of their firms. Secondly, elders are need drugs and medical cares thus, government requires to obtain this necessity.So, it can cause huge charge for state to create hospitals or special places for aged people. .Finally, in my way of thinking, the government budget should be spend on other vital things including building schools.Not only should it spend on building schools, but it also is a good idea to spend it for educational system to have well-trained children for future.",
        "In conclusion, due to both above mentioned perspectives, it seems to me that it is a harmful development to have elders more than youngers. Lack of young individuals in every country can has negative drawbacks for that country instead of getting an old country."
