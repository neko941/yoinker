        "Buying new materials for our homes has become the norm in many households. So many individuals these days spend their money in order to get more and more materialistic things for their living places. This essay will discuss the impact of this immature selfish behavior in detail.",
        "The amount of wasted money spent every year to own unneeded stuff is surreal. While people could use their income wisely to really benefit from it, they would unfortunately rather spend it in impractical things they might not even use in their homes, nor any other place, which surely becomes a financial issue in the long run. For example, recent studies has shown that people\u2019s ability of controlling their own money logically had decreased in the last ten years. Is short, people should really consider educating themselves to be good users of money instead of obsessively buying unnecessary goods.",
        "People could easily get distracted from developing their beneficial skills/habits partly attributed to being too busy buying new things for their homes. Having no time-management skills could be a reason why people tend buy more and more things without valuing their time. If people take time to be grateful bout what they already have and use their money and time powers to better themselves by buy self-development books, attending classes that are money-saving related instead of the regular act of going home shopping every weekend, they would definitely be better versions of themselves. Being better humans means being better consumers.",
        "This essay discussed the main two negative aspects of buying household things, which as mentioned are wasting more money, and being too busy buying that people tend to not being able better themselves. In my pinion, people should work on themselves to break the old habits and to gain more positive ones to get rid of selfish behaviors."
