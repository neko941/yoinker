        "In this contemporary era, there have changed to living life style day to day. Plethora of agricultural people prefer to move to city due to the work. In this essay, I will discuss intends of what are happen to this phenomenon and how to evaluates this perilous problem.",
        "There are number of causes creating by this stipe. First and foremost inimical cause is that the price of the food and vegetable should be increased. In other words, if all community commute to developed and developing city, so that the production of the food, which is one need of the humans, should decline, and it effect on the country economy growth. In a recent survey from United Stat, for example, almost 7% of the small town\u2019s people transform to Washington every years for their future work.  It can be solved to improving the all the agriculture needs as well as some types of lone should be given by   their government authority.",
        "Another cause is that the developed cites are being crowded. That is to say, if majority folks migrant from rural area to the big towns, that it should effect on the flora and fauna, hospitality and transportation. For illustration, in Pakistan from 2003, in the Karachi, population level augmented due to people needed job, and which was effecting on the other factors of the Karachi. To tackle this issue, government should create some job in small village, which root this problem",
        "Agglomerating, all the points of elaborated, it can be concluded that this detrimental step impact on the agriculture\u2019s food prices and population in cites. My point of view the main responsibilities to solving this perilous problem lies with government."
