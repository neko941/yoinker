        "A debatable topic is whether free social services should be enforced as part of high school curriculum, I would agree that implementing volunteering work  in High school  activities allows students develop unknown skills and also aid to reduce youthful deliquescy",
        "Why should unpaid charity work be engaged in student work?",
        "First of all, it helps in discovering new skills. Most times vlounteering services allows people from different schools and countries to participate. In this way, students are able to meet and exchange ideas amongst themselves motivating each other  to uncover new abilities that will be helpful  to them and also to their schools. A good example was when my cousin volunteered to go for an Art  seminar in Spain, he was privileged to learn different genre's of  dance from other participants compared to routine hip-hop  dance which he only knew. This shows the  importance of volunteer services to students.",
        "Another reason why community services should be insisted in schools is because, it serve as a a good distraction in reducing nefarious activities  amongst students.  Since high schoolers will be engaging their time in doing free services, they won't have time for  fivolous activities. Take for instance in Sheba High school Maimi a school my sister attends, since the students started volunteering to teach  at the orphanages, they have not recorded any case of drug abuse compared to when there were no forced community services in their school work. It is therefore ideal to say that volunteering is a good idea that should be encouraged.",
        "To conclude, it is evident that there is need  for free  community  activities to be enforced in high schools as it obviously improves the  skills and productivity of students."
