        "Nowadays, high crime rates are increasingly being witnessed in many nations. This essay will discuss the main causes of increasing crimes including unemployment and lack of education. This essay will also suggest how to cope with those issues by eliminating illiteracy and creating more job opportunities.",
        "Some people struggle hard to earn money and maintain their daily life due to limited jobs especially for those who doesn\u2019t have relevant educational qualifications and as a result, they tend to commit crimes such as stealing or robbing in order to survive. For example, it has been found that 70% of criminals in New Zealand didn\u2019t graduate from high school and stuck in different menial jobs, suffering from the increase of living costs. As can be seen, crime caused by money problems and education issues are prominent.",
        "In order to eradicate those problems, creating more job opportunities and eliminating illiteracy are both critical to reducing crime. Education plays a crucial role in our career as it can broaden our horizons of life and enable us to have the capability of achieving our goals. A good illustration of this is that compared to developing countries, developed countries always have low crime rates because of sufficient job options and adequate educational resources available in the public. Therefore, in order to reduce the amount of crime, it is essential to eliminate illiteracy and create more works.",
        "To sum up, many nations are facing the growing number of crime these days. This essay discussed the main causes of growing of crimes including unemployment and lack of education. This essay also suggested solutions to these problems including eliminate illiteracy and create more jobs."
