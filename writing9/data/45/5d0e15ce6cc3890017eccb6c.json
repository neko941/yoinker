        "In recent times, social media has created a huge impact in the society and debate is still going on to decide whether this has to be seen as a positive aspect or not. Even though people are becoming closer with the help of this, sharing personal information do possess risks. This essay will discuss both advantages and disadvantages and why disadvantages outweighs.",
        "Social media sites like Facebook is having a clear and immense impact on the society. People from all age groups equally enjoy the benefits of this. Children who study abroad are able to connect to their home country friends as well as family and this in turn helps to keep the bond stonger. Moreover, unlike old times, people are even creating business relationships through this platform thereby creating job opportunities as well as contributing to the economy. We should agree the fact that finding jobs, houses and even life partners have become easier with the help of these online sites.",
        "However, with all the above mentioned positives, there are negatives also that are worth mentioning. Children and youngsters these days are more addicted towards all these and are not concentrating on their studies which in turn affects their future. Besides, they also doesnot care about security and share all personal information such as photos as well as day to day activities which is dangerous. Criminals take advantage of this and many a times, they misuse these informations that are readily available.For instance, lot of children even provide their parent's credit card details and their house address unknowingly which results in theft and even kidnapping.",
        "To concluse, even though social media is beneficial in one way, it has its own disadvantages. In my opinion, this has more detrimental effects on people, rather than advantages."
