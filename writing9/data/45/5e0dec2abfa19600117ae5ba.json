        "Recently, a lot of children have access to the internet witout having adults to control and advice. there is a concern that this may be dangerous, espectially when they makefriend with unknown people on social medias. This issue can be solved by, first, encourage parents to have more time with their children. Second, having a regulation to control children accessibility to the internet.",
        "The main reason children are spending time on the internet is because their parents do not have enough time with them. In other words, The more time parents spend with children, the less time they will use on social media. This will effectively reduce time children spend with strangers on social medias. Thus, reducing the chance of being in unsafe circumstances.",
        "However, in our society, it is sometime impossible for parents to stay with the children all the time. This is why it is equally important to regulate both the children and the social media companies. For example, social media companies should be required to have their users registered some personal (and official) information. This way, the social media providers can know users age, and manage the contents that each user can see, or even manage the people that users should meet.",
        "In conclusion, this essay presents two suggestion of the serious problem of risk when letting children spend time with strangers on social medias. Firstly, parents should spend more time with their children and second, in case that the parents are not with the children, regulations will be useful."
