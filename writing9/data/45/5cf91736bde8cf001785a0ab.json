        "Current affairs in the media is edited; top-ranking personnel in the news outlets arbitrarily come to a decision on what is released to the public. This is apparent when scanning through a range of publications and broadcasters on a particular day; as there will be censoring and oversharing on different levels.",
        "Various reasons factor in and play a part in the decision-making process. For instance, editor's or owner's political or cultural affiliations, benefactors of the institutions, hidden agendas etc. Higher positions are invariably influenced by their own associations; be it political, racial, religious or gender-based; and this reflects on their articles presented to the public. On the other hand, a powerful political force could strong arm what is provided to the public as well. On the same lines, the shareholders or donation-providers weigh in on how to nip and tuck a story. Moreover, there may be unseen propaganda deciding news items that only become evident with time. A good example is reporting done on presidential daily activities.",
        "Repeatedly being fed unpleasant news does take its toll, eventually, we become sensitized to it and could even grow to be oblivious to it. This is because, it is human nature to adapt to safe-guard ourselves. To elaborate more, consistent emotional turmoil is counter-productive for the wellbeing of mankind. For example, in war torn countries, death is part and parcel of daily living.",
        "Is the solution to be given a higher percentage of joyful news? The answer is subjective. Although, in an ideal world, present happenings should be informed as it is, unbiasedly. However, sadly, humans are emotional creatures; influenced by everything around them."
