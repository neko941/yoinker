        "Nowadays, the busy life leads to a haotic regim and bad habits, that is why in opinion of some people it is hard to have a healthy lifestyle. Others, have an opposite opinion and that is that it is easy for people to be healthy and in a good body form if they tend to it.",
        "There are several reasons why some people have unhealthy lifestyle, and one of them is having a lot of assignments at work place, which give stress, worries and zero time to take care about of eating proper food and at the meals time, doing regular exercises and taking care about of moral healthy side as well. Another reason for unfit persons is the bad habits and bad education they got from their childhood time, which became a normality difficult to change in years. The last two reasons I would like to mention are the people 's laziness and ability to find the excuses why they can't reach the better lifestyle.",
        "To my mind, people should make some effort, sacrifices and invest time and money to mentain the body and the mind healthy, and the most important element in having a healthy lifestyle is a matter of choice. This tipe of lifestyle requiers organic food, regular exercises, meals, wolks in fresh arrears and reserve for their self time for relaxation and fun.",
        "In conclusion, it will be easy to live a healthy lifestyle if the persons understand about the amount of benefits they get from it, like strong immunity, healthy and clear mind, good body form and no or less visits to the doctors."
