        "With the rapid development of science and technology, televisions, as an invention in the 20th century is becoming very populous in people\u2019s life. People can be informed of the latest news and enjoy the colorful programs on over the world. In my opinion, I totally believe that televisions are more beneficial for the growth of creativity because of the following reasons.",
        "Firstly, televisions are the most effective tool to inform children of the latest news and scientific development over the world. Television tells us the recently development, such as genetic technology, artificial technology and so on, which can stimulate the growth of creativity and encourage them to carry out the relevant experiences, to make the new finding and breakthrough in their study.",
        "Secondly, some programs like adventures and geography, which are widely recognized as a channel can help the children\u2019s knowledge. If children based on the knowledge in textbook, it seems to not enough breakthrough ideas in the processing study. Program like adventure can cultivate the children\u2019s creativity to tackle difficulty; Program like geography can teach children knowledge about different countries on the world and making the children\u2019s curiosity about the nature. Program about science and technology can inspire children\u2019s interest in science and technology.",
        "However, the improper programs on television sometime have negative contents which play negative role in the growth of children. These programs lead children to violence, criminal road.",
        "To sum up, I believe that televisions will not influence children\u2019s creativity. But meanwhile, the government and whole society should do their utmost to prohibit the programs have negative contents on television and provide the children with a clean growing environment."
