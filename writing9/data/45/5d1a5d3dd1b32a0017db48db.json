        "There has been significant changes in online marketing that has icreased the number of people opting for online shopping.Some people even think that this drastic drift towards online shopping can lead to closing of all shops in towns and cities one day.In my opinion, even thought web based shopping is trending , there will always be a section of people who will find comfort in going to shops physically for shopping.",
        "Admittedly , online shopping is preferable for many people now-a-days. thsi is majorly due to busy work shedule of massed and advantage of getting products delivered while sitting at home or working in office. Also, there is a large variety and options available to choose from accross diffirent websites.Moreover,online markting and various schemes remind people to buy things that they didn't even plan for.",
        "Despite above mentioned benefits of online shopping , there are many challenges along with it. The website have their own product delivery time frames, whereas, i can easily fo to the market and shop as per my convinience. Also easy trials and physical presence of the product increases reliability of consumers.For example , i always prefer buying cloths offline.i will visit different shops, try diffirent shops , try the dresses on and even check the quality which satisfies me from all aspects before actually buying it. Buying offline is also a recreational activity for few as people will tend to hangout with loved ones along with shopping.",
        "Although , online shopping saves a lot of time the tendency of masses to go for offline options will never end due to easy accessibility ,reliability and goodwill of traders."
