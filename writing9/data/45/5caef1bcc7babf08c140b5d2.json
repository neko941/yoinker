        "There is a number of reason for behind this phenomenon, one can go to the list. The top-notch concrete reason is that if people have interested and efficient knowledge for doing their hobby so they could be easier to attain knowledge without any types of arduous in their life .for example, in the recent survey from Oxford University, the researcher reckons that almost 85% people around the world who's never have had difficulty to achieved of their all types hobby. That\u2019s the way it very essays to obtain and learn about the hobby.",
        "But not everyone agrees with this statement because there are lots of available on the earth, which are dangerous for people, such as scuba diving, bungee jumping and so more things which should be difficult to do this types of hobby and which have various struggle for doing that types hobby .for example, the world-famous scuba diver is artival det, who could  practice on scuba diving after doing that they were world famous for scuba diving  . These ultra-challenging experiences are paradoxically the main advantage of interesting on their hobby because they are doing with happiness.",
