        "In recent times, there has been an alarming increase in the crime rates all over the world. The main reason behind this is illiteracy and unemployment. The feasible solutions are to provide awareness through education, thereby creating more job opportunities to make people independent.",
        "One of the main cause for the growth in criminal activities is the lack of education. People do not have enough knowledge to judge between what is right or wrong. Moreover, they are easily getting manipulated by the powerful, who use them for criminal activities. Another reason, which is related to the above one, is unemployment, which in turn leads to povety. Since these people are not qualified enough to have a job for their living, they are forced to take up whatever work they are getting. Besides, once someone has committed a crime, the probability of them reoffending is also high due to the aforementioned reasons.",
        "This can be prevented in multiple ways of which the first and foremost one is to provide mandatory schooling to every individual. In this way, they will be able to decide what is good for them. Along with this, since they have basic educaion, it will not be difficult for them to find a job and make their own career. Although, primary education is not enough to provide a high-paying job, at least this will provide a means of living to even those who are not so good in studies. Another step that has to be taken by the governments is to form strict rules and to punish those who offend, so that others will think twice before committing any illegal activity.",
        "In conclusion, high crime rate is a serious issue in every country and it is the responsibility of authorities to find solution minimize this. Education ought to be the best remedy for this which will in turn resolve all other issues."
