        "Parents are people who\u2019s child sees after his birth and during his growing period he learns everything from them. The parents are role model for their child. Their responsibility is not only taking care, feeding and nursing but teaching too.",
        "At the early age child learn everything from their parents. Parent teach them difference between good and bad, right and wrong what to do and what to not do. So the role of parents in childs growing is important. Unlike teacher parents know their childs personality and they know how to teach them. Teachers on the other hand teach generally whole class and teacher uses general terms and parents use terms that their child understand.",
        "However, even if parents teach child better than teacher they can\u2019t give the child knowledge that he need. The child taught by his parents start seeing world by his parents point of view and will not have his own opinion. The teacher may not be clear for student but they not impose their own point of view on the contrary they give him general opinion and give him choose on his own thus he could have his own opinion.",
        "Parents opinion about the world may not be appropriate because the world in which their child live are a lot different. But they can give their child basic knowledge. Even if they don\u2019t understand social and technological changes they can teach the child thing than never change.",
        "In conclusion I must say that parent are important teacher in our lives and even if they have lack of knowledge about some subject they still can show their child right path and subject that they lack of child can learn from school teacher or other."
