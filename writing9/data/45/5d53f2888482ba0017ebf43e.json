        "Some people opine that children should learn how to be good members of society from school, whereas others feel this is the role of parents. This essay agrees that parents should teach children how to be good persons.",
        "Parents should teach children how to be a good person because they understand their children more than other people. In the family will have some unique family culture or activity that who are family\u2019s member are know while others do not get it, also usually have many activities they do together which make it easier for parents to teach children. For example, when I was a little girl, my parents always taught me through the story at night about what is the good thing which a nice person should do and what is the bad thing that I should not do.",
        "Even though children spend much time with the teacher for education but children can spend time with their parents more. Parent has much time and many opportunities to teach their children because most schools accept children at age more than three years old, in this period children have to stay at home and learn basic social skills from their parent. Moreover, while children can go to school, they still stay with their parent after school, weekend and holiday. A parent can guide their children about somethings that happen on the way while they pick up children after school, it easy to teach their children when the whole family stays at home on the weekend and they can suggest children to be polite when meeting other people in a holiday trip.",
        "In conclusion, parents are a very important person who should teach children how to be good people."
