        "New technological methods have emerged recently, which provide people with fast communication. However, the users of new methods have less chances to communicate in person. While, there are some drawbacks associated with modern communication ways, I believe the main benefits are more substantial.",
        "On the one hand, a potential disadvantage of new communication methods may be lack of possibility to meet other people face to face. Which could not provide all our needs such as emotional one. Sometimes, we need to hug and kiss our relatives. Another perceived negative is that sometimes we find it difficult to convey our thoughts by phone calls and sending messages via the Internet. Since often we are unable to use our body language it could lead to misunderstanding.",
        "On the other hand, a primary advantage of high-tech devices such as the Internet and mobile phones is that we are able to have a fast communication with the others. A thousand years ago if ancient people wanted to send a massage to another they would sent it by horses or trained birds. In such situations it may last days or even weeks. However, it is an undeniable fact that nowadays we are able to access whoever we want to call all around the world within a few seconds just by dialing their phone number or sending emails. A further benefit is that some activities are no longer needed to be held physically. For instance, weekly meetings or theoretical classrooms can be held on the Internet, that makes communications easier for people who are in long distances or unable to attend in classroom.",
        "On balance, it is true that emerging modern ways of communication would seem disadvantages under certain circumstances. However, in my view, its positive effects in terms of fast and facile methods override the disadvantages on the society."
