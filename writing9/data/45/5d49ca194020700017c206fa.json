        "I totally agree to the opinion that very expensive space research programs are straining government's budget,  jeopardizing essential more prominent issues like employment, healthcare and basic education which impact majority of the population in developing countries.",
        "Many developing nations still have people living below poverty line are are deprived of the basic necessities like  food , shelter , education and hygiene. Myriads of people lack basic primary education which eventually leads  to  lack of the employment. Bureaucrats should allocate more funds in generating employment which  will  eventually reduce the crime rates . Health campaigns and creating awareness about health issues demands more attention . only a handful of people are able to utilize the medical facilities , government should spend  more on medical research programs to make it economical and accessible for masses. One more area which demand attention is infrastructure . Government should work in building infrastructure in order to boost economical growth . Thus, in such socio-economic condition space research programs looks like luxury .",
        "Now  a days every country in the world is  conducting space research programs to understand the planets and in search of life beyond earth. I understand the requirement of the  the space research and  its significance as well . Without performing such research we would not have come to know about Global warming, Ozone layer depletion, change in  temperature of the atmosphere which is increasing at an alarming rate . As we are aware of it now we take corrective measures to control the damage.",
        "To recapitulate, conducting space research programs are significant for the countries ,However, Authorities should give paramount importance to the  basic needs of the citizens ."
