        "In this contemporary ephoc, high standard of living has become the topmost priority for many nations around the globe; owing to this phenomenon,majority of countries strive to enhance the living standard of their citizens with economic blossoming but as a result some indispensable moral and social values have seen a set back. In my perspective, the drawbacks certainly seen to be exiguous as compared to its benefits",
        "To commence with, there are numerous benefits of economic development. Firstly, with economic evolution, the employment opportunities in a country rises. For instance, more demand of workforce in different sectors of economy like IT, education, banking, infrastructure,etc, rises and in order yo fill the vacant positions, unemployed people gets job both in skilled and unskilled sector. As a result, the national incomd of a country also increases rapidly in the form of various taxes and charges for providing services. Secondly, economic upliftment brings foreign investment into a country because it attracts the investors to explore the unutilized resources of an economy and use its cheap labour. It, indeed, improves the overall living standard of the citizens of a country.",
        "Nevertheless, economic development do impact a country in a negative way. To set in, it is believed that economic enrichment makes people materialistic because they become workholics and run after the big chunks of revenue only neglecting their moral and sovial ethics. As a consequence, one loose the culture and traditions associated with their roots and try to find happiness solely in materialistic world.",
        "To recapitualize, I firmly believe that benefits of economic development certainly outweigh its disadvantages as blossoming of an economy bring plethora of job opportunities and foreign investment into a country which enrich the lifestylr of people of a nation."
