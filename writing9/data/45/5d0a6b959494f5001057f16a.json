        "Global warming has become a serious threat to the world at large and its severity is on the rise. Although it is sometimes thought by some that individuals are significant have a role to playin curbing climatic change, while others opine that companies and states can prevent it . In my opinion, I believe all three parties have roles to play in protecting our society world looks more ideal from global warming.",
        "To begin with, Individuals can control changes in climatic change by reducing the usage of non-biodegradable substances that causes global environmental pollution. This means for instance when shopping they should take into cognizance the number of items purchased that are packed in bottles, containers and cans. For instance, the use of these objects could be minimized by opting for other alternatives that are packaged in reusable. People can reduce the intake of canned food and also recycling bottles can have a huge impact on preventing global warming.",
        "Other point you can mention is use of clean energy such as solar and electric cars because one major contributor to global warming is Carbon mono oxide emission from automobiles.",
        "Or people can choose to leave their cars to go for public and mass transport systems provided by the government",
        "On the other hand, an organizations can prevent the greenhouse effect by acting efficiently in controlling the usage of energy. This can be done by changing their energy source to renewable and cleaner alternatives. That means they should focus on substituting the usage of fossil fuels to alternatives like alcohol, wind and solar power, to mention a few. This will not only benefit society but will also translate to more cost saving and increase the company's bottom line. Government, however, can help in enacting laws that regulate the number of emissions generated by industries. This can be done by imposing fines and taxes on defaulters that exceed the stipulated limit approved by the state. A recent survey conducted in Nigeria has confirmed that industries tend to reduce pollution when there is a strict governmental policy in place.",
        "To conclude, Individuals should take it as a responsibility to prevent global warming as well as businesses. The government should put a check in place to regulate the activities of the society in order to save the nation from the epidemic caused by the exacerbating climatic condition"
