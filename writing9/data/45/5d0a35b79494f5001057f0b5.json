        "Over the years, the amount of time that should be assigned to leisure activities has been under debate. While it can be observed that several young ones spend a greater part of their day on such, I am of the opinion that boundaries should be set by caregivers.",
        "Firstly, one major reason why this habit should be curbed is that it affects the academics of pupils. As a result of their addiction, they find it difficult to concentrate maximally on their school work. My five year old niece for example, can spend six hours watching her favorite channel but has to be forced to attend to her assignments for thirty minutes. Consequently, this has resulted in poor grades as expected.",
        "Also, the habit of indulging in leisure activities excessively, plays a huge role in affecting other areas of children's lives negatively. Their sleep pattern is altered which culminates in a perpetual dull outlook. Gradually, lack of rest for their tender bodies results in various illnesses as well as low rate of output generally. The results of a survey carried out on Primary School students of Primerose Academy by the Bright Child Initiative reveals that those who had a minimum of eight hours of sleep daily are less prone to depression and more productive throughout the day.",
        "In conclusion, although every child should have the space and opportunity to play and wind down, however this freedom should be supervised and limited so that their education and health does not suffer."
