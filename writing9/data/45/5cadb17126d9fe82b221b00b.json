        "Nowadays, animal testing and using is the buzzword in human community. Although human being should not violate these animal rights, from my own perspective, the specific raised types of animals should be of the exploitation to serve for human\u2019s basic needs.",
        "When it comes to downsides against the animal rights, there are various reasons why these living samples should be entitled to co-survive with human instead of being exploited. The plain truth is that all of the species in this world make an irreplaceable role in maintaining the ecosystem balance. To be more specific, the epidemic of grasshopper in China bringing about the large-scale destruction of crop in that time came down to the bird overhunting for food. On top of that, people do not have a right to force other species to withstand the excruciating pain or meaningless deaths to gain their achievements. In some leaking documentaries, many laboratory mice and monkeys had to overcome the constant sequences of hazardous pain in tear and blood. However, these sacrifices might be totally worth.",
        "Albeit the cruelty and the unfairness, people could deprive a wide range of benefits of this activity. As a growing recognition, the nutrition provision from animals, especially tamed ones, occupies a lion\u2019s share in humankind\u2019s mundane life meal. Should taking meat from raised cattle be halted, people will suffer from the lack of vitamin or protein, which leads to health-related problems such as malnutrition. Another worth mentioning factor is that the animal\u2019s experimentation offers the real opportunities to generate new treatment without harms on human race. Alzheimer\u2019s disease, for example, do not pose threat on human by the success of remedies after thousands of failed animal\u2019s experiments, not human\u2019s ones. Therefore, because of the sustainable survival of the most advanced species, this type of research should be executed.",
        "As aforementioned explanations, I would acquiesce with the idea that prohibition on animal\u2019s utilization should not be introduced."
