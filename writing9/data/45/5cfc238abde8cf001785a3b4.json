        "The statement said that human activity causes the global deforestation which is the significant environment problems.",
        "This environmental problem of deforestations could be solved by the various alternatives.",
        "First of all, the easiest of human practice which can help deforestation is the recycling campaign.  According to there are various popular products that raw material is consisted of trees components, such as, papers, wooden tables and palm oil.   Then, the supplier companies have to source and provide such materials to meet the consumers\u2019 demand without environmental realization.  Forbidden of consuming products which produced by deforesting activity is not possible.   Therefore, the recycling campaign should be promoted for the consumers\u2019 awareness of the environmental effects involved deforestation.",
        "Second, the regulation of conservative environment area should be available in every country.  Nowadays, the laws and penalties of restricted area are not issued legally in some countries.  Thus, the environmental regulation should be an intensely concerns.  Deforester who violates the law must be properly charged and liable to penalty.  This is the one of solutions to preserve green area which positively affect to both human and animals in the world.",
        "Lastly, environmental problems could be slowly decreased by replanting.  There are many defenders of deforestation support and solve the problem by planting.  They believed that planting can be replaced of deforested.  This solution is not only the benefits to human, but also the animals which are permanent living, foods and clean air.  Beside of resolving environmental issues, planting might be driven activity for children to be realized of environment matters.",
        "In conclusion, I believed that the above solutions might be reduced environmental problems caused by deforestation.  The environment issue should be resolve rapidly as the warning signal of global warming is more obvious.",
        "For my perspective, if everybody in the world concerns and be aware of this matter, the world will be surrounded by good environment and lived healthy."
