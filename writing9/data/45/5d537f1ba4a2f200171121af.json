        "First of all, it is clear that it is human activities that have negatively impacted on the environment throughout history. This means that both environmental contamination and conservation are the long-term process, and no single government or corporations can tackle this challenge alone. So, every one of us needs to participate in fighting climate change. Moreover, the public\u2019s wills and behaviours have a critical influence on the government\u2019s policies and the company\u2019s strategies. For example, if citizens say no to plastic bags and avoid using thrown-away items, the firms that manufacture such products will switch to produce other environment-friendly substitutes in order to survive in the market.",
        "This is not to say that government and large business have not needed to be responsible for the deterioration of the ecosystem. Indeed, government can enact laws and offer programs to raise the public\u2019s low-carbon awareness; Companies can promote eco-friendly products to change people\u2019s consuming habits. But they also need an individual\u2019s appreciation and support to bring good results.",
        "In conclusion, every effort is precious when we are protecting the environment. Meanwhile, local authorities and organizations must shoulder their responsibility to develop renewable energies such as wind, hydro and solar power. Only by doing so we can assure that we could hand this beautiful planet to our next generation and the next generation after."
