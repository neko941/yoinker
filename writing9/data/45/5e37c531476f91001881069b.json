        "In this day and age, it is a lot of opinions how youth should spend their student\u2019s life to get all opportunities for this short and unique period in life of everybody. It is suppose if have a part time job during study, students will realize what they want from live and where they need to go. Another people agree that in this time students have to focus on the study to receive deep knowledge and be professionals in the field. I am convinced that every job discloses internal potential assisting to determine a future way of young people and find out strong sides of personality.",
        "Some people share the opinion that every student should have a work experience to understand how money are earned and receive opportunity to find right way. Part time job provides chance to work in various industries and improve time-managing skills being useful in daily life. To illustrate, my groupmate was hired in small hotel in Chelyabinsk like a waitress and after half year she realized that hospitality industry is not her field where she want to work. On the other hand, she improved stress tolerance, can perform several functions in the same time and discover that she enjoys working with people.",
        "Others believe that work can destroy all aspiration to study replacing knowledge by money. Thus, they are not able to find a good job and lose motivation to receive high education missing opportunity to improve skills and broaden horizons. For instance, some students from my group gave up study and went in different cities to work in hotels and restaurants losing possibility to study hospitality industry, have internships in international chains and receive high position after graduation.",
        "To conclude, work experience during study is great opportunity to recognize yourself remembering about work-study balance. I adhere to the view that part time job has many advantages if you manage your time in right way."
