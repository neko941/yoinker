        "The charts illustrate the percentage of three age groups in Yemen and in Italy in 2000 with its forecast until 2050. Overall, it can be seen that in both cases there are going to be a variety of alterations among societies over the 50 years.",
        "In 2000 in Yemen the biggest maturity group was the group, whose members were younger than 15 years old and which constituted slightly over half of the whole population (50,1%). In contrast, in 2050, the most common age is going to be between 15 and 59 years old which is predicted to account for nearly 60 % (57,1%). However, as well as in the past as in the future, the percentage of the oldest is the lowest among Yemen's society, constituting only 3,6 % and 5,7 % respectively.",
        "In comparison, in Italy, the people in the middle youth were, and are forecasted to still be the most numerous maturity group with 61,6 % in 2000 and 46,2% in 2050. What is more, the percentage of the youngest will be the lowest over the period with 14,3 % in 2000, and 11,5 % in 2050. Seniors will account for 42,3 % in the future, whereas in 2000 their proportion stood at only 24,1 %."
