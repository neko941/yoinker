        "Decent, good quality public transportation services are a necessity in any country. Not everyone is able to afford his own transportation; a sound network of variety of public transport should be available to sustain the economy by ensuring the availability of the workforce.",
        "Without public transportation the poor will be left stranded, with long distance travel out of their reach. Cities which are suffering from high level of pollution, suffocating gases and smog can benefit greatly from improvement of public transport. Lower cost and high quality should also attract those who do not use these services because of their poor quality.",
        "Public transport although provides convenience to the citizens of the country however is not suitable for everyone. For instance the elderly and the sick may find it difficult to reach and wait at the bus stops or rail stations.",
        "Many orthodox religious women may prefer private transport over public transportation. All kinds of people use these transportation and stations and bus stops could be rife with criminal activities.",
        "The taxation of car owners will result in fewer ownership of vehicles; even those who own their own vehicles because of any such necessity will no longer be able to afford them.",
        "The government should be quite selective in taxing car owners, those who own them out of sheer necessity should be immune to the levy of such tax. Other ways to deal with the issue of traffic congestion should also be considered i.e. by building underpasses and flyovers and widening of roads. Pollution problems can also be dealt with introduction of green vehicles which use electricity or solar power instead of fossil fuels."
