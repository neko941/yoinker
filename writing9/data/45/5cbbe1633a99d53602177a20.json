        "In today\u2019s era, adolescent are spending their leisure time around the technology, owing to this they are becoming more tech savvy; however, can not deny the fact that it is against their healthier life. I would elucidate the pros and cons of new technology in the following paragraph.",
        "If youngsters would spend their the maximum time with captivating technology; they would never learn the importance of growing in society, because juvenile is the best stage to learn and gain the wisdom about life. Moreover, instead of engagement with family members, children devote too much of their time with television, mobile and play stations.",
        "Furthermore, youngsters who are not involved in physical activities will lead to a unhealthy life; they will become more sensitive towards the natural environment. For instance, government has shown some statistics last year in a survey that thirty two percent of youngsters have sensitive skin and nose, which can not tolerate dust particles.",
        "Although, technology has some bad impacts, despite that it has part of benefits, as young adults are learning new techniques related to their studies and general knowledge facts by surfing on internet; this will help them in competitive exams, for example, entrance exam of a college, quiz competition or a job related examination.",
        "In conclusion, despite modern technology has some advantages, I believe there are more disadvantages. In future teenagers will lack in social life as a result they would have lesser confidence level in all the stages of life; they are stepping towards a unhealthy life."
