        "At the first stage in the cement production, limestone and clay are crushed to form powder. This powder later enters into a mixer before passing into a rotating heater. After heating, the resulting mixture is poured onto a ground, and it is processed by a grinder. Finally, cement is produced and packaged in large bags.",
        "Cement is one of the four raw materials that are used in the production of concrete, along with gravel, sand and water. To be exact, concrete consists of 50% gravel, 25% sand, 15% cement and 10% water. All four materials are blended together in a rotating machine called a concrete mixer."
