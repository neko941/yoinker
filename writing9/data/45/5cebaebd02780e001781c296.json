        "Over the years the communication between individuals has changed dramatically. The use of sophisticated technology is a major factor in this regards. Despite the fact that there are a lot of advantages with the use of improved technologies it has also taken its role not without a cost.",
        "Nowadays the use of technology and advanced electronic gadgets plays an important role in defining the lifestyle of a person. It is much easier to communicate with any individuals at different locations in a matter of seconds and under one touch. It has made networking much easier than in the olden days. People used to wait for days and weeks to receive a reply on their job interviews, business meetings etc. Apparently, life has become incredibly easy and the use of Skype and social media networking like linked-in and face-book has resulted in a much faster communication channel.",
        "Alternatively, technology has also resulted in adverse changes in individuals' relationships. People are more addicted to technology that they spend their major portion of their time in gadgets surfing on social media, games, and by watching series with the introduction of Netflix and stuffs, which are relatively cheaper to use and spend time that they literally forget the people next to them, which can ultimately cause chaos in their relationships.",
        "To recapitulate, I would say that it is always advisable to adapt to the new technological innovation but without sacrificing the personal relationship that one must have with their partners, parents, and children. As technology is an inevitable resource in today's life and avoiding it completely can result in the anomaly, it should be used in a moderate amount as needed without getting addicted too much."
