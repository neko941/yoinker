        "The given bar graphs illustrate the major reasons impelling students to study in different age groups and the number of assistants from their employers.",
        "Overall, it is clear that the percentage of the reason for studying for career declines as  age increases, whereas that of studying for interest rises as people age. In addition, students in the age group around 30 to 39 receive the lowest amount of support from employers.",
        "Looking first at the bar graph of reasons for studying, a decline can be seen in the percentage of the reason for studying for a career, it falls from about 80 per cent in the age group that is under 26 to around 50 per cent in the last age group, which is students that are above 49 years old. As for the reason for studying for interest, the proportion increases from approximately 10 per cent in the first group to 70 per cent in the last group.",
        "Moving onto the bar graph for the amount of employer support, the number of support declined from around 65 per cent in the first age group to less than 35  in the students aged around 30 to 39. While the percentage of the purpose for studying a career keeps dwindling as the age level increases, the amount of support grows, increasing to about 46 in the last group."
