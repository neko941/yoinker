        "These days people likes to travel fast and to avoid long ways because of that many of them are using Motorways.A long with the advantages of this Motorways. Also there is some disadvantages as the air pollution and the high possibility of accident . There are some solustions for this problems which should be implemented to at lest reduce the dangers of this",
        "Motorways.",
        "Firstly.One reason for problems is the damage that this ways cuase for the environmental.Moreover, chemicals that  been used in  cars or  others have been a main reason for the air pollution.For example, some families how had lived near to this motorways had saferd from respiratory diseases.A one soultion for this problem is to encourage people to start using  environmently friendly cars and try to use publice transport more.Which, might lead to control the amount of petrols and other chemicals.Therefore, it will be possible to solve this problem.",
        "Scondly. Another issue is the high rate of accident.In motorways the incidence rate of accidents are much highr than the normal due to, the high speed and the lack of traffic lights. Some people drive so fast even in bad weathers.For instance,  their was a study about the main reasons for people death and the the first one was motorways accidents.One effective solustion is to reduce the speed limits for this ways hopefully this will help to save people lives.",
        "In conclusion, Motorways can be a beneficail. Only by following the safety roles, this solustion will ensure that people will benefit from this motorways without any risk."
