        "It is globally opined that the rate of learning new activities reduces  as one's age is increasing,and that organisations should  employ younger staff because they learn and execute jobs faster. I  totally  agree with this assertion  as the younger adults  attract more customers to the company  and they  could  quickly learn  on the job.",
        "",
        "A very  strong reason why recruiting  firms should go for the  younger generation when   enlisting workers  is because more  clients  would be attracted to them  .This is further explained by seeing young adults who can discharge their duties as efficient as possible ,leading to customer satisfaction . As a result, more individuals patronise those industries.   For example, GT bank employs  young personnel's .Consequently, this has made them gain more customers as their workers are very  fast in attending to clients.",
        "Another  point to consider is that  they learn  without difficulty on the job.  This means that, when they are hired to work, due to their zeal and enthusiasm for the work, they quickly pick up  the various ways  of executing their task. A good illustration is found in a study  conducted   amongst the staffs of Innoson Motors  Nigeria Limited, where it was discovered that the people above age 65  found it hard in learning the ropes ,unlike their Junior  colleagues within a one month period  . Thus,  giving credence to the fact that young staff are very smart in getting the hang of a task .",
        "In conclusion,  in my opinion, companies  must  go for the junior employees when recruiting if they want to  attract more customers and  also because these set of people learn easily on the work.",
