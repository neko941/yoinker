        "The World is fast evolving, gyms are being opened daily and even new exercise machines are being produced. However, the majority are still \u00a0weighing more than they should.A major cause of this is high consumption of fatty foods. This essay will elaborate on the causes of overweight and measures to be taken to overcome this.",
        "One major cause of weight gain is the consumption of foods with high calorie content. Due to work pressure and lack of time, most people find it hard to prepare their food themselves hence they results to buying fast foods which are quick and readily available however bad for the health. Daily consumption of these meals, harm the body as more calories are stored. Preparing your food means you can control everything that goes into the making of the food however once you purchase a meal outside, you are limited to whatever the preparer puts in the meal. Recently It was widely reported in the punch newspapers that fast food is responsible for 80% of excessive weight gain amongst youth, children and adults. Hence, a limit should be placed on consumption of these meals.",
        "A good solution to tackle this epidemic is regular exercise. Actually, people are overweight because they burn less energy than they consume. The public is \u00a0encouraged to register in local gym and engage in regular exercises. In order to curb overweight, the Gyms are available at subsidised prices and even some are free for the locals. Technology has made it easy to watch our weight as there are \u00a0smart watches which serve as \u00a0calorie counters and step counters. This watch will show how many steps you have taken in a day as well as calories consumed. For instance, One can engage in early morning jogging with the gadget and even wear it throughout the day. It should be noted that exercise should be \u00a0a continuous thing and it takes being \u00a0consistent and never giving up as the saying goes \u201cNo pain, No gain\u201d",
        "Furthermore, It should be noted that for the exercise to work ,one also has to watch what he consumes. The nutritional facts at the back of the food should be checked before consumption and try as much as possible to prepare your food. In conclusion, excessive weight gain is bad for the health and we should try as much as possible to be healthy."
