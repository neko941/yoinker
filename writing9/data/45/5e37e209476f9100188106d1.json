        "A greater percentage of a nation's health budget should be devoted to health awareness programs and  measures for prevention of disaease. I personally agree with this idea for a number of reasons, which will be outlined in this essay as fighting the root cause is absolutely essential to eradicate the problem and help in saving time, money, and energy.",
        "Firstly, I feel that channeling healthcare budget extensively towards pre-emptive health measures will reduce overall medical costs. It will also indirectly contribute to the country\u2019s economic growth. The spending on medicines, lab tests, doctor\u2019s fees, and surgeries is huge. Much of the clinical expenditure can be easily obviated if more money is spent on preventative steps. This can enable every individual to be educated about health. More health campaigns can encourage people to take simple steps of hygiene such as avoiding contaminated needles and refraining from unwanted physical contacts. Due to this, many dreadful diseases such as AIDS, Hepatitis, and Tuberculosis can be prevented. This, in turn, can save exorbitant expenses at a later stage.Secondly, incentivizing health programs can motivate people to support the government in eradicating preventable diseases. For example, a street play or a free seminar can be arranged to enlighten the public about the ill effects of smoking, chewing tobacco, alcoholism, and ignoring health check-ups.Lastly, the precautionary approach towards health will ultimately lead to a better quality of life. Healthy citizens will engender more happiness and wealth in the nation. In a developing country, many patients will be relieved of the extravagant medical costs and their productivity will increase.",
        "In other hand,treatment is a method of preventing from death emergency,it would be measured on some disaster condition, but it is more expensive and sometime we will not able to get good result because we are still unable to have all appropriate skill and materials.Furthermore,if somebody comes with massive bleeding by cutting his arm,in that case hospital should suture the wound and prevent from bleeding abnormalities.Like that,treatment is more important in some cases.",
        "To be concluded,health education and prevention measure go for a longtime and affordable by everyone so the country's big budget should be invested in education and prevention measure where as treatment should be available as much as possible."
