        "In this contemporary era, the use of latest electronic machines like refrigerators or washing machines is very common. There is also an increase in the use of these machinery. However, I believe that it have much more merits over demerits. This essay is an attempt to explain the advantages and disadvantages of use of consumer goods.",
        "Firstly, the use of consumer goods had made our lives easier than before. In the past, if we had to wash the cloths we had to wash it with our bare hands which is quiet difficult for everyone. Moreover, it take too much time to dry the cloths especially during the winter months. However, nowadays not only the cloths are being washed themselves but also they are being drying themselves and very fast. Additionally, when we need a cold water or when we have to freeze something or when we want to get an instant ice we can get easily from the refrigerator. I believed that if these things were not made then our lives would would be very difficult.",
        "Secondly, we are too dependent on these types of consumers goods. For instance, if these goods gets broke or not working then we can't do any work ourselves. However, these types of machines are quiet expensive and have a limited life. In addition, it is quiet dangerous for children.",
        "To conclude that, these machineries had much more benefit than demerits. However, I believe that these things are made for the convenience for the people"
