        "It is common to see that some high school students are required to wear school uniforms. But some high schools allow the students to dress in their own way. I personally believe that wearing uniforms is a proper policy for serveral reasons.",
        "Wearing uniforms could reduce school bullying. School bullying has been a long discussed subject, and one of the many events that could trigger a tragedy of bully is the dress. Some students are laughed at their clothing because it looks cheap, while other teenagers are envied by their peers simple because their dressing is eye-catching. Considering the abovementioned problem, the uniform, as a useful tool to hide the differences in students' economic conditions, and personal preferences, could reduce the likelihood of school bullying caused by dresses.",
        "In addition, wearing uniforms is a proper strategy to teach the teenagers the meaning of disciplined. Entering high school, the children are coming to the phase where they should be able to understand that following the rules in the society is something important throughout their lives. Compared with showing their unique personalities, being able to obey is the basic skill if a student wants to cope with the future challenges in their work. Therefore, following the high school dressing code is a good starting point.",
        "Undoubtly, wearing their own clothes is good for cultivating students' independency and unique character. Yet, this can also be done at their leisure time, at home or on holidays. It is not necessary to show this in the form of a piece of clothing.",
        "In conclusion, I personally believe that the policy that requies everyone to wear a uniform is better for the students, as well as the school environment."
