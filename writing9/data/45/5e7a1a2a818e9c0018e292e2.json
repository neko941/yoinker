        "International travel has taken mammoth dimensions. Unfortunately, it creates an adverse effect on people rather than make people open minded. I shall discuss the what are its problems and how to overcome frim this problem in the following paragraphs.",
        "The pivotal reason of people becoming prejudice is that tourists are not respecting to the local culture of the place where they travel. They are inadvertently or deliberatly not following or accepting the local culture. In India, for instance, people removes their shoes outside the temple before they enter into the shirne, while tourist with having western culture might not follow this. In addition, tourists does not respect local language and local food. In some places, non-vegeterian food is not allowed to eat and it is a big sin for people to kill animal and consume in meals, but some tourists does not respect it.",
        "Moreover, people are staying in luxurious hotels while they travel to different places. They are taking bath three times, which results in wasting of water resources. Also, they ordered food in large quantity which they might not be able to finish and wasting it as well. On the other hand, local people does not have enough fresh water to drink and sometimes they have only one meal per day. Furthermore, when tourists buy souvenir from local shops, they bargain a lot which shop owner cannot deny it because their shops are dependent on tourists only.",
        "However, there are some solutions which are not simple. The tour operator meed to giod their tourist about local culture, tradition and food. In addition, people can also learn from itself by searching it online. Tourist can live with local people so that they can taste the local culture and local people can also earn some money which creates a win-win situation for both.",
        "In conclusion, people need to respect the eachothers cultures and if they do not the many countries, whose economy is depend on tourism might affect a lot. Finally, local people also need to understand sometimes that it takes time for people to adapt different culture."
