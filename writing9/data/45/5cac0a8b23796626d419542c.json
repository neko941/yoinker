        "Ordinary citizens do not have the competence to help the environment, while government and big companies can make changes. While it is true that government and business can contend with improvements in the environment, I believe it is the people who can most contribute.",
        "There are several reasons why I believe that people are the ones who can most contribute to the environment, after all, it is in it that we live. Every citizen can plant a tree and doing so will have a very good impact on the air, for example. Everyone can learn how to recycle their trash and this is another way to help the Mother Nature.",
        "Another great initiative that has become stronger among the people who are engaged for a better world, is to use eco-friendly products. For example, I myself try to buy my makeup that is free of animal cruelty, and yes, for those who do not know, this is also taking care of the environment. While protecting animals you are also preventing another part of the destruction.",
        "In conclusion, everyone can help the environment, everyone can do their part regardless of whether the government does or not."
