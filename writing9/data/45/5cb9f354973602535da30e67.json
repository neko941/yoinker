        "Nowadays, the youth population are relatively larger than the elderly in some countries.This can contribute to the major economical growth of the country. Although there are major advantages, it also comes with similarly disadvantages.",
        "The youth population is always energetic, creative and always have a solution to their problem. This is mainly because of their young thoughts and active brain. Quality like these can contribute a lot to their work environment. Also, young adults in developing countries is a boon because of their involvement in labour workforce. For example, In a developing country like India, youth play an important in uplifting the GDP of the nation. Hence it is always a huge advantage to have large youth population than the elderly.",
        "Every coin has two sides, therefore this situtaion also has come disadvantages which is comparatively less than the pros. One of the major disadavantage is unemployement. Despite the fact that the young adult are active and smart, they lack in terms of experience in work, which is the result of unemployement. The job markets can be very competative because of the large number of participants, who apply for the same job. For example, If a person of age 45 is in senior position, it takes atleast 15 years for him to retire, which could be a hinder for the fresher to apply for the job. Because of this, the hierarchy in the workplace remains constant.",
        "In my opinion, the factors contributing to the disadvantage has less impact interms of contributing resources to the government. On the other hand, advantages can help largely on the country's economical growth."
