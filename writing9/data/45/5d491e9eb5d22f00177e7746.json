        "The current world is changing in all aspects. One of them is the disbalance between the people of different age groups. Statistics show that the population of younger generation is far greater than the elder generation. Certainly it is of great benefit on the whole.",
        "Let\u2019s draw a comparison signifying the advantages of having more youth as opposed to the elderly. To begin with, young people are more enthusiastic and full of energy as compared to the older ones. The have more hope of life and hence struggle to make a better living. They strive to compete with the world with all their zest and zeal. When given a certain task they are quicker and more efficient to respond. The use of technology is more common in the youngster and they know how to make use of all the different features therefore benefiting themselves as well as the organizations they work with.",
        "Coming to the elderly they are old and feeble; they look forward to only a few more years and ultimately this leads to lesser efforts on their part. They might be facing different ailments and struggling with them. This in turn harms the economy of the country as they have to spend more and more to provide them all the health facilities and the list of such things goes on.",
        "The only thing that makes the elderly important is their insight about different situations that most of the younger generation lacks. Their experience makes them stand out.",
        "All the whole I would say that though people of all age groups hold significance at their own level but have more youngsters is definitely better on most of the grounds."
