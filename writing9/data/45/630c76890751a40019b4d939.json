        "The classes based on the Inernet has replaced those of colleges year by year. Some people say that classed on Internet is useful as they do not need to go to colleges, whereas others believe that learning in university is essential.",
        "Firstly, one of the advantages to take classes online is that students can cut down the time to commute to their colleges and then can spend that time to a lot of things, such as their assignments part-times and hobbies. Focusing on the assignments, the colleges can give more tasks to students due to reduce commuting time, which may lead to improving student's growth. In addition, considering about hobbies, student can expand their network of contacts by meeting and interacting with people they would not be involved with at colleges, which may have a positive effect on their carrer.",
        "However, there are some benefits about studying at university. Students typicall can learn not only academics but also a lot of skills they can not learn online, including relationship with friends, time management. Above all, the period of college lifes are the best opprtunity for students to acquire these skills because they are essential to participate in society and success their carrier.",
        "In my opinion, both classes based on Internet and universities have each advantage, which means that the options depend on people and what they have as the top of priority. Furthermore, I believe that it is also important that more and more colleges offer a wide range of classes more flexibily."
