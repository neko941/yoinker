In addition to that the staff feel working under pressure due to unforeseen conditions. Furthermore, employers need to take break for five to ten minutes for every productive hour. They needs to stretch their arm and legs followed by massaging their eyes.  To elucidate, a Survey conducted by World Health Organisation (W.H.O) in last month tells that 80% of stress can be relieved by taking short intervals at work.",

For example, if a worker is working in a reputed company as a sales manager where they have meet monthly targets, by practicing yoga they can practice by staying calm which helps the to think innovative which help them to perform multiple tasks at a time. At the end of the day, health is more important than wealth and work following doing eating habits keeps the staff fit and healthier.",
