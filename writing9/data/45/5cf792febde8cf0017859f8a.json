        "Technology has improved the way of communication compare to the past. However, it also made some good and bad effects to the people's relationship. In this essay, I will be discussing why I believe it a negative development.",
        "Text messaging, instant messaging and electronic mails are some of the most used mode of communication these days. It is undeniably fast and effective way to communicate to people however, this means of communication does not require a face to face conversation. For example, Facebook messenger is a popular application used to communicate with other people. Some people manage to create virtual friendship over this and belive that they do not need to meet personally to become good friends. This leads to the reduction of personal interaction with other people. In a recent study by a group of students from Harvard University, it showed that almost 65% of young people are not comfortable talking to others face to face. Out of 65%, 30% of this young people are stuttering when they talk and showed no confidence at all. This technology seems to affect their personal development.",
        "In addition, instant messaging and electronic mails in the workplace also have some negative impact. For instance, in big offices, only few colleagues know each other personally as most of them only know their co-workers' name. This creates an unhealthy working envirnoment. Also, in instant messaging and electronic mails, the way the sender deliver his message may differ on how the receiver interprets the message. This modes of communication may cause misunderstanding as the receiver cannot hear the tone of the message. Hence, it is difficult to build established a solid working relationship although, work can be accomplished faster with these technologies.",
        "In summary, these modern ways of communation badly affects that intrapersonal relationship of people. It has drastically changed the people's confidence when it comes to personal communication. Most prefer to talk through their mobile phone and computers rather than face to face."
