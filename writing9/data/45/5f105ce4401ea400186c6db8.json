One reason for this is the growth in low-cost passenger flights, often to holiday destinations. Some people say that government should try to reduce air traffic by taxing it more heavily. Do you agree or disagree?",

        "Air transport leads to a variety of different problems and one of the causes is a rise of budget-friendly flights. Many individuals claim that authorities should decrease the number of flights by boosting the tax rates. In my opinion, I assume that flying should be taxed more heavily because airplanes are one of the most polluting transport, also less individuals would be using air vehicles.",
        "Firstly, it is necessary to increase taxes, because planes are among the transport, which has the greatest impact on pollution. By using fossil fuels, air transport emits a huge amount of carbon dioxide and other harmful exhaust fumes which are toxic for the environment and encourages air pollution. For example, in 2017 the study on transport impact was performed and it is estimated that aircrafts are responsible for 10 percent of carbon dioxide while trains produce nearly 3,6 percent.",
        "Secondly, higher taxes could decrease the demand of flying. Growing cost of the flights would reduce the number of people who use air transport. For instance, some people would choose cars, trains and buses or other different types of transport because travelling by them would be more cheaper comparing with airplanes.",
        "To sum up, I strongly believe that it is essential to increase tax rates for air traffic because aircrafts have a huge effect on pollution by releasing a great amount of carbon dioxide and other dangerous chemicals. Also, because of the higher prices of flight tickets, the usage of air transport could be decreased."
