        "Males and females in some nations around the globe are having their kids later in their life. This development is due to them wanting to have more time for themselves and this has both positive and negatve effects on the society and their family life. In this essay, the reasons for having children later on in their life and the effects of this on the society will be discussed.",
        "People in some countries are deciding to have kids later in their life. This is because, they might want to have more time for themselves and wouldn't want to invest the majority of their time, especially in their prime age, dedicated to their children, rather, would likely want to spend time to become a better as a human and improve on becoming a good member of society. Moreover this would help them raise their kids better if they are mature and good people themselves in the first place.",
        "The effects of this decision taken by the men and women, on the society and their family lives are both positive and negative. Because, the kids would be growing in a better environment, and hence, the society in the future would move forward in a positive direction as they would grow up to become good human beings, but having children in their late years would lead a more old-age centered society, which isn't exactly a good thing.",
        "Due to these decisions, the children would, thae majority of the times, become good people, which is a better than the situations the other kids have to go through because of having young and immature parents. On the contrary, after growing up they have to go through so much of stress, for them to be able to take care of their parents. Moreover, to take care of the old people by giving them certain health benefits, the government needs to have funds, which they take care of by imposing greater taxes on the working people.",
        "In summary, some men and women have their babies later on in their lives as they desire to have more time for themselves but in the future, the ones who grew up as their children would go through stress to take care of their parents."
