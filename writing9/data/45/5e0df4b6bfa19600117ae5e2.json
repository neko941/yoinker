        "I am totally disagree with the statement that university education should be right of anyone without any due scrunity and further analysis about their academic records in regard to lack of reserving seats.",

To add up it ,it can not be ignorned that university expenses would be escolated by fixing unlimited seats. Which may effect academic level during study due to lack of tutors and facilities as equipments ,which are required to perform in regard to study purposes.",
        "Secondly,by such a disturbing environment all about study ,passout strength would be worthless due to inability to tackle several compitations to obtain jobs in various sectors . This is because ,decreasing level of educations as like it than used to be . Which may effect on overall unemployment  level of nation eventually.",
        "However,well education oppertunity should be opportunity to include them in the accurate path but  by doing this , other aspects would be demolished which may create numerous problems in academic records and wouldbe difficult to manage ultimately prefering to accedemic or any other compitition to fixing university educational seats in various streams is considerable way to maintain its all necessities.",
