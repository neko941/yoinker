        "The enormous advantages of engaging in sporting activities - whether as a professional or for leisure - can not be overemphasised. While some participate in team sports such as soccer and cricket because of its attendant merits, others believe that getting involved in individual sports e.g. tennis and golf, have better prospects. This essay will discuss both standpoints but in consonance with the former.",
        "Firstly, the most successful and famous sports veterans today emerge from team sports such as football, basketball and rugby. This explains why, in a recent research from an International Sports Institute in Switzerland, 80 percent of sampled population of school children between the ages of 8 and 15 confirmed that becoming professional footballers and basketball players as their biggest dream.",
        "Also, asides being a mutual source of motivation and ideas to one another in a group, teamplay also helps in achieving set goals quickly with minimal efforts. It is sometimes very exhaustive to expend individual effort to achieve a particular task. For instance, it will be an Herculean task for a goalie of a soccer squad to dribble his way into the opponent's net without the supporting effort of his team members.",
        "On the contrary, indecisiveness as well as individual differences which has recently become rampant with team sports, form the basis of argument for the advocates of a one-man team. For instance, the recent rate at which some (disgruntled) members of football teams across the world form cabals to sabotage the efforts of the whole team is quite alarming. This is very costly to the team as it often results to loss of concentration for other members and a consequent poor team performance.",
        "In conclusion, with a more delibrate and strategic hire of team managers and coaches skillful in group dynamics and team management, the benefits inherent in playing team sports abound compared with playing individual sports. It is in \"Togetherness, Everyone Achieves More\"-TEAM."
