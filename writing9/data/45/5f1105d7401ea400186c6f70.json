        "Unemployment is the rising concern and the biggest hindrance of the modern world towards success. Thus, this is getting a concerned issue that such people should get a proper aid from the government. I strongly accord with this notion that ministry do hold a responsibility in taking care of homeless people. I will discuss the strong points to support my view.",
        "Firstly, in this competitive world, finding a job is as difficult as finding a needle in a haystack as everyone has to go through a cut throat competition. Moreover it is a result of wrong government policies too, that there are not enough jobs available in the market these days. Which in result could a devastating for any nation as there will a break on the all out development. For an instance, recently India banned all Chinese products which lead to hike in unemployment. Government should think of alternatives before taking such decisions.",
        "Secondly, if government will not provide jobless people with must needed food and shelter they will tend towards doing crime and looting to meet up with their daily needs. Similarly in South Africa, where the crime rate touched the sky due to such circumstances. Furthermore politicians can bring up enormous policies to create jobs which include foreign direct investments in the nation which could really be a blessing in disguise. Along with a prominent action is much required against corruption if we really want to eradicate the problem from its roots.",
        "Finally, in conclusion, political parties must do their jobs properly and provide every citizen what their rights are. I strongly believe that if government do their part with consideration, there will not be such problem and it will be greatly helpful in deterring the stress."
