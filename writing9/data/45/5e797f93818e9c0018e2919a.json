        "In the changing scenario environment problem is burgeoning with every passing day. It is not only  problem in developing countries in fact developed nations are also victim of this. Masses donot able to solve this issue. Therefore it is only solve by big organisations and authorities. My inclination does not fall with this statement. My essay would clear all the doubts in upcoming paragraphs.",
        "There are numerous of way which help to reduce the environment problems. First of all, public should use carpooling and follow shearing system and due to this the traffic is reduced then the atmosphere issue is also decreased because traffic is a main crux of pollution. Therefore follow the shearing system is helpful to cantroll it . For example, folks who do work in a same place then they should shear their vehicles with each other and then it is possible to solve this issue because there are less car on the road thus the environment pollution is reduced.",
        "The trustworthy point to be a noted here is that, nowadays mostly individuals use plastic made things owing to this environment pollution will be increased because plastic made things is not reused. People ought use 3R rules such as reuse, reduce and recycle with the dint of it they donot face any kind of problem related to environment. For example clothes bag is use by them then the pollution easily removed. Hence they should not us plastic.",
        "However,  government should impose rules regulations to solve environment problems because owing to stickiness of authorities people are more adults be they donot any activity which is harmful for atmosphere then government give punishment to them. Hence they can solve this issue.",
        "To conclude, in these days there are many problems face by masses but environment is big issue among the people. Although authorities is helpful to reduce this issue but the implement of folks they cannot face this problem because government only imposes the rules but public follow it then it has more optimistic."
