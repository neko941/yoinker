        "The maps illustrate an industrial part of Norbiton and anticipate the advancement of the site. Overall, it is noticeable that the number of housing will significantly grow and plenty of facilities will be constructed.",
        "According to the first map, now in the area, there is a river flowing on the north side of the place. Moreover, there are 8 facilities laid on a road. Besides, farmland is situated on the other side of the river.",
        "Looking at the second map in more detail, it is predicted that factories will be eliminated. One more striking change is thought to be the expansion of the road to the newly-built housing area on the west-northern section and to the farmland, crossing the river. In addition, the main road in the south sector might make a circle, in order to make it convenient for cars to turn. Furthermore, the factories will be replaced by infrastructural facilities, such as shops, a playground, a school and a medical centre."
