        "In recent times,it has been discovered that a huge number of people make trips to places with high risk of survival. This incessant growth especially to the Sahara Desert and the Antarctic is alarming. Although there are benefits to touring these areas, it is not devoid of some demerits.",
        "To begin with, tourists to these places may fall victims to the harsh and dangerous environment.  In spite of the fact that they are advised on the suitable clothes to wear, bearing in mind the difficulty of those areas, they may still be injured or even die in the process. One article i recently read, confirmed that at least, one hundred tourists die in Antarctica every year. Even with the heavy leather clothes and high boots against cold, people freeze to death there. Moreover, a visit to those areas may subsequently affect a person's health medically. The reason for this is apparently the exposure to harsh weather conditions of those areas. Survivors of such environment may end up with ailments like Pakinson's disease for the rest of their lives.",
        "On the other hand, a visit to such places reveals to the tourists the beauties and aesthetics of the environment. Without a tour to these areas, one cannot fully appreciate the beautiful creation prevalent there. Some people believe that despite its cold weather conditions, Antarctica seems to be the most beautiful continent in the world. Another advantage of travelling to these places is that it gives the rest of the world more information about the areas. It is certain that without prior visits made to these dangerous places, many would not have known of the risks they bear. Thus, when tourists visit them, more information are gotten regarding them. It is these information that advise intending tourists of suitable materials to go with.",
        "In conclusion, while travelling to areas with difficult  weather conditions is highly dangerous,  there are indeed, benefits to it, such as documentation for the general public and experience of beauty."
