        "Internet has brought revolutionary change in the way we live our life and the changes it has made are tremendous, however it has fabricated a fictitious world without a physical presence called internet. Some people believe that there are more merits of having virtual classes, while other completely rejects this notion and supports typical classroom environment. This essay will discuss both merits and demerits and will suggest a plausible conclusion based on logical justification.",
        "Firstly, online studies will provide you a leverage to choose timetable of your own choice; hence, those who are working can continue their jobs without compromising on their studies. For instance, nowadays studying online is quite common among student due to the availability of variety of tutorials on any topic or subject required, however, it also saves our time and efforts of travelling, which consumes a lot of energy.",
        "In contrast, if we consider the benefits of environment of old classroom system, the most important advantage is a mentor, who can clear all of your doubt through two way communication. Furthermore, a classroom will give an opportunity to get connected with other students, have exchange of views. For instance, by participating in group discussion and projects, student comes to know a lot about each other than otherwise.",
        "When it comes to disadvantages, each one of them has their own drawbacks, such as, online studies has affiliation problem as, many universities do not accept such online course as authentic as classroom studies. Further, student find it complicated to clear their doubt as usually they have no mentor available to them and they have to email their quarries or have to wait till a tutor get live with them and so on.",
        "In contrast, if we consider the drawbacks of traditional classroom studies, it has fix schedule, such as a teacher might teach hundreds of student at the same time and those who cannot manage to attend it will have no other opportunity to make up.",
        "In conclusion, each of them has its own merits and demerits, a student will choose what is best for them on their own convenience and circumstance. In my opinion, as classroom system is a traditional and widely accepted method of teaching it is more convenient to sit with a coach in class and learn things."
