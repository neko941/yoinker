        "Our world is going through a phase where all the countries will be experiencing important challenges in the next ten years that involves not only the environment but also population and education. This essay will discuss the issues that will be faced by my country India, in the next decade and the possible solutions to overcome them.",
        "Firstly, the vital issue that my country will encounter would be the over-population in the next 5 to 10 years. At the moment we rank second in the list of top populated countries in the world after China, but this will change in next five years according to the recent survey conducted by 'World's Population Society'. This over population will lead to scarcity of jobs and 6 out of 10 people will encounter the unemployment problem. Secondly, education will be an alarming issue considering the current education system that offers the better service to only for the students who can afford to pay the higher fees. If this policy continues then students will suffer from inequality within the education system which will lead to have an impact in the country's economy.",
        "To overcome the population issue, first of all people should be educated about the birth control option. Most of the current generation from the villages are not even aware about this option, and in some worst cases they tend to think this will affect their health. So the quicker we apread the awarenss about the usage of condoms will help to control the over-population. In regards to the biased education system, the current policy should be completely revamped to find out the present issues that everyone's facing and implement the new policy that will provide the education equally to every student. Also, we could develop a new department in the education organisation to reach every nook and corner of the school to understand if the new system are practised without any concerns or loop holes.",
        "To sum up, every country will have their own problems in near future. It's upto us to recognise in prior and frame the strategy to stop them happening. In India the major problems will be over-population which can be avoided by birth control awareness and biased education system that can be resolved by amending the existing policies."
