        "There has been a growing argument for school to teach students money management skills, which are rarely found in today\u2019s curricula. Generally speaking, I agree with this premise, however, I also believe that awareness of this issue should be nurtured as early as possible by parents.",
        "One of the most eminent problems that recently-0graduated young adults experience is financial problems. Most of them have just been apart from their parents, who used to cater to each and every need of theirs, and therefore jumping to the real life with little or no clue in money management. With this in thought, it may be inferred that parents are to blame with some calamities in their children\u2019s lives. However, majority of parents also do not know the first thing about good fund management, as accentuated by the discrepancies in their socio-economic conditions. It is therefore imperative for schools as formal education institutions to give a standardised guide for coping up with money crisis.",
        "Nevertheless, people should not completely wash their hand and just hope schools to take the wheel. Despite however catastrophic a household\u2019s financial situation might be, there is no doubt that the family members know the fundamental rule of money saving and self-control; after all, major crisis mainly happens not because of lack of those skills. These two basic skills are unquestionably essential for child development, as well as cementing foundation for their ominous quarter-life crises.",
        "To conclude, there is no doubt that the integration of financial management into scholar activities will enhance the quality of their student\u2019s lives. That being said, it does not mean that parents do not have anything to do with their children\u2019s impending problems."
