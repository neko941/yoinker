        "Looking first at the middle and right side of the island, several changes can be seen. In the central area, a restaurant and a reception have been constructed, where they were surrounded by the vehicle's tracks. To the south of the reception, a pier was built at the shore of the island for tourists to access the facilities by boat. As for the right side, a number of accommodations were constructed and all were linked by the footpath.",
        "Moving onto the left side of the island, another accommodation area was set up and was connected to the beach and reception by footpath. In regard to the beach, a swimming zone was designated on the outskirts of it, providing a safe area for tourists to enjoy swimming."
