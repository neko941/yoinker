        "In today's world where Globalization has taken such a toll on human beings that maintaining a healthy diet has just become a part of history and is rarely followed by the people.",
        "Due to the increase in globalization, people have strict timelines for everything and they don't have much time to think about their diet or what they are eating. They just eat whatever they get in hand and people don't want to spend much time on cooking rather than that they prefer frozen food which is already cooked and can be directly consumed but overeating of that type of food has some hazardous effects on human body. Also with the increase in the salaries of people they spend more on Junk food which has become extremely popular by the of advent many fast food chains. The quality of food and vegetable has also decreased as there is an increase in the population and to feed the increased number of people artificial methods of agriculture is being used to quickly grow the non-seasonal fruits and vegetables which is not considered to be very healthy.",
        "With the growing issues of health problems following a non-healthy diet should be one of the major concerns among the communities. Government has to take control for the abolishment of the usage of false practices by the farmer for the growth of fruits and vegetables. The government can provide them other facilities which should stop these habits. The respective authorities can also control the growth of fast food ventures which are indirectly influencing people to opt for Junk food. Also, awareness has to be spread among people about the benefits of a healthy diet and what impact it can have on the human body if not followed.",
        "A Healthy diet is a need of the future generation and if not followed by the people living today then it can have huge impacts on the coming generation."
