        "It is sometimes argued that both individuals and society are influenced by advertisements and are suffered some problems. I generally agree with this claim because companies overstate their products or service to make customers buy or use their things. These action stimulate people's impulsive buying and cause offences.",
        "One of the positive point of advertising is economic growth. Companies use numerous methods when they make their advertisements  look well. People tend to be affected by advertisements and buy better products than they already have. Therefore, advertising spurs economical activities and leads to economic growth.",
        "On the other hand, one of the negative effects of advertisements is impulsive buying. The recent technological developments have allowed us to buy online regardless of time and location. These developments seem to be good for us, but these technological advancements make us buy goods even though we already had a similar type of products. Similarly, the invention of SNS also expose us to numerous advertisements and chances to buy something.",
        "Another negative aspect of advertisements is bad influence on children. Recent advertisements especially on the internet think highly on the adult or violence contents. When we watch these movies, there is an age restriction, but the governments can't set legulation for advertisements. These advertisements stimulate children's curiosity and some children violate the rules to watch these videos.",
        "In conclusion, while advertisements work positively in some aspects, they also have dangerous points, including encouraging us to buy unnecessary products and to get involved with criminal problems. Hence, I believe the drawbacks are greater than the good points."
