        "One part of the society consider citizens of a place to look after for its cleanliness. However, others endorse incumbent government to be responsible for. I strongly advocate that it should be a combined effort of both government bodies and local residents.",
        "Needless to say, administration is held responsible for the management of collective waste dump by the residents as sorting out a gigantic litter pile is not a cup of tea for individuals alone. Besides, higher authorities can also strive to enact stringent laws regarding the waste thrown by people individually. Levying of high rated taxes by municipal Corporation can also be proved as a viable method to dwindle the rubbish. To exemplify, Telangana government in India started imposing Penalty on the people who are found culprit for contaminating roads.",
        "However, denizens should also to be blamed for the tidiness of their society since around 80% of the garbage is collected from house bins. Moreover, youngsters get themselves amused bt throwing parties and produce waste food and other material. If hoteliers take responsibility to hygiene their places after parties then how the young people will understand their duty? So, to teach them the value of beautiful nature, it is necessary for parents to make them responsible for their surroundings.",
        "To conclude, though government should take responsibility for the large waste thrown outskirts of the city from financial Perspective but I believe local residents should also need to nurture the environment by getting some time from their daily regime to clean the area."
