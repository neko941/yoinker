        "It is presumed by certain sets of societies that leisure time is more important than having a colossal sum of money to lead a life filled with complacency; however I stand with the fact that other factors like reputed as well as satisfied job, a healthy lifestyle and a happy long lasting relationship with near and dear ones are also considered to have a worthwhile living.",
        "To embark with, undoubtedly, in this contemporary era, a good quality of lifestyle is not attained without money. For the elite class people, lifestyle is meant to be having a big mansion to live, a long car to ride and attending A-one parties. They get these all materialistic things with the money. As money is an asset for them to pursuit the happiness in their own way and to spend a luxurious lifestyle. Nevertheless, it does not mean that the middle class people with little earnings are not spending a good living. For instance, the naval officer is happy about his job despite of little earnings. What he desires to feel is utmost satisfaction and recognition, without having an urge in himself to getting more and more money.",
        "Marching ahead, the other numerous factors like a healthy lifestyle and strong relationship with family and friends cannot be denied to live a good quality of lifestyle. There is a Mongolian proverb that \"Most important happiness in human's life is its health\". Being robust and healthy in all means (socially, mentally and physically) can ultimately lead the life happiness to reach at the authentic pinnacle and to enjoy the stupendous fruition. For example, a healthy and sound person can live longer and enjoy good lifestyle as compare to the one who is indulged into myriad illnesses. Also, love and affection with the family and friends can lead the person to live happy and satisfied life. To quote an instance, socialization is an imperative factor to achieve healthy lifestyle and those who spend their leisure time with friends, family and neighbors are more likely to spend joyful life than the others who are self-centered.",
        "To reiterate, money is important up to some extent to live a good lifestyle, but other factors also have a crucial place in everybody\u2019s life. Ergo, quality of life depends on many factors and all of them have their essential role in human beings' lifestyle."
