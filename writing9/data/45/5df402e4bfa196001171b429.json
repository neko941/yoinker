However, these days fewer and fewer people appreciate art and turn their focus to science, technology and business.\nWhy do you think that is?\n\nWhat could be done to encourage more people to take interest in the arts?",

        "The role of art in enriching cultures throughout the world is unquestionable. However, science, technology, and business are more appreciated and practiced by many people compared to art in this modern era. In this essay, we will discuss why art is not so famous these days and ways to boost people's interest.",
        "Even though art resembles one's customs and traditions, it is not an integral part of daily life. Admiring great paintings or marvel at brilliant sculptures has nothing to do with leading a comfortable life. In contrast, the contributions to science and technology like medicine, computers made our lives comfortable. Many innovations like the internet, mobile devices are no more luxury commodities. Many businesses provide employment opportunities and help to sustain economies. Needless to say, people are more inclining towards science than in arts.",
        "Another reason for the diminishing popularity of art is due to less or no support from the government. During the medieval period, arts have enjoyed considerable attention from the kings. Artists were paid heavily. There are very fewer incentives for the masterpieces of art. Arts are no more considered as a career option since the income through arts is insufficient for daily needs and standards. In order to have a successful career life in art, one has to dedicate more time compared to other areas.",
        "",
        "Preserving art has paramount importance in retaining our culture as both culture and art co-exist. Making art as a viable career option by creating more jobs, organizing exhibitions and promoting cultural exchange programs would encourage more people to show interest."
