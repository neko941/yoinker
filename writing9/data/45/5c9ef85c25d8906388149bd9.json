        "Technological improvement has been having negative impacts on the environment. Although living in a simple life can tackle environmental issues, I would argue that technology can be the answer to flow these problems.",
        "On the one hand,  when enjoying life is not entirely dependent on sophisticated technology, it will solve the problems of the environment. firstly, we will reduce greenhouse gases emissions if every household or business does not overuse large power consumption devices such as microwave ovens, air conditioner or lighting equipment. Secondly, instead of abusing agricultural pesticides that are harmful to the environment, a farmer can use predator that would control pests by eating them.",
        "On the other hand, I agree that technology development has been bringing enormous benefits to the ecosystem. The first benefit is that we can use renewable and environmentally friendly natural sources such as wind, solar or tidal power. It replaces the use of fossil fuels that emit many harmful gases. The second benefit is that we can leverage technology to recycle garbage for many different purposes. For example, we can recycle organic waste like vegetables, tubers, fruits or leftovers to make fertilizers for crops.",
        "In conclusion, although limiting the use of technology can solve some environmental problems, but according to my observation, technology has been applied a lot to solve environmentally problem ."
