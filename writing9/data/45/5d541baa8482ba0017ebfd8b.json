        "Nowadays,more and more people travel to different countries in search of either livelihood or academic reason.Many people find travelling overseas is  the best way to get their dreams.",
        "This essay discusses  about the pros and cons of migration affecting on a person and society as whole .",
        "Individuals from developing countries,since the education system in developed country is far more developed  interms of infrastructure and teaching quality,tend to migrate to western countries.To illustrate,my nephew recently went to Harvard University to study Artificial Intelligence.As artifical intelligence course is not available in home country,he migrated to United States.Therefore ,many students  migrate with different reason for their academic enhancement.",
        "In addition to that numerous job seekers migrate to various countries to brigthen up their job aspects.They are looking for high earning potential that leads to a high living standards.For example,various technical jobs from software development to testing are been applied from asain counties especially China and india.Hence for better living,many people travel to foriegn lands to fulfill their dreams.",
        "There are certainly various  positive effects on society.Due to various ethnicity, people will come to know about various customs.Local people could have a glimpse of whats happening in other parts of the world.Due to vividity of ideas, there will be intermingling of cultures.This leads to harmony and bright prospects to future.",
        "On the other hand,the person who migrates has to lead a difficult life initially. As he is new to surrounding,he will have difficulty in learing and understanding the prevalent culture.This is more pronounced if the person does not know the local language.For example,During travelling if he gets lost,he might not understand a way to get back since all sign to the way will be in foriegn language.In short,newcomers could not cope up with thier surroundings.",
        "Another problem caused by overflow of migrants is that jobs become scarce for the locals .Due to which there might be some tensions escalating.There is also an issue of racism but the effects of it comparitevely small.",
        "These are the various aspects of the migration and its effect on individual and society."
