        "I strongly agree that at present governments provide more funds on treating diseases and illnesses and allocate minimal funds on health education and prevention. I think it is more effective to increase the budget in designing programs that aims to teach the importance of healthy lifestyle to prevent major diseases.",
        "Government should use the funds to make various platforms in educating the public of the causes of various diseases and how it could be prevented. I believe if the government will have community based activities related to healthy lifestyle it will help decrease the percentage of people with medical ailment. Programs such as sex education subject should be part of the curriculum in secondary schools. At present, there are an increase of person diagnosed with the disease and it continues to rise due to ignorance of the public. Prevention is the best cure. It is cost efficient to formulate preventive programs than to invest and purchase medicines and equipments.",
        "Furthermore, government should focus more on people and how to further develop their knowledge and awareness. I believe that if people powered with knowledge of what causes a disease will surely increase percentage of people living a healthy life. I think this approach is good for long term.",
        "In summary, government allocate more funds on medicines and medical equipments more rather than to portion a higher budget in promoting health education and prevention. I strongly agree that its about time for the government to use a much effective way to solve the issues on healthcare."
