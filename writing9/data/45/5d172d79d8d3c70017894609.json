        "Discuss both view and give your opinion",
        "There are different view about the role film. While it can be argued that films only focus on intertainment, I am convinced that it is more beneficial to provide education.",
        "On the one hand, it can be argued that the main role of films is to entertain. Movies relieve stress tension so most of people watch film for relaxing after a stressful workday or studying time. Films are a great way to experience laugher and put smile on their face. When people watch movies, it relaxes their brain and they don't have to think about anything. For example, people watch sci-fi movie like Harry Porter, they can have a few hours escape into a different world and forget their worries.",
        "However, I gree with those who support movie should focus on education. The first clear reason is that film is great for visual learner. Movies enable young people to understand concept without the bariers that hinder learning. It is easy to raise their awareness while they enjoy the film instead of being taught by teachers. In addition, films provide a visual aid to understanding historical. For example, an historical documentary like Vietnam War can help students understand the War for peace in Vietnam and more. And the last reason, films can help people learn foreign language. When students learn a new language like English for example, they can watch a movie in English and try to follow along as much as possible so thay can apply everything they learned.",
        "In conclusion, although there are arguments in favor of enjoyable films, it seems to me that films\u2019s educational value is better idea."
