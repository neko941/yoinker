        "There is no doubt that different species of",
        "animals are being increasingly endangered. As a result people have been more environmentally aware, especially regarding the significance of biodiversity. Because of this significance, serious steps should be taken for biodiversity maintenance.",
        "Firstly, natural habitats preservation is very important to ensure the safety of flora and fauna. And this step can mainly be achieved by restricting human actions which destroy wildlife habitats, such as logging which destroys rainforests and over grazing which damages grasslands. In South America, for example, there is a vast unspoilt forest, where hunting, logging and lighting a fire are Strictly forbidden consecuentes, this land is considered a treasure of rare birds and another unique animal species. As this example shows, protecting natural environments can promote the biodivesity.",
        "In addition to that, threatened creatures can",
        "be kept in safe places for a stage of their lives to rescue them from extinction. For instance, a Russian project, which aimed to prevent a sort of birds from being extinct, took the eggs directly from the mother birds and conserves them in special conditions away from predators, until they hatched, and returned the their environment afterwards. As shown in this example, there are effective Strategies to ovens some avoidable threatens on animals.",
        "In conclusion, Although the ecosystem Suffers from dangers which threaten the biodiversity, these dangers. are not inevitable, and can be alleviated by preserving natural habitats and animals which are likely to disappear. The more responsible human being is to the earth, the healthier environment they will enjoy."
