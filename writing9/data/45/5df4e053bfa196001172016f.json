        "Nowadays, people tend to decide to have their first child much later than a few decades ago. This trend has divided public's opinion into advocates and detractors. Having children later on is a consequence of a few factors.",
        "Firstly, these days an indispensable role in today's society is in education, which is time consuming and very often young students are unable to become parents due to being focused on the acquisition of new knowledge and gaining professional qualifications.",
        "Secondly, after finishing university, the young generation would rather concentrate",
        "on their future career than on having progeny.",
        "Furthermore, when they finally establish a strong social and financial position, they are becoming focused on creating a homely environment and introduce their babies to the world. However, sometimes it takes longer than expected due to new generation's diseases such us problem with fertility, that is often the consequence of a stressful and unhealthy lifestyle caused by the rat race.",
        "Personally, I think that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages, because much more mature parents are taking greater care of their offspring, due to being more patient than younger people.",
        "Moreover, educated parents are better role models and are able to pass their acquired knowledge to their children. There was a research, which showed that the majority of teenagers who are entering univeristy, usually come from families whose members also have a degree.",
        "Another point which supports my point of view is, that older parents, who have already established their financial position can offer their offspring better prosperity.",
        "In other words, parents have resources to contribute financially in their children's education, holidays and other additional after school activities, which can reflect in better physical and emotional development.",
        "In conclusion, the new generation seems to have their children later on than before due to longer periods of education, better access to contraception, fertility problems and a desire to establish a financial and social position in our society. In my opinion, older parents are usually well educated and wealthy enough to offer their children a better start in their life."
