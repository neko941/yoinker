        "Entertainment aids in breaking the monotonous routine, and in this, enjoying films top the chart. However, a section of the masses consider it a sheer useless business. I do not concur with such notion and hold the opposite view as it not just a great stress buster but can also turn into a career for some.",
        "To embark on, watching movies is a way to relax and rejuvenate oneself. After a strenuous day at work, one wants to divert one's mind, and there comes a relief in the form of films. Divergent genres, such as romance, action, thriller, suspense, and comedy serve an awesome plater, which one looks forward to every week. Especially, weekends are the best time to engulf oneself with latest releases. As per a survey by a leading magazine, around 80% of the populace relish movies and deem it as the only way to detach from the professional surroundings.",
        "Another profound reason to back my stance is that it is not just a mere way to uplift oneself from the same tedious life but also to turn a hobby into a professional pursuit. One gets inspired to venture into a world of name and fame. Though the life of an entertainer is an unpredictable one, it reaps fruits if one is ready to take on the hardships initially. Shah rukh Khan, for instance, got inspired by watching Raj Kumar on the screen, and started desiring to become like one; now here he is, the most admired hero not only in India but in the whole world as well.",
        "To encapsulate, watching films is not at all splurging of the precious time. Indeed, it works wonder for tew mentally exhausted person as it relieves one from the myriad tension. Moreover, it is highly sought-after medium to turn a passion into profession."
