        "Taking a gap year between high school and university is a ighly debatable thought. Several countries encorage youngsters to gain experience before joining college while in others, students begin training for entrance examinations in 11th grade. In this essay, I will discuss the benefits and drawbacks of taking time off to travel or work before starting university studies.",
        "Traveling as well as work experience increases exposure of students to new situations. They have an opportunity to learn about different cultures, thus enabling them to adjust easily in a diverse college campus. Additionally, working encorages young adults  to think about and experience various fields and therefore pivk the one that interests them the most.",
        "however, taking a year off may have disadvantages. Firstly, there is a break in the flow of studies. It is a well know fact that information is forgotten if it is not revised periodically, and this is what happens when a student dosen't study for a long period of time. Tis is something that several students in india experience. they take a gap year on failing enterence examinations and therefore forget the basics before the next set of tests.Secondly, students may loose interest in studies all together and may try their and at unconventional careers like youtubing which is not a stable source of income. Most young youtubers now a days only have a high school degree.",
        "In conclusion, I believe that the disadvantages of a break year outweight the advantages. Travel and job experience gained through the school year or during summer vaccations will have the same benefits but will do away with the drawbacks."
