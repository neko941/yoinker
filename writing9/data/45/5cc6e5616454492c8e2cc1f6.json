        "It is generally believed that following news and articles keeps one abreast of happenings in the world. Although, in some countries, a significantly less number of young people are inclined towards reading newspaper or viewing news on television. Plethora of reasons contribute to the same such as lack of interest among the young population and further, important steps needs to be taken to combat with the issue.",
        "In recent times, social media has had a substantial impact on the lives of youth. The proliferation of the social media has led to a decline in their interest of following the current affairs. Young people tend to read latest happenings in the world through the internet feed. This can make the young mind think they are following the latest news, but on the contrary, their grasping power is reducing. Moreover, reading via the social media is similar to skimming the news wherein the opinions of the individual is not developed. What is more, the youth seems like not cared enough about the economy or politics which tends to shape the nation.",
        "Crucial steps need to be taken by both government and communities to tackle with the issue. Firstly, an awareness needs to be created among young individuals so that they can come to know as to how their participation can aid economies at large. Secondly, introducing subject or projects in schools or colleges can automatically lead students to follow reading newspaper or watching news which can further help in developing their own views on the subject.",
        "In conclusion, it is extremely important for the youth to follow news or reading dailies as they would be the decision makers in the near future. In the rapid declining of interest in matters related to politics or economy, crucial steps such as generating awareness among youth need to be taken by communities to ensure that the young minds have a critical role to play in the development of nation."
