        "Despite health insurance companies are extensively working to deliver quality services for individuals and corporate but they are all should be supervised and managed by the government. Because it is essential to each individual to have to right for proper treatment regardless of his employment and financial aspects.",
        "While many workers have their health insurance provided by their companies there are still many individuals who are switching jobs or even careers. Because the majority of the people depend on their companies\u2019 insurances other people who are in the process of searching for a job or switching careers wouldn\u2019t have any medical insurance. No one will ever know when and how he might get sick so, it is not fair for them not to have insurance in this period of time.",
        "However, there are many individuals who are self-employed or not working at all, in that case, they wouldn\u2019t have any kind of medical insurances. Although some individuals aware of the importance of it and might buy individuals plans from insurances companies but many others aren\u2019t initially aware of it. Not only they don\u2019t have the awareness but also they most probably don\u2019t have the financial luxury to buy one.",
        "Without further ado. I totally support the idea of each country should provide free health insurances plans for their citizens. And it must include all the latest medical treatment. It is inevitable to have insurance because of the employment state and financial level of each individual. Which delivers a high living standard for the country utilizes free health service."
