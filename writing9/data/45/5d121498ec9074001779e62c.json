        "Nowadays, there has been an increase in the number of overweight people all over the world and this is impacting the current health care system. Some think that the ideal way to deal with this issue is to incorporate more physical activities and games in the schools. I completely agree with this argument.",
        "On the one hand, some people believe that school is a place to study and physical education should not be a part of the curriculum. Obesity is mainly due to unhealthy food habits, lack of proper excersice and addiction to the internet and video games. Even though this set of people are aware of these reasons, they want parents to play the role in controlling their children rather than teachers. Their argument is that a lot of money is spent by the governments for education and it should be utilized for improving the knowledge of students rather than taking care of their health.",
        "On the other hand, I agree with the other  group, who thinks that schools are the best place to start creating awareness regarding the importance of health. They believe that physical eduaction should be a mandatory subject in all the schools and colleges and everyone should be participating in at least one or two activities. One main advantage is that, if they practise this at a very young age, it will easily become a habit and they will continue this life long. Also, when kids are engaged in any sports, parents will also participate in excersie sessions as a means of encouragement and the whole family will thereby follow a healthy lifestyle. Besides, any kind of sports requires stamina and hence they will follow a strict and healthy diet which in turn helps to maintain the body mass index.",
        "In conclusion, every individual should understand the fact that health is wealth and undoubtedly, schools are the perfect place to start preaching this. In my opinion, schools ought to give equal importance to both studies and physical activities."
