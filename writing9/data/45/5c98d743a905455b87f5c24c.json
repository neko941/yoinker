        "Animals are an integral part of ecosystem.It has become a debatable issue regarding the exploitation of animalsby mankind.Some people opine that animals should be treated the same way as humans are and  have equal rights as humans while others think that they should be used as a source of food or medical research.This essay will discuss both sides of the argument.",
        "With regard to exploitation of animals,people believe that it is acceptable for several reasonsFirstly,humans are considered to be the most prime being on planet and everything is done to ensure human survival.If it means experimentation on animals to fight and find cure against disease or to fulfill other demands.Then this takes priority over animal suffering.Furthermore,it is believed by some that animals do not feel pain or loss the same way as humans do,so if they have to be killed for medical research and other purpose,then it is morally acceptable.",
        "However,i do not believe that these argument stand up to scrutiny.To begin with,it has been shown on several occasions by secret filming in laboratories by animal rights groups that animal feel as much pain as humans do and they also suffer if kept for long periods in cages.In addition,a substantial amount of research has been done on animals for cosmetic products,not for finding cures which is unnecessary.Moreover,humans can get all the required nutrients form green vegetables and fruits.Therefore again,having to kill animals for food is not adequate argument.",
        "Summing up,it can not be denied that animals are required for research and other purposes but it should be keep in mind that they should not be capitalized on just for the sake of human needs and appropriate steps must be taken to improve the rights of animals."
