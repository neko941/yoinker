        "It is often heard that the population of the old will rise significantly in the future.I personaly believe that it has both advantages and disadvantages although the demerits outnumber the merits.",
        "On the minus side,increasing the number of old will have some disadvantages.Firstly,elder people are not energetic enough to improve their society.In other words,they will fail to do  arduous tasks owing to their aging process while the youngesters can do practical skills.Thai is to say,they  recieve a pension which can be  expended for social facilities.Secondly,the rate of  immigration is  bound to increase,meaning that the young from other nations,especially from underdeveloped countries will be embaraced by the government,leading to manifold problems ranging from rising the rate of crime to financial issues.Finally,older people will be deemed as a burden.In deed,youngesters should bear the burden of the them since they have to pay heavy taxes for the public amenities which the old generations have exempted from paying that.Thus,rising old population cannot be negative trend.",
        "On the plus side,decreasing the young population in comparison with the old could have some advantages.One of the prime advantages for it is that the more number of youngesters in the society,the more budgets should be expended for them.Plus,the government should allocate sufficient fund for the young education ,which can be spended for other sections such as improving recreational places,building hospitals as well as shopping  centers.Another advantage is that it is youngesters who bring tremendous problems  including commiting crime,recquiring multitude facilities for their pastime.As a result,rising the population of the old has some advantages.",
        "As outlined aboved,old population will increase in the future and has some merits like decreasing the rate of crime and saving the budgets for other affairs and it also has some demerits although it seems to me that the demerits may overshadow the merits of that."
