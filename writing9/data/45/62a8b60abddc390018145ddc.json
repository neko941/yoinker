        "It can clearly be seen that the sector of Chinese and Indian contribute the most vital key to take-home foods. Furthermore, the number of Indian restaurants in Canada rose steadily during this period.",
        "The pie chart shows that the Chinese and Indian types that are brought by citizens are much more widespread than all the others, at 34% and 26%. There is the number of people who have never ordered more than one-tenth at 11 %. While Greek, Japanese and Mexican are only chosen by 1% of people.",
        "In a detail of the second graph, at the beginning of the period started under 2000 restaurants. Next, the graph surged sharply until 2007 and reached a peak point in 2009 with approximately 9000. After that, the number remained stable until 2015."
