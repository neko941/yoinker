        "It is undeniable that, presence of plethora of sorts of leisure time activities baffle to select one of them to choose and person has to assort them not in terms of interests but challenge that they bring. My personal prospective would be hundred percent on par with this concept and this essay will divulge the cogent reasons of that contribution and draw plausible conclusion.",
        "Above all, the prime purpose of the hobbies tends to kill time and eradicate the boredom. People always make attempt to avail the time killing benefit of hobbies that makes them feel as they invest their time efficiently instead of just squandering. Furthermore, hobbies should not have only appealed them but also salutary adequately for the persona. To elucidate that more, work out, which is one of the most prevalent leisure time activities currently, can be a perfect example, in which sportsman tends to build his endurance through hard activities. Perhaps, it may seem challengeable to do but if it was not people would have already forsaken that. Because, people have always been interested with the activities that sharpen their abilities or difficult enough that deserve to cope with.",
        "Moreover, insufficiently difficult tasks, that are not able to draw the users attention completely, cannot be great hobby, because ideal hobbies are supposed to make the persona to concentrate fully on single task, which arouses a sense of flying time. For instance, reading book, that open new gates to the imaginary world, can brings a reader to its world that eligibly accelerate the passing of the time. Consequently, it will be beneficial for the reader\u2019s brain and may be pretty time killer activity as well.",
        "The conclusion to be drawn is that, if hobbies had not been not only interesting but also difficult as well, it would not bring feeling of satisfaction on persona and would have been renounced."
