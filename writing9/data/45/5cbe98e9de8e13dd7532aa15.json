        "Opinions vary on whether it is more advantageous to settle in vertical city rather than a horizontal city, although I can understand the reason why some people would like to live in a horizontal city, I am of opinion that living in a vertical city is more suitable.",
        "It is undeniable that there are many benefits to work and live in a horizontal city to some extent. One of the major reason is safety from natural disasters as earthquakes. Given that, it is easier to escape from a collapsed house than a high building, people can feel safer to live on the ground and not take a lot of effort to protect themselves when earthquakes happen. Another point is that makes it possible to build up the house with no upstairs to the bi-level house when this owner affords to reconstruct.",
        "Despite the aforementioned argument, I believe settlement in highrise buildings is more substantial related to space saving and the fact that enjoys the extraordinary views from the high level. Regarding the former, there are less and fewer clearings for building a house while there is an increasing the flux of immigrants to urban areas, as a results housing shortage. Because of that, apartments in high buildings is a suitable solution. The other beneficial element is people can enjoy sightseeings especially the vivid lights at night, for example, Ho Chi Minh city has sleepness inner city, people can not admire these when they in a low-level height.",
        "To conclude, there are many benefits of the horizontal city for accommodations and workplaces, I think that vertical city is taken into consideration for a satisfactory choice for living and working."
