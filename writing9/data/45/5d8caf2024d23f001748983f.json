        "It a common practise in UK that once the people there get aged, they often opt to go to old age hospice , often supported by the government  and reside  there with the people of the same age group. I strongly agree with the opinion that these homes need to be supported financially by the government rather than the families because this will decrease financial stress upon the families who actually cannot afford to pay for the necessities of elder folks in their families and also in certain families the supporters themselves are too old to pay for the care.",
        "As of today, thanks to vast advancements in science and technology  health facilities have improved which has resulted in increased life expectancy. As a result of which the number of people belonging to the ' old ' category of age is increasing and these elderly people cannot actually be burdened to pay for the care of even elder family members. This can be understood with an example of a country like china where the percentage of people above the age of 65 is expected to rise above 60 percent in the coming years. If this happens, people who themselves lie in the old age group will have to take care of their parents which will be extremely difficult for them.",
        "With the growing economic stress, providing basic life necessities and care even to one's children is becoming extremely difficult for parents so if these people have to support the elders of their family, this will be extremely difficult for them. So it would be better if the government pay for their care at a place where there will be people willing to provide care to elders. This will also avoid breeding of physical and psychological abuse of the senior citizens which usually happens in cases when such people stay with a family who cannot adequately support them. If government pays for the care of such people it will definitely  be a better option in favour of the senior citizens of the society.",
        "Having said all this, though, if families support the elders of their families , it will bring psychological satisfaction to them but it will be extremely stressful for the members supporting them in current situations of economic stress. So, it would be better if the government gives support to this age group of the society."
