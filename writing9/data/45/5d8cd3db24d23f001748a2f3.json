        "Advent of blood shedding games in which helpless animals are targeted for the entertainment of masses,such as bull Fighting, hunting, cockfighting and many others have brought inhumanity and cruelty among the society towards these supernatural things,are shown as act of uncivilized society and it should be under prohibition. I am in consumate Accord with given statement.this essay will explicate my point of view.",
        "To commence with some factors which exhibit it as poor approac,the predominant one is, every living organism has equall right to live on Earth whether it's human beings, animals or other mamels and blood shedding games are the most ubiquitous menance for all animal species which are getting extinct because of this cruel practice.moreover, animals are also having feelings and they feel uncontrollable pain while fighting for their lives in these bullfighting or cockfighting games. This inhuman act should be banned for the smooth running of the nature, As a result.",
        "Some might argue that human is superior as comparison with animals and fighting of animals in games provide them entertainment, simultaneously,for many who host these shows of blood shedding games,is the main source of earning but I, however still assert that these actions towards animals show cruelty as that of so called superiority owing to this life of endangered species is also on the verge of extinction for example,tiger, Amos,zebra so many .it is,therefore to eradicate this problems these adventurous games which are the sign of uncivilized society and human domination,must be prohibited for the sake of nature.",
        "",
        "As per aforementioned information,it can be reitrated that government should putforth same preduit rules and regulations to muzzle these blood oozing games which are making the Human being aggressive and disgusting.i would like to suggest that government should keep an eagle eye on illegal supplies of animals in every zoos so that animals can be perserved"
