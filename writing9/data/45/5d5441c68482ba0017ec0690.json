        "It is a debated issue at what level of education kids should commence learning another language other than their native language. Some say that teaching of foreign language should start in high school. While others hold that it should begin earlier, that is, in the elementary school. This essay seeks to weigh the pros and cons.",
        "At a much tender age, children learn fast and this is also attributed to learning of new languages, this is because their brains are like clean slates. To clarify, a Language expert in Harvard School of Linguistics suggest that children from 5 to 11 years can learn upto 5 foreign languages at a time. Therefore, it is essential to begin teaching elementary students Foreign language rather than wait until high school.",
        "On the downside,Some people attributes maurity to learning a foreign language.  As children grow, they appreciate Foreign Language courses. For instance, in my primary school days I disliked French classes. Last year, I visited Paris and wished I could turn back the hands of time to bring back the knowledge I missed during those years. So, learning foreign languages that early might be regarded as a waste of time and resources.",
        "",
        "Some Educationists believe that High school students are mentally ready and more enhanced to take Foreign Language courses. A relevant study shows that a number of teenagers show interest and enthusiasm in learning a new languages. Secondly, most of them devote their time to source for material that will improve their learning pace. Finally, so many secondary schools engage their students in exchange programs. For example, A popular high school in Nigeria takes its grade 9 students to Togo yearly to enhance their French communication skill. As a result, higher performance is expected of at middle school. The downside of learning foreign language at high school  may be that students are busy studying more relevant subjects like sciences and arts classes and may not see Language classes as necessary as the other subjects.",
        "In conclusion, although it is quite necessary to start teaching children foreign language at elementary school, there are more advantages of learning Foreign language in Middle school."
