        "In this 21st century of civilization, overweight is the main cause of serious health issues such as obesity, and increasing number of people are at risk daily. In this essay, I will explore the main cause associated with this, and implore the best solution to tackle this problem.",
        "The foremost factor that result in growth in excessive weight is convenient foods which are mostly junks. In other words, convenient foods such as pizzas, most fast food meals, sweetened carbonated drinks, to a name just a few, are only rich in calories from sugar or fat, but they have little dietary fibre, protein, vitamins and minerals. These are commonly consumed by people because they are easily accessible. As a result, there is always a drastic increase in weight. For instance, a recently study by Weight Management Agency of Nigeria, in 2018, shows that 80% of people who eat mostly junks are obese, as a result of excessive weight gained from calories.",
        "However, the most practical solution to this problem is a government-sponsored awareness campaign. An effective advertising campaign could warn of the dangers of being overweight, and hopefully, raise awareness amongst the public. For instance, Nigerian government usually run a TV programme weekly to create awareness about dangers of excess of weight gain leading to obesity which is a life threatening disease. Consequently, citizens have been lobbied to know the benefits of staying healthy from eating well balanced diet.",
        "Conclusively, in most countries around the world, obesity has become a serious health problem because of drastic weight gain of people. If regular campaign through seminars, TV programmes can be taken seriously by the government, many lives will be saved from this deadly disease. Otherwise, many will due out of ignorance and careless lifestyle"
