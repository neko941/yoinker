        "Mankind has outpaced the technological advancement more than its expectations. In present scenario, if any work needs to be done then equipments are given more preference. Whilst, same household chores were done by family members earlier. There are merits outweighs the demerits of this trend.",
        "It is indeed a strange fact that with rise in use of machines, people are becoming more lethargic. Consequently, the population of obese people are surging day by day; the medical bills are increased. So, the people should join gym or have a schedule for physical activities. Moreover, the cost to purchase these devices are quite high. Many times one has to shell out more than he is earning. To add on, the service repair is also hidden charges that comes along with time span.",
        "On the other hand, the key significance for using any tool to do a job is time saved by an individual. This time saved will be fruitful when the person use it wisely and focus on doing other meaningful tasks that can help him growth in career. Moreover, the tussle to get work done from house keeper is also not there. To add on, these appliances never get ill and one need not to worry about odd situations.",
        "To recapitulate, there was time when everyone lives the same rut life. In contrast, now they can grow more and live life of their own after having these required instruments. However, the personal wellbeing should be also not ignored because with machines decrease in physical activity can cause health issues."
