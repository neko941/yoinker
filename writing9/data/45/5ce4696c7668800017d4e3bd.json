        "Nowadays, people still argue that the responsibility to teach children become  a good citizen is in charge of whether school or family.",
        "Some people think that parents have to be the ones who nurture and educate their children to be good individuals of society. Parents need to supervise their children at home, teach them good behaviors and guide them to do houseworks and other necessary things. They should help their children to create good habits and also the role model for them. Besides, children should be encouraged and punished properly by their father and mother to become better.",
        "However, some people think that school is more appropriate for learning to be a good citizen because children can be taught by qualified teachers with good education and training skills. The fact that there are a large number of parents do not know how to teach their sons and daughters and what is good for them, some of parents even be a bad role model for chilren to follow. Therefore, these parents relied all on school education  and they believe that teachers will teach their childen what is right or wrong, acceptable or not in society.",
        "In my opinion, we need both of these approaches to train our children become a good citizen for society. Parents and school should coordinate with each other to unify what and how to teach their children and try their best to well implement at home and at school to get the best result. That why parents\u2019 meetings on a regular basis are extremely important."
