        "Due to the rapid advancement in technology many supermarkets introduced",
        "online shopping for food. Many people prefer to buy food in supermarkets while other people go for online shopping. this essay will discuss why online shopping has its own benefits and why traditional food shopping is ultimately superior.",
        "To begin with, some people prefer to shop food in supermarkets because they have their own reasons. One particular reason is that food stores undergo a quality check regularly before deploying it to people so, people are choosing to buy food in supermarket. For example, if a product is fake or does not meet quality standards, they can sue them. Therefore, people choose buying food in physical stores.",
        "On the other hand, some people will go with online food because it has its own benefits. One of the major reason is that they can order food from home by using mobile phone or laptop. For instance, if someone is not interested in going out or busy with their own work they have this facility to shop from home with ease.Being able to shop online saves busy people the unnecessary hassle of having to visit a store.",
        "Finally, with the introduction to online food shopping, traditional routines are being challenged in many ways. Some people prefer going to buy food in supermarket while other people going with a new way that is online food shopping. In my opinion, visiting supermarket offers a better experience of food shopping."
