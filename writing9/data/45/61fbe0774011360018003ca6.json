        "In the last several years, the number of road accidents has significantly increased; some even included fatalities. This has led to a larger discussion  around the punishments for these offences and whether stricter punishments such as detention are effective or if there are other creative means to improving the condition.",
        "On one hand, many columnists have suggested a multi-day detention for driving offences causing injuries or fatalities. The belief is that fear can drive the underlying change that authorities seek. Additionally, other suggestions included suspension of driving licenses for first-time violators and cancellation of the same for repeat offenders.",
        "On the other hand, there are a large group of people who think that fear should not be the reason why drivers must behave. The notion is that the authorities must consider rehabilitation sessions that would inform first-time offenders of the consequences of not abiding by road safety rules. Additionally, fines, scaled according to the number of total violations, is a great tool to inhibit road safety. This would mean the more you violate the rules, the more expensive the fine.",
        "In my opinion, I feel like there should be a balance between the penalty pronounced. The imposition of punishment should depend on the severity of the action. The bigger the crime, the harder the penalty."
