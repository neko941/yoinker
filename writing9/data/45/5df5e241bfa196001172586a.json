        "Needless to say, globalisation has changed the lives of mankind over the past few years. It has not only opened up economy, but also drastically changed the living standard of people. Nowadays, people are free to move around the globe, which eventually influence the modern culture as before. Through this essay i will make an attempt to figure out certain positive developments related to the above mentioned standpoints.",
        "Of late, with the introduction of globalisation, the world economy opened, which found beneficial for many people to move around. Today, we can reside in any part of the world by successfully completing the immigration procedures. Therefore, people can explore and get an opportunity to experiance the world culture. For example, the dressing style of indian people was greatley inspired amd influenced by the British colonials. Even today in twenty first century, indians are following the same culture in dressing. Thus, British people became the pioneers to indians for adopting the western culture.",
        "Secondly, today's world is a mixed up economy. Irrespective of their cast, sex, religion, people live togethet as mere human beings. All the diverse cultures evolved not to seperate people but to integrate all the folks. For example, today we can see people from different countries, cultures living together in a same place peacefully. These people live in harmony by sharing their own cultures with others. Thereby, they get an opportunity to mingle with others and a chance to study a lot about their fellow companions.",
        "However,there are certain banes associated with sharing of cultures. The perspectives of different people plays a vital role which makes this phenomenon good or bad. For example, it is a custom of western culture to treat their guest by hugging, irrsepective of the sex, but hugging opposite sex in public is a nuisence for people in india. They welcome guest by shaking hand or bh saying \"namasthe\".",
        "To recapitulate,i vehemently agree that, mixing up of culture around the world is a welcoming trend and inded makes man a better social animal."
