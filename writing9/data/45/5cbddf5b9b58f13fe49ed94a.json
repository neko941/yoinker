        "While the primary purpose of a image acts a supportive character of a news report, it is thought by some people that pictures are now often used as a strong technique than a thousand words by the channels of media. I do accord on with the idea that visuals connect more sharply with the audience than just a pack of words, especially in terms of interpreting in a simpler way and using universally.",
        "An argument in favor of using as a medium for everyone is that mass people regardless of the age, sex, religion, and so on can perceive a picture soon enough than a full-fledged story. Consequently, as there is no such universal language than just a image, consisting more information demonstrates anything but a luxury. This can be seen by the growing number of people who like to scroll more for images than statuses or wordy updates in South Asia.",
        "There is, however, another way possible way of defining the effectiveness for visuals is that less time is required whereas words in news make us to read or listen for a longer period. In addition, relying on images, which give birth to instant impression, becomes more frequent not only for televisions or newspapers but also for individuals. According to recent study, restaurants in Europe who own menus with picture grab 30% more orders than those who don't.",
        "All the things considered, I am inclined to restate that since people across boundaries have grasped the gist of a picture in a glance from the very beginning of human civilization, visualized news was just a matter of time for happening in real."
