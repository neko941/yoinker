        "Nowadays, computers have become an indispensable machine. Computers are used in many fields; for instance, educational system and business. On the other hand, there are negatives, but not compare to the major positives. In the following passages, we will show these positives and negative.",
        "",
        "The foremost benefit of using computers is in the educational field; computer helps students to interact with lessons through video and audio aids. As we see at the current time, all universities and schools have suspended, therefore many educational centers resort to distance learning. Without computers, it would not be possible. In addition, we may see companies cannot be run in the absence of computers, because of the huge database, which is stored in these machines. Computers are a vital part of companies; they connect the whole staff of the company. For all of these benefits, we cannot imagine our life without computers.",
        "Drawbacks of computer are not many as its benefits, but unfortunately, it is harmful. For example, in a survey, it was reported that 26% of learners and computer users were afflicted with vision problems caused due to the long watching. Many students waste their time on computers and they do not have the ability to makes use of it. Therefore, parents should teach their children the right way to use it. From all the above, we can conclude that we should take precautions while using computers or electronics in general for our health.",
        "In closing, computers are blessing when we use it well, but when we misuse of it, it become a curse."
