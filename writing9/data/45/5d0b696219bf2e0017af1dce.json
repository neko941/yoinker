        "Weddings are one of the auspicious occasions in anyone\u2019s life. However, it has been observed that today\u2019s generation is spending insane amount of money on their marriages in contrast to earlier times. People usually celebrate different ceremonies to make this day memorable. In the upcoming paragraphs, the reasons for this trend will be analyzed and why it can be seen as harmful to the society.",
        "There are myriad of reasons, First and foremost, people often consider expensive marriages as a status symbol and spend huge amount of money by inviting unnecessary guests along with buying costly clothes and jewelry. For instance, those who want to show their community that they are very well connected socially, would consider this an opportunity and would invite as many as political figures as they can. Second, development of media influences people\u2019s perception of how a wedding should be conducted. Idea of fairytale style marriages heighten our sensation and lust for mind blowing nuptials.",
        "Though, this growing trend has huge negative implication on our society. Firstly the middle class which constitute 80 percentage of total population is the prey of this craze due to demonstration effect. For example, in a bank survey it was found that loan for nuptials has triggered to 65percent from 30 percent compared to past years. Secondly, matrimonial ceremonies are losing their true meaning and importance which is to unite people in love. Instead become obsessed with the vanity of the ceremony.",
        "In the nutshell, I would like to pen down by saying that to maintain their stigma and showoff to their community are the prime causes for this big fat weddings. However, it does not come without the price of financial worries for the future."
