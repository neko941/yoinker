        "It is a popular belief that, residing in a country where speaking a different language is required can pose serious social, and practical challenges. I completely agree with this assertion, and will be discussed below.",
        "The inability to speak a language, which is essential for effective communication in a foreign country, would make it difficult to socialize with people easily. Making friends, which is very important in every society, becomes very difficult for foreign residents due to the language barrier. Consequently, such individuals become lonely, and they tend to live a life of boredom. For example, it was recently revealed by the department of social sciences of the university of Lagos that, most foreign students suffer depression because they find it difficult to socialize with other students. Hence, depression sets in with time. Overall, language barrier makes it very difficult to effectively socialize with people. Furthermore, the chance of securing a good job is a really reduced due to language differences. Effective communiction is very vital in any work place; hence companies tend to employ people that speak the local dialect. Such a scenario makes it almost impossible for a foreigner to get a dream job unless the language is learnt. A case in point is the city of Quebec in Canada, where the possibility of getting a good job depends on the ability to speak French. A consequence of this is that, the rate of unemployment increases if there are lots of foreign residents in that society. In conclusion, because language is very important tool for effective communicaton, residing in a country where a foreign language is required presents both social and practical challenges. Although, some people are of a different opinion, strongly agree with this view as it could lead to a life of loneliness as well as increased unemployment rate"
