        "People consume lots of ready food rather than they did many years ago. This is because they tent to spend more time at work, opposed to the past. This essay will suggest that causing many serious diseases impacts significantly on this this phenomenon.",
        "It can be seen obviously that people in modern society are busier than they used to be in the past because they prefer working longer hours. Even somebody spends 12 hours at their office to accomplish their work. As a result, people will be fatigued and they don\u2019t have mood to cook anymore. They always opt to eat ready foods from the restaurants or food courts. In fact, my eating habit is the prime example for this case. I like buying processed food to eat for lunch and dinner so that I can save more time to rest after  work.",
        "On the other hand, this phenomenon is the reason to cause many critical sicknesses such as blood pressure, obesity, diabetes and so on. People cannot ensure that processed foods contains healthy ingredients instead of high calories. Even some of them are tough to digest and prevent from metabolism. For example, there are many children and adults in Dubai having obesity and diabetes because they consume instant foods frequently such as fried chicken, chips in their meals.",
        "To conlude this essay consuming processed food has been prioritsed in this modern world. More and more people are eating them because they are so busy to work longer hours. However the effect of this habit can be the resource of many serious diseases to people\u2019s wellness."
