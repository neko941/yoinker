        "Leaving a birthplace can be a nightmare for some individuals while they prefer to live near the place they grew up. It is a place where they built up their connections which prevents them to cut their ties. However, this belief comes with advantages and disadvantages which will be discussed in this essay.",
        "There is a variety of reason which keeps the citizens in their hometown. For instance, their family ties and friends or even the connections that they made throughout their lives. Hence, this allows them to be in their comfort zone, and they believe it is impossible to reconstruct everything from scratch.",
        "On the one hand, at some point, it is beneficial to be near their birthplace. For example, their families can support them to develop a business as well as their social relationships might give them job opportunities which a stranger might not meet in the city. As a result, moving toward success would be a more straightforward path for them.",
        "On the other hand, such individuals could face some disadvantages throughout their lives. The people who prefer not to go beyond the border of their cities would limit themselves to the opportunities within the town. For example, they might lose a chance to get a better job position or meet someone who can change their lives. Consequently, sometimes the benefits may not outweigh the drawbacks.",
        "In conclusion, although staying in our hometown might bring us more satisfaction and safety due to our relationships, it prevents us to seek various chances in other lands. Hence, people should consider both sides to have a successful life and career."
