        "In today's world, an increasing number of people think that a large proportion of government funds should be invested in teaching science-related, to achieve what is termed economic development. In my opinion, although science plays a large role, other subjects hold their merits and therefore, deserve equal government investment and funding.",
        "On the one hand, public funding in science education subjects is important in driving the development of a country in many areas, such as technology and medicine. For example, developed countries such as Japan have emphasised the science education of their citizens. This strong focus has led to scientific research achievement, knowledge fosters innovation, and increases productivity, which directly contributes to nations' economic development. Therefore, investment in teaching science is an indispensable part of a country's economic progress.",
        "On the other hand, this does not mean that only science subjects are important. Other subjects like art, literature, and history play a vital part in the development of nations. For instance, those who do not have a knack for calculating or using formulas in science subjects, still have their own strength in subjects related to social subjects. These subjects make people aware of their history and culture. They are also a factor in the development of long experienced historical countries so that these countries become the most popular tourist destinations. After that, no nation can progress only on the wing of science.",
        "In conclusion, although science subjects have an impact on the development and progress of one's nation, I totally agree government should balance in investing both science and other subjects."
