        "These days with increasing urban populations, there are major problems with congestion and not only the price, but also availability of accommodation in large cities of the world. It seems that one possible solution could be to relocate large companies and factories as well as their respective employees out of these urban areas and into more rural ones. I strongly agree that this would have a positive effect in making cities more livable.",
        "To begin with, the traffic problem in cities doesn\u2019t only exist from commuting employees, but also the general public travelling around the city. While this may be a fact, if the number of workers' vehicles is reduced on city streets, a large percentage of traffic will obviously decline in rush hours. For example, peak hour of the traffic is undoubtedly made up largely of staff from companies going to and from home.",
        "Secondly, in regards to housing problems, populations will always continue to grow in cities and therefore inadvertently decrease the number of cheap and available apartments. This is certainly obvious, however, a large proportion of these apartments are occupied by employees of large firms and their families. If this workforce is relocated to housing estates in the country, city apartment blocks will fall in price and certainly increase in availability.",
        "In conclusion, by relocating workers to rural areas to work and reside, heavy traffic conditions and lack of adequate accommodation in city centres will obviously change for the better. As far as I\u2019m concerned, I agree that the government should enforce such a law in order to increase our standard of living in our hectic city life."
