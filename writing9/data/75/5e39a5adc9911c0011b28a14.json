        "There is no doubt that the gap between wealthy and poor's earnings is significant. While some people feel that this gap should be reduced in order to provide societies with the happier life, others do not believe that this would help. This essay will discuss why an income should be distributed more evenly and provide evidence for this.",
        "To begin with, some might argue, that money cannot make an individual any happier and his happiness absolutely relies on an individual himself rather his material condition. This is because, the argument goes, there are the internal factors for one's wellbeing such as a passion for life and the ability to accept the current situation. For instance, even the wealthiest of this world might suffer from the deep depression despite their prosperity. Therefore, it is claimed that it is by no means the best remedy for societal wellbeing.",
        "Conversely, this practice should work due to the number of reasons, not least among them are basic life needs. An individual is less likely to be delightful, if he has to struggle to provide himself with a home, groceries or an education and does not have a stable disposable income to entertain himself. To illustrate, recent studies have shown that there is a higher rate of unhappiness among less wealthy than among those who have a high income. Thus, decreasing the difference between these two demographics should increase the overall wellbeing.",
        "To conclude, the big difference between rich and poor is evident, and, although, some people do not believe that reducing this would contribute to a happier society, in my opinion, it is the best way to do so, since more people will have the conditions for a better life. By doing this, we can ensure that the future societies will not live in poverty while the rich live to the fullest."
