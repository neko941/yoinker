        "It is claimed that in a few nations, the overall physical fitness of the people and their average body weight has been changed. In my opinion, it is mainly due to our sedentary lifestyle and less sports involvement. Thus, we need to develop a strategy to resolve this situation.",
        "Firstly, I believe, the way we lead our life in current times are the main reason for the increased weight related  issues. In other words, people are engaged in work which require no or less physical activity which results in accumulation of fats in the muscles resulting in weight gain. For instance, nowadays most people tend to choose white collar jobs which mostly involve working with computers and softwares, where they had to sit ideally for more than six hours for a day. Secondly, the recreational activities had been decreased in recent times. In the past, people used to engage themselves in sports like cricket and various other games. This has been changed in the current scenario, public opt for more relaxing ways to spend their time. Even if they choose to play, they often go for indoor games which does not require much of the physical work effort. For example, play stations and other video games are popular among young generations.",
        "One way to solve this problem is to understand our style of living and try to include work which involves our body. In simple words, we need to realize the drawbacks of our current lifestyle and use necessary measures to rectify it. Although it is not practical to change our job, we could  use some workout regime to follow to keep ourselves fit. Another point to consider is to promote sports at office like team hiking, or running as a group on weekends. For example, so many IT companies have facilitated intra marathon competitions on National Health day to make awareness among their employees.",
        "To conclude, In my view, adhering to an active lifestyle is one major step to tackle health related problems."
