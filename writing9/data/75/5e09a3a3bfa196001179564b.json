        "Some consider raising fuel prices as the most effective method to resolve global environmental issues. In my opinion, I disagree with this argument as it has the potential to disrupt world economy and global peace severely.",
        "To begin with, transportation, industrial production, and even energy generation sectors run their operations on fuel. If the fuel prices are increased, it raises the prices of the products and services of these sectors as well. As a result, this affects the general public ability to afford basic products and services which is known as inflation. Inflation does not only affects the households it also slows down the overall growth of the economy. For instance, in developing countries, it is often observed that whenever the fuel prices jump up, the economic growth jumps down.",
        "Moreover, increasing the fuel cost no only cause inflation, it can promote instability as well. When people are unable to afford the basic necessities, they get frustrated. This leads to protest and sometimes these protests are converted into violent demonstrations. This not only results in the loss of public property, but also human lives. For example, in recent days, a protest against oil prices increase in Iran spread across the country which compelled the authorities to contain it by force and restricting mobile and internet services in the affected areas.",
        "In conclusion, while other people\u2019s opinion may vary, in my opinion, without any alternative options for fuel, increasing the fuel prices is not the solution to the global environmental issues but a trigger to affect the world economy and global peace and stability."
