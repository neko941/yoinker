        "I feel the need to bring your attention to a serious matter we are facing these days. My name is Sara Khan, and I am the resident of Sector I-14, Islamabad. As you know, the fruit market is located in the vicinity of this sector, which produces a huge amount of leftover of rotten material. The municipal workers usually visit regularly for waste collection, but now it has been one week since we have not seen any garbage collectors in our area.",
        "What is more, our community is suffering from several diseases because of the production of excessive flies. Since the rotten rubbish serves as an appropriate medium for the growth of flies, which transmit bacteria from garbage to human beings. Many cases of cholera and dysentery have been reported in my neighbors within one week.",
        "I would like to request you kindly send your workforce in our area as early as possible for waste management. Moreover, initiate a cleaning campaign, and fumigation of the market and our houses to kill pathogens. Rest assure that this negligence would not happen in the future.",
