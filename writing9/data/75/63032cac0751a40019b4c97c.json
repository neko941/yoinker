        "I am writing this letter in reference to drawing your attention to the garbage collection issue which we have been facing for almost two weeks. I am a resident of Avenue 23, there are two garbage bins are located at both ends of the road. Usually, the municipality truck used to come and pick up the bins on daily basis but due to road repair work  going on at the entrance of Avenue 23, this big truck is not able to access the area.",
        "The situation is getting worse day by day because the bins are full and overflowing. Many nearby houses\u2019 residents are complaining about the smell which is coming out of the rotten trash. Also, this has created an unhygienic condition for the local people and especially for the children whose playground is closed to one of the bins.",
        "The truck  allocated for this area is quite big in size and due to narrow access, it is unable to pass the construction area to approach garbage bins. However, this can be solved if you could arrange a smaller vehicle.  Also, these can be resolved if you send some labour to carry these garbage bins outside and from there pick up truck can take care of them.",
        "I hope you would ack immediately so tackle with current circumstances.",
        "Yours faithfully,",
