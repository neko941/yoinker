        "Some people believe that the extinction of certain species of plants and animals is the major environmental issues, while others argue that there would be more vital issues threatening our environment/ natural habitat. I entirely support the latter view and think that climate change and earth contamination are the two other detrimental problems that deserve our attention.",
        "On the one hand, losing the richness, evenness, and compositions of certain plants and animal species will have many adverse consequences to our surroundings. Firstly, there is considerable evidence that ecosystem functioning such as (nutrient cycle and productivity) and its stability will be affected. The only loss of one type of rare breed can adversely influence other creatures' food chain. Secondly, biodiversity decline may also diminish human well-being by decreasing the services that the ecosystem provides for people. Changes in the ecosystem pose an immediate danger to food security for mankind. So, since the global extinction has been proven to be an irreversible issue, aid rescuing flora and fauna should be encouraged through preserving practices, including establishing more ecological zones, breeding programs.",
        "On the other hand, climate change especially global warming and waste disposal into the environment are the two most serious environmental problems. The evidence of the sea-level rise and associated flooding with loss of homes and lands are becoming frequent. In this way, both humans and other living creature's habitat will be destroyed. Secondly, by the spread of human habitation, urbanization, and industrial sectors more waste has been discarded into the environment. The chemical emissions from factories pollute rivers, harm sea life which can hurt people's health as well. Moreover, People by discarding plastic bags are spoiling the natural beauty spots which destroy the tourism industry, and consequently, the economic growth will be decreased. In this way, birds and marine animals can die through being trapped or caught up in plastic bags or ropes. If the major contributors to climate change/emergency will not control, there would be little hope of future life.",
        "In conclusion, although the loss of endangered species both flora and fauna is a great regret, I believe that if climate change and damage from excessive plastic waste continue, there will be less habitable land, food for everyone including plants and animals which is devastating."
