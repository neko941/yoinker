        "One of the most conspicuous trends of today,s world is the colossal upsurge in the number of people who believe that every year several languages die out while  others argue that this is life will be  easier with fewer languages. Here, in this essay, I will articulate my opinion related to this issue in the forthcoming paragraphs.",
        "There is a widespread worry that this will only lead to a  myriad of concerns,s in the life of  human beings. Firstly, languages are the roots of culture and traditions in many ways and if other all tongues will disappear then the coming generation never comes to know that they had a variety of speech. Moreover, the eldest people are very comfy to speak their authentic lang so there will be hard for them to communicate or deliver their messages to others. For example, there is a unity in the variety so if the language will be less then cultures and customs will be extinct.",
        "On the other side, if there will be only a few dialogues will be in the world then it will be easier to get communicate all around the world in  limited speech. Furthermore, all the expenses  spent on the different tongues will be compacted if there are only the lingo will be known.",
        "For instance, English is an international language so if everyone will easily speak and understand this then it will be more beneficial to the different sectors to get more close to each other. As research has been deducted in Japan that more tongues are beneficial in all the ways in the whole earth to communicate easily in the business or any kind of expertise.",
        "In the conclusion, the view of the arguments outlined above, one can conclude that dialogues  are a barrier to  communication so as it will be more or less, there will be helpful in many ways."
