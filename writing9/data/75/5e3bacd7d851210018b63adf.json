        "It is widely thought that the main component of fortune is a good life. That is to say, individuals should have a shelter under their head, accomplish their purposes and receive a good treatment in order to consider themselves as a blessed person. Therefore, many wealthy countries\u2019 citizens are happier than the people who are living in poor countries. A good illustration of this is Scandinavian countries. According to World Happiness Report, these countries\u2019 citizens are the happiest nation in the world.",
        "On the other hand, others feel that each individual can live a happy life, if they satisfy with their current situation and wealth. Therefore, many poop people consider themselves as a delighted person, because they believe that there are a plethora of other things instead of convenient life, which can bring happiness to the people. For example, family, friends and relatives can make individuals joyful. In addition, a lot of poor people are not more stressful than wealthy people. In other words, rich people can earn some illness, when they pay much attention to double their money.",
