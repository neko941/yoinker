        "Nowadays, since we are now living in the modern world using networking sites such as Facebook, Twitter and other platforms is not a big deal. There is an  argument that those give a negative impact on one's life and our society. In this essay, the reasons for those will be mentioned and discussed.",
        "Firstly, too much time we spend on those sites is not good for our health. It is cause depression due to what we see and read on Facebook. Furthermore, toxic netizen is rampant on the said site. This can cause mental health issues among us. Secondly, another reason is due to fake news. We really do not know between facts and fakes. For example, they can easily edit pictures and make them real. As a result, we will be confused about the information that was posted or published. However, I believe this can be avoided. All we have to do is to be responsible and think first before we click and believe.",
        "Though, those social sites give us knowledge and information around the world. We can now easily access and re-watch that news to make us updated. However, we can use newspapers as substitutes as we use to 20 years ago.",
        "In conclusion, I would like to say that, those social sites mentioned above are helpful in some aspects, however, in my opinion, I rather not  be updated through that site. Let us start with the basics without those. We do not need those toxic people in our life. Peaceful life is better than toxic life."
