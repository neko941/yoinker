As you know, the customer was extremely disappointed with our previous delivery as their expectation regarding quality and the timeline of the release was too high. To meet their requirement, I had been working consecutively for 3 weeks even on the weekends. Now, considering the number of hours I spent in office last month, I have decided to take a short break from work.",
