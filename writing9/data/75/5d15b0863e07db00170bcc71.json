        "It is certainly true that an increasing number of cities in the world are experiencing traffic jams and this makes it tough for people to get to their destinations. In my opinion, this situation could have been caused by the fact that people are seeking a better quality of life in terms of work and facilities in the urban areas. I would suggest that the government should allow some companies to relocate to the regional areas to reduce the traffic in town.",
        "There are several reasons why heavy traffic is found in many metropolis areas. Firstly, many people travel to towns because there are better amenities - such as schools and hospitals - that provide better services which are mostly lacking in the rural areas. For example, most secondary and tertiary care hospitals in developing countries are located in the cities. As a result, many parents would rather travel there with their children to receive expert care. Secondly, there are a lot of employment opportunities that can attract young people to frequently move to towns. For instance, there is always heavy traffic in Lagos mainland in Nigeria, as many workers from the suburbs have to drive down to their offices every morning. For these reasons, daily travellers contribute to traffic congestion in those areas.",
        "However, the government can solve these issues by making jobs and better facilities available in the local communities. This means that they might have to make policies that will encourage industries to move to local communities. For example, the villages in China became developed after the Chinese banks offered loans to companies to build the infrastructures in those areas. Consequently, this strategy provided more jobs to the people, and the revenue was used to improve the structures there.",
        "In conclusion, the gridlock in the metropolitan areas is attributed to the large number of people that are migrating there to work and to patronize high quality facilities. Therefore, the government would have to improve the situation by providing better jobs and services such as medical care in the rural areas."
