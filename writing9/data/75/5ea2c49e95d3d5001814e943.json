        "Nowadays, in most countries, parents have the opportunity to send their children either to single \u2013sex  or coeducational schools, however, it is considered by some that sending children to single \u2013sex school  will have drawbacks in the future. In my opinion, I believe that studying in single-sex school does not have any effect on a child\u2019s future. Moreover,  it enhances gender specific skills and builds their confidence  which is essential  later in life.",
        "Firstly, studying particularly in same sex school boosts gender specific skills.These skills are specific to the child\u2019s gender  for instance, in girls' schools they are more keen to learn  specific skills such as crafting, drawing, whereas in boys' schools, boys will be more interested in sports, such as swimming, cricket. Theses skills depend on sex specific interests as well as their physical capacities. In addition, learning these skills in schools specifically for girls and boys will prepare for competition within their own sex. Some children can take these skills as profession later in their lives.",
        "Furthermore, same sex schools' boosts tenacity in children. As there  are differences in the physical abilities between boys and girls, so  judging them in competition of physical abilities will always lead boys towards winning, the same can be the case with girls as they mature  faster than boys so their competition in class will lead girls. Thus, they can lose their confidence. Equality is important for morale as it inculcates fare standards of competition.Hence, single sex- schools can boost their spirits in the long run.",
        "In conclusion,  single \u2013sex schools does not hinder child\u2019s growth in future, Furthermore enhances their confidences and skills."
