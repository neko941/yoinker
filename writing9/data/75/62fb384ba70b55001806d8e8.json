        "Nowadays, it is becoming increasingly common that more people are likely to think that the authority should spend more money on public services, instead of wasting money on the arts. From my perspective, this tendency is totally to disagree with the notion of the matter investing in the community.",
        "First of all, it is an indisputable fact that  art contributes a major advantage to the economy. To begin ,  many films, music videos, live shows and performance stages are released every year which brought a large of income for investors and also for the income of a nation. For example, the USA, the richest country and also famous for the music and film industries, such as Hollywood which bring  America many benefits in every view. For example, the Avengers which movies have the highest profit in  the world, as well as on the list of top 100 grossing films in the world that 80-90% is the USA. In addition, many albums and CDs music are sold out on the planet that almost in America, by selling albums, CDs and tickets show that make many famous singers get wealth such as Taylor Swift, Justin Bieber and Micheal Jackson. Moreover,  its convenience is clearly to be seen that the artistic field contributes a huge role in the development of America.",
        "On the other hand, this constantly causes some drawbacks such as keeping, saving and advertising national identities. Many movies about the historical era of the country  make people know more about their forefather\u2019s life in the past and as well as advertise with other countries about their traditions and culture. Take a good example of it is Korea, in the previous time Korea was a developing country, when time  drama and the music industry  make Korea progress more quickly and become one of the richest countries in the world. Remind  South Korea  makes crowd remember  Kpop, K-drama, BTS and Blackpink. Their phenomenon is a major waive for Korea, that makes the public know more about Korea and also advertises their foods, culture and lifestyle. After the completion of the Artistic field, the number of people learning the Korean language rose substantially. BTS and Blackpink, which are the faces of Samsung,   development of them led to the evolution of Samsung cooperation.",
        "In conclusion, the matter fund money on public facilities or art forms has its pros and cons. In my opinion, I still think that there are more advantages if we know and realize how to control what we do in the artistic field. Additionally, we cannot deny the economic contribution of the arts and their role in preserving  cultural identity."
