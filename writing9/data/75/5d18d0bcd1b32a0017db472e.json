Others, by contrast, are worried that we are not prepared for a world in which computers are more intelligent than humans. Discuss both of these views and give your own opinion.",

        "People have different views on the use of artificial intelligence. While some people consider AI as a huge threat, I believe that AI could make a great contribution to society.",
        "The main reason why people worry about the situation that AI developments may surpass human intelligence is that the human workforce would be replaced by AI computers, especially in some simple repeatable tasks such as packing and storage. Some companies, for example, Amazon and Google have used this kind of AI equipment for years, and many workers have been laid off, and end up in a miserable situation. If the unemployment rate continues to go up, problems related to poverty and crime is certainly becoming an unstable bomb in society. To avoid this happening, supporters who are against AI argue that we should stop developing this technology.",
        "In spite of the risks mentioned above, I believe that AI could add many benefits to human society and bring people up to another level of life experience. First of all, these AI machines can do many tasks that humans cannot do or prefer not to do. Moreover, AI technology can act as extended eyes for humans, helping humans to see beyond boundaries. To illustrate this, an AI technology, which is created and programmed by IBM, has been used for mineral exploration in the mining industry. By introducing AI technology in this field, the efficiency and productivity of mining have improved, and the incidence of injury from works has certainly decreased.",
        "In conclusion, although some people argue that AI machines could have negative consequences, in my view, advancements in AI technology could be a blessing to human society."
