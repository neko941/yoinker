        "Nowadays, advertising is an integral part of marketing so companies allocate a sizeable amount of money to producing effective commercials in order to absorb customers\u2019 attention. However, People have different views about the efficiency of ads. There are some who argue that adverting is very ordinary and they do not care about it. While others, myself included, insist that it is a powerful tool in convincing community members to buy certain products. In this essay, both viewpoints will be discussed.",
        "On the one hand, many commentators claim that persuading individuals with ads is not an effective way to increase customers. Firstly, most shoppers find that really boring due to the fact that it is broadcasted frequently on different social media such as television. Consequently, people often change the TV channel when ads begin. Secondly, most clients have a negative attitude to advertising because they think advertisers want to promote their sales without considering consumers\u2019 real needs. From their standpoints, they intend to mislead them with catchy slogans and flashy products so as to fulfil producers\u2019 goals. for instance, Introducing new products for preventing hair loss is of no credit now owing to previous poor quality products in this field.",
        "On the other hand, there are those who subscribe to the view that advertising is a strong instrument in the marketing world. They maintain that advertisements help people have a reasonable choice. As they provide useful information about the quality and price of commodities and services which is helpful in decision making. It means that shoppers can choose their desired products or services by watching different ads and comparing them. Furthermore, adverting makes markets more competitive. More precisely, it can decrease the price levels and increase households\u2019 welfare.",
        "In conclusion, looking at views about advertising as a tool of marketing which is based on the reasons mentioned above reveals that although some people try to get away from advertisements in order to make their own decision without any external interference, I personally believe that ads are an efficient means by which people can find their potential needs. Family members should be aware of the merits and drawbacks of commercials to make the best purchases."
