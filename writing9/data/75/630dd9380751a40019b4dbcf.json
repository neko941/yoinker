        "In schools, children often have a hard time concentrating on their studies because they are distracted by some other factors. In order to address this problem, there are a few things they and their school can work on.",
        "There are several reasons for this situation. The main one is that many teenagers are not mature enough to understand the importance of studying. Without a certain goal, they would not be as persevering as adults. For example, they might stop preparing for the upcoming test and spend their time on an online game. Another reason is that young students are easily affected by their classmates. If one student keeps making noises in the class, it would be almost impossible for other students to stay focused on what the teacher says.",
        "To solve the problems, the teachers must make effort. The first thing they can do is to emphasize the significance of studying. They should communicate with the students, get to know what dreams each of them has, and explain how studying can help them realize their dreams. In addition, the schools should also set up some regulations to keep the children disciplined. For instance, talking during classes might be forbidden in some schools.",
        "In conclusion, many students are unable to stay focused due to various reasons. However, this problem should be solved by not only the students themselves but also the teachers in the schools. With the help of others, the overall study performance of the young generation will hopefully be improved."
