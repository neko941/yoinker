        "Tourist and scientist collaboration in migration to ancient natural environments such as south pole is a recent development, which facilitates scientific research and results, by minimising time spent in search of a quest. However, this collaboration could have its downside, as the tourists could be highly distracted by other artefact which are not of scientific importance. As a result, academic research parties and tourist travelling together to the remote environs has its benefits and disadvantages.",
        "",
        "The migration of both researchers and tourists to the remote natural environment has its benefit, which is time maximization, ultimately, speeds up research processes and results. Tourist are usually familiar with the geography of distance vicinity, hence, enables the academic researchers to locate their specific quest and other sites needed to be researched without perambulating. For instance, the geographical location of a tree from which medications for hemorrhagic fever was initially secured was first spotted by a tourist on their initial tour. This initial discovery by the tourist facilitated the research process of the scientist at a second trip involving both tourists and researchers. Ultimately, the merger of the travellers and researchers on a trip to ancient cities is advantageous, as it facilitates discovery and scientific procedures.",
        "",
        "On the other hand, the collaboration could be disastrous as travellers could be totally distracted by various artefacts and awesome sites during the course of this journey. For example, a tourist who travels with a scientist for the first time to a remote location, appreciates some awesome monuments and artefacts, thus, takes to photography ,forgetting the primary purpose of their journey. Then, the purpose of a scientific personnel and a traveller on a trip becomes futile.",
        "In conclusion, the collaboration of a scientific personnel and a tourist migrating through remote natural part of the world is quite beneficial, particularly for a tourist who is not easily distracted and loves research to some extent."
