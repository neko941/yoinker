        "There has been considerable debate on the efficacy of private lessons to that of group lessons. While both factions have their own merits and demerits, I personally find group learning superior. In this essay, I hope to elaborate on both points of view and conclude with my take on the subject.",
        "On one hand, those who lobby for one-on-one lessons, often list the learner\u2019s ability to work at their own pace as a key factor in their support for private classes. It is true that many a student may either fall behind or get bored because they understand the lessons too easily, in a classroom environment. A private tutor, however, can observe their student\u2019s progress and tailor lessons accordingly. For example, a private tutor might assess a student\u2019s superior mathematical skills and start out with advanced math at an earlier age or spend more time teaching basic linguistic concepts, depending on the student\u2019s unique needs, rather than their age.",
        "On the other hand, many believe that group lessons open up opportunities for collaboration both in as well as outside the classroom. Additionally, groups enable classroom debate. Both the students and teachers can exchange views and learn more from a plurality of perspectives. This is further exemplified in the project work that is commonplace in high schools and university classrooms. The rationale for assigning these projects is that students develop skills to work in a team by getting along with classmates, taking on responsibility for given tasks, learning to compromise, and managing different temperaments. For example, many schools today assign roles within teams, such as team leader, presenter, primary researcher, and so on. These collaborative projects can then be brought into a group lesson and debated.",
        "On considering both the arguments, I lean towards group lessons, as a superior way to foster learning as they better prepare an individual to function in society. While private classes do ensure additional attention, group classes ensure holistic learning."
