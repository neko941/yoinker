        "There are many who claim hosting the Olympics unproductively diverts money from more essential areas. In my opinion, despite these valid objections, there is still great value in the unifying impact of the Olympics.",
        "Critics argue there are urgent needs that should be prioritised over a sporting event. This applies to every nation but particularly developing ones. For example , the Olympics in Brazil in 2016 led to mass unrest and protests as locals felt too much money was being spent on the event and not enough on helping to alleviate worsening conditions among underprivileged segments of society. The government could have instead  improved the infrastructure used by millions daily, invested more in education, or built more hospitals. These allocations of the federal budget would not only serve an immediate purpose but also  have a longed  lasting effect than the Olympics.",
        "Nonetheless , most Olympic games are sponsored by developed nations and they occur very rarely which justifies their efforts to unify. The countries competing in the Olympics often have fraught international relationships and competition can counter-intuitively decrease tensions. Supporters may root against other countries at specific instances, such  as when watching a football match, but they are united in their love of sports and the shared viewing experience. This  has the subtle but powerful unconscious result of fostering greater empathy between diverse ethnic and national groups. When an individual roots for their country and their athletes, and sees other individuals partaking in the same ritual, they will realise that  association within a larger tribe is an essential, common human trait.",
        "In conclusion, despite the seemingly inefficient allocation of funds, the Olympics  are a mass, cooperative effort that has tremendous value. Therefore, countries should consider hosting the games a great honour."
