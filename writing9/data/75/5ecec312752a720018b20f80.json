        "The ways of delivering the information are contentious these days. While many people consider that the individuality of learning is the most effective way, the others are arguing that the education via groups is imperative. This essay will discuss both sides and will demonstrate that why the classroom groups are superior.",
        "The most advantageous factor of one-on-one learning is the efficiency. There is no time consuming, because of no side-talks and unnecessary conversations in these styles of learning, so time could be allocated in focusing on the topics. The delivery of data will be faster, which will give time for the students for absorbing information and even rehearse them ultimately. Moreover, these learners will be able to take the extra miles in capturing further topics, so there could achieve a tremendous progress in their curriculum. Nothing could elaborate this efficiency in learning process rather than the mega-research which has been undertaken by Aston University in 2013; A significant increase in completion of the singular learning modules rather than collaborative modules. Not only that, but the students in singular modules also were more agile to access more topics remarkably compared to the others. Therefore, the efficacy of one-on-one instructions is highly prominent due to time-saving nature of this method.",
        "On the other hand, learning in groups is possessing further values like Teamwork values. If a person study in a group, he would learn how to listen to the others' inputs and how to interact with a variety of ideas. The student is not just a receiver to some information, but he is an active participant in his classroom. This engagement in these kinds of discussion is vital to build up something bigger; like how to be team-player and to be co-operative. Many role models and eminent stars in different aspects of life have pointed out that their period in the schools and among their colleagues in classrooms and different activities had enabled them to be very effective members of their societies. Furthermore, Many sciences could not be learnt individually, as these sciences need special setups to be overwhelmed as well.  These setups could be projected or assignments for a group of people. For instance, Engineering science projects most likely need a team, and every member of this team have a certain task which should be done by this member to pass this project. Another example of these sciences that need collaborative learning is studying languages. Linguistics skills need a discussion and interactions between students and mentors to be developed properly. Thus, learning in groups is a mandatory method in different fields and stages, and ignoring this way of education could possibly have potential drawbacks to the whole educational system.",
        "In conclusion, the efficiency of individual learning is very considerable, but it could deprive the students from essential skills and even essential sciences that could learn from group-learning method. In my opinion, education throughout groups is high imperative and irreplaceable."
