        "Yes, It is true that television is a big part of the many people.However, satellite box is not a part of my  life philosophy. However, everything what interests me  is possible to find on the other electronic devices, because of that I don't see in today world TV as only digital media. Nowadays, many people can't imagine a world without TVs and they will present it with all pros rather cons. Although,  essay will present both sides.",
        "First of all, nobody can confirm what is good or bad for the other person and the same is with this essay theses that for me is good television. As an example, I can tell that I am not possessed TV set more than 10 years, what means that I can have different lifestyles. However, as a disadvantage of watching television screen is constantly pushing the ads. Unlikely, they are psychologically used as a manipulative objet to push people spend more on unnecessary things.",
        "Secondly,  sometimes is good to watch a relaxing movie, documentary or sport. The digital box is possible to shear on different devices, which allowing as better movement and possibilities to watching interesting programs wherever we are. Also at an advantage some TV providers, allowing to explicitly to make a custom list of our interests.",
        "As a conclusion, in some occasions, digital media can have a positive impact on me. Although, if we are using screen reasonable time, without addiction, is good to have a one. Unfortunately, I can confirm that every type of media more often has inappropriate or uninteresting program rather something interested and what can bring more advantage in my life."
