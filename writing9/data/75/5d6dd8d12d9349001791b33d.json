        "To begin, contributed support services have been of great benefits to the community as whole and imbibing it as an essential schedule in colleges will not be a bad idea, as it is undoubtedly a good contribution to the society, also for the development of the students. For example, pupils could decide to do nothing with their leisure hours, contrary to this, getting them involved in an unforced contributed social welfare of the public helps in developing and preparing them for the future, which was supported by the world health organization that youth who assist in support services are braced up to be good citizens who has a passion towards humanity and to also be firm enough to face the challenges of life that may arise in later life.",
