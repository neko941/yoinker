I believe you remember who I am. Today I am writing to express my interest in the position in the chain of your restaurants.",
        "You have mentioned about your chain of restaurants and you would like to expand it and use more information technology for you to manage them easily, especially the inventory and point of sales. As I told you during the flight, I am an IT expert, so I am particularly interested in the IT system development job which can help you in these two areas.",
        "I am a suitable person for you because I have 10 years of system development experience, specialising in point of sales systems for supermarkets and convenient stores. I believe my skills and experience can help you to set up and customise a robust point of sales system for your chain of restaurants. We can discuss this further face-to-face, and I am available anytime next week, you can call me by the contact information to decide a date. I look forward to hearing from you soon.",
        "Thank you very much.",
