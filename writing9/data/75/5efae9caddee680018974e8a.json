        "It is considered by many that the news published by newspapers should mention only the facts, rather than taking sides. In my opinion, whatever is published by the news agencies are true, however, highly opinionated, which is far from what they are supposedly expected to do.",
        "Firstly, even though the articles published can be depicted in different ways, nevertheless, I feel that the actual news are indeed not false. The effort to influence people is very well understood, but it is not only difficult to write a completely fabricated news, but also it is harmful for their reputation. For example, a few years back, a leading newspaper wrote about a political party, which included many details of their corrupted whereabouts and the detrimental effects of those on our society. Fortunately, there was a media coverage on this, focusing on how wrong the news was, resulting in untimely and forced closure of the aforementioned company. Hence, according to me, in today's world, it is not possible for anyone to publish hoax.",
        "Newspapers exist to make the general public aware about the current affairs happening worldwide. Additionally, they are not to reflect any emotion or opinion regarding the issues and subjects printed. For instance, even if the writer supports a particular political party, their writing is not supposed to mirror the idea. Therefore, sticking strictly to share knowledge about the activities taking place, is what should be done by all newspaper companies.",
        "In conclusion, letting the nation know about the latest incidents occurring around the world by staying neutral is the sole purpose of newspapers. Moreover, I believe that the truth published by them is heavily one sided, which should not be the case at all."
