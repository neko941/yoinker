        "Nowadays, plastic is one of the most extensively used materials all over the world. Despite having unlimited applications, it creates a multitude of problems for the environment. This issue is only growing so the government and all responsible citizens must come together and try to solve it. In this essay, I will talk about a few problems and give suitable solutions.",
        "It is a well-known fact that these Teflon-based polymers are non-biodegradable and yet it is used daily in the form of water bottles, food packets and carry bags. The real problem begins when it is thrown away irresponsibly because some of it lies on the road thereby making the surroundings dirty and unappealing and some also reach the ocean. Furthermore, it is eaten by animals like stray dogs, cats and cows or aquatic species which leads to death and will disturb the entire ecosystem. Moreover, it is burnt in some places where people are unaware of the ways to decompose plastic. As a result, it causes air pollution which further leads to life-threatening pulmonary diseases like lung cancer. This needs an immediate solution.",
        "Controlling this global issue is very important and it could be achieved with the help of the government and individuals together. One of the solutions could be that the government should impose a ban on plastics and only allow recyclable plastic such as thermoprop. Also, individuals must adapt and do their bit by using paper-based products to prevent environmental damage. For example, paper-based straws, glasses and bags. Similarly, environmentalists should teach the ways of composting Teflon materials instead of burning them. This could be used as land fillings to make roads as it will not only save our nature but also make the place cleaner.",
        "In conclusion, it is well understood that there are enough applications of plastic which are causing damage to our environment and this problem needs immediate attention. Nevertheless, the government and the citizens together can fight against it while working in sync. The key is to replace plastic with paper and discard it correctly."
