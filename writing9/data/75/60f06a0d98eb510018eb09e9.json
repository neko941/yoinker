        "A few individuals perceive that they are not guarded both at their homes and in communal places.The aim of this essay is to review the reasons behind this behaviour and suggest  ways to remove it.",
        "Perhaps, people feel unsafe due to the following reasons.Firstly, at home , people feel annoyed and scared when they are surrounded by individuals who are arrogant and freak too much. This way they feel devoid of love and affection and they crave  security.Secondly ,individuals get scared at the market places because of  thieves and criminals.Due to these persons, the public fear  losing their items or even being killed.For instance, as the public places are really crowded and no one can be easily balmed the criminals easily choose these places to commit a crime.Therefore people do not feel safe.All these sum up to build a scary feeling in a set of persons.",
        "Hopefully, there are viable solutions which can vanish the fears among the population.to start with, if Government can take care of the citizens both personally and publicly.That means  the ruling bodies should provide psychological assistance to these people who are depressed.Also, police force  and  CCTV cameras should be provided at the areas where there is constant public can remove the fears of all the citizens.For instance, people really feel safeguarded by seeing the policemen on the road.Thus their insecurities get vanished.",
        "To conclude, this essay has described the different causes for the given situation and suggested some of the viable solutions that can be implemented by the Government to remove all the insecurities of the people both at home and at communal places."
