        "With the rapid growth of technology, the world has come  a long . Newspapers and media become the main sources of  entertainment . We get numerous news across the globe through the newspaper . One of the most conspicuous trends of today's world is the colossal upsurge in the number of people who believe that in the near future printer peppers and magazines will be totally replaced by  online media platforms . The assertion seems pretty controversial across the globe. Without any doubt, society is divided into two groups as per  distinct mindsets of different folks . A fair amount of people believe that newspapers will be replaced by the internet while, others opine the statement. they claim the day is very far from when the news industry  will be totally controlled by the internet . whether to agree or not it's a tough-provoking question.as far as I can see it is more justified to disagree with the statement . In upcoming paragraphs, I will not only shed light on both sides but also elaborate on my point of view regarding  this issue .",
        "To embark, if we have a deep look at the issue we can find numerous reasons why people think newspapers and magazines will be replaced by the Internet. The first and foremost reason behind this is the internet is very easy to use . We can Know what happening across the globe with a single touch . We don't even have to leave our room to get news . Secondly , we can read News any time anywhere . There's a plethora of apps available on AppStore from where we can read News for free for example, Dailyhunt, ABP , Dailymotion etc . Additionally, we can enjoy live news from the Newsroom which attracts the children the most . They become more interested in the news when they can watch and listen to the news .last but not least we can enjoy live sports on our phones which is not possible in newspapers.",
        "On the paradoxical side, some communities claim that newspapers will be important for some reasons in future . Firstly, the old generation is very comfortable with the traditional reading style . They like to read paper news while enjoying their morning tea . Secondly , older peoples are not very well known with modern technology so they prefer to read newspapers and magazines. Furthermore , there are some rural areas still available where the internet can't reach so the only source of getting News is through the newspapers .lastly, Newspaper is very cheap and available everywhere . we can find newspapers easily in so many languages which is a huge benefit.",
        "In conclusion, both newspaper and the internet have their own Inevitability.as far as I can see it's more justified to disagree with the statement that newspapers will be totally replaced by the internet in future because I believe the day is still way far when everyone can use the internet ."
