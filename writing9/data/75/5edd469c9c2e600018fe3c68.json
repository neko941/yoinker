        "A person can be assessed on how well they organize\u2019.Some people often say that it is highly essential to maintain one\u2019s environment neat and organised.I completely agree with this perspective and this essay shall accommodate my view.",
        "To begin with, keeping things in order at home and workplace reduces stress and increases credibility. People often find it stressful to search for things in a home and for necessary files in an office when these places are full of clutter. For example, it was nerve-racking on many occasions when i could not find my car keys instantly. Furthermore, being organized improves one\u2019s image amongst colleagues at the workplace and friends. People tend to take a systemised person seriously and can be  as an intelligent person. A recent study of the University of Buckingham reported that people who are well organized are respected and believed more amongst their peers. So, It is irrefutable that keeping things in the places they are supposed to be, help in maintaining a stress free life and also increases trustworthiness.",
        "On the contrary, some people opine that organizing is not that supreme because of the time constraint. In today\u2019s fast-paced world some people don't find enough time to just set up things either at home or at the workplace. For instance, one of my friends has a ten hour work schedule daily, including her part time job and could not find enough time to sort out things. But such cases can easily be taken care of by hiring a home organizer or so and thereafter can be maintained accordingly.",
        "To recapitulate the aforementioned argument, organizing is helpful in reducing clutter and pressure. What is more, it is also proved to be efficient in improving and improvising.Admittedly, It is highly advisable to maintain home and workplace neat and tidy."
