        "It is usually argued that where there is  pain, there is  gain. Moreover, taking risks in all  aspects is not the right approach, when the probability of success rate is not near 80%. Nonetheless, while people are still ready to take chance considering both the negative and positive aspects of that, in my opinion,  the benefit of taking a hasty judgment is minimal to the side effect it brings.",
        "There are many reasons why taking a risk in all personal decisions would not only impact that individual but also the family members and dear ones. For example, there are cases where youngsters fall in love and take a decision to marry their loved one rather than concentrating on a future stable path. Though the initial phase of growth looks cheerful with strong bonding, the practical responsibilities overdo that emotional bonding after a certain period of time. Similarly, personal matters can never be ignored nor stopped to avoid the repercussion, and invite lots of trouble if the choice turned out to be wrong.Therefore, giving time to understand the personal need and expectations is required to have a happy and prosperous growth ahead.",
        "Professional decisions are still where everyone can control the risk by avoiding it or coming out of that. For example,some jobs initially gave good pay but later turned out to be a disaster if an employee skill not able to meet the requirement , and that employee can easily choose to quit the job and can search for another position. Though such an outcome in a professional matter looks quite easy, the complete budget to run the family gets disturbed and to an extent will affect the relationship too. Additionally, the age and experience factor would get lost by then in such a battle.",
        "In conclusion, people are ready to take risks to choose the shortest way to fulfil their dreams and desires, I still believe that any immature choice brings lots of bad things along the way.Therefore,  a thorough analysis and planning are required for any life matter to avoid a negative impact."
