        "In recent years, the easiest way to travel between cities is by using a fast train. Indeed, a country will spend a substantial amount of money on constructing a railway whilst others believe that the money should be spent to improve public transportation. In this essay, I will simplify both points of my view based on the topic.",
        "To begin with, a high-speed rail is now needed to connect from one city to another. It is said that it will be faster and more efficient. Although it is going to be more expensive on the constructing, the next generation will feel the impact of it. For instance, in Indonesia, before it has a high-speed train from Jakarta to Bandung, the public usually drives in the car and approximately will spend 3 to 5 hours on the road. However, now individuals do not need to drive longer as it is claimed to be faster and more convenient.",
        "On the other hand, some people consider that improving the existence of public transportation is also essential. Many transportations in the big city usually are not in a good condition. So that is the reason why the public believes that it is better to improve the existing transportation rather than spend too much money on the new railway construction. For example, the government should pay way more attention to the existing bus that is now mostly damaged in the country so travellers will feel more comfortable travelling using public buses.",
        "In conclusion, building a railway for fast trains brings more value for some people because it is going to be way faster to travel to its destination. However, improving public transportation also hold a significant role because one feels more comfortable using it. I consider that government should have  concerned regarding this issue that appears on the surface. I believe either spending money on constructing a fast train or advancing  public transportation, both have an impact on a majority of people."
