        "Nowadays , many individuals say that internet-based electronic books should be used in children's education system instead of paper books , however , others do not agree with that idea . I partly agree with this view and I will discuss both opinions in the following paragraphs .",
        "On the one hand , many opponents believe that electronic books bring many benefits for children. For example , many young learners are prefered to learn their subjects via the internet because they can easily find and accessible with few clicks. Moreover , they can also discuss or comment on each other virtually using some social platforms or tools and that can enormously improve their learning abilities and skills . However , some online documents do not have proper copyright or authorization and that could lead to false or altered information inside them.",
        "On the other hand , some opponents quickly  point out the fact that printed books should not be eliminated for the next generations because they have many positive benefits. For instance , paper books have more reliable information compared to online documents because most of them are published by authorized publishers. In addition ,most printed documents are located in libraries and that can attract children to use this instead of using the internet .However , some paper books are quite expensive for children to carry out their studies .",
        "Taking everything into consideration , both electronic and paper books have their own advantages and drawbacks .However , in my opinion , we need to use both documents to minimize the learning gaps of children.Otherwise , it would affect young people's imagination and creativity ."
