        "There are different views about the most important goal of a country. While some people think that the economic growth is the main purpose of a country, the others believe that other factors are key markers in this area. In my opinion, although the economy has a significant role, other primary aspects contribute to the success of a country.",
        "The economic progress plays as a key role in developing of a country. Firstly, financial growth helps in job creation and prevents unemployment. So, it leads to the welfare of a society. Secondly, economic growth can affect the international relationships. For example, the United States, which has the most powerful economy in the world, can determine world's important decisions. Finally, economic growth has a direct influence on health and well-being of a nation. In fact, it can improve the state of health.",
        "However, I would argue that various other forms of progress are just as significant as the economic factors mentioned above. In particular, we should consider the area of social justice, human rights, equality and democracy. For instance, the treatment of minority groups shows the level of development of a society. On the other hand, protecting the natural environment is another serious issue should be seen in measurement to know whether a country move toward environment sustainability. Moreover, health, well-being and happiness of a society are the other yardsticks for measuring of success for a nation.",
        "To conclude, economic growth is just one measure of success. Nations that strive to be developed should work on the other areas such as social, environment and health."
