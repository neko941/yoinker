        "In modern days, it is apparently a challenge to maintain museums open without entrance fees. In my point of view, two sensible ways are the government and individuals.",
        "Initially, it is obvious that the government holds great responsibility for maintaining and preserving museums and artefacts. The most significant reason is that museums are tourist hotspots. For instance, the Lourve museum in France, where the Mona Lisa is preserved and exhibited, attracts thousand of millions of tourists each year. Having a huge number of tourists visit the country not only contributes to the national GDP but also spreads local tradition and culture. In addition, museums are national treasures, so it requires the highest standards for the preservation of relics. An unfortunate situation happened in a Vietnamese museum was a 100-year-olds picture was destroyed by a non-professional by using dish soap while cleaning it. Consequently, the government has to make clear regulations in allocating professionals for keeping museums at their best in order to prevent similar cases.",
        "Secondly, the individuals also contribute to preserving museums and keeping them open. By funding, art lovers or history enthusiasts not only show their affection towards artefacts but also support the preservation as well as improving museums. For example, the Vietnamese history museum has displayed some interior upgrades. This helps to raise the population's interest in museums as well as provide a more modish way of displaying relics. Consequently, more and more people, especially adolescents have paid more attention to museums and artefacts. Along with the mentioned status, the young generation has the chance to approach artistic and historical topics which raises their  artistic sensibility and strengthens national pride.",
        "To summarize, government and individuals are two  sensible ways to fund  museums. The government, however, holds  greater responsibility for preserving and maintaining museums to keep them open without entrance fees."
