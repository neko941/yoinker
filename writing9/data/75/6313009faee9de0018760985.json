        "There are many people who think that some educational subjects such as physical education and music are don\u2019t needed at school and pupils should learn only useful branches of study. I oppose the view and my reasons will be explained in the following paragraphs.",
        "According to me, I would like to say that  if we will study only the academic lessons that are necessary for the future, it seems to be that people's views will grow narrower. There will be learned only equations, formulas and glossaries that are boring,  on top of that it is a very subjective opinion , and not everyone likes to study only  academies in public schools for 10-11 years. Because , as it has been for a long time, school is a place where children should choose a profession that they like, studying different subjects and having tried yourself in different areas.",
        "Apart from that,  the subjects such as music, and physical education are kind of  entertaining and useful for us stuffs. For example, sports help keeps our body in a normal tone and prevent diseases. Besides art and drawing lessons will help us relax and let our imagination run wild.  I guess when students   want to rest from these academies,  subjects like music , and art are very convenient for this purpose",
        "To draw a conclusion, looking at the different interests of students and taking into account the long-standing principles of the school, I think that children should study not only academic subjects  but also other classes."
