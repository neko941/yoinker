        "After returning from the trip, I, as usual, got busy with my office workload and daily routine activities. A couple of times, I thought about writing a letter to all of you. But, I got engaged in a new assignment allocated to me by the management of our company. I hope you will understand my position. However, I would like to make a request to all of you kindly visit my home city Goa in the month of December after completion of your term exam. Moreover, a large international movie carnival is organized in the month of December which I personally believe that all of us will have lots of enjoyment. Therefore, I assume that all of you will make this trip possible. Nevertheless, please don\u2019t worry about your stay as you all are going to accommodate at my house especially in my personal room.",
