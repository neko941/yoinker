        "It is advisable by many  that instead of raising kids by parents only , the contribution of the entire family is more beneficial for their growth. I tend to agree with this statement and will highlight my viewpoints in the favour of this.",
        "To begin with, several justifications can be placed in favour of my opinion. Firstly, children learn the values of sharing and caring in a joint family due to multiple interactions and learn to adjust to any circumstances. As each family member has a different personality which influences a kid to learn from different perspectives. Secondly, nowadays mostly teenagers and adults face problems of depression and anxiety due to being lonely as their parents cannot devote  valuable time to them. Hence, being raised by grandparents and other family members will mitigate these problems and children can enjoy their childhood more happily.",
        "Moreover, children have tender minds and they can be deviated from their path easily and often fall prey to bad habits due to less supervision from parents. Consequently, usage of mobile phones and internet content at an early age can corrupt their minds due to isolation and being alone at home. However, due to the support of all ,this problem can be hindered. For example, parents nowadays are working hard to fulfil the needs of education and the basic necessities for their children. In this scenario, a joint family can inculcate good values in them and occupy them in various cognitive activities.",
        "To sum up, the support of other family members is really important for the physically and mentally growth of a child as their supervision makes them good human beings as well as mitigates loneliness in their life."
