        "Many people argue that school should teach the pupils how to become good citizens. While others are of the opinion that parents are the first teacher of the children, hence it is their responsibility to teach society morals. I believe both the educational institution and parents have their own responsibilities. This essay will discuss more  these two points of view.",
        "To begin with, teenagers live and spend most of their time with their parents. These kids also tend to portray their parents\u2019 attitude; therefore, the family members should attempt to teach their kids to act properly and behave to others. In addition, family members are the first teachers and young minds have more bonding with children. If parents can create a convenient environment at home, youngsters will engage with individuals of society.  For example, according to the City news report in Pakistan, adolescents who live in joint families have seen more respectable and treat their elders as their role models.",
        "On the flip side, a school is an influential place in educating youth. In schools, skilled teachers are available to teach their pupils and mostly children follow their teachers as role models. The schools concentrate on a curriculum that has been developed by pedagogical experts and real stories have included inspiring the children. For example, I read the biography of Qaid-e-Azam in my school syllabus about the founder of Pakistan and was inspired and tried to implement some of his philosophies in my own life. Moreover, some schools only focus on academic achievement and do not try to develop personality traits in young generations.",
        "To conclude, reliance on one side of teaching adolescents may not be a wise decision since both sides address the valuable role to help children become good citizens. I believe children spend more time with their parents so they should teach basic things and prepare young learners for a better society."
