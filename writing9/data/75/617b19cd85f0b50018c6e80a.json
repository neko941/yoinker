        "It is undeniable that children currently often allocate  much time to watching television or using technology devices instead of joining physical and creative activities. There are several reasons why they like spending time on screens,but parents and schools certainly make some actions to solve this situation.",
        "There are two main causes that lead to this phenomenon. The first reason is that there are a thousand  attractive contents on television with sounds and visual effects, like Disney. Children, for example, can watch Tom and Jerry  a thousand times because of their contents as well as images. This leaves them little time for other activities such as sport or arts. Secondly, the market and the internet have many games, both online and offline, that are highly addictive. That is to say, these games create many challenging tasks that require children to concentrate to complete them. During the time of playing, games can bring the unique experience that they can not suffer in the real life. Pubg, for instance, creates the feeling of achievement and pride when being a soldier and winning the opponent. Consequently, children are often attracted and play games  non-stop instead of spending time on other activities.",
        "It is supposed that a number of solutions can tackle this issue. In terms of parents, they can encourage their children to join physical or creative activities instead of watching. These activities should be more exciting than cartoon movies they like. Also, some rewards could be given to encourage children after they complete these activities well. Moreover, schools also organized some physical competitions. After winning the competition, children can get well-deserved rewards and commendations. This can create the same feeling when they win in the game. Therefore, they may spend more time  exercising and physical activities.",
        "In conclusion, electric games and attractive content should be the main reasons why children love spending their time on screens. However, parents and schools can take some effective actions to address this issue."
