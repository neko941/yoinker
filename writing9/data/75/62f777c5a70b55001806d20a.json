        "It is often argued that the high school system should provide prohibition to students from using their gadgets at school, whilst others disagree that this regulation should be implemented for pupils. As far as I am concerned, I vehemently agree with the second notion and this essay will discuss them based on my personal opinions that can be given below.",
        "First of all, the improvement in technologies nowadays has made an enormous impact on society, especially on education. Therefore, one of the first benefits of allowing students to use mobile phones is to have effective and efficient access to find information related to the subjects that are needed for school children. For example,in my high school in Jakarta, the school system allow pupils to use devices in the classroom in order to gain information easily and quickly. As a result, this situation would optimize the process of education in the classroom.",
        "On the other hand, despite the advantages, there is also a drawback to this regulation. In this situation, some pupils may use their mobile phones for gaming or something that is not related to education. This would mean that the use of mobile phones could distract their attention. For instance, one of my friends from the class is often using his gadget to play games. As a result, he got the lowest mark on the exam compared with others.",
        "To sum it up, using such devices at school indeed gives a lot of benefits for students. However, the teacher also has obligation to control this regulation in order to maximize the process of learning in the education centre."
