        "Television is very common nowadays. Almost every home owns one. Surprisingly, some schools also have television sets mounted on the walls of their classrooms. It is speculated that young ones are able to learn effectively when they watch television. However, I disagree that they should be allowed to watch TV regularly at home and in school. In this essay, I will explain why.",
        "First, there is no doubt children love to watch television and children learn faster from things they like. It is also true that children learn quickly when the material comes in images and colours, colors attract youngsters. For example, pictures of animals tend to stick in the minds of children when they see them on TVs than when they see them in books. Therefore, regular watching of television could ensure effective learning.",
        "However, not all programs on TVs are educative. Televisions are mainly to entertain. It is a bad idea to substitute books for television viewing to educate children. When children sit in front of a television, whatever they see on it is fun and their minds do not tell them to learn. For instance, with animations that recite the English alphabet, children watch and recite along for fun and not to study the alphabet. This doesn't prove effective learning.",
        "In conclusion, televisions shouldn't be used for educational purposes in place of books. Children can watch television to back up what they have already studied in their books though. Children should be made to watch television after learning to release stress."
