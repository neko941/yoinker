        "I am writing this letter in response to your complaint concerning the loud noise from my flat because of which you had to suffer.",
        "Last Sunday, I was trying to repair a broken window in my kitchen. As some children were playing cricket outside my house, accidently, their cricket ball hit my kitchen window and not only broke its glass but also the wooden frame. Moreover, since, I do not have any prior experience of how to repair a window, the hammering must have created a problem for you and your family.",
        "I am extremely sorry for the inconvenience caused because of my rather amateurish carpentry skills. Since it was cold outside, I decided to complete the repairing work within the house rather that the lawn outside and I am regretful of my decision.",
        "As far as the work of the kitchen window is concerned it is still pending and I have decided to hire a professional to complete the unfinished task. The work would be completed in a day or two and I will surely instruct him to keep the noise minimal so as to cause no further discomfort to my neighbours.",
        "Once again, I apologise for the problems faced by you. Please accept the box of chocolates as a token of my deepest regard for the disturbance faced by you due to my negligence.",
        "Regards,",
