        "These days it is evident that restaurants and supermarkets try to lure students by paying schools to promote their products. In my opinion, it is a negative trend as products which are part of paid promotion might not have necessary nutritional values in it and can also make children heavily rely on it over the course of the time.",
        "There are a lot of demerits of the goods promoted to students in schools through such schemes. Firstly, every school would have different vendors to market their items based on the revenue generated from them. Secondly, there are no laws in place that give such external suppliers a room to advertise their product by providing money to educational institutes. Thirdly, children would get addicted to such snacks and would not crave for home-made ones. Lastly, hygiene cannot be accurately measured by anyone to approve it safe for consumption. For instance, nourishment delivered from the supermarket is generally preserved for long which over the time makes it lose its nutritional value before reaching the end consumer.",
        "It is unethical for schools to be part of such campaigns, which selfishly generates revenue for them, but at the same time ignores student's health. In their growing years, kids need to be provided with food which gives them energy and immunity enough for their daily chores. Food packed with nutrition is essential for them to stay healthy and fit. Also, parents become lazy in preparing food for their kids, as they are aware of ready-made food available in school. For example, a recent Cambridge study shows 38% of working mothers do not prepare lunch for their school going children due to availability of fast-food chains.",
        "To conclude, paid promotion of products raises suspicion of its quality and consumption safety. Government should revoke license of chains or markets indulging in such practises. Laws should be rolled out for schools to seek local council approval before hiring any external vendors to cater their students. As responsible citizens of the society, we should be vigilant enough to mould the future generation in the right direction with best practises."
