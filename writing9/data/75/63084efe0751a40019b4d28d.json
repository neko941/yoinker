        "It is an argument about whether school uniforms should be compulsory or not.In this contemporary epoch, whilst some people believe that it is the pupils' choice to wear the dress code , others have a diverse perspective. I am a staunch believer that wearing a uniform should be followed by students  because it helps them to focus on their studies, rather than on their clothes. In this essay, l will discuss both views, along with my opinion.",
        "On the one hand, a category of people has the stance that children have to opt for their own clothes, as it promotes them to have liberty . In other words, if educators choose their clothes, they will be comfortable, and can also express their opinion , and participate in activities in school. A prime example of this is nowadays some schools in Egypt, give learners permits to wear what they want , believing that this makes them like going to  school. Thus, what can be said is that everyone has his own opinion to make a decision in his life and put on what he wants.",
        "On the other hand, proponents and l hold the view that schools uniform should be mandatory. This is because it helps to identify pupils  if there is any dilemma. To illustrate , when some criminals come to schools to commit crimes, it can be easily known . In addition, dress code can bridge the gap between rich and poor , as all student obliges to wear the same clothes, and this helps them to concentrate on their school curriculum and not be disrupted by brands. In Egypt, for example, children wear a dress code from primary school till high school and this assists them to follow rules in the future. Therefore, schools ought to union the clothes for this reason.",
        "In conclusion, after this essay has manifested the above-mentioned points , it can be reiterated that some claim that school uniforms should follow pupils' tests, others negligent that. I am convinced that all students should interest in following schools ' rules."
