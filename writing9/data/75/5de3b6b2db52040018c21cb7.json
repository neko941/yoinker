        "It is a fact that purchasing objects online is becoming increasingly common. This trend would introduce both pros and cons, but I think that the benefits do outweigh the drawbacks.",
        "On the one hand, it is conspicuous that purchasing things on the Internet would bring  about an overwhelmed number of disadvantages.One evident weakness is scams and thefts on the Internet.Some hackers create fake websites that trick people. For example, lots of people who are not aware of scams online  may be more likely to shop something from fake websites and receive dangerous objects or even nothing, moreover, they can be a victim to transfer viruses. However, these demerits can easily be avoided by being cautious and relying on reputed brands.",
        "On the other hand, the advantages of shopping online are not neglected. Shopping via the Internet is the most convenient way to find what you want in a large range without consuming a lot of time.To be easy to imagine, you only need to scroll your new feeds and click on the goods you want and the deal is completed. For instance, when shopping for air tickets or books, going online gives you access to a much wider range of choices so you can find a better deal without wasting time at a travel agents office.

        "In conclusion, it is irrefutable that the dangers of purchasing online are insignificant compared to the benefits.  Online scams and theft can easily be avoided with a little bit of caution and the remarkable convenience of online shopping cannot be ignored."
