        "Which quality is the most important for a worker to get a high-salary job is often a topic of controversy. While some individuals believe having a good qualification can certainly bring a high-paying professional for employees, others argue that workers need to be experienced at the workplace to have a high salary. This essay will discuss both sales of the view and express my approval of the former idea.",
        "On the one hand, it is undeniable that work experience is one of the key factors leading to a well-paid job. To have work experience, workers need to allocate time for working in various places for a long time. During this time, they can learn numerous interpersonal skills which are useful and precious in improving the quality of their performances at work. Moreover, since workers have experienced the working environment before, they can be aware of what kind of mistakes would appear in the process of working and know how to deal with them. Also, some big companies tend to be convinced by employees with solid work experience. For example, Grab employs workers experiencing 3-4 years in the workforce and offers them a high income.",
        "On the other hand, I think that being highly qualified is the best way to get a professional with a high salary. It can be ascertained that companies will seek employees with skills and talents for the sake of their development. To explicate, these prominent figures can contribute greatly to the improvement of organizations. In addition, a qualification or a degree is required if people want to have a job in certain fields. For instance, ones need a degree in a relevant field to practice as a doctor or lawyer. While practice will make folks better doctors, before gaining that experience, they need to have a university education first and get a degree. Therefore, good qualifications play a vital part in having a high-paying professional.",
        "In conclusion, although there is a statement saying experience is the key that opens door to opportunities to get a well-paid job, I believe being highly qualified is more necessary for employees to have a high income. I also think that a worker should try to gain practical experience and a qualification at the same time for their benefits."
