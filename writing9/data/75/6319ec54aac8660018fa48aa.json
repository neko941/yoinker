        "It's an incredible thing in this world, two people being found and falling in love with each other until they decide to get married. An important question is, how old should people allow to get married? In my point of view, I agree that youth should be married at age 21 or older. I have two main reasons, which are emotional balance and financial stability.",
        "First of all, when teenagers are older, be more emotional balance. They are learning, growing, and getting more experience. It helps to decrease the conflict among people, because of connecting and communication in daily life. For instance, when they are coincidently misunderstood, they are furious and improperly manner with them. Meanwhile, the other chooses not to react aggressively, because of understanding and emotional stabilities. In addition, if they are still immature, they can respond negatively, as if they were shouting in return. Not only for people but also for the couple, lacking a cautious temper can lead to an issue between each other.",
        "Secondly, puberty comes with financial stabilities, the responsibility of managing money, career, and if children result in family harmony. Having a family and giving birth to kids at 17 or 18 can lead to monetary problems. For example, During that period, they are either spending funds for studying at university, buying a new habitant, or initiating business. Then, getting pregnant with no financial support from the parent will tend to occur economic problems later.",
        "However, considering both these sets of arguments,  I believe that we can gain more an advantage because people will have more essential emotional balance and financial stabilities way."
