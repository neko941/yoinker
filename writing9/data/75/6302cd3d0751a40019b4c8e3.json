        "The given maps illustrate the information about how the surroundings of a city hospital were upgraded and ways to enter in two different years: 2007 and 2010.",
        "Overall, between 2007  and 2010 it is clear that the hospital and Ring Road stayed the same, while the roads were upgraded significantly with some additions such as, two roundabouts, a bus station, and a separate public car park.",
        "Looking at the 2007 map in detail, the access to the hospital is bordered by Ring Road which connects Hospital Road to the south which leads to City Road Furthermore, there were six bus stops along Hospital Road; three on each side of the lane. Additionally, there is a large parking space for both staff and the public to the south of the hospital and to the east of Hospital Road.",
        "In the 2010 map, upgrades can be seen in several locations. First of all, a new parking lot was added to the east of the Ring Road for public use only which we gain new access to the hospital. Meanwhile, the old car park which was used for both public and staff is now reserved only for the hospital staff. Secondly, two new roundabouts were added; one at the junction between hospital road and city road and the other at the junction between Ring Road and Hospital Road. Lastly, all the bus stops which were present in 2007 were removed. Instead in 2010, a new bus station was erected on the west side of Hospital Road giving access via the two roundabouts mentioned above."
