        "A major problem in a large number of schools is bullying.  I assume that family disorders and ineffective moral education are the most salient causes of this phenomenon.  Logically, closer attention to students with family troubles and  enhancing moral education could be two viable solutions to this problem.",
        "Bullying, as an important manifestation of student misconduct, can have two primary causes. First,  tensions between parents can be a notable cause of bullying behaviours at school. Family troubles tend to exert a remarkably negative impact on students' mentality and even morality. This can lead them to unpleasant behaviours at school. For instance, research conducted in a wide range of educational institutions in the US has indicated that students coming from families with considerable tension are more likely to have bullying behaviours at school. Second, inefficient moral education can be another factor contributing to this issue. It is crystal clear that inculcating moral principles in pupils' minds can improve their conduct at school. To illustrate this point, I can refer to a survey conducted in China, revealing that bullying was more frequently observed in institutions where moral education was ignored.",
        "Two solutions can be proposed based on the above-mentioned causes. The first solution is to pay closer attention to students from troubled families. Special consultants can be devoted to such pupils, reducing the detrimental effects of the tensions they are exposed to in their families. For instance, this strategy has been employed in some schools in Germany, the result of which was a decrease in bullying behaviours by 23 per cent. Another solution is to increase the efficiency of moral education, which could significantly improve individuals' morality. For example, this approach was adopted in China, which could reduce instances of bullying by 18 per cent.",
        "In summary, bullying behaviour at school can be rooted in family tensions and a lack of attention to moral education. This could be mitigated by dedicating special attention to students suffering from family troubles and enhancing the quality of moral education."
