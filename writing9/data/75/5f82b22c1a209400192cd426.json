        "E-commerce grocery shopping has gained increasing popularity these days. A few individuals prefer to purchase eatables in a traditional manner like from departmental stores while the remaining people like to shop them online. This essay will discuss both opinions and explain why purchasing of food products from shopping malls is always superior to online shopping.",
        "Purchasing consumables online makes things very convenient for people with a hectic work schedule which are earlier considered as a laborious task. They can get food items delivered to their homes simply by the click of a button and in the short period of time. For example, Amazon is one of the biggest successful e-commerce websites that commit 100% guaranteed delivery the next day. Therefore, the number of people preferring to shop online is increasing owing to the busy workday.",
        "Despite the convenience, the pleasure of shopping from a supermarket cannot be experienced on a computer screen. Walking through the various sections and selecting from a vast array of different products can give a positive experience. Also, reviewing each of them and then buying is always predictable when someone wants to try something new which is risky in online shopping. For instance, selecting the best apples from a high pile can be really satisfying at the same time one can be sure of the quality it items purchased. Traditional shopping for grocery therefore will always be the more trusted and pleasurable method.",
        "To conclude, shopping from supermarkets has forced many challenges since the introduction of online methods. This essay discussed even through grocery shopping online is more time efficiency, shopping through the physical channel will always be superior in choosing quality products. In my perspective, visiting a departmental store will be always more beneficial and pleasurable experience."
