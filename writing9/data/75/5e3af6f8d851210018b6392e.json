        "There is an opinion asserts that increasing imprisonment years is the most workable solution to shrink the crime rate. While I think punishing criminals is indispensable I believe that the more vital issue is to find the causes and eradicate them.",
        "On the one hand, implementing severe sentences would be beneficial for both society and criminals. Due to the fact that tough punishments such as mentioned one could act as a deterrent, less people would be inclined to turn to crime and the general public would live in a safer society. Furthermore, the more a criminal stay in prison, the less would be the number of criminal activities committed by this person. Thus, not only does the government have better control over the society, but also the prisoners have more time to become rehabilitated. As an example, they might learn new skills, which could be useful for their freedom period.",
        "However, in my view, despite the importance of punishments, if the government does not pay attention to the origins of illegal activities, poverty for instance, such solutions will be ineffective gradually and will not remedy the situation properly. Since there is a causal relationship between offenses and financial issues, one of the most influential ways would be creating various well-paid job opportunities. In this way, individuals who commit crimes in order to meet their needs and afford the cost of living will not abound. Another factor in this regard is poor education. When some members of the public are deprived of decent education and proper schooling, they do not know the difference between vice and virtue; hence, they are more likely to become offenders.",
        "In conclusion, there are various ways that crime could be tackled through including strict punishments and alleviation causes. From my point of view, the latter factor is pivotal and should take priority over the former one."
