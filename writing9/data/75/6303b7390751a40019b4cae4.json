        "Nowadays, a number of people  agree with this statement that protecting endangered animals is much more crucial  than that other ones. I completely disagree with it due to all the species have the right to live free in their own territory, provided by both government and the people.",
        "On the one hand ,  taking care of no longer existing animals  is make  humans  feel convenient for hunting the rest of them. Clearly, this discrimination will illustrate a dramatic rise  in the perishing of other creatures.",
        "Such as thousands of birds , fish, and goats  are hunted for either  instant  happiness or purposely  annual ,however, they have the right to live as well as us. Consequently, for keeping balance in  nature  ,neither endangered nor other species should be killed. Instead of hunting  them , we can  educate our children on how can protect those to keep harmony in nature .",
        "On the  other  hand, destroying living things  make is an indication of aggression and violence . Instead of   doing  this ill-treat behaviour  on the planet , humans have to approach  them with care, so as to try to demonstrate their intention is  different. we have to bear in our mind humanity will save  mankind . For instance,  if you  intend to save any animal in a particular place your children observe it and keep it in their mind.  Furthermore ,  once they  have come across  this situation in order to show misbehaving,they imitate you.",
        "In  conclusion, In spite of the fact that  some people's attitudes towards  all animals are not the same, all of us have to make a great effort to rescue them. In my opinion , the utilization of animal products has to be forbidden for the short term in order to monitor the results."
