        "Health fund has always played an imperative role in the national budget since the early stages of the world due to people\u2019 demands which are relevant to their well-being\u2019s concerns. Thus, it is admitted that officials should spend public money on promoting a healthy lifestyle with the view to consider prevention as a top priority. While I agree with this point of view, I would contend that spending money on medication for people who are already suffering from disease should not be ignored.",
        "On the one hand, there is a common belief that there are some clear merits of allocating state budget on the promotion of healthy lifestyles. The most obvious benefit is that citizens could ensure their health sustainable due to the government\u2019s fitness awareness campaigns which advocate prevention than cure. The proclivity of raising dwellers\u2019 self-awareness about bettering their lifestyle could significantly encourage them to follow healthy eating habits and exercises religiously, thus, the increasing number of people with stable strength conditions may lead to the reduced reliance on medical therapy. In addition, if individuals are able to be aware of the importance of taking care of themselves, the national budget investing in social healthcare may be cut down. Therefore, this public money can be utilized to supply other fields such as education or environment, which would benefit society comprehensively.",
        "On the other hand, investing in social medical remedy for the purpose of taking care of sick patients is also vital for some notable reasons. The first reason is that citizens have paid taxes for the government, therefore, the public health services which are paid by residents\u2019 personal energy insurance should be funded by the state. Moreover, the central authorities should offer a privilege of free medical treatment for those living in poverty who cannot afford the increased cost of medical fees. Additionally, the government must take prompt actions in an attempt to cope with the unexpected outbreak of epidemic at any time. For instance, the outbreak of life-threatening disease called NCOV-19 recently has put Vietnamese health at risk and luckily, the top leaders have deliberated and brought out outstanding measures which is ascribed to the reserve of the national health funds to significantly control the number of patients in a particular period of time.",
        "In brief, while I agree that preventive method should be the top priority, I opine the regimen of sick patients should not be undervalued."
