        "Some people believe that prisoners should not be given proper accommodation and basic amenities while others opine that prisoners are human being and every human have basic rights. In my opinion, people who committed crimes should be given necessary requisites, so they can change themselves in prison. In this essay, I will provide illustrations and reasons for the same.",
        "First of all, the people who are in prisons are humans and they have every right to have the needful. It seems logical that thieves and burglars should be punished by restricting their food and medical supply, but this will be inhuman and cruel. In prisons not everyone is guilty, there are innocent people as well. For example, in a study, it was found that 30% people who went to the prison were simply framed as criminals and they were not the actual criminals. Moreover, if people were given bad quality of life, they will eventually become more furious and aggressive in real life.",
        "Secondly, everyone should be given a second chance in their lives. The people who are in prisons they are not born cruel, it is simply that they make a serious mistake in the life and they should be given chance to rectify their deed. For instance, A man who spent 7 years in prison came out to be a life saver for many as he later became a firefighter. This clearly shows the concept of prison as a person can overcome his cruelty in the facility and later, he can live a prosperous life.",
        "To encapsulate, every person has their basic rights and no one can take that from them for any reason. Prisoners should be given a chance to change their lives, but if they were not given basic requirements that can turn them barbaric. I personally agree to a great extent that prisoners should be given residency, health facilities and healthy food."
