        "There are no families in this world having no disputes in their families. Two different people will have  different points of view and it will very possible to create some disagreements. That matter happens also to parents as they came from two distinct backgrounds. Moreover, those different points of view that lead to a conflict will also  arise in parents' and children's relationships. This essay will elaborate on how that will affects children's growth from both positive and negative possibilities.",
        "It is good if something is started from the good news, so the writing will explain the positive one first. If the conflict in families could not be avoided at all, people can possibly change the way to face and react to the contradiction. Moreover, it will be better if there is at least one person to be a middleman during the situation. For example, if a father advised his son not to always  fights with others at school in anger and the son is still stuck in his mind, then a mother could take the role of a calm mediator. She needs to monitor and understand both sides' arguments. Then, she can start to talk to her son first to give an explanation of the bad of having a fight with others. After that, she can approach her husband to overview her husband's manner in reprimanding their son. In this way, a kid can see that his parents actually love him and want the best for him. In addition, he could learn how good communication solved the problem.",
        "Wiseman said, the broken bottles can be repaired, but they still create scars. It is really related to the family's friction. Thus, it is better to avoid conflict as long as possible because it usually creates bad memory, especially for kids, even though everything had been back to normal. It could also impact  the children's feelings and future character like being a grumpy or arrogant person.",
        "In conclusion,  I agree that prevention is much  better than mending. So, in my opinion, parents need to have more patience in growing their children by trying to understand their emotional stages in order to prevent  negative disagreement because we are not always in positive vibes to tackle the negative side of the fight."
