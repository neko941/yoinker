        "Some people believe that despite the spreading popularity of the online media, traditional newspaper will still hold the most vital position among news readers. In my opinion, this idea is rather absurd as the Internet has become increasingly dominant due to the benefits it offers.",
        "firstly, It is undeniably true that reading news from online outlets could make it easy for people to access it. With the presence of the Internet around almost every corner of the world, people with a portable device such as a mobile phone can access huge storage of news. In fact, latest events, for example Covid-19 pandemic, would be updated immediately on CNN or New York Times. By contrast, with prolonging processes, including editing and printing, conventional newspaper might not be able to compete with the Internet in terms of the updating speed.",
        "Second and more important, however, thanks to the huge advances of  the Internet as well as online media, it brings to readers a new experience that they could not have had through a printed version. One limitation of newspaper is that it cannot convey visual messages to the people who read news on a regular basis. Meanwhile, the non-stop progress of the technology industry has unfolded the possibility to upload videos and voice records on various online websites. For instance, soccer fans these days can rewatch their favourite matches anytime they want with only a laptop connected to the Internet, which a mere paper cannot do.",
        "by way of conclusion, I disagree that printed newspaper would continue to be the most crucial source of information because more and more people will be drawn to use the Internet."
