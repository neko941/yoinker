        "I am writing this letter to offer some valuable feedback on spending a certain amount of money on the children\u2019s sports team or open-air concerts by a large company in my region.",
        "To begin with, I would like to suggest that there are many benefits of sponsoring the sports team in a local area. Firstly, it makes children  participate easily in sports daily like playing badminton or basketball after they finish school. Secondly, the children can be healthier both mental and physical by playing sports near their area.",
        "On the other hand, by summarising the advantages of spending some budget on concerts in a community area, concerts such as music or other kinds of concerts make the children to be happy and even can motivate them when they are getting depression.",
        "Because both have merits, in my opinion, an organization should spend the budget on both a local sports team and concerts by allocating money. I hope my insight will be valuable.",
