        "Throughout the decades the importance of this or that subject is being changed, namely due to the breakthroughs made therein. Nowadays, some people believe that science and technology are being considered as a more important subject than history, whereas the others beg to differ. To my way of thinking, it is not correct to prioritize them, as far the level of their importance cannot be measured.",

        "Developments in the science and technology, without shadow of a doubt, improved the human lives. Namely, people began to use this technological advancements in all areas as much as it possible. It definitely helped them to automate labour-intensive work with which most people were struggling before. All inventions made in this branch of science made people to think that is the future. To illustrate, people are now looking forward of the invention of the artificial intelligence or advances in the medicine that will be able to prolong their lives.",

        "On the other hand, knowing the history is also very important for a couple of reasons. Firstly, it is necessary to be aware of what your homeland came through for the it's history, such as knowing the cultural values of your country, its friends and enemies. Secondly, by learning the history it is possible to avoid the mistakes that were made by our ancestors. As a result of which, might be better international relationship with countries-neighbours, or meaningful political decisions. Last but not least, it would be disrespectful toward the our ancestors, as far they went through all these difficulties for laying down the foundation for the next generations.",

        "To conclude, despite the importance of one of the subjects, learning the other ones is equally important. In my opinion, we must avoid the discrimination of the subjects as far as we can, otherwise it will cause the disrupting of the balance in the educational system."
