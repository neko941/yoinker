        "In recent years, environmental issues have increased enormously due to various human's actions. A group of people argue that individuals alone are unable to resolve this menace, whereas, the rest of the claimers vocalized to have the regime support to the person to mitigate the current hassle of surroundings. In my view, if the authority and civilians work together as a team, the outcome would be definitely a positive one, otherwise, effort form one side is a waste of time. This essay will discuss why people have such distinguish views with  suitable examples and explanation.",
        "On the one  hand, people who think that individuals should come forward in order to sustain the environment, this because they are the one who is being irresponsible to take care of the surroundings by making damage to it. For example,  researchers from  Oxford University reported in the last year study that there has a 70% increased in  climate change around the globe due to humans' irresponsibility.",
        "On the other hand, it is also true that person solely not capable to tackle the surrounding issues unless everyone teams up. Because they used to have a glance towards the problem as a vast rather than thinking that if they work in a team nothing is impossible in the world to overcome. For instance, A study had done in the USA environmental department and revealed that if  the effort comes from the regime and civilians the result will be in the favour of environment.",
        "In conclusion, undoubtedly, effort from one side will give some optimistic results, however, that result would stay for a short period of time. But, the atmosphere issue is the longe term concern which requires to have almost complete results."
