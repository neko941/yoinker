        "Financial supporting of capable people in the arts by the government could be a compensation for them as an appreciation, while others argue that there must be other resources except the authority. However, in my viewpoint, there are other workers in the state that should be properly funded by the government. In this essay, both topical debates will be investigated before a rational conclusion.",
        "",
        "The proponents of this perspective are extremely encouraging their wish. First and foremost, there are not many individuals who have such talent in art, it is rare to find them. It can be said that they are chosen to be appreciated by the government. Moreover, the art people also could create the distinct arts for their country as the typical art to identify the characteristic of the nation. This action would bring  a great name of the state, and they should be given a reward. For instance, the person who spends their time to devote at the museum of arts have to get rewarded with financial support from the authority. Hence, they could develop their skills in art as well as dedicate themselves more to the country.",
        "However, the opponents are disappointed to the government act towards the art people. Firstly, they truly think that the right individuals who have the reasonable position to receive is  the doctor and the teacher. Both of these careers are the pivotal occupations that have contributed more to the all society in developing the education. It is unquestionable to say that the policy maker should provide more appreciation to them. Furthermore, the meritorious jobs are not merely those aforementioned works, yet there are other occupations which have been encouraging the development of the state. Taking economist in providing the brilliant idea to the development of economic as an example should also be appreciated by the nation.",
        "By way of conclusion, the advocates said that the worker in the creative arts has to get concerned more than the other jobs, yet the other professionals who give the prosperity to the country, reaching a great deal would be fair for them. As I would state that the authority have to treat the society with a justice and to decide any policy properly."
