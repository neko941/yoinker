        "I am a citizen living in New Castle town. I appreciate your writing the article published in a national newspaper saying the beautiful scenery about my town center. You are right every shopping center is crowded and busy.",
        "But I am afraid that my place center is different from the other place. To begin with, we have an organic farm market located in the east area which is rare to see in other cities. Secondly, We have a strong free internet net built in this busy center. Everyone can use free wifi which makes both buyers and sellers very happy. For example, my friend David coming from the UK was surprised by the amazing wifi design.",
        "To sum up, I will give you a rough guide about my hometown. Taking the No.1 bus to Yulong Road, then you will see the big entry arch door at the beginning.  Walk straight through the road you can find a primary souvenir in a shop which will make you happy.  Turn right at the end of Yulong Road you will see a big plaza there, it is our Feihuang shopping mall, If you go the opposite way, you can have the best cuisine there.",
        "Hope you can have a good journey in my town.",
        "Best wishes,",
