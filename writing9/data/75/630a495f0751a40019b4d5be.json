        "In recent years, reading online has become more popular thanks to the widespread use of the internet. Some people believe that this revolution may lead to replacing free online press with printed ones in the next years. However, I personally agree with this claim to some extent because of the reasons that will be discussed in this essay.",
        "On the one hand, many commentators justifiably argue that reading books and newspapers through the Internet has some merits. To begin with, it is free of charge and people do not have to pay fees. More precisely, as soon as a person connects to the Internet, most of the resources they need will be available. Moreover, studying online materials requires no special time or place. It means that they are accessible whenever and wherever people want. Also, not having to carry things like books not only decreases the possibility of losing them but also increases individuals' convenience.",
        "On the other hand, they are those who subscribe to the view that there are a lot of benefits in reading printed journals and books. They maintain that it can prevent eye diseases. As research findings confirm that excessive use of electronic devices such as computers or mobile phones is harmful to individuals' health. Eye weakness, for example, is a prevalent result of this usage. They also assert that this way of studying gives a sense of nostalgia on which most people are keen due to the fact that it reminds them of their childhood memories when data connections were not common as today. Consequently, there will be some readers who prefer reading printed resources.",
        "In conclusion, although emerging the Internet has changed different aspects of people's lives such as rising their willingness to study online, I personally believe that it is not able to eliminate printed materials completely owing to the reasons mentioned above."
