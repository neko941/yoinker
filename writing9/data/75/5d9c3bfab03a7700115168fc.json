        "Nowadays, people become more tired and less motivated when they have to work. Most people are fortunate because they have gotten a chance to work on what they like, but some people are not. The reason may relate  to the salary because people give their priority to different factors when they apply for a job. In this essay, I will give my opinion towards this statement.",
        "First of all, I partially agree that when choosing a job, the salary is the most important consideration. This is because the purpose of working is to earn an income and be able to survive by yourself without relying on someone else. Every single part of our lives need money, so without money people cannot survive. For example, since you were born, your parents have to pay for hospitals, equipments to take care of you, and school fees. It is impossible to mention that it is fine to live without money. People need to have it, but some people use less and some people use more depending on their lifestyle, so salary can be the most important thing to some people, but it can also be nothing for some people when they talk about a job.",
        "On the other hand, there are many people who give priorities to  their dreams and passions rather than income that they would get when they work. People who stay with what they love will feel motivated and joyful. They will not suffer from what they do not like to do. Moreover, people have to consider several things not only salary that they would receive, but they also have to be able to fit in with society, environment and people who will work with you. Nevertheless, you have to be able to grow in the company, otherwise you might feel down afterward.",
        "Eventually, salary is a part of our consideration, there are many factors that contribute to people's decisions, so it is significant to look around and observe everything rather than only the salary. Because people have different preferences and purposes in their lives, it is better not to judge people who think that the salary is the most important thing when it comes to job, while other people might think that it is better to consider other parts.",
        "To conclude, I partially agree that income is the most important thing because when you are working, you would expect something in return. However, people have different perspectives and backgrounds, so it would be nice to discuss about this statement, but it is better if they do not judge other people's opinions about this."
