        "The significance of top-level jobs has always been debatable and people hold varied perceptions about it. Top position jobs are always done by men as it is believed that men are more capable than women. Therefore women do not get the opportunity to reach the highest position in the company. I strongly believe this opinion that the government must introduce reservation on such positions for women.",
        "To begin with, there are myriads of reasons why the government should introduce reservation systems on top positions in the company. To clarify, few people have the opinion that women cannot justify the high-position as they have many more responsibilities over their shoulders. Therefore, the seat will be offered to men even when he is not talented enough to hold that responsibility. For instance, most of the company CEO\u2019s are men because there are some stereotypes regarding women that no matter how skilled they are, they lag somewhere. Hence, if the government reserve some seats to that position, no one can go against law. As a result, women get what they deserve.",
        "Furthermore, when some seats are reserved in the company at top-level, women feel secure financially and put more effort to make the ends meet by justifying their position. As a matter of fact, women empowerment can be seen in all the fields which give women strength and confidence to achieve their dreams. For instance, Norway Government has already introduced reserving seats to women in top-level jobs. As a result, more women have come forward to fulfil their dreams.",
        "In conclusion, despite men are capable of doing high rated jobs, women are not behind. In my perspective, if the government introduces the reservation system for those jobs, women could become financially independent and utilise their talent to serve the nation."
