        "Unequivocally fast food has become an important part of most people's lives. The ones who live in cities with fast-paced lives cannot survive without fast food because it offers time-saving and cost-effective advantages. At the same time, fast food deteriorates the well-being of its consumer, and its everyday consumption will make a person forgetful about cooking  conventional cuisine. This essay will determine whether the pros outweigh the cons of  fast food.",
        "When we think about advantages of the fast food, the first and foremost one is time-saving. The food does not take much time to prepare like the conventional food, as well as it is available in most restaurants of the country. This feature helps in saving  time for its consumer. For example, many working professionals do not get enough time to prepare food by themselves. Hence, they prefer  fast food in their working days. Additionally, the food is not so expensive as  conventional food. Raw materials which are being used in making the fast-food are comparatively cheaper. Due to that, the overall price is quite affordable for the majority of the people.",
        "On the other hand,  fast food cannot be the complete substitution for conventional cooking due to certain disadvantages. The major disadvantage is its adverse effects on the consumer's health. If someone continues to eat  fast food every day, they would end up having health issues like diabetes, obesity and blood pressure. Sometimes these health problems are life-threatening. Furthermore, if people were to habituate to fast food, there would be high chances that they would forget how to make the conventional food items in the near future. We have a great example of the younger generation, many of them do not know how to cook  traditional food.",
        "In conclusion, after observing the aforementioned pros and cons of  fast food, I certainly believe that there are serious disadvantages than  advantages. Hence, the advantages do not outweigh the disadvantages in any circumstances."
