        "I am one of your routine passengers who use the main role's buses every day. along with I am writing this letter in order to bring to your kind attention a few critical issues about some dilemmas which have been occurred with your services recently also mention about the effects of the hassle on people who use the accommodation. Moreover, ask you to take a deadlined action as soon as possible.",
        "In the ,beginning it is crucial to note that all vans that are attended in the aforementioned route have been delayed about fifteen minutes in the last fortnight so that means neither the first vehicle do not reach at the time nor the others too.",
        "secondly, it is not only  just a detainment period for all attendance. but also it would cause further problems such as misleading appointments for workers or making students  be punished as a result of truancy hence I have missed lectures at university completely.",
        "lastly, I would have some recommendations for you, such as empose tight penalties for drivers who do not arrive on time or Installing attendance devices in coaches.",
        "Thank you for giving the appropriate priority to the matter.",
        "Yours faithfully,",
