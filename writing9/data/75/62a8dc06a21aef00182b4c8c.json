        "It is believed by some that subjects like music and art must be compulsory for every individual in high school. I vehemently agree with these statements. This essay will propound my opinion along with credible examples.",
        "Analyzing the statements and explaining further, the first and foremost reason behind this is that nowadays, every hobby is a complete profession. Moreover, music and art are two subjects related to the natural talent of a student which is not common. If these courses are compulsory, then children will study and find hidden talents in themselves. Since students spend most of their time at school learning traditional subjects like math and science, students who have artistic talent may not even have a chance to discover this ability. For example, my friend has just completed her schooling with the compulsory subject Art in her high school and now he is pursuing Art for graduation in University Categorically discussed, it cannot be ignored that the main reason behind this is that arts and music play an indispensable role in children life.",
        "Moreover, one of the main underlying reasons stems from the fact  that art classes should be required in high school because they allow students to show their emotions through these subjects. Many students have reported that art is the way they express complex ideas. For instance, According to a survey, times of India, Most of the students express their ideas through Arts and Music is a great way to express emotions. Apart from the reasons mentioned, above it can be clearly stated why many are in favour of this trend.",
        "In conclusion, it is undeniable that art and music classes should be included in high school because they allow students  to express their emotions and find their talents."
