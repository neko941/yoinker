        "Music is the most ancient type of entertainment. In this day and age, it plays a huge part in human beings\u2019 lives together with forming subcultures like rockers, hippies and so on. Therefore, it is so charming to go into detail about the influence of melody heritage on modern society.",
        "Firstly, there is no doubt that opera made a significant contribution to setting people\u2019s emotions as well as shaping their thinking over the ages. To put it more simply, each sound you have heard would produce a particular feeling, by way of illustration, excitement, sadness or even anger. For instance, such noises as crashing waves, the singing of birds or the babbling stream of a river will soothe one. What is more, individuals subconsciously adopt a position stated in the lyrics of the song which they listen to on repeat. As an example, if you stick his playlist with a plethora of romantic songs, the topic of love will become more sacred for him.",
        "Regarding the importance of pieces in various cultures, from my point of view, rock is not one-legged in use these days. In other words, people used to listen to pieces of rap in their spare time in pubs, restaurants and other institutions targeted to enervate weary individuals. However, nowadays it is becoming an undeniable part of one\u2019s casual pastime, inasmuch as people are getting used to listening to background soul literally everywhere they go. Evidence for this is provided in groundbreaking research carried out by sociologists from Cambridge University which concluded that over 20% of the English were enjoying their favourite tracks while taking a shower.",
        "In a nutshell, music has been increasing its popularity as well as its impact on social groups throughout the entire history of humanity."
