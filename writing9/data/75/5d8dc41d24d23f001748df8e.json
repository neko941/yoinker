        "There is an ongoing debate about the party to be responsible for the environment and while some people think that the government ought to take care of it, others are of the opinion that it is the individual's task and in my opinion, I consider the latter due to the fact that it is the people that are in close contact with their immediate domain.",
        "On one hand, the sole responsibility of keeping the immediate environment clean should rest on the shoulders of the people in that territory and I agree. This can be done by making sure that their environment is clean and cultivating the habit of throwing dirt in the appropriate place instead of littering them around. Furthermore, littered dirt can have adverse consequences on the environment which includes the blocking of drainage systems and flooding. For example, in the area I reside in, the residents come out every Saturday take care of the streets and gutters to ensure they clean. Additionally, fines are meted out to people who don't participate.",
        "On the other hand, the government have a huge role to play in the task of taking care of their territory and this can be in form of enacting laws prohibiting littering of dirt on the roads. Furthermore, they can also get lands in the outskirts where these dirts when picked up by the agency, can be kept and recycled. For instance, in 2013, the Edo State Government put a law in place to ban the act of throwing dirt on the streets and also made available dustbins for the this purpose.",
        "In conclusion, while people may vary in their opinion, I believe that individuals should have the primary responsibility of taking care of their environment to prevent environmental mishaps."
