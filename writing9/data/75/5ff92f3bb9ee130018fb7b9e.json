        "A highly controversial issue relates to whether living in high buildings causes loneliness or sadness or if it brings benefits people. In this essay, I will examine both points of view and explain why I believe that the arguments for benefits are stronger.",
        "It is commonly believed that Living in lavish buildings considerable outweighs its disadvantages. The mains reason for believing this is because residents resort to safety for their families. This is that in constructions like these tend to rely on private securities or twenty-four hours of vigilance. It is also possible to say that it is convenient since these model of home is generally located in downtown or uptown, which counts on several amenities such as hospitals, markets and schools. A good example here in New York, where almost all of the buildings are high-rise, figuring as one of the most expensive places to live while is also safety.",
        "On the other hand, others believe that living in places like that brings about loneliness or sadness. It is often argued that as these places are generally isolated from normal neighbourhood people tend to feel alone sometimes. This is due to the fact that rich people tend to be selfish and do not rely on people. A second point is that living in places like that requires much money, which only people who carry out important jobs can take in. A  particularly example here is London, which is one of the most expensive cities to live, and living in uptown is affordable only for politicians, judges or bankers.",
        "In conclusion, both arguments have their merits. On balance, however, I feel that living in high-rise buildings only triggers benefits since they are located in a perfect neighbourhood and are safe in comparison to normal houses."
