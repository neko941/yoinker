        "Spending leisure time with kith and kin is considered more valuable for young generation instead of going outings from the house. Although young people prefer to entertain themselves by doing different types of activities such as hiking, trekking, surfing, and so on, to name but a few, it is also significant for them to spend quality time with their parents and other family members. From my perspective, adults should spend their free time with their family member, because most of the time adults are busy with their work and rarely have they gotten the chance to meet with near ones.",
        "To begin with, it is true that most of the adult generation loves to spend their free time with various types of activities, since they want to come out from their hectic schedule. For example, these days, young people are busy with jobs, study, research, and private activities. For that reason, they would like to spend their leisure time with extra interesting activities such as bungee jumping, hiking snorkelling, etc. As a result, they can get relaxation from their monotonous life. Therefore, thinking to go out from house sounds intriguing if the individual gets hilarious through these works.",
        "In contrast, when adults get time from their work m they must be with their family. The reason is that family bond is acute and it should be prioritized at first phased. To cite an example, when an adult was a child, the family took great care of that child. Furthermore, the elders not only succours that person to build his/her career, but sometimes it also shows the path to achieve success. Moreover, sharing the pain and agony with family reduces psychosomatic problem as well as various types of diseases such as heart attack, bronchitis, brain haemorrhage, etc. In addition, if adults meet with family members, their joy knows no bound. Ergo, time spending with friends is worthwhile and precious.",
        "",
        "In conclusion, I would say that a number of adults adore to do outside activities in their free time while staying plenty of time with family members are more important due to building a natural bond emotionally which has lots of benefits."
