        "From the advent of the modern ,time people have taken sports as the supreme way of entertainment tremendously. This conception helped  people to keep their minds fresh, bodies fit and indirectly make active whole immune system. But in today's ,world there are some arguments regarding the sport's effectiveness on health solely by the people.",
        "Firstly, in recent times human beings are up to their eyeballs at home and office even at daily activities anywhere. Such types of activities lead people to pass their time with technology and busyness whereas they need to enhance their intellectual and physical abilities to perform their mental and hard work. Here, to keep their mind fresh and to keep body fit, sports can contribute a lot. Playing football can be the ideal example to show the effectiveness of the sports that helps the students to make active and nourish their brain, make instant palan, keep body fit, remove depression and create least chances for obesity. So, in the ,offices the superior authority can take some initiatives to make their subordinates  ensure active participation and become enthusiastic by arranging some indoor sports like summing, table tennis, indoor cricket etc.",
        "Secondly, sports can not be taken in isolation as a way of keeping the body fit and developing intellectual ability whereas, other measures like meditation, counselling, showing motivational movies and interactive tours can also play a vital role in upgrading the public mental and physical health. Such types of arrangements are also cost-effective for the government and even concerning authority in comparison with  sports. At the end of the day, the population will be benefitted from health measures and the economy will be empowered by saving money and contributing to the development areas.",
        "So, I believe that the authority should take decisions regarding sports into consideration of their contemporary demands and motives. Furthermore, only sports are not fully sufficient to ensure the perfectness of  human health, they need other ways of rejuvenation."
