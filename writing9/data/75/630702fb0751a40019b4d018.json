        "In today's world, an increasing number of people leave their countryside to study and work in metropolitan areas in order to have better universities and better jobs. From my perspective, I completely believe that the upsides of this phenomenon far outweigh its downsides.",
        "There are two main reasons which urge people to leave their rural areas and move to the cities. The first reason is that the most of top universities are located in big cities and these universities attract ambitious students who want to earn higher degrees. The second reason is that the job market in the cities offers more job opportunities. Therefore, it is an ideal place for professionals to find jobs there compared to the countryside where the economic activities are limited.",
        "There is no doubt that there are several disadvantages to this migration. Firstly, the growth of population in the cities will affect on city's infrastructures severely. Additionally, it also results in the lack of accommodations due to the development of people shifting to the cities. Secondly, this migration leaves their rural areas abandoned and demotes some necessary professions such as farming.",
        "Despite the negatives above, I believe that the major advantage gained is a remarkable increase in the number of university graduates which broadens society's education level. The second merit is that more and more job positions in various fields are opened for people from remote places which will a factor to increase the country's economy as well as their financial conditions.",
        "In conclusion, most people from rural areas tend to move to big cities for reasons related to their career and their education. Although there are several drawbacks, we cannot deny that individuals and societies are benefiting from this phenomenon."
