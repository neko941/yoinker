        "Nowadays there are some countries which have a high rate of unemployment citizens, some people suppose that these people do not necessary secondary education because they have a little chance of finding work. I would disagree that secondary education may lead to pretty good consequences which can decrease this rate.",
        "Firstly, One of the problems in the world which has not found yet the solution is unemployment. I believe that for finding job education is the most necessary things. As we now in primary education are not teaching certainly specialization. Moreover the main of the subject is made up general knowledge. It means that they knowledge don\u2019t appropriate for clearly working condition. In this case secondary education can be vitally important because they students, which graduated secondary education gathered specific information such as opportunities, prospect, working process and etc. They have already gained the specific experience for a job within training at the university. In other words employer try to seek specialist with deep knowledge.",
        "Secondly, increasing of unemployment can carry on without stop. If they have  a secondary education can affect the unemployment rate to fall. In this case, they should focus on bringing together people who have achieved success in their lives. therefore, they should share their life experiences with teenagers who are in primary school. this can lead to a sense of motivation in the lives of young people. In addition, these experienced people can take out a bank loan and start their own business. In this way, they can provide jobs for citizens, which is very essential. Although it is not to be easy.",
        "In conclusion, unemployment is a problem which still solution does not find because problem connected clearly with deficiency education"
