        "However, on the final day of stay, I was in a hurry to check out and catch the flight, and I forgot to pack the documents that I placed in the right top draw of the TV cabinet. These files contain confidential information regarding the projects and their budgets that we were planning to bid to the customer next week. When you find the documents please make sure that you destroy them. I suggest that you either micro shred the documents or burn them in a closed container. Kindly let me know which approach you wish to take and please send me a video recording or photograph of the process.",
