Especially,  technology has a positive influence on transportation.Thus, people prefer to travel ever than before.

For example,  the short destinations could take long hours or even days. But the length of distances is not a problem at the present. Additionally, the cost of the excursion was too much, so people hardly visit different places.  For instance,  long-distance journeys brought more economic challenges for visitors. Moreover, the conditions of the environment were not proper to join a journey because of unsafe vehicles. However, people are more able to travel in order to see different points on account of the technological improvement in transportation instruments.  Further, people are always curious to see and discover new locations. The desires trigger human feelings to find new areas and cultures.",
