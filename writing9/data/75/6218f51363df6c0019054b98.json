        "There is a high demand for hiring those who have  excellent social skills as  great qualificators in  several companies. I mostly agree with this statement because both  skills are important for employers: the former can be considered as a person who has a more transformable ability toward a variety of tasks and the latter can be recognized as a person who has a more specific ability to finish specialized tasks.",
        "Most employers have a tendency to prefer  an employee who can complete various tasks regardless of his specialized skills. This is because basically, there is no company where employees take only work which is familiar by themselves. For example, those who have one of the common transformable skills such as communication skills are a possibility to finish their tasks perfectly by asking advice or method to solve a faced problem to their colleagues even if they are required to complete complicated work which is unfamiliar. It can be beneficial for employers to employ people who can cope with a wide range of tasks.",
        "On the other hand, holders of qualifications are needed by employers for dealing with a certain specialized task. For instance, if an employer can not hire these kinds of people based on their type of  company, it is impossible to cope with specific work like a construction project, financial consultant project and some mental health conductions. It leads to the situation where a company can do not make any profits in their work, which can also bring  bankruptcy. Therefore, people with  good qualifications have a pivotal role in a certain company.",
        "In conclusion, it is worth for employers hiring both of types\u2019 people such as people with good social skills and good qualifications because of completing work of their companies."
