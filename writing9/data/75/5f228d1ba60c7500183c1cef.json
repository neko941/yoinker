        "It is true that there has been a significant increase in the number of ages people live. Because of  medical science developments, longer life expectancy leading some negative impact in the society as a whole. However, I believe that the benefits are of more importance than drawbacks which I will discuss in the following essay.",
        "In terms of positive aspects, thanks to medical advanced some plague or disease can be prevented. Yellow fever is a good example,  before the disease being researched, there was no treatment and medication can be used. Whereas nowadays, various vaccinations have been used to combat different disease  in many parts of the wolds. AS a result, people no longer suffer from these pleasures once they administered vaccines. Furthermore,  gaining medical knowledge can be another advantages. Because of the level of education increasing, people more likely to pay attention on the health issue. For instance, the pandemic Covid-19, since governments educate people how to combat the virus, people would practice social distancing and wearing masks in daily basis.",
        "Nevertheless, on the downside of improving medical treatment is aging society. That's the fact, older people most likely need medical care which could result in financial strain and put pressure to most families. Consequently, aging population can be a serious issue in the society.  In addition to this, overpopulation can be a major concerned, because an increase number of people in some developed countries might face food shortage. According to World Food Programme said that eighteen years later, more than half of the population lives below the poverty line, and over 11 million people are classed as severely food insecure",
        "I conclusion, although there are many arguments both against and in favour of medical care improvement, I'm convinced that the positive impacts are outweighed disadvantages."
