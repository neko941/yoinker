        "It is often argued that after completing school education young crowd tend to go for travel or job for a particular period of time before taking straight admission to the university. In my ,opinion there are numerous advantages of working or travelling before going to  university. In this ,essay we will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of travelling or work for a certain period of  time for institute leavers.",
        "Firstly, there are plenty of advantages that school leavers can take the certain gap, and explore different places, culture, and history by travelling. Secondly, if they work for a certain period of time they can learn, and find an interest that what exactly they want to do in future. Travelling or work gives opportunity to young people, that how to live life independently. This means that some of the school leavers do not know exactly what they want to become in future, or in which field they want to make a career. For example, travelling can help to explore cultures, tradition art and some people find art most interesting after travelling.",
        "However, there are some disadvantages like working at the early stage of life might be losing interest in further studies. Nowadays, It is widely argued that some young people love to hang out and travel instead of study. If they start working and get a good salary in some field they will not even think about higher education in the university.",
        "In conclusion, there are some advantages that school leavers can take the experience of actual work before directly going to the  university for higher education, however some the youngster might not continue the university study if they lack interest in the study and continue to work."
