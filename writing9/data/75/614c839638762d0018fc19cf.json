        "In the last few years, the Internet has become something adults and even kids cannot help but use. Some people believe that you can successfully find everything that you need online, whereas others think that it\u2019s not the best place if you\u2019re looking for information. I am of the opinion that there is no better place to find information than there, but you have to be careful.",
        "Firstly, part of our society is sure that the Internet is a great way to communicate with others. Indeed, social media have given us the opportunity to talk with people from all over the world and send them messages instantly. Moreover, websites and social media are great places to read the news. For instance, I use Twitter daily to check on what is going on in the world, and I find it extremely useful.",
        "The Internet, however, has also downsides. In fact, not everything you read online represents the truth, and this could cause some problems if there are people that are easily convinced by fake news. For example, in Italy, there has been fake news on social media related to the vaccine, and this has led to a big problem.",
        "In my opinion, websites are a really great way to check on what is happening in the world and, of course, there are some downsides, although if you are really careful and only believe information that are facts, you have nothing to fear.",
        "In conclusion, there may be some contrasting opinions about the Internet ,however, I think that it\u2019s wonderful that we have something like this, and you just have to be careful when you are online in order to have a positive experience when using technology."
