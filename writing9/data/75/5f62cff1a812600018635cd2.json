        "Dear Sir or Madam,",
        "I am writing to bring to your attention a significant mistake regarding the Spring Festival Market in Markham in your recently issued magazine.",
        "In the article which introduced the Spring Festival Market this year, it mentioned that the market would remain open until 1st February like last year. However, the last day of the market is actually 22nd January, which is almost a week earlier than the incorrect date on your magazine. This may terribly affect many people who read the article and planned to have a family outing after January 22nd. What\u2019s worse, this mistake would negatively influence the reputation of Markham.Furthermore, some tourists might have a bad impression of Markham or your magazine due to this issue.",
        "I believe it would be a great idea to add a page to correct the date of the market in your next issuance. In addition, posting updates regarding the correct on your official website is an effective approach as well.",
        "Hope my advice is helpful and please let me know if you need any additional information.",
        "Yours sincerely,",
