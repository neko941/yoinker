        "It is often argued that the government is responsible for the environment, others think that each person should take responsibility for their own actions. I agree that it is the government's responsibility, as it has to implement a campaign to change individuals' behavior and invest in recycling programs. Although, people should also take responsibility for their own participation, as taking their rubbishes to recycle. The following paragraphs will highlight the importance of both sides working together and some relevant examples.",
        "",
        "Pollution has increased in the past years harming the environment. The government has to raise campaigns to solve this problem. Governments have the power to decrease pollution, such as implement rules and punishment for actions that harm the environment, creating campaigns, and supporting volunteers who work for this cause. For instance, in 2017 a campaign was created to stop plastic pollution in the ocean, and more than 60 countries are participating. Consequently, it is already possible to notice the difference governments make in taking actions to help the environment.",
        "Despite the fact that government is responsible to take care of the environment, the population has to make its part. It is essential for people to understand the cause and collaborate with the government\u2019s campaigns. Individuals have an important responsibility to help the environment, such as recycling their own rubbish and buying less plastic. For example, a particular program in England has shown a massive difference between 2012 to 2020 when the population tried to decrease plastic in their own houses. That shows how important is for citizens to take their own responsibility and also help the environment.",
        "In conclusion, both sides have a responsibility to help the environment. The government has the power to raise campaigns and individuals have the responsibility to participate in campaigns and make their own part."
