        "Boxing, which is a type of sports where two people punch each other in order to earn points, and the person with the highest points emerges the winner, is a bloody game that many times leaves the competitors with noticeable bruises. Many believe it is detrimental for boxing to be in existence in the modern world. In my opinion, I strongly disagree with the proponents that the sports should be eradicated because asides the fact that the players should be left to indulge in their passion, it is an honest profession through which wealth and fame are attained and must be left to go on in this new era.",
        "The existence of boxing should not be brought to an end, seeing that everyone has a right to be involved in what he or she loves. Besides, these folks are not cajoled into boxing, they willingly chose it as a sport to play. Meanwhile, if one is forced to abandon his or her passion, it will result into rebellion.  For instance, a recent study proves that people who are forcefully put out from hobbies, tend to protest and this many times leads to violence and death. Hence, it is wise to leave boxing for those who love it.",
        "Furthermore, the sports, boxing  need not be stopped due to the fact that it is an honest profession. Numerous people make a living by participating in it. It has in fact enriched lots of people who are faithful competitors and also makes them well-known. For example, the famous Mike Tyson made his first millions as a boxer who started the sports at a young age and did not relent. This goes a long way to prove that boxing rewards the participants greatly and therefore, should not be cut off from this new age.",
        "In conclusion, although the sports is a bloody one which causes obvious injuries, I opine that it should be in continual existence since many people are passionate about it and whole-heartedly accept the outcome of the sports, and it is also a good way to make an excellent living."
