        "Nowadays, with the support and development of technology, research and experiments conducted on animals are gradually rising. Some people agree that the scientific findings should be done on animals while others object to that as it can lead to animal extinction and there should be laws to protect those animals. In this essay, I will articulate both views along with my perception.",
        "On the one hand, it is true that experimentation on animals can be adjusted with the help of the latest technology. To exemplify, in the production of cosmetics, the tests can be done on  artificial skin instead of  rabbits or pigs. Moreover, the government should enact rules that restrict the experiment on  wild animals like tigers and lions as this can lead to the extinction of that wildlife and  indirectly harm the ecosystem. By doing these, it can lower the risk of harming the animals although it is guaranteed that they are safe for them.",
        "On the other hand, some medical experiments tested on animals are more effective than others methods as they can be more dangerous if it is made on humans and it can take more time to produce the result. For instance, in a vaccination experiment to fight against COVID 19, the tests were done on the animals give more effective results in a short period where we can stop the number of people suffering from  COVID 19 and more importantly able to stop the number death rate and the outbreak happening. Thus, scientific findings on animals are also crucial for public health.",
        "In conclusion, both government bodies and scientists should cooperate to balance the risk of harming animals for experimentation and there should prepare an alternative solution that can replace the animals."
