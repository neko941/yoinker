        "Citizens nowadays choose to submit their personal information in order to get new software. Whilst this can be beneficial on the grounds that individuals would get a free application, and  this process can create a significant database for the technological firms, I believe that the downsides are utterly more serious because this will lead to a lack of privacy and online theft which tips the scales towards the disadvantages.",
        "On the one hand, purchasing software applications is anything but cheap, and the chance to get some beneficial ones for free is a bargain. That is to say that when the cost of gaining a useful yet expensive software is just to share someone's personal data, it is looked at as a successful transaction. Additionally, gathering all this information on one server allows the developer to create more targeting applications, and this leads to breakthroughs. In other words, if the software engineers had the preferences of a certain community, they would create useful online inventions. For example, Google accumulates the data from its users which then are used to design various applications. Not only does this benefit the individuals, but it is also  beneficial for the corporations.",
        "On the other hand, surrendering one's personal information leaves him or her with little privacy, and it can be something of an ordeal. In other words, when one company gets a customer's information, they share it with other companies that usually use it  to send the potential customer repeated advertisements.  For instance, most cyber hackers prey on these websites where tons of clients' data are gathered and use this to hack their bank accounts. What can be said is that the risks are grave that any outcome should be neglected.",
        "In conclusion, after this essay has shown the above-mentioned points, it can be reiterated that in the modern age lots of people choose to trade their personal data for  access to software. Whilst this may be advantageous to the customers in the short term by getting free stuff and to the companies in the long term by allowing them the opportunity to manufacture audience-specific applications, I believe that the disadvantages greatly outweigh the advantages because people will lose their privacy and will be prone to robberies."
