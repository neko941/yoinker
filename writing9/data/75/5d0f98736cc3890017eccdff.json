        "As you know, my old apartment needed to be renovated, but the landlord refused several times to allocate money for its renovation. Also, it becomes currently quite small for my family to live in as it has one bedroom only. At present, I have 2 children, who need 2 more bedrooms, a study room, and a wider area to play in.",
        "My new apartment consists of 3 bedrooms, a comfortable living room, and a wonderful terrace, where my children can play safely. I\u2019ve a suitable study room, where I can work in a quiet environment. All the interior, the paint on the walls and ceramic floors are of a marvelous condition, so no more maintenance is needed.",
        "It\u2019d be a great idea if you come with your family next weekend to see it. Let\u2019s spend some exciting moments together and enjoy watching new movies in the living room. Think of it and let me know as soon as you can.",
        "Please pass on my best wishes to your family.",
        "All the best,",
