        "Dear Sir or Madam,",
        "I write to express my disapproval of the plan of setting up a plastic factory in Parkland.",
        "I was extremely surprised when I read the news that the construction application was submitted to the state government last week. As we know, serious air and water pollution would be associated with the production process of plastic. It would be detrimental to local dweller`s health if the factory is approved. Compared to the economic profits the healthy environment is of more social value.",
        "Moreover, the parkland has been always regarded as an ideal relaxing place for our local inhabitants. Every weekend those living in surrounding suburbs gather there for picnics and parties. It has already been an indispensable part of our daily life. It is replaced by a factory. I suspect most citizens will get distressed.",
        "Therefore, I would like the council, representing us to demonstrate the view opposing the factory launch plan and try to find out a win-win solution by negotiating with the government and the factory investors.",
        "I look forward to your effective actions in this matter.",
        "Yours faithfully,",
