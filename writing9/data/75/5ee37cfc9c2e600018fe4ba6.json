        "Sports play some role in our life. Some people regard them just as recreation activities, while others believe that sports are more important in our life, and I agree with this idea.",
        "The argument in favour of sports being leisure activities would be that some sports are relatively less strenuous. For example, an activity which is less energy-consuming for individuals is climbing. People can shoot the breeze with their friends while going forward to the top of a mountain. This type of sports allows people to unwind and keep updated with their friends, just like other leisure activities do, for instance, going to a tea house with some friends, singing some songs in a KTV.",
        "However, I\u2019m convinced that sports doesn't only play a role as leisure activities, they also definitely have a positive effect on our physical and mental health, which makes them more important in our daily life. The sedentary lifestyle is taking its toll on our health. For example, obesity, nearsighted, autism, and neck problems become more and more popular. Doing sports can help us handle these problems. For instance, the players have to raise their necks from time to time during play badminton, which helps relax their stiff neck. And playing such strenuous sports also can make players more open-minded which is helpful for tackling the problem of suffering from isolation feelings.",
        "In conclusion, different types of sports have different functions, while some sports can be considered to be leisure activities because of easy-doing, most of the activities are playing a more important role in our daily life."
