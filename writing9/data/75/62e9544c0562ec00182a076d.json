        "Many people choose their jobs based on the amount of the salary offered. Personally, I disagree with the idea that money is the key consideration when deciding on a career  because I believe that other factors are equally important.",
        "On the one hand, it is agreed  that money is necessary in order for people to meet their basic needs. For example, people need money to pay for housing, food, bills, health care and education. Most people consider it a priority to at least earn a salary that allows them to cover these needs and have a reasonable quality of life. If people choose their jobs based on enjoyment or other non-financial factors, they may find it difficult to support themselves. Artists and musicians, for instance, are known for choosing a career path that they love, but that does not always provide them with enough money to live comfortably and raise a family.",
        "On the other hand, it is believed that other considerations are just as important as what we earn in our jobs. Firstly, personal relationships and the atmosphere in a workplace are extremely important when choosing a job. Having a good manager or friendly colleagues, for example, can make a huge difference to the workers\u2019 levels of happiness and general quality of life. Secondly, many people feel satisfied with their work due to their professional achievements, the skills they learn and the position they reach, rather than the money they earn. Finally, some people choose a career because they want to help others and contribute positively to society.",
        "In conclusion, while salaries certainly affect people\u2019s choice of profession, I do not think that money outweighs all other motivators."
