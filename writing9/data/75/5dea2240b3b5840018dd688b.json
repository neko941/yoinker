As a result of fixed levy payment, the company has to do their best to make as much as money as possible for both monthly expenses and its whole profits. This has resulted in overtime working among officers to direct the business strategies in different periods and promote the advertisement for customer attractions. The high prices on advertising give fruitful results to the company\u2019s earnings for the time being, although the sustainable growth in economic value has always been the top priority. Therefore, the difficulties should always be passed with incentives for maintaining their operations.",
        "In conclusion, entrepreneurship causes benefits and challenges to those who start up. In spite of a contribution to fostering the economic growth, private sectors must always enhance their sustainable development with significant efforts."
