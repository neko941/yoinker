        "During the last decade, smartphones are becoming an integral part of everybody's life. Most people spend a huge amount of time using smartphones. This essay will discuss a couple of reasons in the forthcoming paragraphs.",
        "To begin with, there are many reasons for using mobile phones. Firstly, people are connecting with their kith and kin by smartphones. They can share their life with family members by connecting them.  For instance, when I was in a hostel I daily gave information to my family about what I did or what I will do tomorrow. This makes our life easier. Secondly, an individual can book his air, railway or bus ticket by using a smartphone. So, there is no need to go in rush and book tickets. Moreover, nowadays, due to the covid19 pandemic, online classes are organised by the education department and these are attending on  smartphones.",
        "However, everything has a positive as well as a negative approach. There are also some drawbacks such as children have fewer friends and they do not like to interact with others. Furthermore, using a smartphone for a long time can affect eyesight.  On the other hand, it gives us many benefits such as entertainment  in our free time. It also helps us to find routes by using an app. It is very convenient to use.",
        "To conclude,  In my opinion, even if it has some side effects then there are more advantages which one cannot ignore. One can use the smartphone for a limited time with these eyes will not be affected."
