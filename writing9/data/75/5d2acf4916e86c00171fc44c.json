        "Nowadays, most of the people opt to give birth later in life. This is because of inflation and hard to get jobs. And there are more advantages to this as compared to drawbacks as we will discuss.",
        "Firstly, over the past few decades, inflation has been on a never ending rise which has made it difficult for people to earn and provide for their families. For example, a salary which was sufficient for a family of four in past times can only sustain two persons at most now owing to the price hikes and taxation. In addition, jobs have become tougher to find. Individuals tend to secure a better and stable future before starting a family. This is justified because prior to having children, one must have the adequate resources for their nutrition, education, and health. Therefore, it has become a growing trend to give birth at a later age.",
        "There are many benefits of this practice. To explain, when parents have a secure career, they can perform better in the upbringing of their children. For instance, they can afford better schooling and healthcare for the offspring. Moreover, once adults have a balanced life, they can spend more time with their family. This allows them to be aware of their needs and problems. Thus, all these perks outweigh the disadvantages of not having children sooner in life.",
        "In conclusion, people prefer to delay childbirth because of the increased cost of living and to seek a better future for themselves and their dependants. And this has the advantages of providing better resources for the offsprings and an opportunity to spend more quality time with them."
