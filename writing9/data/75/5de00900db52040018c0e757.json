        "In this modern era, students do not fond of hard copy study material, so it is thought by many that books should not be used in the educational institutes. It is considered that modes of e-education are more appropriate method to educate them in an interesting way. I do not completely agree with the latter persuasion and hold the view that there should be a proper balance between the both approaches. In the given essay, I will explain the reason of my contemplation that why I am partially agreed.",
        "To begin with, the conventional method of studying is in continuation for many years. Therefore, the benefits behind teaching in the books are manifold such as to learn creative writing, to make notes conveniently and avoidance of harmful effects of being in front of the screen all the time while studying. For instance, one of niece used to learn everything through internet or televisions.Consequently, her eyesight has become weak, and she wears contact lenses now.",
        "On the other hand, today's generation have become immensely smart and to make them learn practically, it is essential to show them the exact pictures of the topic what they read so that they can co-relate things better. Therefore, in this situation to use computers and teaching via games have become indispensable. For example, my son knows more than me when I was of his age as he has smart classes in his school, and whatever it is taught in his class, he can experience it due to visual effects.",
        "In conclusion, although it is true that children feel lethargic to learn from their textbooks, there are significant benefits of learning from the books. However, to make them smarter, it is also important to attain the information by means of technology. As a result, they get instant details on any subject in a fascinating way. After thorough analysis, to rely completely on any single pattern would not suffice the requirement, so it is necessary to use both of the methods while teaching to children."
