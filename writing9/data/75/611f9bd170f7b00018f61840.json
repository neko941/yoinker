        "One of the main responsibilities of the government is to maintain the law and order of the country. In order to ensure the security of citizens, sometimes the government has to violate people's freedom. I strongly agree with this and will explain why I believe people's freedom is breaching when improving national security.",
        "To begin with, law and order play an indispensable role in security in a country. Since the government would take necessary actions to maintain the protection of society, people would have to deal with many violations of their freedom. For instance, nowadays in almost every corner of the city have CCTV cameras operate 24 hours daily, whereas people are being monitored without their consent. Even though this would impact their personal lives as it breaches their privileges, this would decrease the crime rate in society which would improve the protection of individuals. Therefore, it is undeniable that, in order to improve the protection of the community, the state has to take action even though they are infringing an individual's privacy.",
        "Furthermore, in order to avoid terrorist attacks or similar attempts, authorities are conduction various searches in public areas. Since these operations are performing without prior notice, people are facing difficulties or delays in their day-to-day life. To illustrate, since police conduct raid public places such as train stations, bus stations,  this impacts people who travel to the office or home as it could delay the usual process in those places. These activities ensure the protection of citizens from terrorist or underworld attacks on innocent people even though the way of ensuring the security is disturbing their daily schedule.",
        "In summary, it is intuitively obvious that security is a more important factor in a country. Some people myself included strongly believe that people's freedom would violate whereas the government take action to improves the security of the country."
