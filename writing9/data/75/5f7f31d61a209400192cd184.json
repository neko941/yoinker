        "It is a widely held belief that many individuals learn nonnative languages to explore different nations as well as for the sake of work abroad, but there is a strong counter-argument amongst sections of the people that although a significant number of people learn languages of different origins for career and tour. But there are many masses who enthusiastic to enhance their knowledge as well as to do business with overseas clients. However, I am of the opinion that this is a matter to be debated in light of several factors before a reasonable conclusion can be drawn.",
        "The first and foremost reason is that language is a way to express thoughts and exchange information. People mostly prefer to learn the language of the country they are going to visit as this helps them to interact with native speakers, make new friends, and to know their cultural values, therefore decrease language barriers as well as more harmony and understanding. For instance, In 2019, I learned Spanish before visiting Spain thus I am still in contact with five masses from Spain and we have a great bond that taught me the value of common language. The second worth-mentioning the reason here is that for understanding clients' requirements, Common language is profoundly important. Individuals who visit abroad to earn money, always prefer to learn their native language because it helps them to increase their chances of Job such as IELTS, for example, students who move overseas for higher education especially in Canada, USA, or Uk learn the English language to do the part job to pay their fees as well as other expenses.",
        "On the contrary, there are certain groups of people who vehemently contend that people learn a foreign language not only to move to foreign countries, also to enhance their skills as well as for business. Nowadays, multinational companies work with clients from diverse nations, and for this purpose, they hire employees who know languages like French, Spanish, English, and more. For example, Many IT companies hire bidding teams who must aware of distinct language so that they can talk with clients from other countries to gain the trust and to attend the online meetings, conversate with overseas clients to know their requirements. Moreover, to finalize the deal without any misunderstanding. Besides this, sometimes students are eager to learn a new language as a hobby and later on they use it to interact with people online using social media platforms such as Facebook.",
        "To conclude, though people learn a foreign language to relocate to industrialized nations to earn more money and lucrative jobs there is no harm to this perspective. Language helps nations to diminish the language barrier as well as increase global harmony."
