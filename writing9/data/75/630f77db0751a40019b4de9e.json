        "Today, it is asserted that some people are happy to live in one place all their lives, while others would like to live in different places if they get the chance. While emotional memory is certainly important, it is equally important to become familiar with multiple regions.",
        "Firstly, some people want to stay in their homeland for as long as possible. They don't need to learn new things in a new environment, nor do they need to leave behind their childhood friends and relatives. Furthermore, some families build businesses from generation to generation. Therefore, it will be difficult for them to restart their lives in unfamiliar places. For example, some Japanese and Chinese families believe that inheriting the family business is their duty and responsibility, so they can keep their own culture and customs for as long as they want.",
        "On the other hand, others believe that being in different places can bring many benefits, such as a multicultural environment and good opportunities. People need to grasp and practice new things like language and food if they move to a new place. Undoubtedly, they may face many new challenges and problems in their new place of residence, such as following local traditions. For example, areas that restrict wearing certain types of clothing can make it difficult for people to like to wear what they want. However, if the crop seems harmful or unsuitable, you may need to stop at the right time for your benefit.",
        "To conclude, that people originally lived in different places, they should bring their experience and knowledge to the particular society where they live and, in my opinion, where we live it doesn't matter but we have to be useful people to our community."
