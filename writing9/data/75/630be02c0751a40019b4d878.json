Firstly, I knew that you love to watch movies on your's TV  despite your busy schedule at the workplace, but unfortunately, the TV was broken into two pieces while cleaning the house.",
        "As you heard, I decided to clean the house as I felt very bad  looking at all rooms. In addition, the kitchen was really disgusting with the bad smell, Hence, I started cleaning the house by leaving the room, where I hit the TV very hardly with a stick and it got into two pieces and I was in shock for a while and still I do hear the noise in my dream too.",
        "Undoubtedly, the damage cannot be incalculable considering  your's love and passion towards the TV. However, we have some experts who can fix the TV in an immaculate way and I am sure that later there will not be any issue with it. Just trust me and hand over the TV to me and rest I will take care and deliver the TV in brand new condition.",
