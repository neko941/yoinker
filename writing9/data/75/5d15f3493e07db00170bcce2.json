        "I am flying to California tomorrow morning and I will be back by Sunday evening. Although I will be available on messenger for text messages, you can talk to me on my cellphone number for any sort of urgency. I hope that you will have a great time with my cat. It is a darling and lovely friend of mine. It takes meal twice a day, once in the morning and then once in the evening. Animal eatables are kept in the first right draw of my kitchen. Feed it and if possible give it a shower on Sunday morning.",
