        "It is widely believed that culture and tourism add immensely to the gross domestic product (GDP) of any country's economy, hence the need for foreign visitors to pay more. While this might be true, I am certain that this would not be the best of decisions to take, as this step would have more negative effect on the volume of visitors coming in to experience and learn about other people's culture. This could also lead to the locals trivializing their own very culture and attractions.",
        "First of all, making foreign tourist pay more when visiting cultural attractions may discourage individuals who are not from that locality. Foreigners may begin to feel that they are being exploited  and thus hinder them from taking steps  to tour such notable places or partake in the events. For instance, many Nigerians who do not reside in Abeokuta, who would have loved to visit the famous \"Olumo Rock\" situated in Abeokuta, have been repelled by the outrageous entrance fee they have to pay, since  they do  not posses the \"Abeokuta Residents Identification card\" which would have afforded them the opportunity to explore such a place at a lesser fee. In addition to this, joblessness might begin to creep in  for those who work as tourist guides, as the volume of people  to show around would have reduced or even gotten to none eventually.",
        "Although, people believe locals should have better and lesser restrictions to attractions  within their locality, as they have  paid taxes for these attractions to be developed and maintained. It is also very likely that these locals would trivialize such attractions.",
        "Generally, whatsoever is  not paid for has no value. In a situation where the locals are charged lower than their foreign tourist they may not be motivated to take a tour to these places, as no value has been attached to the attractions by the locals. Moreover, many locals feel, it's in my neighbourhood,why should I go there to pay even for a lesser amount of money. So why charge them lower than foreigners?",
        "In conclusion,  though the cultural sector of many countries makes more money from foreigners, it is unwise for them to be charged higher  prices than the local tourist as these would cause a  reduction in the number of those who visit, thereby causing a significant drop in tourist revenue. I therefore recommended that both locals and foreigners be made to pay equally."
