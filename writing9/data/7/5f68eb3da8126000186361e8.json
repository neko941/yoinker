        "Although there is evidence that proves to walk and do other physical activities promote a healthy life, the number of individuals who walk frequently has significantly decreased. Currently, the lockdown amid the COVID-19 pandemic has allowed a more sedentary lifestyle. Moreover, people prefer using cars and public transport to move because they do not have enough time to walk according to high job exigences.",
        "Firstly, due to the current pandemic, people are getting used to walking far less than before. This is because citizens only left their homes exceptionally, such as going to the doctor or working as an essential worker. On the one hand, most people work at home connecting virtual trough platforms such as Zoom or Google Meet. On the other hand, most purchases are online without having to walk to get food or indispensable products. As a result of these habits, health disorders are rising, being a serious problem nowadays. For example, the last report of the Ministry Heath shows that obesity has rapidly increased during the quarantine due to the lack of physical activities as walking.",
        "Secondly, workdays are transforming in prolonged periods without rest. For that reason, it seems to be much more convenient for people, driving or moving by public transport instead of walking. In this way, they believe they are maximizing their free time; however, these sedentary behaviours lead to obesity. Furthermore, this situation is very worrying since diabetes and hypertension have increased alarmingly, being disorders associated with sedentary life. In addition, unfortunately, children learn from their parents' routines, and it is expected that these behaviours will impact children soon.",
        "The sedentary lifestyle problem is related to multiple factors. Concerning the exposed points, it is necessary to make the population aware of the harmful effects of life without physical exercise. Walking is a primary activity that human beings must perform to maintain health. It is the responsibility of governments to promote healthy lifestyles, for example, through health education campaigns. Besides, in jobs, time could be allocated to walk during breaks. On the other hand, the use of vehicles could be restricted."
