In addition, during that holiday, Vietnamese usually wear Ao Dai which I gave you on your 22nd birthday last year, if I remember exactly, you were so excited wearing our traditional cloth.",

Luckily, the lion dance festival will be back, after two years of cancelling due to the pandemic, they can show the members how to dance properly and perform as a lion. I believe you will have a lot of fun at the festival.",
