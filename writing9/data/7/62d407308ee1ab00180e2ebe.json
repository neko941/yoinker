        "Today we living in an era where  technology is dominating our lives. Traditional shopping outlets are among the places, where we see a lot of changes due to the hype of technology in recent times. I raise my hand to the individuals who support this notion, and the following paragraphs will analyze two factors that contribute to the affirmation and also to my opinion.",
        "One of the most significant factors that  keep me agreeing with the title is, that online shopping is providing an alternative solution to the energy crisis happening around the world. For instance, Japan is testing a drone-based delivery system as a solution for the people who visit the shops to buy goods. Up to now, they say they have good results than they expected initially. Moreover, the government of Japan has mentioned, that there is a remarkable improvement in the fuel management system, and they suspect drone delivery is playing its part to support this.  Therefore this makes a clear indication, that the world is moving away from  traditional shopping, and there are more challenges that we need to think of.",
        "Secondly, web trading systems offer their customers a wide range of selections to fulfil their needs. For example, the sites like Alibaba, E-bay, and Amazon are good examples that a buyer can think of  if he or she needs to buy something at a one-stop. It also provides a wide range of discounts when we buy something. In contrast, a customer can't expect these things to happen when he visits a physical store. In addition, they might need to visit a few places to buy something or to get a bargain. Because of these things, people are now on a trend to move away from the stores that we see in our cities.",
        "To encapsulate my writing, I reiterate that online shopping platforms will replace the traditional methods of trading because they provide the solutions for their burning problems like fuel shortage,  as well as the attractive offers that they provide. One day, there will be a need to shut down the physical business and move into the digital revolution we all get satisfied with."
