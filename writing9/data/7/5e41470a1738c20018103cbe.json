        "Throwing parties can be quite expensive. While some people don\u2019t find the worth to spend huge amount on social and professional fancy gathering, others opine that it\u2019s essential for both, individuals and society.",
        "To embark with, people choose to throw parties due to various reasons. For starters, they can make better teams. For example, project kick-off parties are specially planned by the company to break the ice between the team and help them to know each other better. Moreover, parties can add the sense of achievement of success and can make great lifetime memories. Furthermore, nowadays companies allocate a specific budget for social parties and gathering amongst their team, which eventually helps to develop the employee friendly environment and a communication amongst the team.",
        "On the flip side, even though parties help to a make better social network , it also can create tension among society. Few people are introvert and they feel difficult and uncomfortable in the crowd, such terminology in psychological language is called \u201csocial anxiety disorder\u201d. Such people feel that parties are a huge burden and stress for them and they find very difficult to catch up. In addition, everybody cannot afford to throw the expensive parties. Throwing such might become extremely stressful and financial burden on them.",
        "To put this in a nutshell, I pen down, saying that, even though arranging parties have few negative drawbacks, it is a form of social gathering which brings numerous benefits to individuals and society. To overcome negative side, it is essential to plan a party in a smart way to cut the spending and avoid the stress with limiting resources."
