        "As per the regulation of this building, any technical problems are relayed to the maintenance team. They did fix it as requested, however, it seems they didn't do a good job. We contacted their office for a follow-up repair and they said we're on queue, for there are others before us that requested their service.",
        "We've been patient in understanding our current situation but this heating problem has been going on for days now. I'm suggesting for you to add more technical crew with better skills. If being understaffed is the problem, then maybe you need to hire more.",
        "I hope you understand our current predicament and I'm expecting you to solve it as soon as the soonest.",
        "Yours truly,",
