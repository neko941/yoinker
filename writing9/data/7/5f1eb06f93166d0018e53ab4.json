        "Most people declared that nuclear energy is a more superior alternative to deal with higher appeal. Nuclear potential, one of the most significant solution to vitality scarcity, yet it is disagreeable for developing this type of capacity since it is still used for military  in today\u2019s world.",
        "On the one hand, there are two main reasons why nuclear should be particularly limited. First, nuclear is mostly applied for national military, especially in many superpowers, such as United States, Russia, or China. It is archived that many military\u2019 superpowers have launched at least hundreds of nuclear weapons since mid-20th century. Worldwide\u2019 superpowers today are racing to scramble the rank of the strongest weapon system. Whenever the race escalates, the nuclear war could occur unexpectedly, followed by the instant end of humanity on Earth. Second, nuclear stamina for military can also affect Earth\u2019s biodiversity and climate. It is researched that nuclear wars can lead to lifelong climate issues, with lower global temperatures, ozone depletion and also species extinction.",
        "On the other hand, if nuclear capacity is accurately used and only for solving the increasing demand, it could particularly benefit humans. Today, the nuclear reactors, applied from various nuclear reactions, can provide usable nuclear capacity, and it can significantly solve the rising claim of it. Additionally, it is considered carbon-free, and it can handle radioactive substances.",
        "To sum up, only by demanding and using nuclear vitality correctly and wisely can it response sufficient demand and reduce pollution, while its requirement for military should be particularly reduced."
