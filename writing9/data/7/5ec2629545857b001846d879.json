        "In today\u2019s world, there is an increase in the use of new technology which monitors people through their cell phones and surveillance cameras. Most of the times, people are even unaware about being monitored.",
        "",
        "In my opinion, I believe that monitoring by the Government is far more advantageous that its detrimental effects. The surveillance keeps public safe in public places by stopping any threat.",
        "",
        "Firstly, the increase in surveillance through cameras has stopped a lot of threats which would otherwise have been unnoticed. As the cameras are being installed in public places, such as malls, streets, and even public gatherings have the advantage that every moment is tracked and is a very effective deterrent for the criminals who tend to do opportunistic crimes in public places. Moreover, surveillance due to security cameras on the traffic light has effectively reduced accidents. In addition, people have started to be more conscious while driving because if caught on the camera, it will result in getting a ticket.",
        "",
        "Another, a main monitoring technology that is most often and easily used is the cell phone tracking. By using the data of travel activity and location has helped to solve a large number of crime mysteries.  As a result of this the crimes for instance, kidnaping  has stopped  and solved by tracking the criminals cell phone by using the cell phone towers locations and thus, saving many precious lives . This is providing a platform for the security agencies to stop the crime from happening.",
        "",
        "In conclusion, I think that monitoring people without their knowledge provides a path  to reduce crime and importantly helps in reducing threats."
