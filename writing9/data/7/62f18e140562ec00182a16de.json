        "The youngsters who live in specific regions in the US are not permitted to be outside without an accompanying adult at certain hours of the night. I believe such type of curfew benefits the teens, although it might seem very restrictive. Since teenagers are susceptible to being in danger of various threats,  an older person can protect them. Addiction and being affected by criminals are the two subjects that can be avoided by introducing such restrictions.",
        "In recent years, drugs have influenced many communities of society and younger groups are more targeted by drug dealers. For instance, young people in the US are exposed to different forms of meta-amphetamines, and these sorts of drugs have become more accessible than before. Moreover, parents are concerned about the addictiveness of such chemical substances while they are more in hand in nightclubs and parties. Hence, curfews could allow the parents to control their children by preventing them from going to danger zones.",
        "In addition, the rate of crime is higher at the night than in the mornings. Even though the teenagers might not be directly involved in crime, being in dangerous areas at the wrong time would detrimentally affect them. For instance, thefts are more active in dark times of the day  they can they can abuse younger or steal their precious belongings. As a result",
        ", being accompanied by an older person could be an alarm for such malicious people, and prevent any sorts of bad behaviours.",
        "In conclusion, despite the fact that a curfew could violate teenagers' freedom, it could help them to preserve themselves from the dangerous consequences of being outside at late times. Therefore, it allows them to keep their belongings safe while it ensures the parents that their children are doing well without being exposed to dangerous drugs and addiction."
