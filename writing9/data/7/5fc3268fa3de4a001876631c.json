        "Due to ever-evolving lifestyles in all over the world, nowadays fast food consumption is soaring. Some people think this is a positive behaviour, while others believe that this is a negative trend. In my opinion, this is a negative trend because fast food is often unhealthy as well as promotes sedentary lifestyles.",
        "First of all, fast food is usually prepared with too much oil which is dangerous to our cardiovascular health. As oil allows faster cooking times, more and more chefs in fast food restautants are utilizing oil in their recipes. For instance, researchers from National Australia University found that more than eighty percent of the famous fast food restaurants such as Burger King and Mc Donalds have been used the same oil for more than six plates. This study suggests that this cooking standard is a serious risk for the population health. Thus, going out for a fast dinner or a fast lunch are risks that we need to be aware.",
        "On the other hand, fast food advertisement is always encouraging a sedentary lifestyle. The most famous brands of fast food are encouraging people to wait at home for faster delivery times, while customers are watching TV. For example, Mc Donalds has launched several marketing campaigns based on actors who are starving and watching movies. At the same time, Mc Donalds proposes to deliver by one-click on its application, while customers do not need to move from their couches. Indirectly, throughout several campaigns, this brand is enforcing their customers follow a lazy life which has a negative impact for the health.",
        "In conclusion, increasing consumption of fast food is a negative trend because fast food offers risks for our health and enforce incentives to follow wrong lifestyles."
