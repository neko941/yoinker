        "I completely disagree with people who argue that as long as athletes play well in their specific field, it is not important if they behave immorally. thus, I will describe my own reasons to prove that being good in a sport\u2019s branch is not more important than behaving appropriately in sportsmen\u2019s and sportswomen\u2019s life.",
        "On the one hand, because of two main reasons, athletes\u2019 role to have a healthy or unhealthy society is considerable. Firstly, they are some kind of role model for a huge range of society, specifically for the younger generation. Secondly, thanks to the internet based platforms, following athletes\u2019 lifestyle becomes more easy, compared to the past years. On the contrary, parental control over children becomes harder than the few years ago consequently. So, it is obvious that if athletes use inappropriate words or behave aggressively, teenagers could get affected easily.",
        "On the other hand, the rate of selling of a specific advertisement, could be affected by athletes. To explain more, there are a lot of advertising companies which use athletes\u2019 popularity such a trump card to sell their products, like Nike and Adidas, etc. So, if an athlete behaves inappropriately, his/her popularity is affected and people\u2019s tendency to use that companies\u2019 products, is decreased, which could get affected advertisement companies\u2019 benefits.",
        "To sum up, I do disagree with this idea which states as long as sportsmen and sportswomen play well, they can behave inappropriately. In other words, because of two reasons, I believe that the quality of playing could not conquest on the quality of their behaviour. Firstly, their behaviour could affect advertising companies\u2019 benefits. Secondly, they are a role model for an enormous range of the younger generation, thus could affect negatively society\u2019s health by their misbehaviour."
