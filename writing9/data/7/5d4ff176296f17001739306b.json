        "In recent times, teaching young people about being good citizens has sparked great debates about whether this is the responsibility of their families or school. Although several people say that this is their parents\u2019 task, I believe that school is a better place for educating this.",
        "On one hand, some people think that families should be the ones who tell their children about being good people. This is because family is the smallest and the fundamental unit in society; thus, people in this unit should be the first group to teach them about this. For example, a latest study found that over 70% of children who have grown in crime families tend to commit serious crimes when they are adults than others. However, I do not agree with this idea since they spend most of their time at school; additionally, families should focus on making them happy and keeping them safe.",
        "On the other hand, other people feel that schools have more effect on this than parents. A strong reason for this is that interaction between students provided valuable opportunities to see the consequences of their actions. Moreover, students spend majority of their time here. For instance, a recent research found that everyday children aged 7 years to 15 years spend about 10 hours at school, while about 6 hours of their time are spent in their homes with their parents. Therefore, I agree that teachers and friends have more influence as well as more responsibility to make a child become a good member of society than parents.",
        "In conclusion, people at school should responsible for helping children to learn about doing good thing while their families should focus more on their safety and their well being due to most of their time spent at their schools and limited time with their parents."
