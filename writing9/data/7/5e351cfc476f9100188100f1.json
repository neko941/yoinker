        "I am an international student at the University of Toronto. I borrowed a book named \u201cFeedback control system\u201d on Monday afternoon from your library and I have to return it on Friday.",
        "After I borrowed the book from the library, I read it for some time at the library and went for home. I usually use bus for travelling, there were very less people on the bus on that day, and nearly all seats were empty. While I was travelling from library to my home, I received a call from my mother and I put my book on the seat next to me to attend the call and forgot to pick it up.",
        "I contacted the bus company and explain the situation, but they can not find it anywhere. I went to check it myself and requested them personally to check again, but all in vain. I am an international student and already living hand to mouth, therefore I would not be able to pay the price of the book at once.",
        "I am writing to you to know what can be done now? Is there any penalty or I have to buy the same book to replace the old one? Is there any chance I can compensate the loss other than paying for it?",
        "Looking forward to your reply. Kindly keep my situation in mind and write to me as soon as possible.",
        "Yours faithfully,",
