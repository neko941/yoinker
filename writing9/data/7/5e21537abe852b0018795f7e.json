        "It is often believed by many that to check the compatibility between partners, they should live together. However, others think that due to this, people indulge in unethical activities and only the emotional attachment is a factor which ensures that relationship will be long lasting. In my opinion, partners must spend quality time before marriage and sentimental attachments along with trust on the other person are necessary for a durable connection.",
        "There is an increase trend of living together before marriage, in order to develop understanding. Everyone has habits which are dear to them, but it is quite irritating for others. As an illustration, my friend lived with her to be husband for four months and found out that they cannot accept the differences, present between them.   Hence, partners must spend quality time with each other to avoid problems in the future.",
        "The factor which is necessary for the durability of the relationship is emotional attachment. The relationship growth depends on the positive sentiments towards a person. The emotional attachment predicts the outcome of a couple dreams. Furthermore, the trust of a person is mandated for strong family connections. It is the base of a happy family and it ensures the ultimate happiness in the afterlife of the couples. Therefore, the positive feelings and a trust over partner is crucial for the durable alliance",
        "To conclude, many believe in order to understand each other and to check the compatibility, partners must live together before the wedding. Owing to this, people tend to involve themselves in immoral acts and only the emotional attachment defines the durability of a relation. In my view,  a specific amount of time must be spent before the marriage, emotional attachment  and trust are needed for long lasting relations."
