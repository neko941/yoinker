        "Over the past few decades,  unprecedented discoveries in the importance of recycling have taken the world by storm. It is often argued that governments should shoulder  more responsibilities in terms of preserving the environment. From my perspective, authorities can enhance the situation by coming up with new obligatory rules, which will be discussed in this essay.",
        "One indisputable prerequisite for enforcing citizens to recycle is to legalise regulations. Such demand can only be done by the legislative power and executive officials. Thus, it is both a privilege and an obligation for governments to set up a series of rules for the public to obey when recycling.",
        "Lack of consistency is another potential threat if the governments sit idly by. Successful and efficient recycling requires substantial organising. Therefore, governments entitled to deploy national resources are phenomenal in establishing the process of recycling. For instance, China, has segmented recycled items by materials into 9 categories. Such policy has an exceptional impact on shortening the time for later collecting and tackling.",
        "Some people may insist that recycling is a waste of money since the process is time-consuming and costly. Admittedly, recycling requires substantial money and manpower. However, litter were generated by no one but  human beings. Despite recycling could be expensive, humans should consider this as  redemption in order to create a better environment for our further generations and beyond.",
        "By way of conclusion, I believe the benefits of recycling far outweigh its drawbacks. Moreover, global authorities should announce and teach the people that recycling is obligatory."
