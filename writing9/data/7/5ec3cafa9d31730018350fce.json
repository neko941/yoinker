        "In the contemporary world, the concern for the degrading environment is at the peak. Some people believe it is difficult for an individual to make a difference, while others feel it cannot be solved without authorities intervening in the matter. Both of these views will be discussed.",
        "",
        "To begin, many believe the task of saving mother nature is tedious for a single person. But if we introduce minor alterations to our day-to-day activities, we could probably eradicate the detrimental causes to our environment. For instance, we can always bring along a recycling bag while shopping so that usage of the plastic bag would decrease. These will definitely help in minimising the air pollution caused by burning plastic bags. Thus, such actions of an individual could lead to a healthy society.",

        "However, apart from peoples actions, governments also has a pivotal role in providing funds for research purposes to checks to whether activities disrupting our ecosystem. Governments can impose stringent rules to be followed by its people. For example, the usage of plastic bags should be completely banned in the country, and this can only be forced by authorities. These regulations require judiciary powers to implement which reside with the respective officials. For this reason, the government plays the cardinal part in a process of abolishing effects causing damage to nature.",
        "To sum up, firmly acknowledge the governments have a prominent role in resolving these issues. As, environmental degradation is increasing at an enormous rate, the problem ought to be tackled by the governments across the globe with collaboration with people."
