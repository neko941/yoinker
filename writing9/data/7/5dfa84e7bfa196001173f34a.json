        "These days, in many families there are multiple vehicles for every individual. Most of the people nowadays prefer traveling to offices, colleges or for some personal work by their personal car or other automobiles. This can cause traffic issues through which consequences such as delay to work or important places can take place. The reason being, it is debatable around the world that the taxation on personal use cars should be high, through which the government can make better quality of public transportation services. In this essay, I am going to discuss some of the pros and cons of this regime, and exemplify it to some extent.",
        "To start with, let us look at some advantages of such a solution. Firstly, through such implementation, the volume of traffic will go down. To illustrate, if high taxes will be charged by the government, many people will automatically stop using personal cars. This will reduce the congestion on the roads and provide smooth traffic all around. Another major positive from this will be that, the public transport quality will be enhanced and different services can be launched such as upgraded buses and metros can be introduced for better connectivity in cities.",
        "On the other hand, there are some cons to such taxations as well. Many people will get demotivate to buy own vehicles. To explain this, by seeing the high tax rates, individuals will stop investing in purchasing personal cars and spend on other alternatives. Furthermore, this will also affect the government tax collections. Another negative consequence of this policy can be that, it can put a burden on public transportation. As more and more people will switch to the option of public vehicles, the pressure to provide frequent services and better connectivities will immerge and this will backfire the government itself.",
        "To conclude, the idea of taxing personal cars is good. However, we have to find a balanced approach to the usage of such vehicles and public transports. So that, there can be less traffic hauls in the town."
