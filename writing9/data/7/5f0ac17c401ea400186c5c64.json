        "The status of the animals in the modern society has become a controversial topic, dividing individuals into two main groups. Some of them consider that they have the right to use the animals for various reasons such as work, research or as a source of food. On the other hand, others believe that animals should not be exploited and moreover they should be granted similar rights to humans. I partially agree with this argument and this essay will analyse both views before reaching a conclusion.",
        "On the one hand, numerous animals are exploited by humans in unimaginable cruel ways. Firstly, despite the enormous technological upheavals of the 20th century, a large proportion of animals such as donkeys and horses are still used for traction on farms across the world. Those animals are often required to do heavy work such as pulling carts and loads as well as carrying loads, which can result in physical damage and even death. Secondly, a large proportion of animals are kept in cages in zoos in cruel conditions and they spend all their lives in a captive environment. Thirdly, other animals are illegally killed for commercial purposes such as elephants for their ivory tusks. Consequently, because of all the aforementioned reasons it can be argued that it is inhumane to exploit animals and they should be granted at least the right to live in freedom, if not similar rights to humans.",
        "On the other hand, critics argue that animals should be used for food and research. Firstly, it is well known that a significant proportion of our food is coming from animals such as meat, dairy or eggs. It can be argued that humans rely on animals for their food, and as long as another food alternative is found to provide similar nutrients as animal-based food, people have no choice but to eat animal products. Secondly, numerous vaccines and drugs are tested on animals before they are used on humans. Even if it can be considered a barbaric activity by some advocates of animal rights, it should be acknowledged that currently there is no other option to develop innovative medications, unless people volunteer to have those drugs tested on themselves instead of animals. As long as humans do not have access to technologies that could replace animal research or food completely, there is no other option, but to keep using them, until new technologies will be invented.",
        "In conclusion, I believe that we should stop using animals for work, entertainment or commercial purposes. However, given the current situation people have no other options, but to continue using them for food and research, at least until humanity will have access to new technologies that provide alternative sources of food and research."
