        "It is often argued that smoking in public should be prohibited, while some think otherwise. This essay will explain both views before giving a conclusion.",
        "On the one hand, smoking in public ignores the right of non-smokers to inhale clean and fresh air. Firstly, smoking can cause harm to the smoker, as well, as to those who inhale it. Adults and children are most common highly affected by this kind of activity. It causes diseases in non-smokers like lung cancer and tuberculosis. Smoking in public also invites those individuals that stop smoking to engage in that kind of activity because of the smell it produces. It also causes annoyance to people that smell a foul odour that came from smoking.  In addition, smoking can cause harm to the environment as well. It causes pollution to the area where there is the majority of people and sometimes once an individual has done smoking, they just throw the remains everywhere.",
        "On the other hand, Banning to smoke in public will cause outrage among those engaging in the activity. They will feel that they are suppressed by the government because their freedom to smoke in public places we're denied. Smoking is like an addiction to those uses. Some say that it is a way for them to relieve the stress and pressure that they experience in their daily life. Once a person engages in smoking, it is hard for them to stop. What's more, banning smoking in public will cause some businesses to deflate, like the tobacco sector, bars and pubs.",
        "In my opinion, smoking should be banned in public places with respect to people who don't smoke and those that stopped smoking. Although they should be provided with  a private area in which they smoke freely, because, unfortunately, it is difficult for smokers to quit smoking just because the government said so."
