        "Today, I went there to buy some items, but, unfortunately, I slipped on the floor due to the water on the floor. As I have seen, the refrigerator kept in the corner was damaged by dint of that there was some leakage in the freezer from where the water is flowing down on the ground. However, I got some injuries on my leg and arm. Thus, I want to write this letter to you so that you should take some immediate action for this.",
        "In addition, I have some recommendation to hold back these kind of mishaps. Firstly, you should put a sign which is easily visible to everyone. For instance,  a big yellow coloured cone shaped wet floor caution. Also, keep watching the surveillance cameras on the regular basis to keep you up-to-date so that some instant steps must be taken in these circumstances. At the end, I request you to repair the fridge immediately before any other disaster happens.",
        "I look forward to receiving your reply and hope that you take my advice seriously. Thank you in advance for considering my perspectives.",
