        "In the olden days, many people stitch their outfits and repair things at home by themselves. Presently, this trend is declining because of the excessive provision of a commercial tailor, carpenters, and other skilled workers. Moreover, people become busier, and they do not have enough time to spend on it. Similarly, this trend is reducing in my country also.",
        "In the present day, people do not have enough time and skills to stitch their cloth and doing menial work at their homes. That's because people are spending plenty of time to enhance their professional careers and after work do not feel to have enough energy for the repairs and stitching. The provision of many paid professionals who stitch the cloth with utmost perfection, new style, and in a short span of time comes on-board. Also, people can buy ready-made outfits from fabric shops. Similarly, with small repairs at home like drilling, changing electric switches,to assemble faucets, these days, people hire professionals to perform such works.",
        "In my country, Pakistan, a similar trend prevailing day by day.",
        "I remember, In my home, my mother and grandmother used to stitch their clothes and curtains for windows and balcony. Similarly, My father used to repair iron, cassette players, drilling on walls, and changing switched every time as needed. Nowadays the young generation is flamboyant, and does not want to waste their time in such things because they easily purchase their clothes from shops and discard any home item if it needs repair and buy a new one.",
        "To summarize, I agree, the olden trends are speedily declining around the world along with my country."
