        "I am Mai Maher, the mother of Seif`s, who is in the second year of the kindergarten. I am writing to you regarding the field trip, which is organized by school to be abroad, as I, buoyantly, ask to join it.",
        "In fact, my son eagerly anticipates this journey, counting the remaining days to travel, but since he is just five years, I could not leave him alone for three days in faraway place. This drove me to ask you to accompany the participant group.",
        "However, I am a registered doctor, particularly a pediatrician, so I can provide any helping hand for youngsters freely. I always carry the First Aid bag with me, which I will bring during the trip to be ready for any contingency.",
        "Further and even more importantly, though, I wonder if you could give me more details about the itinerary of the journey in order to take a holiday from my job. Moreover, I would be grateful if you send to me the hotel name and its telephone number. Eventually, the number of students, who will participate, is imperative to bring adequate tools.",
        "Thank you for your time, consideration, and forthcoming response.",
        "Yours sincerely,",
        "Mai Maher."
