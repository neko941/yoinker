        "There is a huge range of resources available to the modern teacher, and the right selection is crucial in delivering effective lessons. I agree that there will be a place for course books in the school curriculum, despite the many benefits of the Inter.",
        "Firstly, manual books have been developed by pedagogical experts and designed to be incorporated into a subject syllabus, leading to testing procedures such as student\u2019s formal examinations or continuous assessment. This means that they provide to improve student\u2019s academic achievement, enhancing their potential for progressing to further or higher education. Furthermore, the use of modern book course books allows pupils to coordinate their studies as part of group work, helpfully making their lessons less teacher-led and more about autonomous learning.  This is itself teaches study skills such as independent research and synthesising sources, rather than old-fashioned rote-learning. This is where the Internet, in fact, can play a useful part to supplement and add to the knowledge which the students are assimilating via their course books.  However, it is the role of teachers and school management generally to ensure that the use of the Internet remains a guided learning process and not an exercise in data-gathering from Internet sources, which may be unreliable or even misleading.",
        "It is true that the Internet can be invaluable for adults who are able to discriminate between sources and sift information to marshal facts. However, this is a mature skill, and we should not assume that school-age pupils are ready.",
        "In conclusion, I  am firmly convinced that that coursebook with their quality and depth of material, are set to remain an integral part of the syllabus. The Internet can be judged as a useful supplement to this if used carefully and under supervision."
