        "Recently, the use of machines in houses and offices has increased tremendously. This could be due to the advancement in technology and in my opinion, I believe it is a  step in the right direction.",
        "The predominance of using automated machines in carrying out jobs could be due to the improvement in technological devices. That is to say,  there has been an increase in the production of numerous machines that could carry out different specific functions. As a result of this, the systems are now readily available and affordable to the majority, hence their prominent use. For example, the survey done by the Department of Expenditure, Ministry of Finance in Nigeria, revealed that the percentage of washing and vacuum cleaners purchased by Nigerians increased from35%  to 80% in the year 2015 due to the increased number and competitive prices.",
        "On the other hand, this development considered to be advantageous because of the following reasons. Firstly, these devices help to get work done in a short time. In other words, they have been found to complete work 85times faster than humans as seen in the washing of clothes and assembling of automobiles. Secondly, they have been known to reduce hazards at workplaces. For instance, the occurrence of injuries sustained by workers during manufacturing has reduced drastically since the involvement of these systems in some strategic stages of production especially those which require lifting of heavy objects and cutting of materials. Lastly, human errors have been brought to the nearest minimum. For example, in the pharmaceutical industry where measurements are vital, these have assisted in curbing inaccuracies, thereby improving health.",
        "In conclusion, robots have indeed helped in allaying fears in various spheres of life in present times and in my view, I think they are plus to society because of the several advantages they provide."
