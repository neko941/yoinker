        "A lot of small businesses have been closing down because of their inability to compete with large shopping malls. There are some reasons for these problems, namely more convenient, high quality of facilities and better services. In my opinion, the local government should be more strict about pricing and the small shop should use the new way of selling goods.",
        "First of all, the variety of things that large shopping complexes have can effectively make the local shop close due to its shortage of goods in the store. Thus, supermarket provides a wide range of services for the customers, especially for the parents who want to spend their time with their children, also it can save a lot of their time and promotions that cannot be provided by the small shops. Therefore it can make the small shop closed down and increase the unemployment rate to the local communities.",
        "The local government needs to put a cap on the prices of the fundamental products and control them strictly. This will make sure that supermarket chains cannot dictate the pricing and eventually helps local shops to sustain themselves. Also, small businesses can use e-commerce as a new way of shopping by letting the customers do online shopping, it\u2019ll help people who cannot travel for a long distance and benefit the owner itself.",
        "To conclude, even though the large shops tend to benefit the community more than local shops and crush small shops to the point of bankruptcy, but small shops can improve the businesses by using a strategic plan be adapted to the current market trend and make it on par with the large supermarket."
