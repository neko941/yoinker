So, I had to rush bathing in order to get ready soon for my morning sessions or should wake up early for using the washrooms before she uses it. Because of this, I had to reach my classess late and thus missing out important lessons. This made my schedule hectic as I had to prepare both the missed out and the current lessons on my own which is extremely uncomfortable ad stressed.",
