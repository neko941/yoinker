        "It is inevitably true that Environment has been damaged since a long time with human actions causing adverse effects to the individuals. Cities have huge implications that only big industries and factories cause more damage rather than surrounding issues. Is our environment damaging only due to big industries? Well, let's look into the some of the paramount effects leading to dangerous effects.",
        "Firstly, the main important problem affecting our environment is \"Pollution\" . The pollution coming from many ways like traffic, vehicles, sound, etc. In fact, Sound and vehicle pollution has been raising day to day having to release pollutant gases into the atmosphere which in turn causing depletion of the ozone layer leads to the greenhouse effect. Moreover, these dangerous gases in the atmosphere cause many severe diseases to people.  For example, In 2008, 50 children died due to severe diseases which are caused by the surroundings. The Government has to take some measures to control the pollution and as an individual responsibility to take control and save the environment.",
        "Secondly,  the another crucial point to discuss is deforestation ie., cutting down trees and digging the lands for human uses effecting the mother nature and many animals in the forest.  In addition, deforestation is also a main reason for housing purposes as the population is increasing there is a narrow line of the lands. For instance- recently, the biggest Nallamala forest in India has been deforesting for uranium mining purposes and after many disputes over the issue the higher authorities stopped the digging and took action to protect the environment. The issue has been raised and shared all over by the public through social media, which went viral and had huge changes in the conditions. Likewise, individuals play a vital role in protecting the environment.",
        "To conclude, there are many ways to protect and save the environment as aforementioned and it is the responsibility of the Government and every citizen to take part in such actions making our environment crisp, clean and green."
