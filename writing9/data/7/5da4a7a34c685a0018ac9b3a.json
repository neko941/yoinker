        "Even though it is taught that by some having the priceless education and health-related services are crucial to provide by their governments, others claim that such onus is on the individuals themselves to save money for their prospective issues. In my opinion, the governments should shoulder the responsibility of funding the medical care and educational career through its taxis.",
        "The people are of the opinion that the authorities are in the charge of their societies\u2019 tuition and medical fees on account of people paying extra taxes to their governments so as to the provision of the social care; such as treatment, educating, etc. To clarify more, people of all walks of life, either the poor and the well off, are entitled to take sufficient medical care for their family and sending their offspring to the school without any payments.",
        "The opponents of the governmental fund of health care and education think that although the people charge for the taxes, their outlays are based on their income; therefore, it may leave a profound impact on the wealthy peoples\u2019 motivations to strive, when they realize they gain the equal social care versus their payment ratios. To illustrate more, the government of Canada has recently stated that the rate of the capitalist immigrated increase by 12% in 2017 just for the sake of lacking the balance between the revenue and the potential facilities in the future.",
        "In conclusion, I opine that the education and healthcare are indeed pivotal in a society. As for, the communities work hard to support their government to guarantee the amelioration of their lives in the future."
