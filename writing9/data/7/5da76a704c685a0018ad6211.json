        "Local authorities are funding for various sectors like, sports. In the same context, there are people who expect that the government should support games requiring physical strength and exercise facilities for all. In my view, this can create a healthy lifestyle and overall well-being of a nation. Additionally, this can create employment prospects for many.",
        "To begin with, owing to the sedentary lifestyle many individuals are facing health issues such as, obesity and excessive weight. And, compulsion made by such bodies can oblige people to abide by it. For example, countries like Japan has strict regulations in terms of junk food and unhealthy food consumption. This has prepared a healthy outlook of its people. Hence, encouragement from local bodies to supply free fitness trainings can prove to be effective by minimizing practise of bad habits causing health concerns.",
        "Moreover, opening many gymnasiums and fitness centres can support employment options. Enthusiasts as well as  beginners can potentially have job opportunities in these places.  For instance, in many nations staying fit is a norm and exercises are taught for less or no price. This has not only created jobs for many, but improved the society entirely. Therefore, it implies that more career prospects are possible within these areas.",
        "In conclusion, the government spending for free sports and fitness facilities can greatly benefit the masses by opening up career opportunities, and it can also inculcate healthy living among individuals."
