        "Employment in current times demands an applicant to have field talent rather than only academic intelligence. Since in the future, an employee may not be judged on the education he has completed. I partially agree with the view held, as theory aids practical knowledge.",
        "Practical skills over theoretical knowledge have been a long held debate by psychologists. During childhood, one is taught basic education through practical learning, for instance, identifying birds, people, surroundings etc. In school, formal learning forms the basis of foundation for the person to establish his skills further. However, as one proceeds to university theory is accompanied with certain practical knowledge as in the case of science. This is conducted, as mere learning may not help the student to understand the reaction of chemicals just by learning the formulas. Even in a subject such as, mathematics real-life situations are associated with to help pupils learn counting skills. But, once we are educated with degrees in place we head to the job market to earn money. However, organizations test our skills on the field along with the knowledge acquired from books.",
        "Employers often require a certain set of qualifications when selecting a particular candidate. Even though practical skills are vital, they are dependent on written words. For example, if a person were to apply as a surgeon, he would have to study procedures to tackle different kinds of surgeries. Learning on the job, is often the concern for companies, but they are not willing to take the risk if a person has no knowledge of the field.",
        "In conclusion, there will always be a requirement to have paper-based degrees, as it will be with on-field skills."
