        "Presently, infants mostly preferred  technology-based things for playing but puzzles and board games played an important role in a youngster's growth.\u00a0Things like puzzle dice and paper Sudoku are more beneficial to them. An upcoming paragraph is described with the relevant explanation.",
        "To commence with, development among children is mostly a concern issue for the parents because they want that their children would be perfect in all aspects.\u00a0 Along with  education , which is boon for a younger ones to gain knowledge about studies, physical growth is necessary to stimulate simultaneously with mental. \"Health is wealth\". Physical and mental health are closely related.\u00a0At an\u00a0early age, children are more capable to learn new things because the developing brain has the efficiency to grab it. For instance, instead of giving modern technological games or gadgets to children puzzles or board games such as Sudoku and chess in which more mental energy is required to solve, have more advantages than others. Thus, it will develop mental power.",
        "However board game is a good combination between Strategies and entertainment. it is undeniable that puzzles and pictures are likely to put emphasis on individual development since people often spent time concentrating on these things alone.\u00a0 Participants can have fun with other players while their thinking is well developed through playing these board games.",
        "In conclusion, despite the arguments  puzzles and drawing pictures can be good for children's development. I am more convinced that children should be given a chance to play board games which have more benefits in terms of enhancing strategic mindset and interaction with others."
