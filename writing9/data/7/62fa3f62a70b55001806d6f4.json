        "It is true that in today's scenario, the crime rate is increasing day by day ,however, most students get influenced by television which has deleterious effects on offspring behaviour. Personally, I completely agree with this statement which I will discuss in upcoming paragraphs with relevant examples and conclusions.",
        "To commence with, Firstly the violence increase day by day which is done by students because they get influenced by films which are telecast on television as a result they inspire by that films . Moreover, they also see so many actions movie with their parents and they perform dangerous stunts. For example, in Delhi, there is one student who performed such a dangerous stunt as a result he face many problems.",
        "Secondly, they also do robbery in their daily routine to full fill their needs. Furthermore, most of the masses want a luxurious lifestyle as well as they also want their life as they see on television . So they start crimes to fulfil their desires and wishes. Additionally, they are also aware of drugs while seeing television  talk that drugs they also to crimes and they also bully others because they are  jealous of another person who does great work in their life . Further, they are also aware of some harmful weapons .",
        "To commence with, television has a take  bad impact on individual lives as they start crime in their daily life to fulfil their basic needs then that they are also aware of drugs harmful to their health and they use harmful weapons in their daily life as well as they also demanded that weapons from their parents more than that, they also aware about dangerous stunts and they are performance that India daily life too and the facial any problems to reduce that 5 the film industry is should also stop on the violent action that they create in their film."
