        "In most nations,biological parents are allowed to decide to send their wards to single-gender institutes or mixed-sex academies.A certain number of individuals believe that undergraduate learning from one-sex institutes has consequences in the forthcoming.I partially agree with this thesis,in my upcoming,paragraphs I will discuss both viewpoints and will give my opinion with relevant examples.",
        "On the one hand,learners who are studying in single-gender faculties are more into their studies rather than being in relationships.For instance,in a survey conducted in 2020, single-sex institutes had more percentage of passed pupils rather than others.Moreover,many students are not able to present their real role and ability to ask questions in front of both genders due to their shy nature.Last but not least,mostly young ones are being bullied by other genders such as girls are tortured because of their fashion and boys because of their skinny body.",
        "On the other hand,there are some consequences of sending pupils into single-sex schools such as they will have lack of confidence while talking to other people in their forthcoming because they will face both genders at their workplace.In addition,due to less competition students will stay at one point and will not do more efforts to increase the percentage.For illustration,according to professors, it can be seen that in normal schools,peers with various genders are co-operating with each other and learning things quickly due to competition.",
        "To  conclude, it is clear that there are both pros and cons of sending youngsters to single-sex schools because they will not be confident in the future and will have a lack of competition.So, guardians should think about both situations before taking any steps for their child's future."
