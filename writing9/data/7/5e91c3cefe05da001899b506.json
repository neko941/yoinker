        "Technology has become a part of human life. Getting the fact that the world industry has changed into digital 4.0, we can see that every connection and relationship could be reached by a digital platform in our pocket. Handphone, laptop, tablet, computer has now been essentials for people to connect.\u00a0Nowadays, it is often observed that some people tend to more engaged with their gadget rather than in real life. Even though the technology is beneficial for human, I argue that it can harm people in the contact they made through several digital media. Many fake accounts, hackers, and internet bullying can be found.",
        "As the development of technology is increasing day by day, people could easily get connected to the internet. This caused many people use this privilege to harm or fool others. For instance, in these days, there are lots of people doing \"internet relationship\" or \"internet dating\" and when they want to meet each other in the real life, the partner is gone missing. This action is not healthy for somebody mental health.",
        "Instead of fake accounts, there are lots of internet bullying that can happen in many forms. People in social media can easily make themselves as anonymous, as when they have an intend to attack someone, they have no worries to act any harmful thing. For example, there are several cases of bullies happen on Facebook. When I was a child, I was being one of the victims of vocal harassment in social media. And surely, cyber bullying is not good at all.",
        "The conclusion is the changing type of relationship that caused by technology is may be dangerous, even it brings many advantages. Parents should be more aware about their kids activity with technology to avoid such internet crime."
