        "Animal protection has gained significant attention from social advocates over the years. They are of the view that animals should be treated with equal generosity as like humans, while others argue that they are a vital source of food and medical testing which cannot be avoided. I also totally agree with the latter view. However, a line needs to be drawn to assure no unjustified exploitation of these creatures.",
        "The supporters of animal rights believe that they are living beings like us; they also have feelings and get hurt when we treat them inappropriately. It has been observed that sheep, goats and cows which are slaughtered by Muslims on their holy event of Eid, make loud noises at night before they are being sacrificed. It is believed that they can judge that their life is about to end. However, these instances cannot be avoided because of the strong religious beliefs.  Additionally, there are some people who treat animals harshly, which is sometimes unjustifiable. A recent instance was reported in India, where a dog was beaten to death by the guards of the society as it used to come daily there in search of food. The social activists took the notice of the brutality and legal action was taken against them.",
        "On the contrary, I believe that God has created certain animals to serve as a source of food for mankind. If we think of animal rights and stop using them as our meal, we may starve at one time. There are certain regions in developing countries like Thal desert in Pakistan, where people are alive mostly on animal meat as there is not plantation to offer the alternate food. Additionally, over the years science has been able to cure many life-threatening diseases by experimenting sample medicines on mouse and monkeys. Otherwise, such ailments may have taken the life of many human beings. Thus, we cannot avoid using animals as being our significant food source as well as a medium of confirming the medicines\u2019 effectiveness.",
        "In conclusion, people who are not in favour of hurting animals for mankind needs of health and food, advocate that they get hurt which is not right. However, they have underestimated the benefits they bring to the mankind which are inevitable in certain instances. I strongly believe that these creatures are for our utility, however, unjust treatment without any valid reason should be totally unacceptable in any case."
