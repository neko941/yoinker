In fact, not only have I booked Hotel Cera Classic for the party, but I have also planned some in door games for her friends. Moreover, I am planning to shape up the party into a musical evening and for this I am going to invite a musical band as well.",

Because it was you who had helped a lot in her singing practice, she indeed wants to meet her lovely uncle and hug you tightly. If you come to the party and sing with her, it will really be an unforgettable party ever. So, once again I ask you to be on time lest you should be ready to face her anger.",
