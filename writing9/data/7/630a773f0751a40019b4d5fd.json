        "Nowadays, the Style of vertical buildings is becoming more popular day by day in modern areas. For many denizens, the accommodations provided by these apartments are more pocket friendly and give access to amazing facilities than separate homes . However, there are both pros and cons to deciding to do this. In this essay, I will discuss some of the reasons why living in an apartment is more advantageous and some of the challenges to be overcome.",
        "Let us begin by looking at the advantages of choosing flats. One of the main positives of small bedroom units is that these types of homes are not very expensive as compared to individual houses therefore it allows each individual to buy a home and pay the loan amount in a few years. Furthermore, one can enjoy a plethora of amenities provided by the building owner like a swimming pool, gym, and sports room which are expensive and difficult to maintain for individual owners.",
        "Secondly, security plays an important role for everyone when choosing their homes. These days, property management put their 100% effort to provide a sense of security to make their tenants feel comfortable and secure. What I mean by this, is by appointing guards at the main gate, they do not allow outsiders or any delivery boys to enter  the building without knowing an appropriate reason.",
        "On the flip side of the argument, one has to follow a number of rules to stay in a specific apartment so they feel many restrictions upon them as they cannot alter the basic structure of the home. Furthermore, They feel less connected to each other as there is no common place where everyone can meet and do social events.",
        "All things considered, living in apartments is in vogue. you need to weigh the pros of enjoying ample  facilities on less budget, and a sense of security and the cons of feeling alone and less connected to the community.  Personally. I believe the  benefits of staying in big buildings eventually overweight any negatives."
