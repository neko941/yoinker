        "There is no doubt that, currently, women prefer to have a aby in their later years.  It is believed that this is  a part of modern society. While  doing this brings some financial benefits, the negatives also can be seen.",

In other words,  she could focus on her work without thinking about family commitments; therefore, she would hold a higher position in her job. Eventually, this assists to make a better life. Additionally, women of the resent generation have not worried about later pregnancy as the modern medical advancement able to resolve if any issues arise. For example, if they have enough money, they could afford IVF treatments and able to provide  safe and secure living condition to their offspring.",
        "Nevertheless, on the other hand, demerits of the pregnancy at an advanced age also be relevant. One obvious danger  is that health-related problem. This means as age advance, the body may undergo some physical alterations, and this cannot permit  to bear a baby. Similarly, if they have a id, the kid may not be nursed properly as the parents are old.  For instance, a recent study  showed that mentally challenged children  are born to aged parents compared to young adults. Thus, even, medical practitioners  suggest the ideal age for childbirth is below 35 years.",
        "In conclusion, even though having children after gaining a stable financial status is considered as good, the difficulties of this cannot be ignored. It is better to start a family   before 30 years due to health reasons."
