        "I hope you and your family are all well, I am writing this letter to tell you about my recent visit to animal safari.This place is located in Gujarat  and is known as the Gondwana animal safari. And I went there by gotrain till nearby city then I booked open jeep so that I can enjoy the seneric view and dense forest.",
        "I saw many animals there such as the lion , the tiger which is roaming freely in the forest and now come to the interesting part of the trip, I saw a comodo dragon , It was 20 feet reptile, It is quite similar to a crocodile but it does not live near to the water habitats. I was amazed that how exotic this animal is and how they are roaming freely without any fear of predators. This trip has impacted me so deep and I strongly feel that  as  human beings we should make this place good for animals as well.",
        "As you planning your next vacation to visit Gujarat , I would like to take you on this animal safari , so that you and your family can see these exotic animal.",
