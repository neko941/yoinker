        "Recently, a minority of people spend time on leisure interests. There are two causes behind it, however, this issue can be tackled with the help of companies and parents.",
        "The two factors are to blame why individuals do not have sufficient time for their hobbies. The principal reason is that a vast majority of workers have a hectic schedule and consequently they cannot spend time for leisurely hours. Additionally, some employees are exposed to work overtime or against the clock. This way companies inhibit staff\u2019s pastime.By way of illustration, one who has worked for a considerable hours, will not have any energy to dedicate some time for hobbies. Moreover, the development of cutting edge technology also contributes negatively to lack of time for individual interests. It is undeniable that a great number of people have an addiction to gadgets in the computer age.As a result, whenever geeks find free time they get stuck behind electronic devices.",
        "Fortunately, there are two effective measures to deal with this trouble. Firstly, entrepreneurs should not force their employees to work overtime and if businesses face special occasions , extra labours should be divided fairly among all the staff members. Therefore, workers will not snatch a few hours\u2019 sleep and will find a gap in their schedule for extracurricular activities. Furthermore, obsession with gadgets should be diminished. The major help would be measures taken by the family. Individuals will not be addicted to electronic devices, unless parents do not give permission to use computers for a long period of time to  their children. In this case, individuals will not have an addiction to computers because they have not used them regularly in childhood. For instance, one who has developed a particular interest in music in childhood, will definitely find time to be occupied with playing some musical instruments in adulthood.",
        "In conclusion, in recent decades the majority of people do not have enough time for social activities. However, if companies and parents try to solve this problem, this will be mitigated."
