        "In the modern world, some workers opine that formal academic qualifications are more essential than life background or personal skills when they seek for new employees. In my opinion, I believe that this is a positive development. Firstly, the essay will discuss the positives when the candidates take specialist qualifications. Secondly, the essay will discuss the impact of negative while the employees have a life background or personal qualities.",
        "",
        "Also, having a formal academic certificate can have a positive impact on an employees\u2019 job. Nowadays, the human resource executive always gives a requirement for the employees that they have to take a major certificate to apply for the job. The nominee wants to take the job so easy, they will need more knowledge about this job. For instance, some employees graduated in the finance major. They have more opportunities to apply for more companies and will so confident about this apply. They can deal with the salary, the benefits, and the position with the hunters.",
        "",
        "Moreover, I think that it\u2019s not enough when you just have a life background or personal qualities. As the first ground of the hunters sees their cover letter first. They do not know about their skills. For example, when the candidates write the cover letter to apply for some positions. If you do not have a special certificate, you will not have more priority than other candidates.",
        "",
        "In conclusion, in my view, there are more positive than negative. Besides, there are clear benefits with the candidates who have an academic certificate. However, the employees also need some life experience or personal qualities for making their job smooth."
