        "In this hi-tech world, people argue that the online learning platform is a better idea rather than attending university. I want to delineate my views on both perspectives in this following essay.",
        "It is undeniable that modern technology had several benefits not only in the education sector but also in other organizations as well. Such as amazon shopping online or market sales. As we know due to the pandemic students are not allowed to go to universities or colleges in this sense, virtually learning played an important role in education. Firstly, we cannot ignore the advantages of online courses, for instance, the learners who are working part-time, it is the best opportunity for them to finish their degrees in online studios. Secondly, it is more granted to those, who lived in a different country and are not allowed to come to that country where they are getting admissions. The global pandemic made the whole world isolated. In my opinion, for genuine reasons, youngsters must be allowed to have online knowledge. For example, my one friend got admission to an imperial college, it happened when the pandemic started, she was about to come to England, but the government did not allow her to come so, in this situation she finish her first year of engineering online.",
        "On the other hand, the others have different points about the home learner, they think that without attending college it is difficult to say how much students are achieved because they have no practical, and a lack of interaction with their teachers. These theories had a strong motive, I agree, that many things and feelings which teenagers must share with their teachers and many types of research which need practical, it is irrefutable to say that campus learning is the best way to achievement rather than online study.",
        "In addition, however, both the proposal of learning is favourable but moreover, we have to focus on the future outcomes. In my suggestion, it does not matter to anyone who is doing online or attending college, they must have to finish their goal successfully."
