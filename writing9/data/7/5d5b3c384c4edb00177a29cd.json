        "It is argued that our lives were more fulfilling when the technology was less advanced. This essay disagrees with this statement and believes that computers and the internet have made life better. The essay will first discuss how smartphones save us time and then talk about how the web has improved education, followed by a reasoned conclusion.",
        "New phones, such as the iPhone, make our daily lives much less laborious and give us more free time. Jobs that required lots of energy and time can now be done at the touch of a button. To illustrate, if we wanted to communicate with one another in the past, we had to write a letter, take it to the post office and then wait for it to be delivered, whereas these days we can simply tap the email icon on our touch screen and send a message in seconds.",
        "The internet has also enriched our lives by providing us with more information than we could ever need, thus making us more independent and effective learners. In the past students had to rely on a teacher or physical books for their education and these were often either unavailable or in a format that most people did not want, but now we can pick and choose what we want to learn. For example, there are now thousands of free online courses available on YouTube that anyone can watch and learn from anywhere in the world.",
        "In conclusion, life has been improved by technological advancements, particularly labour saving devices like phones and learning opportunities provided by the internet."
