        "It has been argued by some people that presenting yourself well in interviews will help you secure a better work. In my opinion, I completely agree with this notion as good performance in client interviews will help you market yourself better than others and will create an impact that the company cannot resist to hire you.",
        "To begin with, applicants with good interview skills will have an opportunity to market themselves by providing concrete plans and insights that differ them from the rest of the interviewees.

In other words, an applicant who is self-assured and have the necessary insights for the job can answer most of the questions relevant in securing the post than others who have self-doubt and not well verse to the nature of work.",
