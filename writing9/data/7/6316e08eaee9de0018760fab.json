        "There are controversial opinions that children who commit crimes are worth being punished, whereas some advocates suppose that the people who should be punished are parents. In my respective, I partly agree with the first opinion because without punishment every time kids make things wrong, it will result in consequences for their growth.",
        "The parents take the punishment instead of their kids due to the innocence and curiosity in kids' minds. Obviously, children are too young to understand what deeds they should do or not, in part they are curious about new things and want to discover to satisfy their questions, resulting in faults with no expectations. Therefore, punishment is too strict for children. Moreover, the behaviour of kids is affected by their parents. Precisely, if parents took care of their offspring carefully and are good examples for their sons or daughters, kids would form good character to not commit crimes.",
        "However, I partially agree that children would rather be punished when they commit crimes because they will be aware of deeds they can do or not. If parents ignored their kids' deeds, or over-indulge in everything they do, even admonish themselves instead of the kids, there would gradually create a thought that they do correctly, at least they do not get punished when they do wrong, then it becomes a bad habit being difficult to fix in the future. Additionally, children have little awareness of the correction in things they do, so there has to be a punishment to not let them become actual crimes one day. However, there should not be mental punishment for the kids, besides the illegal deed, it can cause  obsession in children and make them live isolatedly with their parents. Light punishment such as not allowing them to have a meal if they have a behaviour of not respecting rice.",
        "In conclusion, although there is some agreement in letting parents be punished instead of their children, I approve of the opinion that punishment is necessary for children to not commit crimes again."
