        "In a country like India, Film stars are treated as demigods, musicians as idols and finally Sports persons as youth icons.Moreover, these stars and endorsed to be seen so by advertising agencies as associated with them. Having stated that there is a common question associated with these celebrities, Are they paid too much money?",
        "As glamorous as they may appear, these superstars would have crossed various obstacles to have reached the pinnacle in their respective careers.To master an instrument like a flute or to perfect a cover drive in cricket it takes rigorous and disciplined regime. Furthermore, to be consistent in their performance, the effort needed is no less. Contrary to popular belief, to be an entertainer is not a luxury as such. While the limelight on them is enjoyable, it also puts them in the public's eye.",
        "The life of Tamil superstar, Rajinikanth, a conductor who has converted all the hurdles in his path into a ladder to climb the heights of success, can serve as a perfect illustration of the persistent hard work put by these entertainers.",
        "On that note, I disagree with the popular notion that the eminent entertainers are paid too much money as they have not only  conquered our hearts but also inspire us to be better.",
        "In comparison, One other profession which has to be highly paid is Defence Services. They serve as the wall protecting us, yet they are hardly appreciated. Although, servicemen would not demand it, they deserve to be paid well and celebrated better. After all, aren't we all sleeping well with the confidence they have bestowed on our safety?"
