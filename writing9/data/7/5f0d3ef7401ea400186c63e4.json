        "Many say that the only viable method to ascertain a good job with a high pay would be to finish a university learning.Whereas others discredit the claim and state that it is far better to instantly start work after pre tertiary schooling and accumulate experience in the working world.I believe having a university teaching is far superior than instantly starting work as I would expedite in the essay.",
        "Firstly people state it is better to start the task right after finishing pre tertiary schooling,either junior college or polytechnic in Singapore.They believe in early bird catches the worm as having a head start in industry life gives them sufficient time to acclimatize to trial life and even gain wisdom, through the challenges they face, much earlier than their peers.For instance, people studying at the polytechnic graduate with a diploma and can jump straight into task as they have necessary skills learned in their period of study.Eventually, they earn both income and wisdom, which would be redeeming attribute when being considered for a promotion at their workplace.",
        "On the other hand, university study is far more important as they teach skills beyond that of what polytechnic offers.To illustrate, NUS not only teaches technical skills required in jobs, but also soft skills through a compulsory research project they have to complete before they can graduate.These soft skills take the form of teamwork, honesty between teammates and determination to never come up.Besides in recent studies, it has been shown that in the past academy was the hallmark to attaining great jobs.However now, only a select top few undergoing academy learning can get these jobs.This is attributed to higher demand of employers to get high performance to price ratio for workers so as to propel the company quickly and rack in profits.Hence educational institution studies became the bare minimum required to get higher pay scale jobs.",
        "In conclusion, I concur that academy education is imperative for students to get the jobs they want.Although those without a university education wins in terms of experience due to the head start they get, university students triumph in terms of the skills they earn and thus more qualified and has vastly greater chance to pursue the jobs they want."
