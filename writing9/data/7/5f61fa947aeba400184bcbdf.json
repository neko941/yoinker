The idea horrifies most people, yet it is no longer mere science fiction.\n\n\nTo what extent do you agree with such a procedure?\n\n\nHave you any reservations?",

        "Living longer has always been a dream we have chased for centuries. Science fiction has pitched various ideas about human cloning and harvesting human parts. These leaps in medical science have narrowed the gap between fiction and reality. While I do support the idea of creating organs, but I do have reservation on human cloning and validity of these artificial organs.",
        "Ability to create artificial organs can be deemed as a boon to many in dire need of it. Concurrently,  cloning humans also opens up gateways to preserve great minds which could bolster our future advancements. For instance, if visionaries such as Newton, Einstien and Picasso would have been alive today, we would be living in a different world, so many unanswered questions would be solved. Man-made organs could also save so many young lives and talents who never reached the zenith of their success. Consequently, such advancements always paint the picture of a highly advanced world, but it also raises few reservations.",
        "Organ donation is a reality since many decades, yet we have failed to achieve a 100% success rate. If the natural organs can fail, can't the artificial organs fall prey to the same consequence? Concurrently, as human cloning could recreate great minds, it could also bring back fickle-minded criminals. Not to mention the horde of identity crises it will give rise to. While in fiction, such processes elope the real-world question, but in reality, we might have to resolve such unprecedented questions first.",
        "In conclusion, I do think artificial organs would act as a boon, but thorough testing, which could take decades to perfect is needed. Also, human cloning is promising, but control measures for such advancements need to be identified before its rollout."
