        "Time plays a very crucial role in everybody's life. Nowadays, Pupils are working more hours along with their working hours. In this essay, I will discuss the reasons and the effects and then I will give my opinion on this matter with examples.",
        "On the one side, Some communities are working longer hours due to their working conditions and rules. Normal people who don't have any certification will work in some areas for gaining money. For example, A person, who doesn't have any certificates will choose to work in a factory with more working hours because he/she does not have another option. and another good example, A software employee who works almost 10 to 12 hours due to their agreements and less experience.",
        "On the other side, Some communities are working for more hours to gain knowledge. Some people want to reach their goals along with their work. Nowadays, some people are doing multiple jobs to reach their goals and also to build their financial status. For instance, A person who is working as a software employee had an interest in acting so he/she works in these two areas to balance his/her work and passion in life.",
        "To sum up, In my view there are reasons to work for more hours but working for longer hours will lead to health problems like stress, etc. I think it is better to take a rest when there is leisure time. And if people want to work on their goals it is better to work during off days."
