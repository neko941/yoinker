        "Ideas of development differ on individual's priority. Massive attractive infrastructures and constructions are preferred by some whereas others give priority to social causes such as schools and hospitals.",
        "There are group of people for whom urbanization is extremely important. Any cities are known for their memorable landmarks, landscapes, huge monuments, museums, shopping malls, posh and amazing lifestyles. High quality of life is reflected by the place we live in. To maintain it people then will develop a sense of civic responsibility which will help in constructing a good society. For instance, as per the study published in Times Magazine, Burj Khalifa contributes 20% to Dubai GDP.",
        "On contrary to first group we discussed, the other group of society believes in social causes like building schools and hospitals. In today's world scenario education as well as good health is of prime importance for any individual. To raise the standard of any society one must work on increasing literacy ratio as well as on the quality of good health. Children are the future of society, so competent and the high standard of education is their basic right. Similarly, Senior citizens are also the responsibility of our society, as they should be provided with the best health care services. A healthy and educated society can lead to a pinnacle growth of the country. For example, there was a report in New York times which confirmed that schools and hospitals contribute 50% to the overall social development of a country",
        "After analyzing both views, I firmly like to support second group of society whose prime focus is on better education and health care structure. Being Humans let's not forget our social values which differentiate us from any other species. In today's world, Man has become more sophisticated and materialistic. Everything that glitters is not gold. Just beautiful attractive infrastructure doesn't construct a society but a happy, healthy and literate group of people do. To conclude, I will just say, to make our nation a better place one must do something constructive to help its citizens rather than just to show off its fame."
