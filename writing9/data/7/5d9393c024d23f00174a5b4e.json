        "My departure date for Canada is drawing near, and I am busy with preparations. I have enrolled at an institution called \u2018IDT English\u2019 in Ottawa, for a four-month intermediate course, full-time. It is quite expensive but I am hopeful of improving my pronunciation, especially.",

Not only are the college fees rather high, but also I know that rental accommodation in the capital city will not be cheap, to say nothing of food and heating expenses! So I would very much like to arrange some temporary employment before I arrive.",
