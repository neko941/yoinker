        "It is commonly observed that people leaving school without completing the education are more progressed instead of those who complete their studies, before starting a job or business. In my opinion, the reason of success of such people is the reach experience they gain at a young age and their passion for work. I consider that hard work and dedication to work is necessary to achieve success.",
        "People who do not complete their academic education are usually more successful as compared to others owing to early identification of their zeal. In other words, most teenagers leave school when they get to know that some work interest them more than studies. Therefore, they start following that passion, leaving the study in between. As a result of working at a young age, they gain rich experience in their field until other youths enter that business. For instance, actors who start working in films at a young age are usually much more trained in acting field and they become famous before even entering adulthood. Additionally, following their passion make them do great things in their endeavours, which also act as an added advantage towards their success.",
        "It is believed by many people that hard work and dedication are key to success. Usually, people who do jobs just to make earnings do not put their hundred percent into it. Mostly, people who are not satisfied with their work type do not show the much-needed dedication towards completing their duties. As a result, these people lack behind in career as well as in business. Therefore, hardworking employees often step up the success ladder faster in comparison to those who comes to office just to get salary at the end of the month.",
        "In conclusion, people should be more focused and passionate towards their work if they want to become a successful business tycoon or achieve great height in career."
