        "Some people are of the opinion that we should focus more on the present rather than making plans for the future. From my perspective, while this argument can be explained for some reasons, I would argue that planning is of paramount importance in the success of any person, and therefore I completely disagree with this statement.",
        "People who advocate this idea cite the living-for-the-moment way of life as their ideology. Preparations and arrangements are deemed too complicated for them, and some even think that having a plan is tantamount to giving ourselves unnecessary concerns. However, I find this argument somewhat flawed, since planning ahead is far from synonymous with excessive worrying. Good planners see planning as a facilitator to their future goals, rather than a complication that stands in the course of personal development.",
        "Furthermore, I believe that future planning is what makes a person successful in life. Good preparations give a person an edge over impulsive, disoriented ones, and indeed, no big corporations would run well without well thought-out, elaborate schemes. Also, good planning helps people minimize uncertainties. Success stories of famous entrepreneurs and politicians all pinpoint the need for a careful, detailed plan. In times of crisis, a person or an organization with great predictions of as many potential problems as possible always triumphs over those without good planning.",
        "In conclusion, my firm conviction is that careful planning for the future is never an unnecessary burden. It is one of the most important attributes constituting success. It is not an overstatement to say that if one fails to plan, they plan to fail."

Prolged life is,  the e hand, a welcome change for many individuals, yet I believe this is completely not a good idea for old people to ctinue to work due to several reass related to their deteriorated work performance and capability to adapt to new technologies. Breakthroughs in medicine and heightened awareness of nutriti are the two key factors leading to lgevity. For example, nanotechnology, with tiny robots being injected into patients\u2019 body and mending all their damaged organs, are believed to the e of the secrets to obliterate any currently incurable diseases such as cancer. Additially, people nowadays are better aware of the importance of a good diet, and such wise csumpti can ensure good health and csequently extended age. However, extending people\u2019s working age can be a catastrophe to both senior citizens and companies. The majority of people at the age of 65 or over, especially in developing countries, are unable to maintain the same degree of performance as their younger counterparts. This would eventually give rise to many unwanted repercussis that affect the company\u2019s overall profits and the persal life of the aged workers as well. Also, the fast-paced life requires quick adapti and adjustments to new technology, and this is something that the elderly may never be  par with the younger es. It is not an overstatement to say that it is a torture to work in a place where you are both physically and technologically inferior to your younger co-workers. In cclusi, my firm cvicti is that old people should not be involved in work any lger than their designated retirement age now. If the need for workforce is urgent, old people can, to a certain extent, work as csultants or mentors rather than the main labor force. 30 minutes \u2013 323 words \u2013 computer-delivered",
