        "There is a growing trend of purchasing stuff online over going into the physical store. Although this trend is seemingly popular in the future, there are still some disadvantages that people must be aware of. This article will elaborate if online shopping really can exceed its disadvantages or either way.",
        "The first thing which is essential to consider for a shopper is the actual quality of the product that is about to be purchased. Much stuff posted on the website did not precisely match the one when it arrived in the hand of the buyer. It is also the first weakness of online shopping when a shopper does not know. The second thing to contemplate is also shipping issues. There is a significant probability of the items getting damaged while in delivery. In this case, because the shop selling the product is different from the logistic shipping company, no one pledged to substitute the broken product.",
        "Despite all the defects above, there is more reason why consumers prefer to purchase their products online. First, it saves much time. Imagine how much time people can save when they do not need to stand in a long queue to make payments. On the other hand, online shopper can simply make their payment during their working time or when they are sitting on the couch and drinking a cup of hot tea. Those examples also could give us another reason why people prefer to buy their products online, the convenience. People have an extensive range of products to make comparisons and choose the most suitable one without even commuting. The last one that makes online shopping preferable is always open. Unlike offline stores, online shops allow customers to make deals whenever they like.",
        "From all the explanations, I conclude that online shopping is preferable to offline shopping nowadays, with all the advantages outweighing the disadvantages."
