        "It is quite paradoxical to know if Internet can sound the death knell for newspapers and magazines. I certainly disagree with this belief. In my vision, newspapers and magazines will always thrive even though, there are so many sharks such as the Internet or the Android conquering the digital platform. This essay will describe how the newspapers and magazines thrive against a stiff competition from the Internet.",
        "To begin with, the newspapers and magazines are always available from various cities till the countryside. Whereas the internet relies on power supply, formulation of internet service providers and a seamless data connection which are seemingly not possible in the countryside. Further, there are varieties of newspapers based on the content which people prefer to read. For example \u201cThe Hindu\u201d covers Domestic and Geopolitics, \u201cThe Economic times\u201d covers the stock market movements and the rapid rise and fall of an organisation\u2019s economic pulse.  The \u201cForbes\u201d magazine covers the content on the most successful men or women in this planet and how they have achieved their formidable success.  The list goes endlessly in flaunting the print media success, even though the internet took the print media by a storm.",
        "However, what made the print media as unconquerable compared to the internet giant? Too much is always too bad. The Internet is vast and endless. When someone searches for fashion in internet, the search goes without any limits. To top it, it further includes the pages that are sometimes not relating to fashion. Most of the times, it causes chaos about the content that one is searching. Consequently, this is the reason why most of the people glued their eyes to the screen content making them doubtful and unsatisfying. Furthermore, there are people who like the touch and feel of paper rather than the touch of a computer mouse. That\u2019s the reason, why schools and universities still follow textbooks as their primary source of education rather than the Internet.",
        "To conclude, in better terms, it can appear as newspapers and magazines, lock horns with the Internet and could be losing their dominance. However, that sort of conflict will never happen. In simple terms, the print media offers a finite level of information which is easier to comprehend from the kids till senior citizens. The content in print media content is easy to remain in one\u2019s memory rather than the vast intangible source of information from the Internet."
