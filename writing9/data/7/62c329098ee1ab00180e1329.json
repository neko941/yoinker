Since they were young and they overjoyed by their results, they were all over the moon. They sang, they danced and even they had arranged a DJ as well. That was not what we planned initially. But because of their happiness, we couldn\u2019t resist it. Yes, I feel now as we are responsible parents we should have controlled the situation in a much more precise manner.",
        "I advised them thoroughly, not to do such kinds of things in the future and I will assure you I will arrange nothing beyond the limitations and if something special happens, I will notice you in advance. Especially about DJs, that kind of thing will happen again.",
