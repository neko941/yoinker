        "Nowadays, technology is our unconditional partner for many daily tasks. Whether the development of home machines brigs more advantages or disadvantages is a discussion that sparked controversy. In my opinion, there are many more advantages for using devices that improve people\u2019s life by giving more free time and also better-quality results.",
        "With automatic processes at home, people can spend more free time with their families and friends. Along with new technological developments, there is always the possibility to simple set up a timer or easily program a task, disregard and came back later after finishing other kind activities such as reading, watching TV, among others. For example, an automatic vacuum cleaner cleans up an entire room or house in minutes and return to its charger base, while parents spend more time with their kids and family. Besides, devices such as automatic dishwashers, vindicate the possibility to spend more time in the table with guests or partners after dinner, instead of wasting time by cleaning up the mess of a kitchen.",
        "Secondly, home activities are more efficient and quality results might be better by using automatic tools. Although, people can spend many hours on some home tasks and made them so carefully, the results of using machines might be better in quality terms. From my experience, I have noticed that using a washing machine gives me much better results when cleaning my clothes in one third of the time. Furthermore, activities such as cooking specially chopping, can be easy by using machines without wasting part of the food that normally happen when it is done by hand.",
        "In conclusion, technological developments for home tasks brings more advantages in people\u00b4s live. They allow to have more free time to share with others and helps to complete things with a better-quality result. Technology development of home machines arrived and is here to help people by making their life quite easier than in the past few years."
