        "As a result of economic situations all over the world, some countries export basic needs to areas that are not near them. I believe the advantages corresponding to transport necessary items to different parts of the world are more considerable than the minor disadvantages.",
        "On the one hand, a potential drawback of sending goods may be difficult in critical situations. Research findings confirm that whenever a country gets into a problem with another country, another country is not able to give them a hand because they are more likely to will be attacked. In that situation, a country without resources finds it difficult to manage its own country. Another perceived negative is that poor land has to pay a lot of money to receive goods. Although these countries are unable to earn much money, they should pay it in this way.",
        "On the other hand, a primary advantage of exporting is that it can create good jobs for people who are willing to find a suitable career. Developed countries can generate job opportunities lot in transportation or production fields. As a result of this, the unemployment rate will decrease. A further benefit is that the production of basic needs in exporting regions leads to a growth standard of living. It can be facilitated living because people do not think about their daily needs.",
        "On balance, it is true that exporting goods to other countries would seem disadvantageous under certain circumstances. In my view, its positive effects in terms of making job possibilities and increasing the standard of living in rich countries override the disadvantages."
