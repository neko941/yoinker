        "Some significant part of education like as reading, writing, maths entailed for the centuries. In addition to this, computers which have developed in recent decades should be accepted as fourth skill in these parts.",
        "This essay will suggest power of computers as a learning hub, and I agree education parts should be contained technological skills.",
        "Education can be evaluated with the success on some lessons such as reading, writing, maths or foreign languages for a long time. In the next decades, computer technology has managed in many things, and it is more important to using well. In schools, computer laboratories and classes are common in the last years and many students know that computer knowledge can be a key for a job for them. Computer skills's beneficial not only finding a job, but also amazing learning hub in every topic. For example, in a national college, students who are successful in computers, are better other lessons according a research. This is because, computer users more curious, at time same time they usually research everything.",
        "On the other hand, computers cannot be thought apart from education parts. Most educate materials are related to them. For this reason, if a student is talented in it, she or he uses these technological materials more useful for learning the course. Meanwhile, capable of computers should not thinking less important other parts of learning in schools.",
        "In conclusion, computers are used every area in this century in order to ease life. This technological learning hub is fundamental to educate youth generations. Therefore, I completely agree that it has not thought separate from mostly acceptable education classes."
