        "It is true that a small number of languages are on the brink of extinction.There seems to be positive views that governments could allocate funds to preserve these languages. I personally consider that these languages should be maintained",
        "There are several reasons why maintaining an outnumbered group languages could be seen as a waste of money. Firstly, the ancient manuscripts might be was written only specific language, if government should know these manuscripts\u2019s translations, government will have to pay more money for an interpreter who knows this language.This money might be better spent on other public services.Secondly, It would be reasonable decision for governments that do not provide extra money for minority languages.It means that the government could save money and might spend on other sphere such as education, hospitality.",
        "Notwithstanding,on the other hand, despite the above cited arguments,I believe that authority should protect and preserve languages that are widely spoken. As a reason, government should organize small groups in the schools as an office hours to implement communication.Furthermore,A minority languages should be used as a subject in the primary schools.Children could easily learn a foreign language.Also, the government can preserve traditions and behaviour by spending money to protect these languages.In other words,we should protect and spread this language along the country in order to save,because language means that reminds us,our ancestor\u2019s history.",
        "In conclusion, if the government will not protect a minority language, this county\u2019s history might be disappearing.Rather, it would be better if the government offers a minority language courses as a curriculum."
