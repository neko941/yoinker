Immediately, I returned the item to your store for repair and up to this moment I am yet to get feedback from the company representative.",
        "Though I would have waited for it to be repaired or fixed, however I would prefer a replacement because my birthday party is tomorrow and I would need the service of the fan.",
        "Thanks for your cooperation as I await your quick response.",
