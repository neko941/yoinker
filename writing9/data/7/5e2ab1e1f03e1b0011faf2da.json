        "Thank you so much not only for memorable vacations as well as for sharing the lovely pictures. Staying with adorable people like you at your luxury home was the wonderful experience of my life. I really missed the yummy food which Ellen served me every day.  Canada is a scenic place with remarkable wildlife, mountains, and a conducive natural environment and particular your place which is a perfect locality to spend whole life peacefully.",
        "Sorry, it has taken me too much time to write. As soon as I landed back, my dad became sick. We were running around looking after him. Now he seems to be improving. I hope he will be fine soon.",
        "Next Month, there is a 25th marriage adversary party of my parents and I will be delighted if you should come to attend. India is also a beautiful place to visit. You both can stay with us as there are many rooms in my house. We will come to pick you at the airport. I really hope you will come to attend this.",
