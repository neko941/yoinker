        "I disagree with it, but I can tell, you how to solve this problem. Let's start with the fact that almost every food we eat contains sugar. In some products, it is less than in others.",
        "Firstly, there are lots of sugar in fast food. Sweet drinks, sweets, chocolate, crisps, and muesli, of it, contain sugar. Everything that people make in factories, with sugar. It is happening because they want their product to taste richer. Even most bottled water contains sugar and a bunch of other additives.  This is done so that people are more and more willing to buy water from this particular company.",
        "Only natural food has no sugar. Because people get it from the environment. Meet and milk, they get from the cattle. Products that contain milk, do on their own. Vegetables and fruits they planted and grown in their gardens. Because of this, they do not have problems with their health. If people do not want to have problems with their strengths, they need to eat healthy food and have more sport in their life. Yes, it will be more expensive, to eat healthily, but it will be more effective than eating lots of sweets and burgers.",
        "To summarize, shops do not have to make products that contain sugar more expensive, because it will not help. Every time, people will choose expensive sweets that are tastier, than expensive vegetables. People should advertise healthy food themselves, and then the rest will also prefer junk food, healthy food."
