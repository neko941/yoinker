        "Firstly, People from new generation are wearing similar clothes because of globalization.

For example, some multinational corporations have a dress code policy which everyone has to follow. This creates unity in the employees. This, also, avoids religion based conflict. Today, people feel more confident in global fashioned clothes. They wear clothes which are comfortable.  Due to their fast moving life, they prefer outfits which are easy to wear. On the other side, some people feel that it is necessary to follow the fashion trend because of the peer pressure.  As per the old saying \u2013 \u201cWhen in the Rome, do as the Romans do\u201d one should adopt the changing surroundings to be in the race.",
