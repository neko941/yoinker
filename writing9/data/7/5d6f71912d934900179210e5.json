        "It is thought that one of the big problems in numerous schools is bullying. In my opinion, there are some factors which are involved in triggering bullying and some solutions can help reduce bullying in schools.",
        "On the one hand, I believe that televisions are one of the most significant factors emotionally affecting children. Today, more and more violent movies and clips go viral on TV, social media and the Internet. Because of the development of the Internet and smartphones which are more and more common,children are liable to watch violent movies, and attempt to imitate exactly how actors in violent movies kick and kill people. Children normally lacking an awareness of the severity of the bullying and hurting other friends will use what they have already watched in violent movies to treat other people. Secondly, parents play a role in increasing bullying. In modern life, due to the pressure of their work, parents cannot spend much time talking to children and playing with children, which makes children feel alone and use violence in order to have their parents\u2019 attention.",
        "On the other hand, I think that some solutions are likely to stop bullying in schools. Firstly, checking viewers\u2019 age carefully before permitting them to watch violent movies is a good method. The suggested solution will guarantee to keep children away from violent movies as much as possible. Next, parents should spend more time on their own children. Children will feel listened and their stress of what they are facing and things rendering children depressed and blue descends.",
        "In conclusion, some factors are a key to rising bullying in schools, while several solutions can make bullying less serious."
