        "While handful members of public reckon that the music is only an elementary amusement, most of them and I believe that it is one of the most crucial subjects in each association.",
        "Music is just a primitive pursuit for scattering people. These kinds of people only listen to melody in certain situations. For instance, they do not listen to opera unless they are at a party, or when they commute to work or university by subway. They may not know the true value of music. Perhaps the advantages of singing are not well-understood. If they were well-acquainted with the importance of soul in life, melody would permeate the whole association. Not teaching the benefits of opera in the heart of community leads to the limited use of rap by these people.",
        "Not only does music extremely prominent in the individual\u2019s personal lives, but all communities also will be affected by the piece. One of the most vital effects of tune in the association is psychological. Promoting melody among the people can calm them down and relieve their pain. Furthermore, problems will be forgotten by listening soul. Rock is effective in every way. To illustrate, employee\u2019s efficiency will be ameliorated by opera, and the milk of lactating cows will be dramatically increased in the musical environment. Theme is a contributor and inseparable part of any community which is immensely popular with folk.",
        "",
        "Although a few public view pieces only as a simple pastime, it seems to me that tune has a significant role in the community."
