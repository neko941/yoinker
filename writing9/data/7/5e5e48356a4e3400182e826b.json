        "Obesity among children is western countries has grown by almost 20% in the last decade. Two of the main causes of this situation are the lack of movement and unhealthy food. Moreover, the effects of this trend are extremely dangerous on a long term. This essay will discuss the causes and the effects of this behaviour.",
        "Nowadays, children spend more time on passive activities than ten years ago. They prefer using gadgets to old traditional toys. If in the past children used to spend a lot of time outside, running and climbing the trees, today they  are spending hours playing video games, sitting on the couch. For example, if you visit a school during breaks, you will see a lot of children checking their mobile phones; almost nobody plays football on the playground, like in the past. In addition, food is another important cause of overweight. Fast-food and sweets are consumed in large quantities. All the chemicals added make the food tasty and, somehow, they create a sort of addiction. For instance, food like burgers, pizza, chips or ice-cream are harmful for the body when it is consumed as a daily meal. So, \u201coverdose\u201d of junk food and playing on the computer instead of running outside are two major causes for overweight.",
        "Furthermore, obesity has seriously harmful effects on individuals. Beside the bad image, which is just the top of the iceberg, there are serious threats to health, like diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hormonal issues, bone injuries and so on. Moreover, the psychological effects are also very serious, like the lack of self-esteem and self-confidence and depression. For example, overweight children are more exposed to bullying because of their appearance. They are often traumatized and suffer from lack of confidence, because they cannot defend themselves and end up being isolated and frustrated. Therefore, overweight has serious effects, both physically and mentally, for children and they last in the long period of time.",
        "In conclusion, obesity is one of the most serious challenges of western society in the modern era. Less physical activity and junk food have harmful effects on children, like a lot of diseases and hidden psychological effects on long term."
