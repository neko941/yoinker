The residents of the area, including me, are daily commuters of the bus service provided by your establishment. However, during the last few weeks, your buses are making reoccurring delays and that is affecting our arrival at the workplace. To add more grief, some buses are not coming at all, resulting some of us to hail a taxi to reach our office. Sometimes, this situation forces me and some other commuters to take congested buses and stand all the way in miserable condition to reach our office.",
