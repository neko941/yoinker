        "Education and soft skills of a person can go hand in hand. Some people are of opinion that by completing graduation one can land into a good job while others think that on job experience & soft skills are more important. In my opinion, completing an academic education will benefit us more. We will discuss both views in detail in the below paragraphs.",
        "Completing a graduation degree is the best way to get a good job for a student. Firstly, getting a good understanding of a specific major will help to work more efficiently when in on-job training. Also, there are on-campus internship programmes that are conducted in the last tenure of the course which will benefit the student to learn some practical ways of working and develop skills like communication. Secondly, Students will also be able to learn various subjects integrated with their specialization and get a full understanding of a particular subject. For example,  esteemed institutions like MIT, and IIT where education has helped to create future entrepreneurs.",
        "On the other hand, working without a university education might impact a person's overall knowledge.",
        "Nowadays, many educational institutes believe in a more practical approach in terms of schooling, they share a lot of practical experiences. Moreover, communication skills can also be developed in college, more personality development classes can be included as a part of the curriculum.",
        "To conclude, Although, work experience is beneficial to gaining understanding in the practical sphere  university education is equally important for students  the university since knowledge is key to any success"
