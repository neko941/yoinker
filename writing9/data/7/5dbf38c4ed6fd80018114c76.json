        "Life has indeed changed how the humanity works and operates. Many people believe that it is better to live in the current life rather than a century ago. In my opinion, I totally agree with the statement, due to the rise in technology and world trade, which will be discussed further in the essay below.",
        "Nowadays, due to the advance in technology, communication is definitely easier than 100 years ago. With the help of the internet, the society is now able to connect with one another easily, regardless of the location or time differences. Online applications such as Facebook, Skype and Twitter enable humanity to do virtual face-to-face interaction straightforwardly in around the world. In 2015, 'The NYT' magazine discovered that online users have increased to 1,000% compared to a half century ago, as people enjoy the numerous benefits through the internet. Therefore, technology allows the community to communicate easily in comparison to a century ago.",
        "In addition, international trades enable the society to get a variety of spices and foods from around the world within a walking distance. These days, people are able to purchase global meals and beverages, in a proper packaging and safety, through the supermarket or online shops easily. For instance, within the last 20 years, Australia's largest supermarket named Woolworths, have offered more than 50,000 of international condiments and snacks in their 30,000 stores. Hence, the rise in global trades have allowed the community to get a plethora of meals and spices across all countries straightforwardly.",
        "To conclude, the current life is indeed better than 100 years ago. In my opinion, the advance of technology and the increase of international trades contribute to the beautiful life that we are currently living now."
