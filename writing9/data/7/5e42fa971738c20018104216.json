        "There is no denying that scientific research is indispensable for the development of the country. Some individuals opine that any research related to science and technology should be controlled by the government, while others contend that the responsibility of research should be given to private commercial companies. Notwithstanding, this discourse will explore these two viewpoints and subsequently put forward my own perspective accordingly.",
        "Admittedly, the advocates of the view of taking authority of any kind of scientific research by the government have their own justification. The rationale behind their argument might be that the government can invest in research and development to enhance the life of the residents. This is because the government is accountable to the public, and research is paid by the taxes. Moreover, knowledge acquired through research is not always targeted for the general audience. Therefore, the government can control the flow of information, also.",
        "However, taking a look at it from the flip side, could the contenders of the school of thought that postulate that private companies should be given the control of research be absolutely right? \tCertainly, the justification for their argument is much likely that these companies have more financial and operational sources than the government to develop various technologies and vaccines. Not only do these companies provide a better future for the people, but they also help the economy to boost in terms of technology and education. According to a survey by BBC UK, to epitomize, private companies invest fifty percent of profits into research and development.",
        "In conclusion, having explored both sides of the arguments, I consent to the hilt that the government should have the primary responsibility in controlling and monitoring of scientific research. Also, vigorous checks and balances need to be in place to ensure future research is ethical and productive."
