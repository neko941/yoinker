        "Crime stories, films and movies have been around for a long time, but over the last few years it has exploded into a cultural phenomenon. In my opinion, crime movies allow people to examine important psychological questions, but the result for society will be insignificant in most cases.",
        "The main reason why the majority of citizens prefer crime films is that viewers try to understand the psychology of killers or a thorny issue of the crime. Recent scientific research has shown that 12% of criminals in Great Britain were justified due to fan interest and willingness to protect criminals who may truly be innocent. Moreover, for many reasons authorities use such a great public interest in crimes in many ways. For instance, to distract citizens' attention from the real life problems and to have an opportunity to manage the society better.",
        "On the other hand, some scientists were concerned about connection between watching crime movies and real crime scenes. Therefore, research has been conducted and it was proved that among those who watched crime shows there was the same percentage of criminals as among those who did not watch. Consequently, there is no any impact on society from viewing criminal stories. Additionally, psychologists say that detective stories develop logical thinking which is a positive result for viewers.",
        "In conclusion, the question of watching films about crime is a difficult one to answer definitively. However, based on the reasons presented above, I believe that people should be able to choose the genre that not only popular and won a wider audience, but which they more interested in because there is no connection between watching and doing crime."
