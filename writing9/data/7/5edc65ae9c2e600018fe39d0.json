        "It's believed that favourable teaching methods are variable among individuals. While people used lectures as a learning method to many students, now the situation is different with the advanced technology for education and many people believed that there is no purpose for attending them. The essay, however, will discuss why this is completely preposterous.",
        "Despite being a significant consumption of time, educational classes and seminars were used as a way of teaching large numbers of students. Moreover, many people prefer the physical existence in an educational institute and they tend to concentrate more using such an active communication. For instance, in Japan, children are being taught to react constantly during a class in order to refresh their minds and boost up their concentration levels. Therefore, although lectures are considered to be conventional means of teaching, it's importance is undeniable.",
        "In contrast, now with the development of technology for education, many people think there is no justification for attending lectures. Furthermore, such activity would be such a waste of time and it should be avoided. For example, research showed that recorded classes and seminars are the most popular and practical ways of learning among young learners. Consequently, it's no longer practical to attend a seminar that could be recorded and watched in the internet.",
        "In conclusion, In the past, education, style involved the physical attending of a lecture, but now with the world being technologically controlled, many people think there is so need for using this particular way of teaching. The essay dicussed why eliminating this method would be totally wrong. In my opinion, reactive educational ways are still important and denying that would be completely unacceptable."
