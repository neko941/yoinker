        "Undoubtedly it is true fact in the cutting-edge era machinery is developing day by day. So it helps to influence the masses in ample ways like watching TV and other programs.",
        "Some individuals think that it is a good way for them . While others believe that it is not wealthy for folks because it reduces thinking power . I agree to a large extent with the latter notion . I will discuss all the information in the ensuing paragraphs .",
        "To commence with , there are myriad reasons to agree with this notion . In the modern ,epoch masses have the extra presence to reduce their stress . So if we spend most of our season in  indoor activities like playing video games as well as watching TV . So they lost their ability of thinking . For instance , recently a man takes suicide because he loses his mental ability . Thus , mental fitness is a vital part of every human life . So folks should spend most of their time in an outside activity . Because it helps to increase our physical as well as mental health .",
        "To shift toward the remaining notion , watching TV and playing games are not good for offspring . To explain it , mostly this age is a golden age for them . So that moment they are not completely mature .  So if they spend most of their stage on automation so they lost their goal . For instance , in the article in the newspaper , a rich family were complete all the wishes of their children  . So he has adopted bed company since childhood . After some ,term he  lost his mental and physical well-being and he died.  Hence , health and wealth both are essential in human life .",
        "To sum up , most  crimes are held with the help of machinery so u think automation is very harmful to the young generation . With the help of this ,development daily crime rate is increasing . I think it makes a big hurdle in future"
