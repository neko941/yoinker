        "Children\u2019s life nowadays is quite different that they tend to have an unhealthy behaviour. Some people believe that schools must respond to change this bad behaviour while other people believe that parents are the most vital agents of these changes. This essay will examine these aspects of whether institute or parents have responsibility for this.",
        "Parents today are busier than parents in the past. They just have less time to care for their children. Therefore, for the children\u2019s meal, parents prefer to give their children money so that children can buy snacks in school. As a result, their children can buy everything the food that they want and no one controls them when they buy food outside. From this point, parents have the responsibility to ensure their children eat a healthy meal. One of the solutions is to cater the meat for their lunch. Schools also have an important role in this by controlling the food quality in the canteen and do not permit children to buy meal outside.",
        "The other unhealthy lifestyle is that children do not care to keep their area clean. In school, some students like to litter the rubbish everywhere. Also, they like to play with their friends without a care whether the place clean or dirty. After playing, they hold the drink using their hands without washing their hands first. All of what they have potentially affected their health. Because of that, teachers in the academy must direct their children to have a healthy life and make strike rules for this. Parents also must teach their children to usually keep clean.",
        "To sum up, to change the unhealthy lifestyle in children, I believe that both parents and schools have the responsibility for it. While the parents control and teach their children at home, teachers do it in school."
