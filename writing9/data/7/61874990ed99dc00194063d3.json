        "About the incident, my visit to your store last Friday was related to purchasing my monthly frozen, while one of the staff was filling the freezer; consequently, the place was slippery, although there were no wet floor signs to alert customers. During my purchase decision, I did not follow the slippery space, which caused this trip, and I got hurt on my knees.",
        "Therefore, I suggest that your staff ought to understand the necessity of health and safety guidelines, which must include penalty clauses for careless behaviour in my view. As a regular client at your store, I will not tolerate this in the future and will follow legal procedure against your outlet if things are incorrect.",
