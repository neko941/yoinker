        "Learning a second language at a very young age is much better than learning it in teenage life. Just as a coin has two sides, there are advantages as well as disadvantages of early learning. However, as I believe,in this essay, I will prove to you why the pros outweigh the cons.",
        "When primary schoolers learn a foreign language at school, it can bring them particular advantages that late learners cannot be related to. Young children are enthusiastic to learn and absorb everything they see and hear in the environment. Moreover, youngsters can pick up the native pronunciation and accent more naturally than adults. Research has shown that children who start learning a second language at a young age develop stronger cognitive skills such as problem-solving and multitasking skills. Approved by my experience, in our country,our generation, who learned English since elementary school, do far more efficiently not only in English but also in other soft skills than the previous generation, who had to start learning English only when they were in high school.",
        "On the contrary, a non-native language learning can affect the learning of the  mother-tongue language. Bilingual children may find it confusing to learn two languages at the same time. For example, children who speak native language at home and practise foreign language at school will have a hard time switching the two without mixing them. Nevertheless, if the parents could help resolve this situation, the child will certainly be able to master both the native and non-native languages.",
        "In conclusion, although there are both upsides and downsides of learning a second language at a young age, the mastery, fluency and intellectual development that can be achieved by early learning, far overbalance the little drawbacks."
