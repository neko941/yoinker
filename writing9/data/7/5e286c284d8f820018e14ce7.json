        "I am writing this letter to express my dissatisfaction towards the technical glitch I am experiencing in the working of the Bajaj mixer grinder I purchased from your shop last Monday.",
        "Being a chef by profession, I make a large quantity of food every day, as I run a tiffin service from my home. Yesterday when I was grinding the gravy in grinder, there was a sudden loud noise from it, after which it completely stopped working. I tried removing and reinstalling the plug but it does not work at all.",
        "As I already mentioned, I run a tiffin service, I have to make large quantities of food every day. With the mixer not working the preparation time for food increases, causing delay in delivery of the tiffins. As a result, all my customers are complaining about the same.",
        "Therefore, I would request you to send somebody to repair the mixer on priority, as it is hampering my work. I would also request if you can send a spare mixer along with your engineer in case my equipment is  going to take time for the repair work.",
