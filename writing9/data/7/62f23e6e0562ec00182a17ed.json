        "It is frequently said that space technology does not apply to individuals. Many people believe that spending money on exploring space is a waste as the focus should be on civilisation on this planet. In this essay, I will discuss reasons I agree with the latter.",
        "Firstly, space exploration helps many high-skilled jobs and fuels technology. In this aspect, it helps the economy expand with the latest innovations from space. Hence, funding projects in areas helps boost the nation's economy rather than the opposite because it contributes to the advancement of telecommunication technology, which may further save resources on earth. Secondly, outer space studies help improve the world's progress in multiple elements, including medicine, horticulture and climate change. For instance, studying plant growth in outer space helps find solutions to plantations in extreme weather on our planet. Hence, the study of space contributes to making our daily living more bearable.",
        "In addition, studying the cosmos help in shifting our perspectives. Astronauts observing the thinning of our earth\u2019s atmosphere enable reports of how fragile our planet is. Moreover, watching how greenhouse effects had impacted venus to become an inhabitable planet gave us a picture of the urgency to save the earth from greenhouse emissions. Thus, it brings us more opportunities to appreciate our motherland by changing our lifestyle and making policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.",
        "In conclusion, exploring space may seem wasteful to some; however, I believe it is essential to our planet's livelihood. Perhaps, it is time to wake up to the reality of our greying world."
