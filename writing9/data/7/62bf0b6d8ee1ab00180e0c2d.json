        "In the present day, many people are tending to use various kinds of banking services such as credit cards, saving accounts and loans for different personal purposes. Some people believe that government and banking authorities should make it  harder for individuals to borrow a huge amount of money, and I strongly agree with this statement.",
        "There are a number of probable arguments in favour of this view. Firstly many folks borrow a large amount of loan without having a soild plan. This massive personal debt results in increasing their burden. For Instance, the statistics represent that 75% of the people are unable to repay their debt and most of them lie in the age range of under 35. Consequently, these individuals, get depressed  and choose to end their lives with suicidal  attempts.",
        "In addition to this, these days individuals are more materialistic. They lend money for useless things just to satisfy themselves. For example, a survey of renowned banks reveals that the majority of  people apply for  loan to spend money on unnecessary items. They use the money to show off their status. Therefore, it is the responsibility of the bank authorities that they should inspect the purpose of the loan. Certain rules and regulations must be imposed to meet the minimum criteria of the debt.",
        "In conclusion, various people get into larger debts by taking extra debts. Therefore, banking authorities should tighten the rules in the procedure to avail money from the bank, to cope with the situation effectively."
