        "It is an irrefutable fact that everyone has the chance to live their life with own rules in the modern world. Some people assert that youngsters should encourage to take the important steps of their life their own. I am the favour with this fact. In this essay, I intend to discuss the both views before the reasonable conclusion can be drawn.",
        "To begin with, There are several reason to spot this view why this is helpful for the teenagers. Firstly, It is the duty of parents to teach their child how to make a good decision because it demands of the today's time children should take their own decisions in life. It's helped to increase the confidence level in adults. To cite an example, The university of Toronto did a great research which showed that youngster who has the power to choose their own career path have 70% chance to become a successful person in their life. In addition to this, Most of the richest men in Canada come from an independent family, where freedom to make their own decision. Moreover, In the modern era teenagers prefer to stay alone in very young age, So they to take their own responsibility from study to other valuable decisions.",
        "On the other hand, Each coin has two sides, So sometimes children's are using this  freedom for wrong works. For example, The survey of the London university indicates that kids under 16 have less mental and social awareness their soul because in that age mind does not have the ability to find difference between wrong or right. Furthermore, young people are very angry in that age, Thus if they have a chance to make their own decisions may it will ruin their future because that anger can distract them make a good choice.",
        "To summarize, I pen down and say that each aspect its own essence, So its the need for the current time folks should give permission to teenagers make their own choice, but always help them to choose the right path for future activity."
