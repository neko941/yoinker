        "There are two different opinions about how to educate the children to make decision of their life. One is to let the children choose what they want depends on their own wishes; however, the other is to teach them to make choices according to their importances. The articles will discuss both pros and cons of these two types of perspectives. The most important thing is not how they make decisions is whether they will know how to take responsibilities after that.",
        "",
        "If the children learned to make their own options on daily matters, they will be able to cultivate their independence.  After the certain age, it is crucial for the kids to know how to make decisions without the permission of their parents on some simple necessity, such as dietary, wearing and their own way for having fun in their life. Children will be able to take responsibility for their choices as long as they know how to make their own choices. It is needless to say how those \"mommy boys\", the male grown adults who ask for their names advices, are mostly lacking of living ability since their parents are accountable for their life choices.",
        "",
        "On the other hand, it is also essential for the children to prioritize the decisions according to the importances. They will know the consequences and make right decisions. For instance, Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, dropped off the university when he realized the profits from making his own company. He knew that university degree could not satisfy his needs for wealth and money. Therefore, as long as the children know the accountability of the options, they will be able to pick up what matter to them the most among those options.",
        "",
        "To sum up, two different suggestions are importances for the children's education about taking priority and commit to the better options of their life. Children have to learn to choose in their basic living environment, but also need to posses the ability to tell what matter to them the most.  They will be able to grow up as responsible and independent among the choices they make in their life."
