        "Many argue that higher education institutions should choose those with top academic achievements as their students. While other people contend that education institutions have to give chances to people who do not record good marks in their previous educations, I believe that all people regardless of their academic statistics should have equal rights to get into any university.",
        "On the one hand, I can understand why universities are inclined to implement an enrolment selection based on marks. This aims to ensure that prospective students are eligible to meet the certain standard established by the university that will affect the output of the institution\u2019s achievements in the future. For example, top-tier universities like Harvard and Standford have stipulated clear admission criteria for students that want to get into the institutions, as revealed by the high score demand on GRE exam results. By doing this, those universities would assure that they accept proper students that can follow their learning systems and also contribute to higher university achievements.",
        "On the other hand, the second argument is also important to be discussed, since the high enrolment standards implemented by universities since confine many people who do not have good academic records to gain chances to enter higher education institutions. However, it should bear remembered that gaining education access, including the opportunity to get accepted into universities, is part of fundamental human rights. Further, it can also affect the widening of inequality in society when it is solely viewed of people who can study in higher education institutions. For example, the main reason why emerging countries are difficult to vie with developed countries in terms of economics is due to the lower ratio of citizens who graduated from universities.",
        "In conclusion, there are plausible reasons why several people assume that universities should be focused on receiving admissions from bright students rather than lower-gained academic records. Nevertheless, personally, I think every people notwithstanding their marks should obtain  equal access to higher education."
