        "Education is a good opportunity for those of us who strive for  better lives. But for people in full-time employment, getting the balancing act between work and studying can prove a stumbling block. So, what are the benefits of hitting the books once at work?",
        "First, Uni has often been considered a logical way step for those who wish to continue their education after school. While options of Master's degrees, PhDs and other postgraduate qualifications exist, many students leave after obtaining their Bachelor's and head into the world of work. After years of doing the same job,some feel getting new skills or knowledge to their locker  may open up new opportunities or help them to get a promotion.",
        "Second, studying part-time in the evenings and at weekends can be a great way to juggle responsibilities. In terms of the benefits, learning new techniques that you can bring into the workplace can make you more of an authority in your area and a go-to person for advice. If the business has a skills shortage you may be able to step up to the plate and fill that gap. In short, studying more could make you promotable down the line and more useful to the business. If you study in a classroom, your experience of the workplace could bring a wealth of knowledge to other students and provide real-life experience for you to draw on.  You may also meet like-minded people whom you can add to your professional network in the future. And while adult learners have to consider things like children, homelives and work, many adults and part-time courses are more flexible and spread over a number of years. Some courses can even be done partly or entirely online, which means that you can manage your time easily studying from home and you don't have to factor in travel time.",
        "In conclusion, there are a variety of options for those who wish to return to studying. And increasing your skill may open up new careers or opportunities in your professional life."
