        "The fashion industry is one of the fast changing industry in the modern era.Change is the law of life and youngsters are the most influenced ones's of this changing trend. Nowadays, people prefer going to malls to buy branded products, but a large section of people still prefer traditional shopping from their set shopkeepers. In this essay, we will discuss both aspects of this development in the light of several reasons, before any conclusion can be drawn.",
        "Firstly, it is universally accepted fact that taste and choices of people changes over time.People prefer shopping at malls because they get a variety of things under one roof and environment in malls is far better than any local markets.For example, we do a lot of things for our entertainment while shopping for our necessities like watching movie,eating, dancing, play area for kids and much more.Also, youngsters do imitate their favourite superstar or famous icon and try to copy them and hence, shop for particular brands to show off to their friends.Shopping malls contribute a lot to economic growth and change is necessary for every economy to boom.",
        "Secondly, some people prefer buying from local shopkeepers because of the price differences. On the other hand, for some people who have time constraints,  they find it difficult to visit huge malls for small requirements. Local markets also offer a wide range of products and advantages, such as the freshness of fruits and vegetables, dairy products, spices and pulses etc.Besides this, local markets give employment to a lot of people and helping them to earn their livelihood.For example, my family prefers buying grocery items and other household products from local chains as they offer a wide range of discounts and offers.",
        "To conclude, everything contributes to the growth of the economy. The increasing trend of shopping malls has more positive points which are eclipsing the counter argument of shopping in the local markets. Change is important and we know the trend of online and visual shopping is on the rise. People  now prefer shopping online, where they get extra facilities of free home delivery and wide range of products. In my opinion, I will prefer going to the mall because of the variety of things one can do under one roof."
