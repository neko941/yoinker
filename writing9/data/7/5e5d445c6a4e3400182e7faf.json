        "Dear Sir,",
        "I am writing this letter to express my unhappiness about the plan to make the local airport bigger and increase the number of flights. My house is located at the 3rd Avenue Street, opposite to the old post office. It is hardly five minutes walk to the airport from my place.",
        "The main problem of me being sad about the plan is because of the noise pollution being faced. When the Government built the airport, they have not taken into account the regulations for the minimum distance policy which prevailed. There is flight landing or taking off every ten minutes which is very noisy.",
        "The reason why I am against this development is mainly because of the anticipated increase in flights which might further worsen the issue I already have. This could also lead to a considerable increase in road traffic.",
        "Being one of the reputed newspapers in my area, I look forward to your further investigation on the matter so that issue could reach the concerned authorities.",
        "Yours Sincerely,",
