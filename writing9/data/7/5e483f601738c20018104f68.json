        "Today, television is used as a primary source of entertainment and information around the world. The main audience for television is children. Some people think that television can have negative effects on children. While others believe television could help children in their future. In this essay, I will discuss both the point of views and give my own opinion.",
        "Children usually get addicted to certain shows on television. As a result, they are easily distracted from their studies. Eventually, they tend to spend more time on watching shows, which does not help them in any way. Sometimes, children also watch disturbing content and keep thinking about it. For example, when I was in my high school, I was addicted to watch teenage shows and I was so involved that I used to spend hours to watch those shows.",
        "On the other hand, there are a lot of shows that can help children in their academics or to become a better person. There are shows that have a moral story or there are shows which can help children to learn academic concepts. For example, I have a cousin who always used to watch national geographic shows, which would help him learn new concepts or subjects like physics, mathematics etc. As a result, he had more knowledge as compared to his friends.",
        "In conclusion, television can have negative effects on children or could help them in future. In my opinion, I feel that children should be guided by their parents or teachers on what type of shows or channels they should watch which can be beneficial for them."
