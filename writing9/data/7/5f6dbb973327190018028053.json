        "Millions of people are travelling through public transportation nowadays. Being an essential part of life, people often debate if spending money is better for constructing; new railway lines or old public transport. This essay will explore both the sides and provide detailed analysis to aid readers with arriving at their conclusion.",
        "A few observation offer support to consider making new railway line for fast trains have beneficial effects. One supportive argument states that this new transportation system will allow people to travel long distances in a shorter time. As maximum people have a shortage of time, they prefer to spend most of the time doing some useful work instead of travelling. Not only for time-saving but fast trains between the cities are also more than reliable as it will have the proper junction for a start and stop with a limited number of stoppage between the route. For example, people having jobs at longer routes and they need to travel daily from office to home, feel this fast trains more comfortable.",
        "Despite the above arguments, some people could believe that the government should invest the money on existing transportation. As the increase in urbanization, most of people prefer to travel through busses and cabs for shorter distances. Conditions for roads are getting worse as the number of vehicles on roads is more than the spaces. Increase in traffic is the problem of every city so the government should invest in making new roads. To further explain, because of the COVID situation most people avoid to travel through crowded vehicles instead they prefer to travel through cars or bikes because of that traffic is increasing nowadays.",
        "Undoubtedly, the formation of fast trains give the people more reliability and time-saving management, but because of expenses, they prefer to travel through the cheaper source of transportation as not all people have same financial conditions. However, the best recommendation for those who caught in this debate would include consideration of the above options."
