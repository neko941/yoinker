        "Learning a foreign expression is an important skill in our world today. Some experts think that the best moment for young people to learn a new style is at Primary School. While this could bring many benefits  and  drawback. I believe that the pluses are for more than two minuses.",
        "On the one hand, many parents think that kids should not start learning any other speech because more subjects will overburden the child. Firstly, it could be a waste of time since children need to focus on other subjects such as math, science. Secondly, children may get confused because of learning many languages at the same time and this could have a negative impact on their development.",
        "On the other hand, in my opinion that children should start learning the other languages in elementary age.Because at an early age, children can learn any jargon so compare and kid's brain is supremely adaptive for any new subject or any style. In other words, for children with learning languages is not a hard task as it is for adults. In addition, languages nowadays are as important in science and math.",
        "In conclusion, although  students have the chance to choose properly a foreign dialect which could be benefited them in the future. Therefore, on balance, I think that children should learn  second accent at an early age, they enter into the school first time."
