        "Technological advancement has brought many interesting games. Earlier, most of the computer games were designed to keep children in mind, however, there are many games which can be played by adults also.  Many parents think it has a harmful impact, but in my opinion, it has a lot of benefits.",
        "A decade ago, digital games were only restricted to entertainment purpose, however, due to improvements in technology, many children are getting educational benefits because these games are more engaging and children can use their own imagination and thinking. To illustrate, if a student is working on to improve his scores in English subject, he can play games  like word puzzle, \"complete the sentence\" and many more. These games will provide an instant feedback on how to improve, unlike in the real life situation. Also, if some youths have difficulty in concentration, video games can be highly beneficial.",
        "On the contrary, these games can have a negative impact also because if someone is constantly playing a game, it will have an immense pressure on the eyes and the child will end up wearing spectacles. In addition, if a child is playing a violent game, for example \"Call of Duty\", it can have a negative result in his brain as he might behave violently.  As per the latest news from \"The Times\", many children have committed suicide because there was a game which gives children some tasks and the last task is to commit suicide.",
        "In my perspective, computer games generally have educational benefits provide if it's been played wisely. The misuse of the games can have negative consequences."
