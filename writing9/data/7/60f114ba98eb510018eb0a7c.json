        "Although going to see a live event, such as a play, concert or football match, is considered to be more enjoyable than watching it on television, I do not agree with this. This essay will discuss why I prefer the screen in my living room.",
        "Firstly, watching an event on television has no stress involved, because it only requires to have the device turned on and seat comfortably in front of it, which means not having to travel to a busy venue, queue with thousands of other people even for the toilet. Furthermore, this is a great way to save money that would have been needed for tickets and travel cards. For example, the Euro 2020 final was played at Wembley, in London, not far from home, nevertheless, we watched the game on television and had a great time.",
        "The television offers the best view of the event, which is the most important point, because of the operator who has the freedom to move around to capture the images. In other words, watching on television is like getting the best possible seat, where you can see things that you could easily miss otherwise. For instance, so many times I went to a live event and ended up without even seeing the performer, because of being too far from the stage, which is a risk you never take with the television.",
        "In spite of the statement affirming that attending a live performance is more enjoyable, I would rather watch the same event on television because you have the best view of the show and avoid busy and stressful situations."
