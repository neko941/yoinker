        "Owing to drastic escalation of population, it is irrefutable that the development of new structures are essential. Some individuals argue that the ancient constructions should be removed by the authorities to accommodate the modern needs. I quite agree with the statement due to the limited spaces available on the planet and unsafe of the antique buildings. Hence, I am going to substantiate my views with relevant examples.",
        "First and foremost, to fulfil the requirements of rapid increase of the human being, it is undoubtedly true that the number of land in the country will never be escalated. Consequently, the developing engineering constructions could be able build the integral developments, according to the contemporary architectural methods, which would accomplish the real need of people such as skyscrapers as well as disaster proof durable buildings. Moreover, the old properties have constructed in a large land and mostly with fewer floors. Thus, those will definitely  only cater very limited number of people, which lead to large amount of obstacles in managing infrastructure facilities and achieving the requirements of its citizens.  In this situation, the government should take proactive steps to identify the old buildings that should be preserved for the future generation as per its archaeological and architectural values and destroy the other ancient structures for better utilizing of existing properties.",
        "On the other hand, it has been proved beyond doubt by the construction engineers that the older constructions are out-dated and unsafe. The lifespan of them is expired and people enter into those unsafe buildings or individuals who live close vicinity or the pedestrians are facing abundant of menace with regard to their safety. For an instance, the  part of the old Dutch hospital located in a city limit in Sri Lanka gas fell down recently as it is an outdated structure. As a result, more than ten persons killed and several mankind got critical injuries. Hence, those unsafe, ancient constructions should be eradicated from the locations.",
        "In conclusion, although some architectures have significant ancient and cultural values, the rest of old constructions as should be demolished to develop modern high-tech structures to accomplish the prevailing life conditions and needs of mankind. Furthermore, due to the lack of lands available on earth as well as   safeguard people from severe devastations as per its poor structures, I strongly believe that governments have to knock down the absurd buildings."
