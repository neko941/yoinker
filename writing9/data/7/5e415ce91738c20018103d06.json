        "Since the turn of the 21st century, the issue of the people does not feel in good healthy and active as they used to do have become a highly noticeable condition, triggering healthy problems and declining quality of lives. Therefore, potential problems of this situation will be discussed and some solutions of how they could achieve this will be offered in this essay.",
        "The first problem of this issue is the changed of life styles. As well as the technological advancement, loads of people have been using the technical aids, technical devices and machines. For example, when they go outside to a near place, they take a car. Moreover, it led to them sedentary lifestyle due to sitting and working the whole day on the table without movements. Furthermore, some students are taking the online classes instead of face to face. What is the suitable solution for these problems is that physical exercises are needed to do well, such as, walking, running and go to the gym.",
        "In addition to this, a lot of consumption of fast food is also another problem of this concern, for instance, burger, pizza, etc. If the consumption habits go on with this trend, people will get a serious health problem. To avoid this situation becoming any worse, they should turn to eat healthy food like home-made, vegetables & fruits. Without such solution, it is undeniable that this problem is unlikely to be solved.",
        "Taking everything into consideration, in my humble opinion, if the proposed alternative solutions were to be implemented, these potential problems could be reduced to some extent, even if not totally eliminated."
