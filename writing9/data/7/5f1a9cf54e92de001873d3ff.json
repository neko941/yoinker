        "The issues of whether the money spent on space exploration is well-worth have been raising debates. Some might say that space exploration can be seen as an ultimate solution to problems, such as population booming and fossil fuel depletion. On the contrary, others insist on the view that money spending on these space studies is expensive and instead the government should shift attention to the current environmental problems. Standing from general viewpoints, I strongly believe with the former opinion for the following reasons.",
        "To begin with, space exploration is a long-term strategy for the survival of humanity in terms of resolving difficulties regarding population and fuels. First of all, by researching outer space, the scientist can find another suitable environment for humanity. Therefore, part of the world population can move to another planet to live and start a new civilization, which can lighten the burden of not enough space to live in many countries. Secondly, the researchers who conduct these experiments can find an alternative power resource to the current fossil fuels. This can be seen as the most obvious remedy to solve the current difficulty of fuel scarcity. Finally, by overcoming obstacles, the government can ensure stable growth in economy and raise the citizen\u2019s living standard",
        "On the other hand, many people claim that capital generated for these explorations is tremendous due to the fact that there are many expensive machines and money should be found to solve current environmental hardness like wildlife conservation and preventing deforestation. However, looking at the future, preserving the current living environment is impossible and the destruction of the earth is unavoidable, so that finding a new place to live is more important compared to other minor issues in terms of the protection of humanity .",
        "In conclusion, it is indisputable to say that funding on exploring space is well-deserved."
