        "Wealthy nations must give employment opportunities to competent, and knowledgeable workers from backward countries. I agree with the statement as I elaborate on it further.",
        "Rich countries have a hub of resources. A country with the majority of resources usually has excessive job openings, and immense wealth. For example, Arab countries are rich in oil resources, hence people from around the world wish to secure a job or trade with these places. Since there is always a balance required between demand, and supply countries should open their arms to the less fortunate. Amalgamation of cultures will boost employee morale in companies. When diverse cultures interact, organizations may flourish, thereby generating greater output. The American dream is a goal for many youth in poverty-stricken nations. If affluent nations were to outsource deserving individuals, it would even help their economy. For instance, a person working in Saudi Arabia will eventually plan to start his family life in the country. Underprivileged nations lack occupation chances, as the government is not able to provide for its citizens. Hence, the public of that country is always on a hunt for better prospects elsewhere.",
        "On the contrary, if people are to be welcomed to a foreign land the inhabitants should not suffer. In many cases, the natives are robbed of their jobs due to foreign overachieving individuals. This often creates a havoc, and dislike among fellow countrymen.",
        "In conclusion, although there will be some matters of dispute, rich nations must consider including employers from poor countries. It will ensure harmony between borders, and facilitate better relationships."
