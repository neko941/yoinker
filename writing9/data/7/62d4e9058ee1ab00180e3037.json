        "A population of ageing people with issues of health conditions who prefer taking substitution medication rather than visiting their general practice doctor in primary care hospital. Alternative medicine has its benefits, while I would argue that it is a negative development.",
        "On the one hand, alternative medicine is becoming more popular in recent years, which includes some treatments such as acupuncture, hemopathy and hypnotherapy. Many people took it as a majority treatment without the professional doctor\u2019s suggestion. More Interestingly, it cannot work as a major therapy because there is no scientific evidence to identify that patients can fully recover by taking a period of the substitution treatment. However, people with sickness might get some better feeling after they took such support treatment. For example, terminal cancer patients might reduce their pain through hypnotherapy.",
        "On the other hand, there are some advantages for people visiting their own doctors. Firstly, many general practice doctors can find some diseases before a patient\u2019s condition becomes worse through modern techniques. For instance,  a doctor found that a patient who has unexpected breathing sounds, so the doctor offer a screen of X-ray to the patient, then found that a tumor existed inside the patient\u2019s body. Secondly, modern medicine is more flexible to adjust the doses by following the patient\u2019s condition and the results of blood tests. Lastly, doctors always give the best suggestions and respect the decision that the patient made.",
        "In conclusion, I believe that there are some benefits of taking alternative treatment, but it cannot entirely instead the suggestions of treatment that came from their doctor."
