        "There is no doubt that these days people are living longer than before because of the high quality health services offered by the governments  for them, however, the question: Are over age people considered helpful in the society? Is being a controversial issue nowadays.In this essay I am going to examine this phenomenon from both viewpoints, while I tend to believe that old people can add a lot to our community because of their practical experiences.",
        "On one side of the argument, there are people who argue that older people are not beneficial for the society and they cost it more than what they can give because of their low abilities and skills at this age.Furthermore, they need more adequate treatment than young people at work, while specialists recommend them to work and contribute to the public regularly.For example, some company owners refuse to hire people above 65 years old because they will ask for higher salaries and benefits according to their experience.",
        "On the other hand, it is also possible to consider it with the opposing case.People over 65 years old can be considered as a fortune in the community because they can share their practical knowledge with young ones easily.Moreover, they can be involved in the consultation positions in order to keep them relaxed and give them more chances to make corrections for others mistakes as they might faced similar situations before.For instance, in Kuwait retired people can support communities in various ways, like handling the area's problems, supporting young people in their social and practical lives.This will give older people the feeling that they are needed in the population and their efforts are appreciated.",
        "In conclusion,as we have seen there is no easy answer to this question, however, I guess old people are offering us free of charge experiences and advises and we have to value their opinions."
