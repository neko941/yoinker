        "Criminal offences have been observed in society since the ancient era. It is proposed that advanced novel technology tends to limit crimes being committed in the modern world. I strongly agree with this view, because technological devices are not only capable of identifying the offenders easily but also restricting the access for crimes.",
        "To begin with, criminals are increasingly being identified and confirmed correctly with the help of the new technological equipment in the modern days. Therefore, they have only a minimal chance to escape from the country's legal bodies. Besides, criminals are not allowed to stay among the general population and they are sent to jails in many occasions. For instance, CCTV camera systems have been installed in many business places like supermarkets and this trend has resulted in a substantial reduction in robberies. Thus, it is conspicuously obvious that the prevalence of violent attacks shows a significant drop in contrast to the past due to the help from the novel innovations.",
        "Furthermore, new advancements in the security systems are skilful in restricting the opportunities to commit crimes. Many public and private places across the globe are now being monitored to detect possible risks using various technologies. Thus, people would have a  limited chance to involve in criminal activities in these places. For example, advanced devices like satellites are commonly used by developed countries for early detection of suspicious events like terrorist attacks and expedite their protective measures.",
        "In summary, violence seems to be detected early and offenders are correctly identified by the modern technological devices. I firmly believe that the comparatively reduced crime rate in the current word is secondary to this."
