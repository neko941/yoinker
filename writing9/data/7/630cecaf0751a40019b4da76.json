        "There is an opinion that sharing as much information as possible is beneficial in some fields(scientific, business, and academic world), while others argue that sharing information should be restricted as some information has critical data. Even though others think that information should be kept confidential, I agree with the idea that researchers and developers open this information or technology with others in order to broaden and improve this knowledge.",
        "On the one hand, some people believe that information should be restricted because they put a lot of time, money, and effort into developing new technologies and information. Although many people invest their own time and efforts in organizing new technology or generating concepts, they cannot insist on their own intellectual property if the information is made public. As a result, they are unable to receive enough compensation for their effort and investment. They are reluctant to invest their time and energy in research and development as a result. As an example, the business group Samsung was in the process of making significant advancements in their key semiconductor technology in 2018, but at that time, that important technology was accidentally revealed to China\u2019s leading corporation. As a result, Samsung had to lose its patent for the technology and various businesses in Korea had no choice but to make payments for its license fees. However, I disagree with this idea because when the information and knowledge are opened to more people, they can get more possibilities to be upgraded with better quality.",
        "As the information is being shared with others, they can make progress in their technology by collaborating with others. Discussions in meetings and periodical seminars in various fields will improve their research and technology by accepting the various perspectives of others. Through discussion, they can gain more knowledge, new ideas, and innovative thinking. It could complement their weakness and magnify the advantages by accepting suggested improvement directions. For example, in 2018, the business group LG made inquiries for customer research on their experiences using cell phones. Through those investigations, they could understand customers\u2019 needs and enhance their technologies by improving their weaknesses. Consequently, they made great results in producing high-quality products with receiving top ranks for customer satisfaction. I agree with the idea that when they make efforts to open their technology and research, more and more people could benefit from these developments.",
        "In conclusion, although information and technologies are too important to be opened to the public, I agree with the idea that researchers and developers should make sacrifices for the developments in various fields in order to get benefit more and more people from these developments."
