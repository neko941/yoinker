By the year 2000, there may be as many as 29 million vehicles on British roads. \n\nAlternative forms of transport should be encouraged and international laws introduced to control car ownership and use.\n\nTo what extent do you agree or disagree?",

        "Transportation is an age long human activity. Although, the first vehicle to ply the roads of Britain was seen in 1888, the number of automobiles on the roads drastically increased to 29 million after 12 years. Therefore, I completely support the use of alternative modes of transport and introduction of international laws to regulate the way motor vehicles are being used and owned.",
        "Excessive use of automobiles for transport is highly associated with traffic congestion witnessed on our roads today. Consequently, people spend too long hours on journeys that ought to have taken them few minutes, thus, physical and psychological stress ensues. A good example is the case of Lagos, a densely populated state located in the South Western part of Nigeria, where most residents leave their homes early and return in very late in the night due to incessant delays experienced on the roads. It is, therefore, imperative for government to reinforce other means of transport such as railway and mass transport systems, in order to considerably reduce the number of cars in use.",
        "Another reason why I support this idea is the negative impact of car use on the environment.  This is because global warming had been revealed to be mainly caused by carbondioxide, a gas released from internal combustion engines of automobiles. Global warming depletes the ozone layer, which is a protective covering of the atmosphere. For instance, a recent study WHO  pointed out that the principal source of CO2 is the fume discharged from car exhaust. Hence, restriction of car ownership and use will invariably help to curtail the menace of global warming.",
        "To sum up, due to an upsurge in the use of vehicles, I am of the opinion that there should be reinforcement of railway transport and adoption of foreign laws to curb the ownership and use of cars. This will go a long way in reducing traffic congestion and making our environment safer."
