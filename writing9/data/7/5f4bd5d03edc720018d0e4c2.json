        "No one can deny that, a technology has revolutionised the transportation in many countries. In other words, it\u2019s argued that some people believe that the income of the country should spend to create a railway system which save money and time. While others tend to spend this money to fix a current public transport, both view will discuss in this essay and my point of view will be involved.",
        "To begin with, spending large amounts of money to create faster and convenient trains to help a nation for a better life. To illustrate, a survey conducted in 2018, by the welfare society, they compared the results with normal public transport and the it quite surprising that, 98% of the total crowd were agreed in construct new railway lines with speedy trains, For instance, most of people who is living in countryside and working in the city, they probably prefer to spend the weekend with them families, which means they are wishing to reach to their home fastest as they can. As a result, they build a trust to go for faster train rather than normal transport.",
        "On the other hand, the option of repair public transport still valid. A recent study had illustrated that, the main reason of such option because an individual can save money. Furthermore, these transport are free for some category of working people. For example, in my country government support the students and government workers by establishing monthly economy packages for public transport. Moreover for free, for older ages. Finally, such option will cover a huge number of people, which will get benefits from it.",
        "To conclude, both views have been discussed with the result, and in my opinion, I tend to the first option, as we are living in this competitive life. Therefore, the government have to enhance and develop the transportation network as per latest technology."
