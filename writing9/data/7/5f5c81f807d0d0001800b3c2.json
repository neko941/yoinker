        "Some people claim that university students should be allowed to choose any subjects they are interested in. However, others suggest that pupils should choose subjects such as science and technology so that they will find better employment. Personally, I believe that pupils should follow their interests.",
        "On the one hand, it is important that students should be able to learn what they really like in the university because subjects such as art and history can be helpful in one's future even though they aren't closely connected to modern technology. In other words, students with special talents can still make a success in their life even though they choose subjects that are not trendy or popular. Take the iPhone as an example, both cutting-edge technology and aesthetic value are what make this product great and successful. So the rapid development of technology means that there might be even more opportunities for graduates.",
        "On the other hand, it appears that picking subjects such as computer science or engineering is a more secure choice in modern society. This is because technology companies usually offer higher salaries to graduates and nowadays, technology is developing at an unprecedented pace. For instance, a recent study conducted in Japan has shown that the number of technology companies has increased by 22% in 2020, which means there are a lot of job vacancies in this industry. Consequently, more and more people decide to study in science and technology to pursue a better career.",
        "In conclusion, studying knowledge that is not trendy can be beneficial to one's career. However, nowadays, there are relatively more opportunities in technology industry. In my view, students should choose the subject they want instead of following trends."
