        "In recent times,  learning English has been increasing for years. The main advantage of this trend is that  it helps to improve the economy and the main drawback is that it can affect native languages. Speaking in  English has several merits.",
        "On the one hand, the English language has a prominent changed all over the world while it also a crucial role in its society, there are common benefits, which contribute to us, speaking a different language can be an encounter with each other easily and it will improve the tourism industry and stimulate job opportunities, which leads to economic growth in the country, whereas people could enhance their income. For instance, research shows, that in Sri Lanka's GDP,  70% of income comes from the tourism industry.  English is the main subject in schools .Which requires  day-to-day life,Such as private sector workers, highest studies, and overseas businesses.",
        "On the other hand, the main disadvantage of this phenomenon is that people are interested in learning the English language as a result, it might affect the native language and culture whereas the native language has an integral part of the future and It represents the country's identity. If it continues it would put an end to our language existence. For example, research shows, in Malaysia, that 80% of people speak only English and Could not speak their native language.",
        "In conclusion, after a thorough analysis of the topic,  Speaking another language has benefit instead of one language. It also plays a vital unit in its society. It can enforce the right method and mitigate the effect."
