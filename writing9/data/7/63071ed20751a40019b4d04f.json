        "Education plays a vital role in everybody's life. Some communities say that teachers should not give any homework to their children while some other communities argue with this matter and say that homework is mandatory for children in their education. In this essay, I will discuss both scenarios and then I will give my opinion on this matter.",
        "On the one side, If students are not given any homework, they will do some activities like playing games, watching TV, etc. However, children are spending most of their time in schools for their education so some people are thinking that it is better to not give any homework and allow the children to spend their spare time with some activities. Nowadays, Parents are encouraging their children to participate in other activities rather than studies like singing, dancing, etc. For example, If a child has an interest in both education and singing then it is good to spend his/her time  singing after school.",
        "On the other side, Homework is important in education. Because, Children will peruse their subject by doing the homework. By doing homework children will gain empirical knowledge. In some countries, children are given  homework as their punishment because teachers have no right to punish the children physically. In this way, children will follow some rules otherwise they will flout. For instance,",
        "children can develop their knowledge by doing things practically rather than theoretically.",
        "To sum up, In my view I agree with the latter statement because without homework and projects children will not get any empirical knowledge. It is important to examine their subject and get a brief knowledge of their subject. It is possible with homework and projects."
