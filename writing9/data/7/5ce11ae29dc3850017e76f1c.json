        "Nowadays we are living in a society based on consuming. In many developed nations, shopping is not only about buying the everyday things we need to survive but is also seen as a form of amusement. Some people hold the opinion that consumerism to relax is a positive trend, whereas, others have conflicting views. I personally feel that this is a negative development as people indulge in impulsive shopping after getting swayed by commercials or window displays to impress others.",
        "The main reason people buy items they do not really need is because of the influence marketing campaigns have on them. We are constantly bombarded with messages telling us that if we buy a certain product we will be happier, more beautiful or more complete. In many ways, these companies trick us into buying their products, however, spending money and time on things we barely need has no real value. For example, one of my mates bought an expensive bag after being tempted by a catchy discount offer using credit cards which she really does not need. The result such stuff usually ends up being scarcely used.",
        "In addition, shopping should be for fulfilling our necessity, not for our personal pleasure. A lot of us buy useless stuff to impress people. However, This is a sheer waste of precious money. Instead of splurging on items we do not require, the money can be well utilized by investing in savings Purchasing things that we do not need is a habit that makes imprudent.  For instance, most of my friends who spend their weekends\u2019 shopping have nothing else to talk about, other than their purchases, whereas my friends who use their time more wisely are often much more interesting and successful people.",
        "In conclusion, shopping and entertainment is not a good trend because instead of buying things which hardly need to impress others or owing to the influence of advertisements we should invest our time and money in more productive activities and investment plans."
