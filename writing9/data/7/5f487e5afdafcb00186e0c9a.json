        "Human kind has been experiencing different events in each generation. Hence, it is a bit hard to understand between each generation. Moreover, it is undeniable that interaction between the age gap or cultural difference can be hard to understand without a helping material. From my perspective, I believe that the power of music can be the material to bring the different ages and culture together. This essay will elaborate reasons and conclude with personal opinion.",
        "Firstly, music cannot be outdated in any generation. A lot of musicians have been emerged and disappeared repeatedly. But the most outstanding musician, such as Steve wonder, Michel Jackson, has never been hidden in shadow, even an enormous contemporary musician popped up. For instance, it is a personal experience that can support this thesis. Upon being an international student in Canada, I was an unsophisticated speaker of English. However, I could interact with others singing that famous music, even they had a different background and ages.Hence, even we were born in different countries, music can overcome the difficult language and cultural situation.",
        "Secondly, soul is a universal language to unite people regardless of cultural background. People can understand the concept of melody, which can easily amuse them. For instance, the most famous tune of all \"We are the world\" produced by a famous musician. This song promotes love and peace around the world, and this song translated into the various language versions; people from disparate cultural backgrounds enjoy and understand its underlying messages. Thus, music is a powerful resource to shrink the age discrepancy all over the world.",
        "However, music can exaggerate the gap of age difference, a different stage of maturity has altered the taste of melody. Since the tune is one of the art forms to reflect the social situation or reality, people in the dissimilar stage of humanity are inclined to listen to the specific piece that indicates the situation and matches their maturity.",
        "In conclusion, melody can influence the world. Although it large the age disparity, it helps to connect people from multitudes cultures."
