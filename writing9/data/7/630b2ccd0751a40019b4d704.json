        "Nowadays a lot of companies expect their employees to be technically sound along with extra skillsets to catch up with the fast-moving technology world. A section of society is of opinion that companies should invest in their employees for training while  some opine that it is completely up to individuals. I tend to agree with the latter because the skills acquired by an individual can be used somewhere too in the next company and learning new things must be one of the individual soft skills.",
        "Firstly, many companies want their employees to be technically sound only when the requirement arrives. Moreover, a lot of companies  only focus on the day-to-day job rather than investing in employees. For ,instance a certain job holder in the company may be doing the same job for the past 15 years without having a chance of acquiring new skills. However, results seem fascinating when corporate organizations are focused on acquiring new technical skills for employees. To illustrate this  60% off more profit was generated in stock companies when their employees were provided with Microsoft Excel and PowerPoint skills.",
        "Conversely, when an individual invests their time in learning new technical skills they will be more research-oriented and can easily get a quick promotion when they have skills in hand. In addition, they can even get a handsome salary from the next organization even if they are fired from their job. Furthermore, technically excellent employees can opt to  open their own businesses when they serve certain roles in the organization as they will have both business and technical skills side by side.",
        "As far as I am concerned, I tend to support the idea of learning skills on my own rather than waiting for companies as sometimes employees can be fired because they might not be technically efficient or the time they take to learn new skills hampers the organization's workflow. I believe individual skills can make a huge difference in company  outcomes when job holders are already in line with skyrocketing technology."
