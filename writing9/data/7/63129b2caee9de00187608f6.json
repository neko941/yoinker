        "Watching imported curriculum can help to gain knowledge about different cultures without even visiting the country. Some communities argue that folk should only watch plays from their own civilization while others say people should watch telecasts from a different society. In my opinion, folks should watch imported programs because they can learn different things about different traditions. I will discuss both the views and my opinion in forthcoming paragraphs.",
        "To begin with, watching only TV shows from your own society could give you awareness about their own nation and which can help society and the young generation to attach to the roots of their own traditions and perception. Most of the drama show in India shows all the tradition and festival and they do all the things according to rituals, which are vanishing these days among the youth. If they will watch shows from their own civilization they can learn about all the rituals which have to perform during ceremonies. Moving further, most of the young generation is impressed by western ability in India and they are following it and forgetting their own culture ,however, shows from their own homeland could help them to attach to their own skill.",
        "Moreover, programs from different countries would give  knowledge about different countries like  their culture, tradition, their ritual for ceremonies and food, which people can from their home, which is so convenient. If they have to travel to different countries and they can save themselves from culture shock. There are some cooking shows which show the recipes of famous food from different regions, which would help the public to try different food from around the globe in their home. For example, if someone has to travel to another place that they do not know anything about their living style and weather, then they can get education from such shows which tell us about different places.",
        "From my perspective, people should watch different shows from different nations to broaden their horizons about  different cultures and the best way to learn about their way of living."
