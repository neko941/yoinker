        "Currently, every person, including children, has their own mobile phone or device. While these can certainly help someone in regards to communication, accessing information and even learning, many schools are restricting the usage of mobile phones on campus. My opinion is that it is a positive decision as it will benefit the students both academically and in regard to health.",
        "Restricting phone use in the classroom itself can improve learning. While having a phone with them, people have the constant urge to check their phones resulting in a lack of attention. Students are always subconsciously alert for notifications and teachers are also distracted by the additional duty of making sure students don\u2019t use their phones in class. This causes disturbances in the class, affects learning and in the long-term, affects the future of the students. As mobile phones undoubtedly hinder academic progress in class, it is a beneficial step to restrict their usage.",
        "Another detrimental side to mobile phones is their impact on health. Using phones for long periods of time causes serious effects like deteriorating eyesight, headaches, nausea and many more. Most people who use phones from an early age are seen to have spectacles. This is more evident in the newer generations where children of ages even as small as 6 years old end up with bad eyesight due to spending a lot of time on their phones. Enabling students to access mobile phones at school will result in them spending their leisure periods on their phones, thus abandoning physical activities. This will cause their physical health to grow worse, and also increase the likelihood of the problems stated beforehand occurring. Banning the usage of phones will direct students to spend their time doing healthier activities and cause an overall improvement in their well-being.",
        "To conclude, despite mobile phones having facilities that are very helpful if used properly, the problems they cause to health and the hurdle it becomes for learning in class are more significant. I think that restricting phone usage in school is, without a doubt, a positive development."
