        "I am writing to make a complaint in regards to the food that we served to us 2 days ago. First of all, I would like to express my gratitude to you and your staff, that the monthly meeting of our company has been a success. My staff was delighted at how they are accommodated, from the beginning until the end of the event. The decorations and arrangements of the place were also pleasant and perfect for our taste.",
        "Although, I can't say the same about the foods. A week before the event, I talked to the head staff of your hotel that the menu should be Japanese cuisine as the majority  of the staff haven't tried it yet. However, we were served  pork and beef along with vegetable salads. There are some desserts as well and champagne for drinks. My staff was disappointed because they expected Japanese food but with respect to the ,chef they still eat it.",
        "It was not what we agreed and it is against the contract not to inform me ahead of time that a different batch of foods will be served to us. I would let it pass since it was successful nonetheless and my boss didn't complain. In the future, you should inform your clients if there are changes to what was previously talked about. We pay the full amount for the services and the place, and our expectations and the payment we made should be rewarded. I would advise you not to do it again or I would ask for compensation.",
        "I hope you will take measure of what happened, and I will expect that it will not happen again",
        "Yours faithfully,",
