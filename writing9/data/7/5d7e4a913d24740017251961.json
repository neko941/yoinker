        "It is true that nowadays people could just receive mass information  on the internet , thus affecting conventional schools to be not as crucial  as ever. Nevertheless, some still believe that the classroom and teacher\u2019s role cannot be changed to educate students.",
        "To begin with, the learning process is  getting more flexible and accessible because of technological breakthrough. Via searching engines, such as Google and YouTube, the learners could obtain various materials  they need. However, others argue that it by far poses a double edge sword impact. Students, especially children, and teenagers should be guided by professional educators. Unclear explanations in internet  might lead us to misconception and unintentionally  the users would possibly open negative website. My own experience could be a good illustration of this case. When I was in a primary school, I, without any purpose, clicked the advertising item which provided adult contents. Seeing that my teacher came fast to close that website.",
        "Likewise, the internet is only a device which everyone could share much information, whether  evidence-based or hoax information,  thus directing us to unreliable resources. Moreover, it is generally convinced that children who involve homeschooling  tend to be introvert individuals. This might because they do not experience social interaction in a classroom. With that, insensitiveness  to the surrounding is closer to them than the students in conventional schools.",
        "To conclude, I would claim that the internet could not ever overtake the role of classroom schools, in the case of trained teachers. It is because the internet consists of untrustworthy  information. Learning only from the internet also causes people to be social-social person ."
