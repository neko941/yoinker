        "In recent years, thanks to the increasing development of intercontinental media, people nowadays have more opportunities to approach different cultural features of many countries over the world. In recent years, some people have raised a growing concern about whether the expansion of international media involving movies, fashion shows, advertisements or TV programs thwarts the cultural diversity. In my opinion, I partly agree with this idea and some following paragraphs will elaborate on the double-edged impacts of this problem.",
        "On the one hand, through international social media platforms, people can access more information about many different cultures over the world and enlarge their scope of knowledge of local residents about their countries. Because of multimedia expansion, many splendid scenic spots and historical heritages would be promoted widespread over the world. Therefore, it could contribute largely to raising revenue from foreign tourists for tourism and help them easily search and learn more about other cultural values. Furthermore, the domination of international media is also a good carrier of knowledge and information. Not only does mass media enhance the national pride of young children, but it also stimulates their interest in maintaining and upholding their cultural values.",
        "On the other hand, if the international media deliver the similar messages to civilians, it might cause some detrimental effects on cultural diversity. Firstly, many young people nowadays, who have inadequate knowledge about the national values, have a tendency to imitate the lifestyles of other countries. This negative phenomenon is becoming more and more popular in some developing countries, which has driven globalization for several years. For example, young adults tend to copy many worldwide celebrities\u2019 traditional costumes or gestures belonging to other foreign cultures which are unsuitable for their national culture. Moreover, the growing developments of many giant corporations which control large sectors of the media market have a tendency to orient the public through their media power. In other words, some Western cultural imperialisms have utilized their social media and newspapers to spread their ideas and reshape perceptions, beliefs and norms of ordinary citizens, which could spoil the patriotism and pride of people about their countries.",
        "In conclusion, because the international media has double-sided impacts on a national culture, I suppose that governments should impose a strict censorship on information sources and contents published through international media in order to protect and guarantee their cultural diversities."
