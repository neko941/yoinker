        "With the advance of the constructive technique, different kinds of buildings were established in many areas, even the rural area. Some people insist that it is not reasonable to make these houses like the apartments or flats anywhere, while others say that we can not ignore the serious matters of lacking in the residences. However, I think that we should conserve our environment in terms of environmental issues and preserve our national identity.",
        "First and foremost, we should protect our environmental lifestyle even for small size sites. if we constantly build too many homes or complex malls even in the corner of the countryside, we can't enjoy the eco-friendly lives, such as Central Park which was made for citizens' mental care. Additionally, if the more buildings are established densely, many people suffer the long term-consequences of deleterious stress and feel confined.",
        "Secondly, the similar buildings make our national identity featureless and faceless just like the legos. For example, if the simple and same interior or exterior designs were adjusted from the entrance of the city to even the corner of the countryside, most visitors coming from other countries think that this country is monotonous and unfascinating. Moreover, they will rarelybe satisfied and do not come here again. our country will be excepted their preferences",
        "In my conclusion, in order to regenerate our national identity and flavour, it is advisable for us to build more traditional houses like Han-Owk rather than just vertical towers, especially in the corner of the countryside."
