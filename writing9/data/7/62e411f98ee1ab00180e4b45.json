        "There is a contentious argument about why folks have become keener to know about the evolution of the house or building in which they are residing. In this essay, I will examine the main causes of the same followed by possible sources people can opt for.",
        "To begin with, the public has started developing an interest to know more about their homes in order to avoid getting stuck in illegal property  blunders and for personal safety reasons. Moreover builders these days are misguiding their customers through activities such as  building  construction on  land which is not authorized for  construction. For instance, recently a builder from Delhi, India  built a residential building of 15 floors in a prohibited area and sold the flats to  clients for a very high price. However, after a short period of time government authorities took action against this illegal infrastructure and innocent owners were not only fooled but also wasted their money as they were not aware of the fact that the building was constructed in a restricted area.",
        "Due to such reasons people are becoming very cautious when it comes to buying any kind of property as it is showing a continuous upward trend in terms of  price. To tackle this situation, in this modern era, solutions to  every problem can be found on  Google, so people should definitely read reviews about the builder as well as the property which they are planning to buy. Apart from this, getting information from the people who are already staying in the same locality can be a very effective way to know more about the advantages and disadvantages.",
        "To conclude, although there are many property frauds taking place due to greedy builders , self-awareness will be the best way to avoid it."
