        "I am writing this letter to complain about my last visit to your restaurant named Indian Island in the east of Riyadh. It was a nightmare for me to eat in your restaurant along with my family.",
        "I was in your restaurant to celebrate the wedding anniversary. As we were planning for the arrangement of our anniversary along with family, and being your loyal customer, have chosen your restaurant as a venue.",
        "First and foremost, We had reserved our table in advance, but as we get in the restaurant it was jam packed. There was no service staff to greet us. When we found one staff, he said reservation is not showing in the system, so wait some time to get a vacant table. Unwillingly,  We kept waiting approximately an hour or more. However,  after getting the table, we have ordered 4 non-spicy 'chicken Curry' along with 2 diet and 2 normal drinks. When we received orders it was spicy 'Mutton Curry' along with normal drinks. It was totally devastating and annoying, ultimately, We did not eat anything, and left restaurant in disappointment.",
        "To compensate me for this tremendous inconvenience, I ask you that kindly refund my all invoiced money that is SAR 300/- and provide me with free gift vouchers along with a family meal completely free, of our choice. If not, I am taking my complaint to higher authorities.",
        "I look forward to hearing from you at the earliest.",
