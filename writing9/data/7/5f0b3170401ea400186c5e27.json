        "When the topic of spend money on transport arises, there are divided opinions. Some are of the viewpoint that it is required to spend a large amount of economy on the train transportation by developing a new railway line between the two districts for fast trains. Whereas, a few others differ this and state that budget should be spent on other public transport mode. Therefore, ahead of my opinion, both the sides are discussed in the ensuing paragraphs.",
        "Examining the former believe, the supporters\u2019 state that large amount of money spend on the rail infrastructure. First of all, train is easy mode of transport compare to any other modes. To explain this, the costs of the train tickets are very low. So, it is cheaper for any other transport mode and people easily affording this transport mode. Moreover, railway doesn't require the fuel. They run on the electric city. By this doing, the ratio of the air pollution is decreased and it solves the environment issue to some extent. Besides this, there is no traffic problem occur in the railway. Therefore, people are reaching their destination on time. Thus, railways are crucial to the local community.",
        "However, the proponents of the latter view have their own claims that money should be spent on improving other transport mode, such as road transportation, airlines and many more. To begin with, in some geographical area, the construction of the railways is not possible. So, in that area, it is requires focusing on the road infrastructure. Moreover, airlines are the popular mode for the international travelling. For instance, when people travel to another country, they only prefer travel by flights because no other transportation mode is available for international travelling. Furthermore, people must use both railways and roadways. Individuals use much road transportation for short distance journey. So, it is necessary to be focused on the road infrastructure.",
        "To sum up and offer my position, I would support both of the viewpoints. I believe that it requires to spend budget on all transportation mode because all infrastructure are popular among the public, they use the transport mode by their requirement and the destinations."
