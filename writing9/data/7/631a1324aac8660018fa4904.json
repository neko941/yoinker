        "While the surrounding world developing faster, many production companies are investing millions in new movies. However, I am of the belief that producers have to support their countries' economies.",
        "In the beginning, after the Russian war,  inflation  increased and many people are suffering from the financial situation ,especially in  developing countries. In other words, if the investors will choose to support their societies, the financial situation would be improved. A prime example is Egypt, recently the government started to encourage actors and actresses to donate. In addition, it was a successful role as ,by the end of the last year, the donation boxes have collected a lot of money. Hence, it can be said that authorities have to control all the organizations and regulate  money spent.",
        "Moreover, Not only do money spending can make the new movie successful but also the moral and good story are important. To illustrate when parents watch a new announcement about the family kind of movie, they allow their children to watch it. For instance, Mohamed Henidi's film is the most successful as  it always suitable for families. ,,Meanwhile citizens prefer happy stories which help them to get out of  work stress. Therefore, what can be said is that joy and morals  can be a story that are very important.",
        "In conclusion, After this essay has shown the effect of movies and spending on  production, I am convinced that it is a very important industry but the authorities have to keep it under control. Movies are very important as many youngsters take actors as a model role."
