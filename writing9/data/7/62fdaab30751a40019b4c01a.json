        "These days, an increasing number of people are concerned about the amount of time that individuals spend looking at a smartphone in their leisure. From my perspective, this phenomenon has some effects on social life for some reasons which are discussed in the following paragraphs.",
        "It is undeniable that mobile devices play a vital role in daily life. Firstly, much of our life is managed through a smartphone which is by one touch whenever needed. For example, most information related to electricity bills, bank statements, or work is noticed through our phones. Therefore, it is unacceptable to cut off cell phones from our community. Secondly, it is impossible to conduct our social life without mobile phones. Modern life involves traveling for distances frequently so the demand to maintain relationships online has increased steadily, for instance.",
        "There are some worrying aspects to this growth in the use of mobile phones. It is widely believed that phone use can thrive in addiction and result in unhealthy independence. Specifically, people tend to be anxious if they miss out on some social contacts. Research shows that this can cause insomnia and other kinds of mental health problems. Having said that, smartphones have proved to be an ideal source of information and entertainment during our free time. It is, for example, to have a mobile phone when one travels to a new area to look up routes and find intriguing destinations to visit. They also benefit greatly when people range activities with their friends.",
        "In conclusion, I would say that it would be wiser if mobile phones are used in an appropriate way. Instead of spoiling our health, mobile phones enhance our lives when users are not addicted to them."
