        "Modern society is notably common for people to work a great number of hours every day, earning a significant amount of money. But consequently, not leaving much room for leisure. Whilst some people choose to work less, most of the time for less money, and, as a result, to have more spare time for themselves. This essay agrees that having more free time can be beneficial, even though it could mean having less money. This essay will discuss both points of view.",
        "It is generally agreed that having more money means having more opportunities in different areas of our lives. Some people work long hours aiming to receive a good salary. However, a considerable amount of times, due to the lack of free time, it also means to abdicate the time that could have been spent with family and friends, going to the gym or taking up a new hobby. For instance, it is proven that human beings with no social life have more chances to become depressed.",
        "On the other hand,  some people rather work less hours and being able to enjoy their free time doing different activities. That could mean not travelling as much or not buying the new model of a car, but it also can be having a healthier life with healthier and more meaningful habits. For example, it is known that having a balance between work and personal life can, a lot of times, guarantee a better state of health.",
        "In conclusion, a group of people, for different reasons, will work more for better wages and some other group will make sure to have more free time to spend outside work. I agree that having money is important for all of us, but we also need a good balance."
