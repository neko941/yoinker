        "It is argued by some parents that day care centres give the best services for primary school children, whereas other working parents believed that other family members will be taken care of their child such as grandparents.In my opinion, I believe that grandparents play vital role in caring children.",
        "On one hand, it is thought by some people that childcare centres give more care to the pre-school age child. This is only possible when parents who are working or having enough money to provide the day care centres.In other words, if parents at home or do not work mainly mothers who are important to raise child in order to make them better individuals.This all leads to children bright future by parents who are giving their 100 % in making child as a good person.For example, in western country, most of  the parents are depending on childcare centres as they are living in a nuclear family.",
        "On the other hand, grandparents have an important role in raising child where their parents do not have time for children because of working all day.To add this, it is happening as child belongs to a joint family, which can have great impacts  on the child's future as well as education. As a result, children can develop various milestones as per their age and constantly under observation in grandparents, they also teach traditional values and behaving in such a manner which includes how to respect elderly.",
        "Finally, In my opinion, grandparents have an influence on children's career as well as future.In India many families belong to a joint family, which have so many other people apart from a grandparent who are taking care of family children.",
        "In conclusion, parents having a busy work day with these types of family, grandparents one who care the children in those old days and implementation some manners and behaviour pattern which is not having in single types of family and those parents depended to private care centres."
