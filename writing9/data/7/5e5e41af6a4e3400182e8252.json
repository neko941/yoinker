        "Firstly, the main disadvantage is when a large business takes over a small business the whole family, which is dependent on the small business will get affected in every way. The majority of the small scales are run by people who are financially weak. So this taking over will make their stand more miserable. The times has quoted that in a year there are precisely 2000 to 3000 families who are getting affected because of the taking over of small scale industries. It also affects the job opportunities which are created by small scale industries for the unprivileged people who are in remote villages. A weaving commerce in a remote village near Gujarat, India was providing job opportunities for a plethora of people. The majority of them were illiterate and old people, but unfortunately, a major big weaver industry took over that company and all of the people were affected and their job was seized.",

For example, there are MNC\u2019s in India who give their workers hike when their company takes over a small industry.",
