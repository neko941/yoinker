        "Few assert that children should be motivated by their parents to take part in organised groups in their leisure time. Others, however, believe that leaving youngsters on their own to learn is essential. In my opinion, pupils should be left independent to learn different things. Let us delve deeper into both the schools of thought followed by my own perspective on the same in the subsequent paragraphs.",
        "To begin with, there are plausible reasons why children should be encouraged by their parents to participate in organised activities during their relaxation time. First and foremost, vast experience of parents from their lives helps children to make them perform well. To elaborate, as parents are experienced persons and have seen different situations in their life, this makes them to give such instructions to their children in which they would not face any difficulties in the future and learn better things from them. To cite an example, a research conducted by the University of Maryland over a sample of 200 college teens in ten American universities in 2018 revealed that 73% of them agreed that their parents' guidance played an important role in their lives.",
        "On the contrary, it is important for children if they are left on their own as they learn different things. Primarily, when a youngster is left alone without any support from his parents, he can explore his talent by focusing properly on that. To substantiate, since every child in the world has some innate quality, it can only be centralized without any hindrance or pressure from parents or guardians. In order to be successful, a child can explore his skill which would benefit the society. To exemplify, Dr. Sigmund Freud, an eminent psychoanalyst in his study of human behaviour and cognitive skills stated that a youngster could be a good learner and could recognize his inborn skills without parental pressure.",
        "In my opinion, youngsters should be given a chance to live in their own way as it will help in the formation of an independent being in the future. To clarify, I believe so because pupils learn the art of living without any support if they were not assisted by their parents. Since living independently is one of the major factors for a juvenile, he can acquire good skills in every field. To illustrate, an article published in the Tribune on leaving children on their own by its editor in chief, Dr. Harish Khare in May, 2016 stated that when left alone, children got moral support to lead their life which would be beneficial for them in their whole life.",
        "To encapsulate, it can be concluded that although there are good reasons why parents should motivate their children to take an active part in organised activities, I believe that pupils should be left on their own. Leaving children on their own will not only help them in acquiring skills, but also results in making them live independently in the future."
