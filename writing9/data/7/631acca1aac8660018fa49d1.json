        "In the contemporary epoch, the majority of people do not get even have important facilities such as healthy foods and education. Few people believe that it is the responsibility of the government to take duty for giving these types of facilities. Whereas, other percentiles of the crowd reckon that it is the duty of the individuals themselves. Both views have their own reasons which will be discussed in forthcoming paragraphs.",
        "To commence with, there are multifarious reasons why the community thinks that it is the duty of an authority to spread education and healthy foods among the public. First and foremost, the government should spend some money on schools as well as hospitals in order to give mankind a lucrative life. To elucidate, due to a shortage of money, institutes and hospitals cannot able to give free education and healthy foods to the community due to which underprivileged society has to face many difficulties in their lifetime. Therefore, law-maker should spend some rupees on colleges and health centres in order to distribute knowledge and body care facilities among poor people.",
        "On the contrary, there are certain groups of mankind who vehemently contend that the public should take responsibility for themselves for education and health. Primarily, an awareness campaign should be done by the population to spread the importance of studying and a fit lifestyle. To elucidate, since the past century, due to the lack of importance of study and fit lifestyle among the public, mankind has to encounter many obstacles in their lifespan. Thus, people should start an awareness campaign to incline the popularity of knowledge and fitness among the population for their holistic development. For instance, in India, 55% of people were illiterate and unhealthy before the spread of the importance of knowledge and fitness; however, after these people became aware of their academic level and the state of their bodies.",
        "To sum up, by analysing both the views, I am of the opinion that it is the responsibility of the government to invest some remuneration in different health centres and colleges to increase the popularity of fit bodies and education."
