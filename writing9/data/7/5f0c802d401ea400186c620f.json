        "Job interview is one of the most used methods to hire an employee for a vacant job position. Although, it is a widely used hiring tool, some of the head hunters have discovered new methods in order to hire new employees.",
        "Indeed, most employers prefer interview as it provides a platform for a person to market himself or herself in a decent manner. Because of the interviews, the real worth of an individual can be known with a proper panel led discussion subsequently, the interviewers can detect if someone is lying on the resume by asking cross questions. In addition, certain jobs require physical handling of the goods due to which, it is always better to meet the applicant in person.",
        "Although, interviews are used in most of the organizations, but recent developments have been made in order to make the human resource operations well organized, which has provided substitute for the interviewing procedure. One such method is a software, which processes the resumes that were uploaded by the candidates on the portal of the organization. The software can screen hundreds of resumes in a minute due to which the hassle for interviewing tens of candidates can be eradicated. This technique can also provide the resumes of the people who live in the other parts of the country and cannot appear for the interview.",
        "In conclusion, I would say that irrespective of how many softwares are developed in the human sourcing system, interview will always remain the best possible method because it can help both the employers and the prospective employee to display their skills face to face."
