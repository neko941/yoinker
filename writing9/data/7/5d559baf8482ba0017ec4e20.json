        "The use of packaging, such as plastic bags, is a common practice in supermarkets and shops to protect products from damage. However, as more and more people start to realize the effects that it has on the environment, discussion now centers on whether manufacturers or consumers should take the responsibility of cutting down the use of such materials. My view is that addressing this issue requires efforts made by both sides.",
        "Before the wide use of packaging, people had no choice but to hand carry the goods they bought from stores, which was indeed a strenuous experience. Thanks to the invention of packaging, consumers nowadays are capable of carrying a heap of items, with no need to worry about some of them falling or getting crushed. Such convenience makes consumers embrace the idea of packaging, get used to it, and thus overlook the negative consequences resulting from using non-degradable packaging materials. In this sense, the responsibility partially lies in consumers themselves, who could otherwise choose to bring their own shopping bags and avoid buying products that use more packaging than necessary.",
        "Manufacturers and supermarkets also have a vital role to play in the sense that it is they that brought packaging to the public eye in the first place, as a user-friendly and low-cost material to transport and store products. If they are willing to replace packaging with more environmentally-friendly solutions such as home delivery and recycling service, the public may eventually get accustomed to the new strategy, though it is likely to trigger complaints at the initial stage of its practice.",
        "In conclusion, I would say the interplay between manufacturers and consumers in this matter means that to reduce the use of packaging cannot be achieved by one side alone. Consumers should be made aware of the differences they are capable of making, while manufacturers have the duty to promote more eco-friendly alternative options to packaging."
