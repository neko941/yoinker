        "These  days,  every  time when you  turn  on  the  television  or  flick  through  the  pages  of  a newspaper,  you  often learn  about  the  victims  of  crime.  But  what  is  the  most  effective  method of dealing  with  the  rising  crime  rate  in  our  society?  Some  people  believe  that the  best  way  to punish  criminals  is  to  sentence  them  to  time  in  prison.  I  completely  disagree  with  this idea  and  in this  essay  I  will  support  my  opinion  with  examples.",
        "",
        "Firstly,  life  in  jail  is  far  too  comfortable  for  prisoners.  For  example,  many  inmates  have access  to  luxuries  such  as televisions,  computers  and  sports  facilities  and  so  on.  In  other words,  spending  time  behind  bars  is  more  like  being  in  a  holiday  camp.  If  prison  is going  to  act  as  a  deterrent,  then  I  believe  it  needs  to  be  considerably  tougher.",
        "",
        "Another  reason  why  I  disagree  with  prison  as  a  punishment  is  that  a  large  number  of prisoners  are  not  actually  a  danger  to  society.  Take  shoplifters  as  an  example.  They  are often  locked  up  in  the  same  cells  as  murderers,  rapists  and  violent  criminals.  I  strongly believe  that  this  is  a  serious  waste  of  taxpayer's money.  What  is  more,  petty  criminals may  even  learn  how  to  commit  more  serious  crimes  when they  are  inside.",
        "",
        "On  the  other  hand,  there  is  an  argument  that  prison  can  help  to  rehabilitate  offenders. Many  inmates  have  the  opportunity  to  study  while  they have time.  As  a  result, many  never  re-offend  when they  are  released.",
        "",
        "In  conclusion,  although  it  is  a  common  belief  that  prison  is  the  best  way  to  punish criminals,  I  believe  it  is  too  soft  and  that  it  is  not  necessary  in  the  majority  of  cases. Personally,  I  think  prison  should  be  the  last option  when all  else  has  failed"
