        "I am writing this letter in response to an advertisement, published last week in one of the leading Australian family magazines, where you asked for a short-term live-in caregiver for your six-year-old child. I have proper experiences to take the best care of your child, and I would like to take the job.",
        "I am confident that I would be able to render a great service in taking care of your child since I have had a good experience in raising a couple of younger siblings as the eldest child of my family. Besides, I love children since I consider them as a bundle of joy, and that is why I took care of some young children as a babysitter in my hometown. In fact, I find children so special that I have taken a short online course on parenting so that I could relate to them in a better way.",
        "By the way, I recently came to visit Australia from my home country at the invitation of my uncle in order to live with him for the next six months or so. And, while I am in Australia, I would also love to explore this beautiful country and learn about the lifestyles and culture of its people in addition to taking care of your child should you choose to offer me the job.",
