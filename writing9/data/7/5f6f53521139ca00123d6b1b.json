        "People should eat more fruits and vegetables and as little meat as possible because eating a high amount of meat can cause severe diseases and health issues. In my opinion, consumption of more plant-based food leads to a healthy life with less vulnerability towards any diseases. So, I agree with the mentioned notion.",
        "To begin, vegetarianism, that has been a well-practised concept in many Asian countries, due to myriads of benefits it is being adapted in western counties as well. Generally speaking, if everyone will become vegetarian, it will clear out numerous problems of countries related to food import and export such that every nation can become self-sufficient in terms of food industry. Moreover, plant consumers not only live a healthy life but also live longer. For instance, a study conducted by London university clearly states that people who have practised vegetarianism; lives 4-10 years more than carnivore people.",
        "In addition, although meat is a major source of protein and calcium, there are various alternatives of it including beans, mushroom and nuts. Furthermore, fruits and other green veggies are the best source of fibre, vitamin A, C, and D, which reduces the risk of heart diseases. There have been proofs that regular consumption of red meat not only has detrimental effects like obesity, cholesterol problems and many more but also more vulnerability to get infected by outbreaks. A typical example, outbreak related to bacteria Salmonella, that is deadly and spread through chickens to humans.",
        "In conclusion, a healthy diet determines our well being and life expectancy. Such that it is wise to decide what we eat and what are the consequences as it affects our way of thinking too, so far vegetarian diet has way more benefits than meat eating diet."
