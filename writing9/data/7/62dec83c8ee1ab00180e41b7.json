        "There has been a controversy about whether PE classes are an important part of a child's education. Others believe that academic classes are more essential. I think they both are vital, and my reasons will be explained in the following paragraphs.",
        "First and foremost. Our brains can take a break by doing sports. It's commonplace that students have multiple academic classes to attend so as to learn new knowledge; however, they can also bring exhaustion to students. At this point, it's vital to have PE classes. Sports play a role in mitigating intensive brain activities and physical activities. As a result, PE classes can help to erase students' tiredness and promote their studying efficiency.",
        "Second, it's advantageous to students' bodies. Students can improve their physical fitnesses by attending PE classes perenially. As we know, one of the main factors that will prevent us from studying effectively is our finite energy. After we run out of our energy, it will be challenging to focus on the academic classes. Therefore, PE classes can not only strengthen our bodies; they can also make students more energetic.",
        "On the other hand, having PE classes has some demerits as well. For instance, they can adversely affect students' learning progress when they don't have enough physical strength to deal with physical activities and brain activities simultaneously. Take me as an example. I was prohibited to do any sports one month before my middle school final exam. My teachers wanted us to spend all our energy on our studies. In this case, thanks to their decision, I passed the exam on account of rich previewing time and strength.",
        "In conclusion, PE classes have merits and demerits; nevertheless, I believe their merits outstrip their demerits."
