        "All over the world, many unknown diseases are left unsolved, by not discovering the appropriate medicines.  Even for known ones like Covid-19, aids, sars, we are struggling to find out solutions.  In such a situation, some people argue that experiments on animals are ethically wrong, as they are suffering, therefore it should be banned, while others support because of their benefits to humanity.  This essay goes through a fine view on both sides.",
        "Initially, when there is an emergence of finding out a vaccine, Medical Council Bars and WHO listed some rules in which it is said that the new drugs should be tested on animals like monkey and rat as a first step and then on volunteering humans.  Covid-19 for instance, which is now outrageous, crossed the first stage and it is in third stage now.  No vaccinations/newly invented medicines should be tested on humans first, said by the World Health Organisation(WHO).  Despite the hindrances, if remedies are found, it could be highly useful to society for such outbreaks.  For example, Oral Polio Vaccinations are a boon to the world, even though it faced a lot of problems at an earlier stage, now the young generations are polio-free.",
        "On the other hand, animal lovers and environment safety trusts argue that animal testings are morally wrong stating that are also living beings, they also have families.  Already because of animal trafficking, the count on particular animals decreased, but still,they are hunted for testing.  If this continues, the species would be no more one day on the earth.  According to a report from PETA, an animal safety organisation, the count on monkeys and domestic rats had drastically reduced, as a result of the above-said issues.  It is not good for the environment also as the animals also have some responsibility towards the society.  Hence it should be banned.",
        "To conclude, in my opinion, although testing on animals is beneficial, it is harmful to them and therefore there should be regulating authorities to monitor and supervise what is going on.  Whereas, there is no other option available except this method as they are practised for such a long-time.   But there are some saying that experiments can be done on offenders like rapers and murderers who brutally kill children and women."
