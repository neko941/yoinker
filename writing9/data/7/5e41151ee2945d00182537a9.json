Winning is usually the goal but the process of achieving it requires a sense of apprehension to know every members\u2019 strengths and weaknesses and use that in order to come up with an effective playing strategy. Secondly, it trains them to be disciplined individual to maintain their mental and physical well being. For example, there are various restrictions they need to follow such as the sets of foods they are allowed to eat, or the required number of hours of sleep to help them attain their maximum potential. Lastly, at the end of the game, there are also times that they need to face the reality of losing in spite of all the best effort to win.
