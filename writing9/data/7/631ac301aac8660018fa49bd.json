        "Dear Sean,",
        "Thank you so much for helping me out to take care of my dog while I`ll be in Greece for my vacation next month. It was very kind of you to accept my request.",
        "I`m planning to leave Sri Lanka on 4th October and I`ll be back on 15th October. My cousin who lives in Greece already got me a sim card for me and while I`m there you will be able to contact me via this number. It`s +8134394424. In case you could not reach me, you can contact my cousin`s number at +81456822532.",
        "As you already know, Mingo is a friendly dog and it hardly bites anyone. I have kept 5 kg of dog food so you can give them during the mornings. In the evening, a maid will come and prepare food for Mingo. Although she is preparing food, she is really scared of the dog so I guess you are the one who need to do that.",
        "Another person will come to clean Mingo`s cage and  give him a wash and he will be there every Sunday. Since we don`t allow him or the maid to access my house alone, I guess you have to open the door for them. And it would be a great help if you can stay at my house while they are working.",
        "Hope I was not asking too much  favours. Since you love Mingo and spend time with him, I`m sure you will have a great time.",
