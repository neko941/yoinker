        "Its is undeniable, that whether young generation should take advice from elders or not. Some believe that advice from elder's is mandatory. However, others think that it has an adverse effect on children. In this essay, examine both the views in detail and put forward evidences why I support the perspective of asking parental help.",
        "Parental advice has played a crucial role in the physical and mental development of the growing child. Firstly, the children's behaviour and respect to the others is important to learn, that's taught by only parents. This knowledge never get from school education. In addition, they need advice for higher education and job career from guardians. For example, education make them capable to in front of other competitors and get top position. But, to reach that position advice from elder's and guidance is much valuable and essential to walk on that right path. Another reason is that, advice from parent's rescue from going on wrong track. For example, giving knowledge about the time important, most of them waste time on watching and on social media.",
        "On the other hand, few suggest that the younger should take their decisions by own. Initially, constant  advice for everything make them more dependent. Or else, they lose their thinking power and ability to take important decision by themselves. For instance, a survey from the USA hospital that depending on others, reduce the capability of the brain. Moreover, taking decision by own make them more stable and think twice if their decision goes wrong and work more on that, which not increase sharpen the mind but also increase knowledge.",
        "",
        "In conclusion, many of them disagree on that of giving advice to their child, but others think advice is change the vitality among others if they are own detrimental side. However, in my opinion, children should rely on parent's advice, but they also should try to take some decision of their own."
