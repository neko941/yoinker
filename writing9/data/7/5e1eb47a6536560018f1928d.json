        "It is universally accepted that children are very delicate and needs some extra care, especially during  their early childhood. In today's society, usually both of the parents are working, therefore making time for children is not an easy task for them along with all their professional commitments as well. Therefore, I strongly agree that parents should take childcare training courses these days.",
        "First and foremost, parents today are quite occupied, unlike fifty odd years ago thus upbringing of children is getting tougher with very generation. Moreover, the time parents take to learn how to effectively take care of their children can be saved if they take childcare training courses before or soon after the baby is born. For instance, it is quite a task for first time parents to feed their children enough to maintain their healthy weight as kids usually start to skip meals while they are playing.",
        "Similarly, experienced parents also can learn new tips on managing a child through its early ages as well as training courses can also teach them how to manage time while bonding with their children. For example, scientific research shows that parents who receive adequate training of handling children, took better care of their kids while balancing their professional lives. Some of these courses also give training to parents in potty training their young ones which is very helpful and needed by every parent.",
        "To sum up, I highly agree with parents getting child caring training as this training helps as well as prepare them to better take care of their kids. Also, these trainings help create a strong and a better relationship between the parents and kids from an early age."
