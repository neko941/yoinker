        "Nowadays, an ever increasing number of women work full time, In this reality, It is widely believed that house chores should be between both partners equally. I completely agree with this notion.",
        "One of the major reasons to share work between male and female, both partners equally, is to form gender equality in society and at home. The stereotype of system is that, man should work for family and women should work for all house works and take care of family intensively. This includes cleaning, cooking and many more. However, in this approach, women might be abreast of the latest trends and current market status. Not only that, if the same women joins work, that will be arduous for them to adjust with company atmospheres. Due to this, many women avoid taking long maternity leaves, and once they do, it makes sense for both male and female to take care of family, more like sharing family and home responsibilities.",
        "Apart from this, there are several drawbacks in the current approach. Few countries do not have the same house chores, sharing system from the beginning, such that they have seldom worked on house cleaning, cooking and other important tasks. This makes them inexperienced and they might not be able to perform the tasks in perfect manner. This can lead to quarrels between partners, hindering their family bond. However, the chances of such conflicts are not high, as these can be solved by few guidance and instructions from wife to follow such as how to mope and how to do laundry and much more.",
        "To sum up, although there are chances of conflict in family about sharing house chores equally, but the benefits outweigh the negative aspects."
