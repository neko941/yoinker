        "I'm really glad about your invitation and I already booked my flight yesterday. I'll be landing there on 15 April at 14 pm. although I've started picking up my baggage so I was concerned if you could give me some pieces of advice about what to bring like souvenirs or clothes.",
        "first of all, I would like to buy some gifts for your parents.I remember you said your father is a real fan of real Madrid so I would buy him the  uniform if you tell me his size. in addition,your mother has told me to bring her a new collection of Chanel perfume so please ask her she prefers sweet adores or cold ones.",
        "Secondly, I wonder if to bring casual clothes or formal ones so please recommend me,if we have some plans for sports activities or attending exhibitions or music concerts during my stay.",
        "Finally,it would be a little embarrassing to say. I've heard people in Denmark are keen to consume red meats but I'm allergic to all kinds of red meals so please tell your mom to be concerned about it.",
        "hope to meet you soon",
