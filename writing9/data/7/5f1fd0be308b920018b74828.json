        "Generally, books are read for two reasons either for educational or leisure purposes. Although it is thought that students  spending time on entertainment books is a waste by some parents,  however,  personally, I believe sometimes  it could be helpful and full of information.",
        "Fun books such as novels are very informative and good source of informations, for instance if you read one of dan brown books you will get alot of new informations about places and cultural landmarks so it is not completely bad, but only if it does not  divert children attention from school or homework then entertainment books would be an additional source of knowledge that will enrich their perception and widen their horizons.",
        "Another point to consider, when your child is reading books for fun that would be a better alternative than playing computer games or any video games which is a giant waste of time and it can also hurt their eyes, for example, it is well known that a child who read books for fun is smarter than the ones who lose their  times in video games. However parents should monitor their youth not to get addicted to entertainment books instead of educational books, In addition, it is important that parents become sure that these books are not stopping children from being socially integrated and spend time with their families.",
        "In conclusion, reading  books for leisure has a lot of advantages, but only if does not disrupt a child's education or distract them from their social life."
