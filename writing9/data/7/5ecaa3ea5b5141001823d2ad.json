        "It is known that a human's heart is getting a lot more stressful now. This essay explains the main cause of such difficulties in people's growth is, automation and never ending hunger to earn wealth.",
        "",
        "Although automation is one of the main components of people's life. Due to the frequent use of machinery such as mobile, laptop, and others, people are getting tired and weak. Due to this, they have stoped working out and their physical exercises have decreased to almost zero. Each and every one knows this, however no one is ready to leave these technologies. For example, now-a-days children watch their phone while eating and while doing other things. We need to work collectively to solve this problem, though it's tough. We can create time table and work accordingly, which separates the working hours and exercise hours clearly.",
        "",
        "Everyone  is running for the money. Peoples' activity gets difficult because they never get happy with what they earn. Although their earning is enough for them, they want to earn more. This leads to and brings more stress in activity. For example, If I buy a phone which has all the abilities up-to-date, but next year, another phone gets launched with better facility and if, again, I want to buy it. Then I am never going to be happy. The only solution to this is to get satisfied too with what we have and only earn the amount of money we need.",

        "In conclusion, the main cause of stress and difficulty in people's activity is new and latest automation and the hunger to earn more money. We can get rid of this problem by being satisfied with what we have and get only what we truly need."
