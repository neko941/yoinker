        "Who can yield more benefits to society: an educated person or someone without training? Since education is one of a fundamental right, some people assume that it should be for free regardless of personal luxuriousness. I completely concede that studying options should be guaranteed by the government to everyone as a part of social programs.",
        "",
        "Society is a place where individuals are the keys to success. Providing basic needs for free such as study, workplaces, health, and social protection is the primary function of the community performed by the regulatory body through various programs. Having learned citizens who bring profits is in the interest of any institution. As a long-term investor of education, the government receives valuable outcomes, which allows obtaining a stable and prosperous population. Moreover, a graduated person will reimburse to the authorities many times through his activities, in other words, will be more cable to represent the union, improve the economy, provide support to the law, pay taxes, and others.",
        "",
        "Another point to consider is that education level mainly indicates the development and prosperity of society. The provision of free studying programs to all people should open doors to new achievements and discoveries. This is not only about schooling, which allows learning nuts and bolts, but also regarding colleges and universities, where students mostly receive their further professions. No developed community can be without the medical system, for instance, which means that doctors are essential jobs, and consequently, their education should be covered by the government.",
        "",
        "In conclusion, gaining different stages of studies creates opportunities to improve skills, and to implement knowledge though everyday life, which beneficial to society. I believe, that to deal with the equal availability of education to everyone by realizing a high level of commitment from both parties, government, and individuals, is the most effective way."
