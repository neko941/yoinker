        "Success is a much-discussed topic. While some people believe that hard work, commitment, and persistence are the key to success in life, others think that family background and physical attributes are more important. I believe that both views are partly valid. We need a combination of personal commitment and finance to become successful.",
        "Without working hard, nobody has ever achieved any goal. To accomplish a task a person needs to consistently put efforts and become a master in that subject. Regularly working at a task makes it second nature to us. For instance, Sachin Tendulkar, the master batsman from India and Donald Bradman, the Australian cricketer, worked hard on playing cricket since childhood and were dedicated to the sport to the exclusion of everything else.",
        "Financial power and physical traits play an equally important role. Humans, unconsciously, are slaves of their biases. We follow our preconceived notions without realizing it. For example, in most job interviews, African Americans are not as easily selected as people with lighter skin tones. This is often attributed to the human preference for people of white skin. Moreover, those with more wealth have superior contacts and greater resources at their disposal to learn new skills. This makes them better candidates for high-paid jobs.",
        "In conclusion, both hard work and money play an important role in an individual\u2019s success. I believe that governments and institutions should make efforts to reduce the role of money and provide equal opportunities to everyone irrespective of his financial status and physical appearance."
