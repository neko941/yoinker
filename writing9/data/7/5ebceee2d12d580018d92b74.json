        "It is certainly true that one solution to address environmental issues would be for the governments to raise the prices of petrol . Although i consider that this might be an effective measure, i believe that other measures have even more profound impacts.",
        "",
        "On the one hand, there are a variety of reasons why increasing the fuel prices is beneficial in addressing some of the environmental problems . Firstly, in terms of private cars, when the national authorities raise the taxes on petrol, motorists will have to limit the time and length of their journey. Therefore, governments will have more money to reinforce and update the public transport provision, as people still need to go the office, school or other medical health services like hospital, for example. Secondly, from the perspective of the freight services, more goods are transported by rail instead of truck. Thus, Both these measures will cut down on emissions and reduce the greenhouse effects.",
        "",
        "On the other hand, while this rise in fuel prices might be a stopgap measure, governments can adopt other policies which may be more effective in the long term. For instance, the local authorities in London have introduced a congestion charge on all vehicles visiting the city central. As a result, they have subsidized their money on some health awareness campaigns and spending on the transport infrastructure. In turn, there is a general decline in exhaust fumes from vehicles around the city centre and the air quality in the city has improved by this action.  Another policy could be to establish some free bus and train routes, as the increased use of public transport will alleviate pollution from private cars and help in the effort to combat global warming.",
        "",
        "In conclusion, a sharp rise in petrol prices can be a useful environmentally friendly transport measure, although in the long term other steps will be more valuable"
