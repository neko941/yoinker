        "Universities are often under the society\u2019s eye for a different set of reasons, one of them are ensuring students\u2019 abilities are being assessed in a right way and on a correct basis. This raises a question whether knowledge and ability should be examined only by formal tests or continuous assessments should also be considered. In this essay I will discuss these views and explain why I feel that continuous course work and regular projects are crucial whilst evaluating students\u2019 skills \u2013 not only because of consistent work undertaken throughout the year which would show students\u2019 knowledge but also developed abilities to be adopted for long term.",
        "To start off, if we did not study throughout the year on a particular subject by doing various of continuous work, such as group projects or assessments, we would have a poor understanding of what we are expected to know or be capable of and could face a miserable fail. To avoid this situation, students in universities are being asked to participate in classes on a periodic basis and as a result, being judged on their work which is a fair evaluation in my view.",
        "Moreover, to gain a skill or learn something new takes practice. Students are not in universities to get a worthless paper, they are there to get the knowledge to be used in the long term, and for their future career, many would hope so. Research shows that if information is being memorized rather than understood keeps in our head for approximately only two weeks. That is another important fact, why students cannot be evaluated just by one final written or practical exam, whereas it can simply mean student learnt the subject last minute and passed the exam while this is not the right way to do it. Similarly enough, a good student who might have had a perfect midterm result, stressed out too much before the test and consequently did not get a result which truly measured his or her abilities or expertise.",
        "To conclude, not only I believe that continuous assessments should be implemented in university levels, but also the knowledge and abilities of students should strictly be measured based on both, formal examinations at the end of the term and continuing work undertaken by students which would show a true value of their understanding and skills obtained due to long-term value."
