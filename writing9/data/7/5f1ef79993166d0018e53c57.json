        "It is expected that people's health will deteriorate in the future. In my opinion, I completely agree with this statement since people live unhealthy lives nowadays and are likely to continue doing so in the future.",
        "The lack of exercise is one of the culprits behind the worsening public health. Most people nowadays lead a sedentary lifestyle, which is detrimental to their health. This is because they spend most of their day either working in offices, or using their computers or smartphones, and if they have free time, they would rather spend it playing games, watching TV, or surfing the Internet than workout. As a result, they suffer from serious diseases such as obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and high blood pressure, which can shorten their lives. This can be exemplified by the growing number of obese children due to being addicted to technology and gaming instead of playing with their peers.",
        "Another problem is leading fast-paced lives full of stress, which has negative implications for people. Due to the increasing cost of living, a growing number of people are forced to work long hours or work multiple jobs to earn a living and afford their basic needs. As a consequence, their free time is decreasing, they spend less time with their loved ones, and they suffer from high-stress levels. For instance, people are always overwhelmed by their work and the tasks they must finish, leading to overthinking, lack of sleep, mood disorders, and unhappiness. This decreases their quality of life and leads to mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, and in severe cases, suicide.",
        "In conclusion, the public health is likely to worsen in the future due to living unhealthy lives, which negatively impacts their physical and mental health."
