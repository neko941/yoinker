        "As society is advancing by leaps and bounds, the attitude people adopt toward economic evolution has undergone a noticeable and far-reaching transformation. Under this circumstance, an absolute consensus is hardly reached as to whether governments should put economic development play the most vital role or improve other kinds of development equally for their own nation. In this essay, an objective analysis of this argument will be made, followed by my opinion.",
        "On the one hand, some harbour the belief that a developed economy is the scale to measure a nation's success. Many studies have shown that although it is invisible the majority of people's living conditions have improved significantly and demands in human hierarchical needs are satisfied in developed countries compared to the undeveloped. Therefore, it will be a grave mistake to overlook the fact that concentrating on improving the economy can provide a lot of jobs and income for the citizens which is the shortest way for a country to develop in the fast pace of life in the modern day. For example, in 1995 Vietnam started to open trading with neighbouring countries and those in different places around the world which gained a huge change over the past 2 decades. From then on, the life condition of Vietnamese  improved dramatically which led to the escape from long-lasted poverty. This example is the illustration of the fact that economic progress can be the most crucial target for to the development of a country.",
        "On the other hand, the counter-argument raised by objectors is that other factors are also imperative to consider in sustaining a nation. This belief could be attributed to the fact that people also need to be well-rounded, which is also important to cope with the perfect life in other countries where culture, art, medication, and education are all well developed. In other words, not only the economy needs to be focused to improve but also the people should be aware. For instance, Japan is a country which developed rapidly in all aspects from the movie industry, economy, construction, and education to fashion, culture are well spread all around the world, as a result, it ranked top 2 in the most developed country. From this example, one can observe that other kinds of progress also play an integral part in building up a nation.",
        "To summarize, in the light of the analysis mentioned above, I side with the stance of the latter for the larger extent  economic improvement is not enough to develop a country perfectly. The government should enhance other factors to have a happy society in the fast pace of life."
