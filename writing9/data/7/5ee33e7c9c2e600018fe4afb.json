        "It is a commonly held belief that it should be mandatory for visitors to stick to the particular rules and traditions of the country they are going to. Opponents claim that it does not have to be obligatory and therefore assume that nations should be more open when it comes to cultural differences. In this essay, I am going to take a look at both these opinions and share my point of view. I personally believe that it is an inappropriate action to disrespect local traditions because it is the leading cause of trouble. The way of thinking should undergo a revolution.",
        "First of all, being aware of distinguished customs would make an individual ready to face uncommon situations. If people decided to go out of their comfort zone, the least action they can do is to search for details in connection with the local rules they must follow. Would it be essential to obey the rules?As a matter of fact,  hundreds of travellers get arrested every year in Muslim countries as a result of their inappropriate behaviour.In my opinion, local authorities have the right to punish people. Specific customs and rules must be followed on each nation\u2019s territory. As an illustration, a British couple got arrested in Qatar as a result of them disrespecting Muslim traditions and showing emotions in public. It definitely expresses the concerns people might have and it refers to the importance of obeying rules.",
        "On the other hand, a popular tourist destination should be open-minded in order to attract more visitors and therefore boost their economy and travel industry. It would make sense for them.  If a modest Middle Easter country had less strict rules, it would make them popular with wealthy tourists. Several countries have lifted their restrictions regarding dress codes and behaviour so that they would experience an increase in the number of foreign visitors they receive. For instance, its significance can be observed if thinking about Dubai. It had been a strict city with serious rules and now it is one of the most sought destination for tourists.",
        "All things considered, visitors are advised to be aware of the customs they should obey in order to avoid awkward situations. However, countries should also improve their abilities to accept cultural differences. This would likely lead to some changes."
