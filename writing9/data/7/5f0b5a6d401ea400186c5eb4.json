        "Many people today value owning their own home over renting. Whilst the majority of Egyptians prefer owning their house, in the developed countries they prefer to rent rather than own because of affordability factors, property taxes, and maintenance costs. I am of the belief that renting homes are better than owing and I think that it\u2019s a negative situation to insist on owing properties. Both aspects will be further explained below.",
        "At the beginning, owning a house gives a sense of personal achievement and considered as a source for addition income. Being the owner of house means there is no one over the shoulder to watch what someone is doing and no sudden notice for evacuation. Furthermore, the owners can use his property to insure a bank loan for business or any financial problem. Besides, the owners can rent the house and this can be a steady source of earning for them. For instance, many house owners use the Airbnb platform to offer their apartments for travellers, which consider as source of foreign income. Hence, many residents take their decision to own homes than rent it.",
        "On the contrary, people often rent a house because it saves a massive amount of money than purchasing a property which requires a great deal of money. There are several advantages of renting for families, renting a property helps them keep their expenses in check by avoiding mortgage interests, property taxes, and expensive maintenance. Moreover, renters can change the living place based on the location of their workplace and children\u2019s school. The renovation of the renting is the landlord\u2019s responsibility and the tenants do not need to worry about it.",
        "To conclude, after this essay has shown the merits of renting, it may be said that insisting on owing houses is a negative situation, and I support the renting situation."
