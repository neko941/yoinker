        "Many people thought that people who work in the entertainment industry paid excessive money. They can be paid 10 or 100 times higher than people who work in essential fields like scientists, doctors, and teachers. Although we have already known that people who work in those substantial fields are more demanding for human existence rather than people who appear on our television.",
        "First of all, I would like to say that this essay totally agrees with this statement. The reason why I choose this is that the impact of some entertainers brings to our society. One of the most important thing about this is because some entertainers do not have the integrity or skills like their ancestor. For instance, the new stars are likely to cause more problems rather than making achievements or, which I can say is they are known because of their stupidity not because of their intelligence. Therefore, it is not worth to pay a lot of money.",
        "Another reason is entertainers that are getting popular have the tendency to show off their wealth as well as their lifestyle, which I can say very toxic. These toxic environments are spreading all over the world through social media that can be easily accessed, and then, their fans will follow what their idols have done. Unfortunately, this bad influence will be a trend across the world. Furthermore, it may break down the morale of young people. For example, it is very common for idols to show to the public about how happy they are with their relationship status, yet, it drives the opinion of people that if they do not share their partner photos in social media, it means they are not happy. Even the reality is different.",
        "In a nutshell, I agree that entertainers are paid too much money, which leads them to use it whatever they like for nothing important just to show off."
