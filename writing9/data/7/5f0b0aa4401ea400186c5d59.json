        "It is irrefutable that the government needs to put restrictions on international firms to open their branches and industries to safeguard the native employment. In my opinion, I do agree with this notion because the extension of foreign trades in another countries are leaving a deleterious impact on their domestic market.",
        "To begin with, the judiciary has to enhance the task transition policy when any multinational organization set up their offices in another country. To be more precise, every year innumerable firms such as chemicals, automobiles, textiles, and call centers established their functional unit to promote their business in many nations,  and also advertise their brands on a large scale, therefore, the existing  local markets of a country suffers a  lot because people prefer to purchase big brands, hence, the domestic products face a great fall in their production, and later on, it diminishes from the market forever.",
        "Furthermore,  to prevent the national goods, the administration department needs to regulate certain guidelines so that both the national and international companies can perpetuate their task without any interruption. Simply stated, multinational firms should be allowed to capture the limited sector  instead of a whole industrial area, thus the home firms, for instance, cotton and silk weaving, carpet making, leather and metalwork industries can also thrive their products in the retail sector. Moreover, a separate budget should be allocated to them to stimulate their domain. This practice would assist both the type of companies to work for a longer period of time.",
        "In conclusion, I do not but agree that it is imperative to put stringent rules and regulations on foreign organizations to save the native occupation of a state as the expansion of theses offices is leaving an adverse effect on their origin companies."
