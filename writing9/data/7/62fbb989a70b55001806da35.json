        "Since ancient times, the main source of information in the education system were teachers. They provide the necessary knowledge and help their students to gain information. However, the quality of education directly depends on teachers and some people say that criticising and indicating out the weak sides can improve the learning process. Another view is that there is a lack of respect for teachers. I absolutely agree that honest feedback from the student's side will improve the quality of education. Why?",
        "Firstly, not every approach to teaching is suitable for a certain group of pupils, wrong method of conducting lessons may cause stress. Evaluating and giving advice on how can lecturer improve his lessons may get rid of the pressure on the students. To illustrate, let's take the popular problem of a lot of homework. If pupils were able to indicate this issue, if teachers were open-minded to new changes, the stress would decline. Secondly, the flexible conditions and solving education problems affect the effectiveness of the learning itself. Plenty of studies proved that the absence of cortisol, a comfortable atmosphere and non-pressure surroundings uplift the ability of the brain to analyze and memorize gained information. In addition, the communication skills of both sides will be enhanced, which means that the relationship will be more mutually supportive. for ,example  flexible conditions and solving education problems affect the effectiveness of the learning itself.",
        "On the other hand, criticism can, on the contrary, lead to problems related to the underestimation of a teacher\u2019s skills and experience. On many occasions, the lecturer might be true about his teaching approach, due to his experience and wisdom. Furthermore, the criticism might be a common cause of teenage laziness. The aim is to create a comfortable environment where learning will be minimal. With regards to respect, rating poorly a teacher's work hurt their feelings and reduces their desire. Hearing censure from pupils when the teacher's sincere goal is to bring knowledge may cause the opposite effect.",
        "In conclusion, both opinions have their own reasons to be followed. However, from my point of view, the advantages of  honest feedback are much more valuable and have more positive effects, such as low stress and effectiveness as opposed to hurting a teacher's feelings."
