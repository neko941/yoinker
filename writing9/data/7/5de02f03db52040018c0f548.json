        "Many people think that having a hard routine allows them to manage their lives easily. Others,   however, think that spontaneous changes to their daily basis make life more curious and exiting. In my view, I consider that having a tough routine may provide more interesting benefits.",
        "On the one hand, having a strict daily routine has some both pros and cons. For example, successful employers have to be careful on their daily life to keep their routine stable. Otherwise, it may cause some issues on their job. However, If a person has balanced routine, It may bring some wonderful benefits. For instance, keeping time equality between your family and job. Furthermore, spending enough time with your family and friends and also being a successful person for your job at the same time.",
        "On the other hand, It is often believed that it is better to have a spontaneous change in your life all the time. The nature of humanity also includes unexpected changes in every moment in life, but is it true to keep your life stable? For instance, the most of the businessman are not interested in changes in their job because fluctuation sometimes produces stress. Moreover, this kind of people are always patient to wait the true time for changing their life. Consequently , changes sometimes may worry people in their life. Although, people want to switch their life, It will be better to make precautions.",
        "Finally,  As I mentioned, It might be scary or hazardous to be always ready for unexpected changes. However, It depends on the situation. Sometimes people have to be ready for changes because the same routine also causes some various things such as success. At least this routine has to be changed after a while. Even if the person does not change it, life will change it naturally after a while.",
        "In conclusion, while people may vary in their opinions, I think that having a strict routine has got better advantages. As I mentioned, the routine also provides better conditions for success in life. Moreover, self-esteem and self-confidence is also another benefit. Therefore, better conditions and more progress are what you are looking for, It will be better to set up an effective routine."
