        "Nowadays, regarding the hectic speed of development in various aspects, the human being is striving to find new technologies and methods to replace them instead of the older and inappropriate ones. In this regard, it is argued that renewable energy such as wind and solar could be used instead of fossil fuels that are the significant source of energy providing in most nations. As far as I am concerned, this trend has positive respects that this essay will examine the reasons as to this notion.",
        "To begin with, using renewable energy are environmentally friendly. Those energies which come from natural power such as wind power and solar unlike fossil fuels do not emit toxic emissions like Co2 that causing air pollution and other environmental damages. For example, according to recent research,72% of air pollution is related to those factories and industries using gasoline to produce their commodities. So if this remarkable amount of contaminating could be decreased by replacing gasoline to green energies, as a result, we would have fresher and cleaner air.",
        "Green source of energies, monetarily, help to nations to spend fewer government budgets for producing fossil fuels and their detrimental consequences. if the pollution becomes more and more, therefore, gradually illnesses and erosion of most of the buildings appear in the countries that all of those need to some budgets to find solutions for eliminating. For instance, when people possess an unhealthy environment so it affects their physical and mental health. Following this trend, they will become sick and need health services that the government should be responsible for their treatment and in general, this process causes money wasting for the government.",
        "In conclusion, although in the initial impression it might seem better to use fossil fuels, owing to some reasons mentioned, replacing renewable energy is not only beneficial to the environment but also affordable for the government. Gelayol Makrooni"
