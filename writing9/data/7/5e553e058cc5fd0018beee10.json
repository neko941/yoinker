Many individuals think that parks as well as sports areas are necessary in new developed areas rather than shopping places for people to spend their free time.

People can meet different types of people and they can make friends in parks. Secondly, parks are the best place to rejuvenate the tired mind. Nation can get a chance to see the beauty of nature. For example, As it is generally seen that most of the people move from village to cities because of better facilities.
