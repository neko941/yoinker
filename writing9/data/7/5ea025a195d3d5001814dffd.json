        "To embark on that, there are mired causes of tourisms makes prejudiced with people, first and foremost, many people thinks that the disrespecting their culture and tradition to visit any religious place without follow the rules of this country traditions, for instance, as per my national Indian people are visit to any temples and other religious place with covering their head and do not wear footwear while, visitors who never know about our culture they neither follow this rules and they go to inside of any religious place with wear shoes and uncovered their heads. So, Indian thinks that visitors never respecting their culture. Secondly, most of the youngsters ate influence from visitor's dressing sense and people attracted to their culture as well as forgetting their own culture. Additionally, many visitors will be damaged the government's properties as like museum and historical buildings which are very expensive and this is against from the nation.",
