        "There has been divided view of the teaching schemes of the pupils during their schooling. Many intellectuals reckon that the teenagers should be taught few subjects in depth. However, others perceive that the schools should impart a wide range of subjects to in their curricula to enrich their students. The positive sides of both these views, along with my opinion is discussed further.",
        "To begin with, the former view is emphasizing the qualitative study of few essential subjects. This practice would reduce the burden of innumerable subjects, as well as inculcate the interest of the pupils in a vital subject. Consequently, the students could gain ample knowledge of their selected subject and their efficiency of learning would elevate. For instance, the researchers had revealed in their survey that, the most of the teenagers are suffering from depression due to excessive pressure of the studying variety of subjects. Hence, the practice of learning few subject in depth would encourage the juvenile of the age of fifteen for the qualitative study without stress.",
        "On the other hand, the latter view is portraying the radical view of imparting all subjects to the pupils. During the elementary study, the students should learn all the basic subject to establish their flourished career in later life. For example, mathematics, science and languages are the most crucial subjects for the learners. Although, the wide range of subjects might create a burden for the students, the tutors and parents should motivate their adolescents to adapt these subjects for their better academic careers. Moreover, the variety of subjects could improve the intellectual level of the pupils up to age fifteen.",
        "In conclusion, both the patterns of learning have their specific advantages.  In my opinion, the latter view is more lucrative for the elementary school student. By studying a variety of subject, one could select his area of interest. Also, the former view is good for the higher studies."
