        "Many people say that parents should motivate their kids to join  the group ventures, and some say that they should let them free to do any solo activity, they passionate about. I believe children would benefit tremendously when they are experienced working together in a team, rather than being independent. In this essay, I will discuss both the point of views.",
        "On the one hand, Group tasks give them a huge exposer of the Social life. They will understand the individual's behaviour and attitude, which will be better for their personal as well as for social well-being. For instance, In 2009, Delhi University has proved that the off-springs who spend more time in the social activities or group activities, become great life observer and always be able to maintain a fine balance in their personal as well as social life. Moreover, In team activities they learn collaboration with other members and Respect them, in result, they  become more enthusiastic towards other's point of view which is quality of a remarkable team leader.",
        "On the other hand, In this contemporary era, the Competition is extremely high in every area especially in education and children are usually forced by parents and teachers to perform better than their capability, Due to which they feel under stress. So it's highly essential for the parents to allow the youngster to spend their less occupy time  to do the solo activities they adore. This will help them to release stress and pressure of study.For example, They always enjoy the activities they eager to do and this joy and merriment with help them to forget their worries, in result more productivity in other tasks.In addition, Sometimes they Spend time on activities  which become their life time passion and career Such as computer programming, YouTuber etc.",
        "In conclusion, although children feel more relaxed and free in individual tasks , I believe juvenile should attend group activities and the team works in their spare time."
