        "In many,societies these days people are concerned about the tendency of individuals to imitate each other is displayed in vogues such as style and consumer goods. There are several reasons why I think humans want to correspond to the present period.",
        "The first and perhaps the most significant reason is the huge demand for the latest items. In the other words, people feel the need to possess items they have been at a friend. Manufacturers use celebrities to increase sales making them believe they are using this item. Phones are the necessary thing which provides a wide range of facilities, such as , for work , communication and entertainment. The best example of this, word famous is Dimash Kudaibergen, he recently advertised \"oppo\" that was not so popular at the time, but after Dimash showed up on the billboards with that smartphone, the sales increased threefold. So, it is clear that because of stars all sales can go up and whether it is bad quality or not.",
        "It is particularly significant that consumers are purchase items to imitate their friends. They could buy products and services which not be required at all. In fact, humans tend to follow their ideal to an extent , possibly, they toserve realize the grave consequence of their actions, but it does not last long, because it costs so much.",
        "The logical conclusion would be all people copy the best of us, but I still strongly believe that we should not copy all qualities of our ideal person, cause everyone got to have their difference."
