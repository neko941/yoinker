        "It is a popular belief that cars are the most convenient way to travel around in cities, while some think that bicycle is better. This essay will discuss both opinions before giving a conclusion.",
        "On the one hand, cars are a common necessity in society. It is used by the majority to move from short or long-distance places. For instance, cars can be used to go to school, work, establishments, parks, beaches, etc. It is also less time-consuming especially if you have family waiting at home. Furthermore, if you travel by car, it can carry multiple passengers to the same place and while travelling you can feel comfortable without worrying if it's sunny or rainy weather.  The disadvantage of cars is you need to invest money for repairs, gas and maintenance.",
        "On the other hand, travelling by bicycle is a simplistic way for someone who likes to be physically fit. Using bicycles to travel is favoured among people that like to exercise and those that lived in the provincial areas. Although you need to exert effort and strength to reach your destination using this vehicle. The rider is also exposed to heat and rain, but you can save money because it doesn't need gas for the bicycle to move. You also help the environment to be clean because it doesn't provide pollution. The disadvantage of a bicycle, it is not realistic to be used on long-distance journeys. It might malfunction on the road and sometimes riding a bike are more prone to accidents especially if a bicycle is used in big cities with several cars moving around.",
        "In my opinion, although riding a bike makes a person  fit and healthy, I believe that cars are suitable to use for travelling. It has many benefits that can provide comfort and is less time-consuming for the person than using a bicycle."
