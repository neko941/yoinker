        "Nowadays people are concerned about the government was wasting money on arts and they are thinking that this money should have invested in peoples' welfare. In my opinion, I completely agree with the above statement that the government is wasting money on paintings and music. However, at the same time, others think that government will allocate funds to the arts. This essay will discuss how the government is wasting money on the arts.",
        "Firstly, it is likely most of the citizens feel that the government spending too much of money on cultural activities, such as paintings, music but the government primary job is to provide common services, such as food, houses, transport, sport facilities, parks, community halls. For example, in some countries they are not economically better still they are spending huge amount of money on conducting an international event like the football world cup and hosting Olympic events etc. This type of unnecessary spending will impact the countries' economic growth. So that is the reason, people thinking that the government wasting public resources.",
        "On the other hand, some people advised that spending money on the arts, such as painting and music will give individuals to show their talent on a global platform. Which eventually increase country's popularity on world wide. In addition, the country got recognition all over the world. And people also not getting bored doing the same kind of work every day. If the government train people on the painting and conducting free music classes, the people will come to this class will learn the art of music. So that is the reason, some people disagree with that the government wasting money on cultural activities.",
        "In conclusion, it is likely most people agree that the government spending huge money on cultural events. In my opinion, I completely agree with the government wasting money on the arts. Still, some people believe that the government giving inspiration to the people to learn the arts."
