        "Money is a very important aspect when getting an appointment. Some persons believe that payment for a worker is the most important to every individual when getting employed. In my opinion, I totally disagree with the aforementioned statement because I consider job fulfillment and safe work environment more important than the amount to be paid.",
        "Firstly Job satisfaction should be considered as one of the most important because the employer will spend more of his or her time at work and not being happy simply means that the individual will end up being sad for a longer period of his time. For example, an engineer getting a bank task as a cashier just for the amount he will be paid, will most likely not be fulfilled with his job because he is not practising in his field, hence will not have a sense of fulfillment in the job. Further more if an individual feels this way he will be very unproductive.",
        "Secondly another aspect I think is more important than the wage of an employer is a safe working environment. This is one that should be given a high level of consideration when getting a job. People's health differs and so some individuals may or may not be fit to carry out some job descriptions. Some working environs are not safe for some people and could be detrimental to their health. For instance, it is highly unfavourable for an asthmatic patient to work in a cement factory. More so, work environment also includes colleagues in the  workplace, while having a healthy relationship at work increases work input and output, working with unreasonable colleagues may lead to depression for the employee thereby reducing productivity.",
        "In conclusion, despite Money is very important in choosing a job, job satisfaction and safe working environment are also very important aspects to be considered when getting a job."
