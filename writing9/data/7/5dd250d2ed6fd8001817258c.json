        "Dear James,",
        "Hope you are doing well. I am writing the letter to say sorry for damaging the camera, which I took from you for a family trip to Mysore. I have been feeling very guilty about spoiling it, and I know how important is that to you as it was a memorable gift from your father.",
        "Exactly what has happened is that when I went to Mysore Palace on Thursday evening to enjoy the beauty, I have opened the camera to click pictures and videos. Though I was holding it tightly, it accidentally slipped from my hands. I felt nervous and immediately picked it up to check where the damage has occurred. Later, I came to know that the lens of the camera got spoiled.",
        "It is bad news though, I went to nearby Canon service centre to get it repaired. They said it would take a couple of weeks as no serviceman was available because of the Diwali festival. I decided to get it corrected at our home town only after I reach my home.",
        "",
        "I hope you can forgive me and I will try to fix the problem very soon. If not, will replace with a new one. Hoping to see you soon."
