        "So this essay will be discussing a view point on the lifestyle of people who are known to people like public fugues. So it will discuss about whether their daily lives have more advantages to them or more troubles to them.",
        "So firstly I would like to talk about the advantages, certainly their lives have an edge over other people in terms of money, limelight and other perks like getting special treatment moreover getting the things they demand more easily than others. Undoubtedly they have bigger influence and it's easier for them to have things compared to a common man.",
        "Secondly troubles, yes, there are plenty of them like their personal lives are totally gone, because no matter what they do, it hardly remains private consequently they have to disguise themselves in order to avoid those media coverage's. For example, recently we have seen famous Indian Cricket team captain M.S. Dhoni, wears a helmet to avoid public coverage so that he can roam like normal individuals. In addition to this they need to be very careful with whatever they do because even a minor wrong action will have big implications for them since they are admired by the youth and other individuals.",
        "So to conclude, If I have to restate my above words and give my opinion, I believe it's a mixture of both as they says it is a two-edged-sword, so if they get more things by being a known person, they also looses their freedom to express themselves as independently as they would have done by being a more common people."
