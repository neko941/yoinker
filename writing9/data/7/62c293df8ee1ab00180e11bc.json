        "In today's practical world only a degree doesn't get us anything with a diploma you also need to have skills and knowledge that are required for a particular course if one has these only they get selected for a job this is needed so that the student can survive in the real world most of the people just say a degree is a piece of paper to judge anyone we need to test their skills.",
        "To start with having  good university exposure will help the student to gain more knowledge and also not to mention the kid will be willing to learn something and will not byheart since he will be understanding the concept for instance if the professor teaches the subject practically and the student grasps it then only the degree that he gets has a value if he doesn't gain anything out of the standard then its a waste of spending huge amount of money and it will also impact his job career.",
        "The second point is by any chance if the kid gets into a company without understanding but with only grades then he will face problems in completing the task given the office since he has a lack of idea about it. for example if a person completed his graduation in sales but he doesn't have knowledge about how to sell a product or service yet still  got a job once he goes to work  he will be facing the issue of selling the product since he does not know how to do it and in bad ,situations it might end up in a pink slip.",
        "To conclude a graduate from the university needs a minimum understanding of what he is studying and have basic concepts clear so that he can survive in the real furthermore experiencing university will help him to make new friends who might help him/her in future."
