        "Community is the surrounding group of people where we live. Believe by some that, there should be a compulsory  high school programme for unpaid people service, likewise, charity, developing the surrounding and as well as encourages younger to sports. I think this is the best possible way to improve social awareness as well as improving the social belonging.",
        "To begin with, unpaid neighbourhood service is the way to encourage the younger volunteer to do something in return for nothing, monetary. A helping hand is necessary for all and by making the compulsory subject in the high school, it helps to bring different kinds of consciousness in the community as a whole. For example, A uncle from my society always comes with a new idea every weekend,how to improve the community and try to make changes that needed to be changed. By seeing that not only younger people but as well as every age person volunteer themselves in creating awareness.",
        "Having said that, unpaid volunteers also plays an important part in developing the sense of belonging to the people. For instance, Dan Gurung a neighbour of mine, a soccer player who was offered to teach in the district and offered high pay, instead he starts teaching people of the low background those who have an interest in football. This shows that the children who can not afford for their training can learn from him.",
        "In conclusion, An unpaid public service not only helps to develop the awareness program in the community, but also help to develop belonging to the people."
