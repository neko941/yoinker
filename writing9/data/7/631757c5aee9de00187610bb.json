        "Throughout history , crime has been an intrinsic part of  human societies. the crime rate is incredibly increasing day by day . It has been universally acknowledged that the problem related to prisoners is escalating at an alarming rate in the current scenario . In many countries ,criminals commit crimes as soon as they are released from prison . It's a very serious issue . If we have a deep look at the topic, we will certainly be able to identify a good number of reasons responsible for this unexpected problem in upcoming paragraphs , I will not only shed light on the argument but also elaborate on my point of view .",
        "To embark, if we have a deep look at the matter we will certainly be able to find a fair number of reasons why prisoners behave like this . The first and foremost reason behind this is unemployment . In this modern era, people who come back from  prison find it very difficult to find a job . They have a family to support in such situations it becomes very difficult for them to survive as a result they are involved in occurrences such as robbery , thrift and all . Secondly, discrimination is the reason why people get into crimes . Society doesn't welcome them . They got discriminated against at every step . For example , people treat them like prisoners in their society . They are not welcome in their functions and all . Because of such reasons,  they get depressed and as a result, they do the same mistake again .",
        "On the other hand, there are numerous ways to solve this current scenario. Firstly, in prison , we can educate them so that they can face the world . With the help of education,  they can find suitable jobs to support their family . Secondly, people can train them and give them work while they are behind bars. They can work for the government and when they get released they will get their money . That way doesn't face money problems. Last but not least , tell the society members to treat them as humans ,not as a criminal . They also deserve a second chance .",
        "In conclusion,  the issue related to crime always has been a controversial topic across the globe . Normal people and prisoners are divided into two societies but I suppose with little trust and passion we can make this place better for all ."
