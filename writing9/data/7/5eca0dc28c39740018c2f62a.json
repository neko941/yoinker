        "Owing to internet technology, work and study can be conducted remotely at home and it is getting more common with time. In my opinion, I think this trend brings more benefits for individuals compared to any drawbacks it might bring.",
        "Despite the drawbacks below, I believe the benefits resulted from the trend of online working and learning are of extreme importance.  One evident benefit is that individuals can develop self-discipline which is a crucial element for a successful future. Since working or studying from home will have no supervision of neither managers nor teachers, people will be trained to have self-control and good time management. Another positive aspect is maximizing efficiency by saving travel time. For instance, people often waste a lot of time due to traffic congestion and feel exhausted from commuting to and from workplace or school. In this regard, home office or study is more efficient as the saved time and energy can be fully allocated on important tasks.",
        "Admittedly, there are some minor problems involved in remote work or study from home. Firstly, it might weaken the social skills of people such as presentation skills, eye contact and body gesture.  As individuals use computers for majority of time for work or study, they have less face-to-face interaction. People, however, are encouraged to maintain social activities after work or application and not to be addicted to the cyber world. Secondly, distractions at home such as neighbourhood noise, TV sounds and snacks might disturb persons from concentrating on their tasks; consequently, their productivity rate will be reduced if they do not minimize the surrounding disturbance.",
        "In conclusion, learning to be self-disciplined and maximizing efficiency outweighany of the minor disadvantages resulted from home office or study."
