        "My country is definitely not the only one that have many unemployed youngsters, who are highly qualified. That is a problem happening all around the world.",
        "One major factor about it is that these graduates have no enough experience about coping with stressful situations and dealing with problems of their everyday lives. Even if they have been studying in an elite university they have only extended their knowledge and that\u2019s all. I suggest having more  lectures about real life and its difficulties.",
        "Another factor is that most of the companies have a staff with people working for them for years, so that they don\u2019t want changes in order to prevent any jeopardy. The solution is clear - companies have to become more open to young people because they are those who would make the world a modern one.",
        "A vital factor causing this problem could be the personality. Youngsters are surrounded by technology that is able to make them less creative and more identical to each other. If employers seek someone who is original and unique, maybe that\u2019s the biggest problem. However, it is not hard to resolve - graduates would just have to show these qualities that make them different.",
        "In conclusion, I think that both employers and graduates have to find a way to solve this big problem causing troubles in many countries, because young people are those who have to show their capacity to the world. We should give them a chance and see what they are capable of."
