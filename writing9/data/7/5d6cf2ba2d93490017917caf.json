        "In this contemporary world, It is considered indispensable by many people that young generation ought to take advice from parents in different situations of their life, whereas others do not agree with this viewpoint. This essay will put forward both the arguments and provide and opinion.",
        "To begin with, it is important in today's world that children at an early age should ask for parents advice in order to prevent themselves from several adverse ramifications. In other words, teenagers often face an ample of challenges in their adolescence, and therefore they can easily get distracted. For this reason, they should always seek for the advice of their immediate elders. Because they have more experience of life and they will always provide wise as well as rational suggestions, which will not harm the life of children. In India, for example, many young people seek for a helpful advice from their parents when they are making some critical decision of their life as they feel that parents provide a sensible and wise opinion. Furthermore, children at their early age are not mature enough to take appropriate decision of their life, and hence parent's advice is of utmost importance.",
        "On the other hand, some people believe that children should not take advice from their parents as it will make them dependent, and they will not be able to develop the core skill of being decisive which is quite crucial for their future life. This is to say, young children has the ability to learn and master the learning in a quick and efficient manner, therefore, allowing them to make their own decisions will enable them to learn from their mistakes and eventually develop their decision making skills. For instance, in the United States, children take their own decisions starting from very early age, and thus successful and independent even at the age of 18.",
        "In conclusion, even though it is necessary for children to be deceptive about various decisions of life without any suggestions or advice from their parents, I strongly believe that they should always seek for the wise advice of their parents in the early age so as to prevent themselves from horrendous consequences. If juveniles start listening to their parents in their immature age, many child crimes will be avoided all over the world."
