Other people believe that it is important for children to make decisions about matters that affect them. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion",

        "It is argued that some people try giving opportunity, deciding by themselves for finding and selecting things that they want, and also the other bear opposite side of this. So this essay discusses both the sides and gives my own opinion.",
        "",
        "On the one hand, some people believe that the young ones should bear there the responsibility while finding things for them. The parents think that their children can handle things they want, and expect this help to build up the self-confidence because someone tries to make own things alone she/he will do their work without any fear. For instance, some television programmed telecast about some characters building the future alone and become strong more than others because of the confidence, but there are merits and also demerits of this method.",
        "",
        "On the other hand, majority me and women hold the other side of this. Most students are not mature enough for doing own things without guide their elders so some time that we can see going the wrong path and destroy the lives early age. For example, many media reports about helpless children and also the committed suicide cases happened due to misguided by an outer person. Although some guided pupils have not achieved their success and prosperity.",
        "",
        "In a nutshell, a lot of guided young ones have reached the goals, and others also gained the outcome, however, most of them failed. In my opinion, many teenagers have obtained the outcome by getting help from a matured one and educated persons who can direct them."
