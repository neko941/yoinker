        "It goes without saying that office work has become an integral part of our lives. Due to ever-growing competition, individuals tend to go out of their comfort zone thus, to provide the best performance. This not only has a significant impact but also hampers the joyfulness of life. I will share both viewpoints in this essay.",
        "On one hand, the first and foremost concern is that people neglect the effect of working long hours on their dear ones, family and close friends. Subsequently, due to a lack of time left for family bonding and interactions, an individual does not stay active and gradually is disconnected. To cite an example, the person who is always away from his house due to office commitments misses out on vital family gatherings and functions. Secondly, it paves a great threat to his or her health. Because of engaging in the high-demand jobs, their schedule is blocked the majority of the time which does not allow enough attention to the exercise routine and requirements.",
        "On other hand, although there are some issues, the most predominant aspect is that they receive hefty payments. This motivates the person to display better outcomes and move up the ladder within his or her company. Furthermore, working for the majority time of the day has become a habit of many individuals because of which in case they do not follow the same pattern, they might feel lost or in a soup. For instance, some folks work during holidays or weekends, due to the simple fact that they do not want to miss out on being on top of their own activities at work.",
        "To recapitulate, making efforts to get involved in leisure activities is essential for a healthy mind and body. However, we cannot neglect the reality that everyone around us needs a good job to meet the high maintenance of lifestyle and stay satisfied."
