I was living on the 4th floor and in room number 524 and I checked out from this place on the morning of the 15th of June. After I reach my destination then I came to realise that my shirt is left behind in the room.",
        "Although I  packed all my stuff, however, I forget to take a shirt which was hung on the wall in the washroom. It was of brand Redtape and having black in colour. There is a logo of that brand on the pocket of it as well as inside the collar. Apart from it, there is a print of light pink colour on that piece of clothing.",
        "I do not want to lose it as it was gifted by my father on my last birthday. Thus, I want you to please ask your staff members to please locate it and inform me on the contact 7485xxxxxx. I would be really appreciable if you could please make arrangement for its parcel to my address because I am living in Jalandhar which is very far from this place.",
