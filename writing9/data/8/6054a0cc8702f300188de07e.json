        "With the advent of technologies, a tremendous increase in the number of industries is observed. Most of the forward countries are facing the threat of reduced air and water purity from commercial companies as well as from building works. It must be tackled adequately to stabilize the environment. In the upcoming paragraphs, every possible solution to this problem would be discussed.",
        "Firstly, to maintain the water quality to a consistent standard, proper measures to be taken to reduce the flow of industrial waste into the waterways. To elaborate, nowadays, most   companies conveniently dispose of harmful commercial contaminants into large ponds, rivers and canals. It must be stopped with powerful rules. For example, a water quality test conducted by the US government given shocking result that nearly 40% of large streams are massively polluted by commercial chemical waste. Thereby reduced the overall water purity. Hence, harmful chemical disposal into such waterways should be stopped completely.",
        "Secondly, besides the water pollution, the purity of air is also questionable. To explain, Industries are indiscriminately emitting harmful gases into the atmosphere. This should be adequately checked to reduce air pollution. For this, industries must filter disposed gas and fumes thoroughly to block lethal particles from escaping into the atmosphere. For instance, a survey conducted by a reputed newspaper in Uk shows that  32% of the contribution to the existing air pollution is from Industrial emissions. Following this news, the government implemented an efficient act to control commercial emissions.",
        "To conclude, commercial firms and construction companies play a key role in air and water pollution. Although they are a boon for the comprehensive development of humanity, authorities must control these for the well being of nature."
