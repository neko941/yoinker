        "In today's world, it is common merit for students to have the right to choose both compulsory classes and free periods This leads to the freedom of managing their own timetable. In my opinion, It is agreed that every student should be allowed to do their time management. The more motivation in learning due to the freedom in time management and more experiences from extracurricular activities I will prove this.",
        "Firstly, motivation plays a vital role in encouraging these days students to keep up with their lessons, For instance, as they are allowed to choose their own liking, it provides fond to study More than forcing them to follow the school regularity. To clarify, the greater freedom of Students, the greater passions they received. Therefore, freedom in time management should be constantly applied in the education system.",
        "Secondly, students free period management also create a suitable decision for each student to have capable time for another activity besides at school. Physical activities (for example) are crucial for one physical development, especially in young people. Moreover, they can use this leisure time to improve and explore their preferences that cannot be found in the academic lessons at school. As a result, students could develop both school activities and extracurricular activities, if they have freedom in time management.",
        "To sum up, allows students to choose their own timetable causing passion in learning, as well as developing outside school activities. It is clear that freedom in time management is supposed to be a common right for all students. In the long run, it is not rather excessive to claim that this causes a lot of benefits that should be seriously applied in the present era of the education system."
