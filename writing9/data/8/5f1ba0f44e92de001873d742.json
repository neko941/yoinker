        "According to psychologists it has proven many times that the clothes you wear describe your personality. Clothes play an essential role in our daily life. It rules our behaviour to a new culture in modern society. I completely agree with the statement that people behave more differently when they wear different clothes. For many reasons, which will be mentioned below the essay",
        "First of all, It is scientifically approved that appearance influences our behaviour. For example, men dress in clean suit and wear polished shoes, his gesture would comport to be elegant. On the contrary, women wear jeans and a T - shirt, she wants to be fun and active; but if she wears some traditional cloth, she behaves more carefully. This experience taught me that the way you dress really does influence how people treat you, which affects how you behave with them.",
        "Secondly, it is widely believed that dressing well helps to build one's confidence. Thus, different dresses often influence the way others think about us and our reaction as well. For instance, we should dress neatly for a job interview, we look more self - confident and professional; and you will definitely impression on HR manager.",
        "Lastly, Clothes reminds a person what type of people. People working in different fields wear clothes depending on their field of work. To illustrate this, students during their annual day celebrations they prefer changing clothes depending on the act they are going to perform on stage. While those working in the hospitals wear clothes depending on the level of protection needed to deal with patients.",
        "In conclusion, different clothes influence the way people behave. Clothes help people to support their attitude and behaviour in different situations. That\u2019s why we should all choose what we wear very carefully."
