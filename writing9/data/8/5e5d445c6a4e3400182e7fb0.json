        "As a local resident, I would like to protest the development of our local airport as it would bring many negative consequences. I am writing to request you to publish an editorial in your newspaper regarding the problems the expansion of the local airport would cause.",
        "I live near the Bogra International Airport where more than two thousand citizens, including children and older people, reside. Life near the airport is already difficult as harsh noises are frequent, especially at night when the aeroplanes land or depart the runway. If the number of flights is increased, the noise will become unbearable. This could result in immense distress to the people. Besides, it would worsen the traffic condition of the adjacent roads.",
        "",
        "Moreover, the airport authority wants to expand the area; so our lovely park, which is essential for every citizen of this locality, will be diminished. Due to this, everyone in our locality is against this proposed development. If you agree with me, please publish an editorial to your newspaper to disagree with this unnecessary and detrimental development.",
        "I am looking forward to hearing from you soon.",
