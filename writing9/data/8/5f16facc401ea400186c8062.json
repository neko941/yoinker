        "In last two decades, there has been a continuous rise in the level of competition among business. Due to these reasons certain organizations have started to follow unethical practices as well as a negative approach to business. I completely disagree with this point of view as I feel at least certain values must be followed by companies.",
        "To begin with, firstly, in todays era of cut throat competition, every organisation wants to do well as much money and investments of different people are in the life. To maintain the profitability of their companies, they start to do unethical practices. For instance, as I am in the field of construction and I especially do the projects of the government, there is practice do corruption with the government officers and making the structure as weak as possible and earning the money by saving material from the construction. Thus, this leads to fragile structure and ultimately people are at a loss.",
        "Secondly, many MNCs follow the negative approach to earn money by which the end users are the sufferers and they earn a hefty sum of capital. Following a negative approach such as, destroying their competitors, bullying their suppliers are some of the practices which are going on now a days. For example, a company called Shiv Ratna electrics having a good market share, but facing a stiff competition from a startup XLRE electrics, creates hurdles to grow these new startups by using his financial power as well as using political power to curb the growth of new startup.",
        "To conclude, Organizations use different unethical ways like financial power, political powers, corruptions and many more to diminish their competitors which is totally wrong and mean, full practice and strict actions should be taken to curb this type of cultures."
