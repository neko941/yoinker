Others, however, argue that the circumstances of an individual crime, and the motivation for committing it, should always be taken into account when deciding on the punishment.\nDiscuss both of these two views and give your own opinion.\n\nGive reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.",

        "In my first view, depravity is a bigger problem in the \u00a0now. Some people, for completing their needs, they do abomination. Such as, robbery, theft and many more. Moreover, if the\u00a0 government allows this rule infraction\u00a0may be\u00a0reduced and criminals will think twice before committing any breach. For instance, in Saudi Arabia, if people do any type of depravity in this place.  The government would only give capital punishment. Because, the main object of this law is reducing the infraction from this place and due to this rule crime has decreased in this country.",
        "",
        "In my second view, Before giving any types of sanction.  The government should see\u00a0the motivation of\u00a0behind the offence. Then, they should decide\u00a0 some about criminals lumps. For example, some time a man going to somewhere in the middle night and someone has attacked on him with the gun and man has also hit him with something to protecting himself. After that, suddenly attacker is a die. This kind of situation law cannot say it is murder. Because they have done this murder for saving himself. Therefore, these types of cases authority should see first what is the region at the back of the felony. Afterwards, they should choose his sanction.",
        "To summarize, I think\u00a0first of all\u00a0nation authorities have to check the motive at the rear of the scandal. Then, they should take some action about criminals lumps."
