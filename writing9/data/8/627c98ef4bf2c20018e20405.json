I received the photos you sent to me via e-mail and I want to thank you so much for that. I had a lovely time with you and Agnes last holiday and I really appreciate that.",

        "Well,I've always wanted to invite you over to my school, so, now is the right time. This will also be your first time in Lagos and I promise to make it worthwhile. Please let me know when you'll be willing to pay me a visit. You can inform Agnes as well because I'll be more than happy to host both of you. Take care my good friend and bye for now.",
