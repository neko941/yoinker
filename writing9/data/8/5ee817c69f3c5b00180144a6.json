        "My name is John Nordstrom and I have been renting the flat in Parkway Boulevard from you for the past six months. As I'm sure you are aware I have been a good tenant during this period. I always pay my rent on time and look after the flat.",
        "My rental agreement with you was for one year and the contract ends in January. Unfortunately, I have just heard that I will need to leave the flat in November, which is, in fact, two months early. The reason for this is that my manager has asked me to go back to Germany earlier than planned and I am afraid this is beyond my control.",
        "As I am now unable to stay here until the end of the contract, I would be extremely grateful if you could release me from it early. I'm aware that this is not normally allowed but I hope you can understand my situation and still return my deposit.",
