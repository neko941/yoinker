THUS, THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE THAT THE MUSEUMS AND CURICULUM WORKS GALLRIES DO  NOTREQUIRE TO BE PHYSICALLY PRESENT AS IT CAN BE VIEW THROUGH ONLINE SECTORS.FIRSTLY, THIS ESSAY WILL PARTIALLY CONCUR WITH THE ABOVE NOTION ANS SECONDLY, DISCUSS THE PRIME ADVANTAGE OF HAVING PHYSICAL ACCESS TO THE GALLARIES AND DIS ADVATAGE OF GLANCE FROM THE INTERNET.",

FOR EXAMPLE, AS PER THE GOVERNMENT ANTIQUE EPARTMENT DATA SAYS THAT 80% OF THE INDIAN CIVILIAN PREFER TO GO TO MUSEUMS OR ARTS GALLARIES FOR THE BETTER KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERINECE.",
        "ON THE OTHER HAND, SEEING OR VISITING IT THROUGH INTENET OR COMPUTER MIGHT HAVE INCLUDED FALSE DETAILS AND THERE ARE CHANCES THAT PEOPLE USED TO MANIPULATE THE GIVIN INFORMATION FOR THEIR BUSINESS PROFITS. HENCE, IT I CONSIDERED AS AN UNRELIBLE MEDIUM TO OBTAIN A KNOWLEDGE. FOR INSTANCE, AS PER THE UK GOOD REPORTS. IT HAS BEEN 60% NEW INFORMATION HAS BEEN CHANGED TILL NOW  AS IT IS ACCEESSIBE TO MOSTLY ALL THE CITIZENS.",
