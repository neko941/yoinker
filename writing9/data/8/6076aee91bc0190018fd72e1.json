        "Some individuals' opinions that doubtlessly artificial intelligent machines take over all jobs from humans. Personally, I think that cutting edge technologies have already reduced manpower in several sectors and inevitably AI technologies will reign all sectors regardless of job types. The aim of this essay is to discuss the argument and it will explain by using relevant examples.",
        "To begin with, it is important to bear in mind that the failure rate which is made by humans can be reduced with artificially intelligent robots. In this way, the standardization of products can be provided and this means that factories and industry are able to produce their product at a standard level of quality. Furthermore, there is no doubt that AI robots can make the same process in a shorter time and more accurately when compared to manpower. For instance, AI robots have started to be used in surgeries and as a consequence of it,  human mistakes can be declined and also the reliability of operation had increased.",
        "Secondly,  breakthrough innovations in the machine learning field show that these technologies can be used in every area, even the arts. Many people thought that machines and AI would never generate art and craft works 20 years ago. Contrary to this belief, people have shown that everything is possible with the development of AI and they have been starting to think about why it can not be replaced with all jobs in the future. For example, with the GAN technologies, new paintings and artworks can be produced by using deep neural networks. Consequently, this revolution showed that machine learning and artificial intelligence technologies can be replaced with all jobs in the future, even the unpredictable ones such as painting, writing poems and novels.",
        "To summarize,  although plenty of individuals thought that AI and machine learning technologies can not be used for many purposes such as arts and crafts, artificial intelligent developments showed that everything can be possible in the computer ages. Especially, it should be considered that the ratio of human mistakes can be reduced and also more efficient production processes can be provided by the AI machines hence, doubtlessly artificially intelligent robots will take over all kinds of jobs in the future."
