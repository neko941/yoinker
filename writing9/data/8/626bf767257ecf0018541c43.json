        "Dear Sir,",
        "I am writing this letter to raise my concern regarding a camera that I purchased last week. I visited your London Airport store on May 3rd and purchased a camera from there. The Bill number of the article is S436325 and I am enclosing a copy of the bill for your reference.",
        "The service executive handed me over a new sealed box when I selected the model of my choice. Due to the hurried purchase, I could not check it then and there as I was getting late for the flight. However, when I unboxed it after reaching back to India, I found that the memory card and battery charger were missing and it is of no use to me without these items.",
        "As It is not possible for me to visit that store personally so I need your assistance to look into this matter and provide either a replacement for the kit or the missing items.",
        "Looking forward to hearing back from you soon.",
        "Yours faithfully,",
