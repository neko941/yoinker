        "It seems that each country worldwide always varies in history, people\u2019s lifestyle, and language. Yet in the present day, the variation in cultural features is being narrowed. This essay will discuss the cause of that situation before explaining why its advantages outweigh the drawbacks.",
        "One reasonable explanation is the explosion of mass media. Thanks to it, each country\u2019s culture is advertised widely, affecting the development of other nations\u2019 cultural values. For instance, the K-pop culture of Korea, which has spread over Asia through televisions leads to the changes in Asian young generation\u2019s fashion. Another reason is the inevitable integration and globalization process, which encourages countries to adopt an open-door policy and learn from other regions. It, therefore, promotes the adaptation of one another\u2019s culture.",
        "Although many people hold that their local is running a risk of losing its distinctive features, I would argue that the similarity in the set of values among countries brings positive impact. Identical customary beliefs, social forms, and material traits enhance mutual understanding within nations, which resulted in a reduction in global wars. Moreover, if they share common in these life aspects, they are likely to put any effort into developing them. For example, Chinese and Vietnamese are joining hands to promote the calligraphic arts by sending Vietnamese learners to China\u2019s calligraphic training school.",
        "In conclusion, the differences between national cultures are being eliminated thanks to the mass media and globalization. In my opinion, this trend would reduce the conflicts available among countries, leaving a peaceful environment for cultural development."
