        "Replacing conventional meals with junk food is fast becoming the norm for many people, and while this may be more practical, it presents some serious concerns for health and productivity. This essay will discuss the pros and cons of this shift in behaviour.",
        "The most serious disadvantage of this issue is the damage to health. In other words, eating fast food regularly means increased consumption of harmful fats and chemical additives. Studies show that consuming these regularly can increase the risk of conditions such as cancer or heart disease. In addition to the increased risk of disease, being less healthy has a negative effect on productivity. For example, convenience food often contains fewer nutrients, and this can make people lethargic and affect performance. Essentially, eating fast food regularly can cause serious damage to a person\u2019s health, and this will negatively affect their abilities in other areas.",
        "On the other hand, eating convenience food can save valuable time. There are times when people with busy schedules would be forced to skip meals if fast food options were not available. Our bodies need nutrition and it is probably better to eat one of the healthier fast food options than not to eat at all. For instance, picking up a quick snack from a fast food restaurant might be the only chance to eat for working people with very tight schedules. To sum up, the pace of modern life means that fast food is sometimes the most practical option.",
        "In conclusion, the disadvantages outweigh the advantages because health has to be a priority for most people. The increased productivity and life expectancy that good health brings is far more important than the short-term gains offered by a fast food diet."
