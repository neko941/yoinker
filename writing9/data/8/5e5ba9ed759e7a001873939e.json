        "The advancement in a technology has altered the way of people interact with each other. People often talk either this shift is a positive or a negative impact on the development of relationships those humans make. In my opinion, its benefits outweigh its drawbacks.",
        "",
        "To begin with, technology has many positive aspects to make a relationship stronger and better by improving the field of\u00a0 a communication. Today, a multitude of companies works with their customers through an online platform. Moreover, they built a strong link with a customer through their all day services using the Internet. This progress of a science\u00a0 plays\u00a0 an essential role in the life of people, who are far away from their families, working in foreign countries. Now, they are kept in touch\u00a0 with their beloved ones via Whatsapp, Facebook, and Skype. For instance,\u00a0 in earlier times,\u00a0 human has sent or received a message through a letter by using the service of a postman. But, now these days, they have instantly talked with each other.",
        "",
        "On the other hand, it has brought a number of negative effects in the lives of humans. It is a direct attack on their social life. People do not want to meet their family members. Whereas, they are pleased with virtual friends of a social media. A relation development through technology is not a\u00a0 time resistant and have a lack of trust. For example, a study conducted in the USA which reveals that 75% of high school children\u00a0 depute their 50% time\u00a0 on the Internet.",

        "To conclude, the interaction between people entirely depends on\u00a0 the way they use a machinery. It brings many useful aspects in human lives, but it has also affected their privacy."
