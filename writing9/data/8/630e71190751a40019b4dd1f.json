        "On top of that, I wanted to tell you about a few problems with a camping trip. First, the weather could be warm, so you might have difficulty falling asleep. On top of that, there are no convenience stores nearby, so you can't grab supplies or food.",
        "I wanted to let you know that I want to accompany you on this trip. I think it's a good bonding opportunity and will also benefit my mental health. Lastly, coming along with you will allow me to explore other areas on the trip.",
        "I am hoping to hear from you soon.",
