        "Nowadays countries have variations in their country level or states. Some nations have become richer than others and they have a lot of resources and a high level of technology but some countries are poorer and they call developing countries. The topic said that developed nations should now help poorer countries. I totally agree with this opinion and the following paragraph highlights my opinion with relevant examples.",
        "Firstly, Developed countries have a lot of factors such as a lack of money,new technologies, intelligent employees and a supportive government .so they always try to discover new methods or technologies assist to country development.In the meantime,they have extra financial states and it definitely helps to improve the basic needs of developing countries by maintaining funds such as \"REDCROSS\" and \"UNESCO\".Last few years UNESCO helped  Africa and India  to develop their basic needs and it used funds for scholarship programs. It will help to knowledgeable future employment and independence.",
        "Secondly developed nations allow them to export their goods and products to the rich countries without tax and strict rules and regulations and it surely affects productivity and economical growth, and also gives more employment opportunities for the local people.However, most of the poorer country people suffer from unemployment and they can't bear basic expenses. Moreover, rich states can invest their money in development projects that are run in poorer states. According to the reason research conducted by the university of Colombo, they discover more than a quarter half of the world suffers from  malnutrition.",
        "In conclusion, some nations have become much richer and financial,technological and natural resources are the main component. The use of these extra resources and funds help underdeveloped nations to raise basic needs and economic growth by executing development project, charity program, and scholarship program and allowing them to expect goods and services from the advanced community."
