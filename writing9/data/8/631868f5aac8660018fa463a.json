        "Numerous uncommon languages are vanishing yearly around the globe. While some say, life will be much simplified if fewer languages are used globally. I, on the other hand, partly disagree with this opinion.",
        "Admittedly, choosing common languages as a mother language could lead to two advantages( job opportunities and immigration difficulties). From the perspective of getting more offers from different companies. For example, more than 50% of the world's population knows English or Chinese, meaning that more than half of companies use English or Chinese to operate. Therefore, when fewer languages exist on earth,  more job opportunities are being offered since people will be able to speak in different countries and be hired. And to the perspective of immigrating. When the whole population on earth uses the same language, people will not suffer from communication difficulties anymore. Thereby, immigrants will have less concern about living in foreign countries.",
        "Despite these arguments, several languages dying out will cause a detrimental effect on countries' culture and finance. For instance, South Korea is known for Korean popular music( K-Pop) and Korean drama( K-Drama). K-Pop and K-Drama are both in Korean. Suppose their primary language is being swapped for English. Then, K-Pop and K-Drama will lose their purposes and features since their characteristics are speaking or singing in Korean. Hence, people might lose interest in Korean culture. And, workers who depend on the Korean entertainment industry are likely to lose their jobs. Moreover, the leading money stream for Korea will vanish. Hence, breaking down Korea's economy and putting Korea in a financial crisis. At last, life would be much harder for them.",
        "To conclude, even though the more unity is for languages, the easier certain peoples' lives are. However, this could also ruin a whole communities' life,"
