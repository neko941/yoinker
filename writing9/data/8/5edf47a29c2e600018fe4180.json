        "Nowadays, Junk food has become an indispensable part in some countries. Moreover, it is booming as a familiar meal for every age and gender. While some people assume that fast food has the considerable benefit of low-cost and time-saving, I believe that fast food brings detrimental effects rather than advantages to people. There are two main reasons for this.",
        "First of all, it is an indisputable fact that processed food is unhealthy and result in serious health problems if people eat in a long time. For instance, fried chicken, hamburgers, and chips, which contain a high amount of fat and salt. Eating a poor-quality diet high in junk food is linked to a higher risk of obesity, digestive issues, heart disease. Although unhealthy food is both convenient and economical, the cost of treating these illnesses it causes a later life is much more expensive. In other words, there is a correlation between junk food and chronic illnesses.",
        "Further and more importantly, with the rapid increase of fast food processing industry, people gradually forget the traditional meals obliterate the traditional meals. In the past, family members used to prepare meals together in a cosy atmosphere, and national food recipes are inherited through generations. In contrast, now, people are likely to spend less time on themselves with home-cooked meals. For example, Mc Donald, KFC, and other fast-food restaurants have grown significantly upward. Admittedly, junk food is much more affordable for every class because of its cheaper price than the former meal. Nonetheless, I would argue that convenience foods have generally been a negative development.",
        "By way of conclusion, I once again reaffirm my view that fast food is a harmful threat to human health because it causes serious health problems and makes people forget the traditional meals. Furthermore, I believe that there is a restricted law on fast food restaurants like imposing higher-rate tax so that people will have full awareness of this tendency."
