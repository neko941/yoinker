        "Nowadays, the technological revolution noticeably rejuvenated the education process. Indeed, online classes have been provided by some universities and institutions around the world. However, having courses on the internet has many more disadvantages in comparison with the traditional classes.",
        "First of all, attending a lesson on the internet mitigates the interactive educational technique. It is widely known that people can efficiently learn by interacting with each other. For example, a recent study at King Abdulaziz University in Saudi Arabia indicates that 64 percent of total students consider classmates as the second information resource after the lecturer. In addition, in 2016, scholars from the United States of America observed that the physical attending to the class stimulates the students and surges their ambition. Thus, conducting courses on the normal method has better consequences.",
        "Furthermore, online learning may prevent students from acquiring life experience. Unambiguously, the university is not an educational place only. By having a look at history, it can be simply assimilated that a university contributes to the enhancement and development of students\u2019 mind. For instance, students in the university are exposed to new ideologies and different thoughts which lead to the reformation of the student character. In contrast, studying remotely can end this kind of amenities. Besides, traditional classes enlarge students networks and relations which might help them to easily get into the field in the future. Thus, the usual teaching process can provide a generation with high awareness.",
        "To conclude, offering courses on the internet has many educational and personal problems which make it inappropriate to be applied. Less interaction, motivation and experience can be a result of online educational institution courses."
