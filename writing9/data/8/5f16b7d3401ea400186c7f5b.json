        "The discussion about whether people should continue to study at university after high school is of great concern to the public. Some people choose to go to work instead of university, but others hold the opposite view. In my opinion, I believe it is a better choose that go to universities or colleges after high school rather than work.",
        "On one hand, there are several reasons why people prefer to look for a job directly after graduating from high school.  The first one is that they can earn money earlier, and their first plot of gold is achieved faster. As a result, it is much easier for them than undergraduates to invest or start their own business. Secondly, young people who decide to work earlier believe that they can gain experience and improve their skills in real work, which helps them to succeed in their career. For instance, it takes at last 2,000 hours apprenticeship to be a registered electrician in New Zealand, so it is obviously better to be an apprentice than studying in university if they want to be a registered electrician in the future.",
        "On the other hand, what I believe is that university or college gives people significantly more opportunities in terms of a successful career. Firstly, those high-income occupations like dentists, middle wives and lawyers require higher degrees, qualifications and skills, while those who have never attended university or college have no chance to enter these industries.  Another important reason is that a higher degree makes us more competitive. There is no doubt that employers prefer those applicants who have a better education background when they face hundreds of applications.",
        "In conclusion, it seems beneficial to work after high school, but it is absolutely much easier to succeed after getting a higher education."
