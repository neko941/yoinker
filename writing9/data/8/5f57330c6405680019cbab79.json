        "It is debated that building more community parks and sports arena in new cities should be emphasized rather than shopping centres. However, I completely disagree with the notion and this essay will discuss my instance with relevant examples.",
        "Firstly, Shopping malls will help the government in generating revenues which they can use in further development of the town. A newly built city requires a lot of investments in construction as well as maintenance, Furthermore, it is very important for the authority to create income source to stay fully functional. For instance, Lavasa city in Pune was built recently as one of the most colourful cities of Maharashtra, However, the construction was stopped halfway due to financial issues faced by the government and most of the vendors did not get their payment. Moreover, the city now just have a few colourful buildings and lots of empty space. Nonetheless, recently the government has announced it as tourism spot to generate revenue, as the city is surrounded by beautiful lakes.",
        "Secondly, Malls facilitates the community with regular use of products and entertainment options. Nowadays, convenience is very important to  mankind, So, whenever one chooses to shift in any city they look out for the area which provides basic amenities for their day to day life. For example, a recent study of Oxford University has shown that now most of the couples are working-class which increases their financial stability, hence they choose comfort over money in daily life. In such scenarios, people will look for nearby malls rather than spending time in commuting for buying household items or for outings on the weekend.",
        "To conclude, Building malls can be a way better idea than going for sports complex or parks. As the former will help in providing comfort to people residing in the city as well as it will generate the revenue for the government."
