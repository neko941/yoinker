        "Although, It is thought by some that digital games are an excellent source of entertainment and beneficial from a learning point of view, other people consider these games detrimental for the gamers who spend a considerable amount of time on video games. In my opinion, I believe that the computer games are having a significant negative impact on mental and physical health of people who play these games for the tremendous amount of time.",
        "On the one hand, people think that playing video games is having an immense pleasure and  extremely useful to spend free time.

Along with this, few games are based on the real life situations that eventually provide sense to deal with these sorts of conditions.",
        "On the other hand, it is believed by some people that these digital games are extremely dangerous for people's mental wellness and I agree. To illustrate, people who are playing violent computer games such as Call of duty, Grand theft auto and several others, generally behave aggressively due to a continuous extreme level of violence exposure. Along with this, some people could go into a depression or in worse case children might get seizures as well. Furthermore, digital games adversely affect physical and eye health as well due to the lack of exercise and long hours exposure of screen. For an example, people spend several hours on these games without even walking that consequently results in awful health conditions such as, obesity, diabetes and lots others. Eye health is dangerously affected by watching a bright screen that emits harmful rays.",
        "In conclusion, while people may vary in their opinion, I believe that video games are extremely harmful for physical fitness and mental well being. People ought to play these games for a moderate amount of time to tackle with health related concerns."
