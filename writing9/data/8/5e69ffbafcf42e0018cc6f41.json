Finally, wearing different varieties of clothes makes them attractive to the opposite sex. Thus, because of the natural affinity of mankind to look good, they have been spending increasingly on recently released clothing items.",
        "",
        "However, the status quo of such a mindset can be hugely detrimental to the society, at large. Not only do people would need to spend so much more time on grooming themselves, but also they would need to spend way higher to look better. For instance, it is an accepted fact that there are no direct results to be derived from looking better by wearing clothes and other accessories in the current form. Additionally, middle income families would need to keep aside a big chunk of their income to adopt themselves to the latest fad, which stems as a result of the requirement to merge into the society like everyone else.",
        "",
        "To conclude, the adoption of the latest fashion trend can be shown to bring in no direct results despite its cost and time requirements. Nevertheless, people worldwide is increasingly spending on upgrading their accessories to feel good about themselves."
