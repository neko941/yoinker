        "The problem of the unhealthy diet and less energetic lifestyle is becoming more and more disputed. Nowadays, some people argue that individuals should be responsible for improving their health, while others believe that it is up to a government. Nevertheless, in my opinion, everyone should have a responsibility for what they are eating.",
        "It is clear, that 40% of the world population suffers from  obesity. There is no doubt that individuals must take the power for their health whether it regards to young people or adults. Therefore, if people cannot track the food they are eating, especially if it is junk snacks or sugary drinks, no one will assist them to lose overweight.  For example, many children become less healthy and only parents can encourage them to accept more nutritious cuisine or vitamins.",
        "",
        "However, the governments have a responsibility in this situation too. They can regulate the production of sustenance as well as the ingredients due to the taxation of the factories or even farms, that supply product to markets and stores either in cities or villages. Also, if they provided measures such as campaigns, there would be an increase in citizens' awareness. For instance, these will encourage residents doing exercises and taking good diets.",
        "From what has been discussed above here should be drawn a conclusion that only  individuals must take ultimate responsibility in order to improve their health. But governments also can have a role to play as only they can regulate the food supply, which openly encourages a poor diet."
