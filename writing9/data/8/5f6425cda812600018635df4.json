        "I am writing this letter in lieu of the article you posted on 12th March 2020 in the Chronicle, about rewarding people who have contributed to society. I would like to nominate Mr. Rajanath Pillai for this award, for his splendid work through his Clean Earth Foundation.",
        "He embarked on the mission to clean all beaches in Mumbai alone, soon someone posted a video about him and then supporters started flowing in. Consequently, he started the Clean Earth Foundation, which has almost disposed of 150 Tons of garbage in the past year. His efforts and vision of a beautiful world is the one that we all share, but he was the one who took steps and got his hands dirty.",
        "I would like to commend his efforts by donating INR 50,000 and also help him set up a website through which more people can register. I hope together we can make the world a better place to live in. Looking forward to hearing back from you with a positive response.",
        "Thanks and regards,",
