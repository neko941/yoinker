        "Most of the countries offer free health services but they do not offer the most expensive latest medical treatments. However, I believe that the health system should be advanced and free of cost to the people.",
        "Firstly, there are many countries who offer health care system facilities but with insurance. As part of insurance is quite expensive, which is unaffordable by everyone. If someone's family won't able to buy the insurance for themselves or their family member than it's going to trouble them in future. Because in certain countries doctor's does not pay attention to the patient as the national system allowed. For example, the USA is one of the countries, where to buy insurance is a must for everyone. But I haven't seen any free medical services they typically offer to the public instead of normal health checkup. Although the country system is well advanced and more technical.",
        "On the other hand, many countries, who offer free health services and medicines, they might have a poor health system in serving facilities. For example, in India, there is plenty of well-being centre's running their free services,  instead of having a poor health system. Nevertheless, families are own responsible to buy their own insurance or either this is not necessary from the government end. So, what are the big advantages of having a free health service, if it's not going to benefit the person, who is struggling with his own life for the illness?",
        "Inconclusion, If normal health services being offered by the government for free then the administration suppose to make some urgent steps to improve the structure and also make it easier and modest for the people to get the advantages from out of these facilities."
