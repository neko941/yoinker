        "It is often argued that in school history classes are one of the most crucial classes, while others assert that technology and science are the far most important topics to discuss. In my view, it is a subjective decision that is based on an individual\u2019s career choice.",
        "Many research suggests that studying history is important for those individuals who work in a profession where previous knowledge is required. Professions like archaeology and weather forecasting demand that one who is studying it should know the previous facts and data. For instance, researchers are studying  the cause that killed the entire dinosaur population, by finding this cause they might be able to survive a similar phenomenon if happened in future.",
        "However, certain people support the point that technical topics are more valuable. The reason is they see them as a medium to get a good job. It is clearly evident that in the current era majority of the things are operated by technology and due to this reason there are plenty of new jobs are opening that demands the knowledge of science and technology. For example, on Linkedin (a job seeking platform) there are 50,000 jobs in Texas, USA that asks only for graduates holding a degree in the STEM field.",
        "In conclusion, history can  be a valuable field for students who are eager to make a career where the knowledge of old data is required, although the new job openings illustrate the importance of studying science. In my opinion, it is clearly an individual\u2019s choice to choose which suits him the best."
