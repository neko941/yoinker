        "In response to your question, yes, I'm still studying English at the EOI Academy. My English level has improved very highly. Now I can have  fluent conversations with people, negotiate with sellers... I can do too many things now.",
        "For learning English better, we are using a combination of various methods of learning. We read books, and watch videos, last week we played a game in English together and next Monday we are going to have a video conference with some students from the UK, so we can hear the real accent of British English. However, what I find difficult from learning English is that outside the school classes I don't have anyone to speak  English with, so I have to speak alone. I would really like to have a friend and have a daily conversation in English with him.",
