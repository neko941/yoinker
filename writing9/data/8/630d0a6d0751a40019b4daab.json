        "Nowadays, it is a usual trend in the young community to migrate to urban areas for further study or occupation. This kind of migration of young people into the cities has some benefits and drawbacks. In this essay, I will discuss related advantages and disadvantages and show my view that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages.",
        "To begin with, the advantage of this exodus is the better opportunities to study in well-reputed schools and colleges for teenagers. In the metro cities, the level of education is high, and many young students want to take advantage of this by studying at these universities. For instance, in London, many highly ranked engineering institutes are located which provide an extreme level of study environment and produce highly qualified engineers. Moreover, for those who want to work in big cities, it offers highly paid jobs and an opportunity to learn from the new daily challenges of their work. For example, a nurse can earn $4000-5000 per month in rural areas, whereas they are offered about $8000-9000 salary per month in a city.",
        "On the other hand, this kind of migration's main disadvantage is leaving older adults behind in rural areas. This causes stress on the older adults, and the job can be executed by young force; older adults cannot manage it. To illustrate this, if there is not enough young force in villages, older adults might not be able to carry out all the hard physical work. The second disadvantage is leaving many schools and colleges without students, which creates financial stress on the authorities to run and maintain them. For instance, many villages around London run schools with almost half the capacity. As a result, this causes a financial burden on the local municipality.",
        "In conclusion, although there are some disadvantages of reduced young force and financial difficulty for the local authorities of the urban area, many advantages outweigh the disadvantages, like providing exciting opportunities to study and work in the cities."
