        "It is often discussed topic weather a child can acquire a greater range of useful abilities by enjoying diverse fun activities instead of reading. I think that utilizing of a children\u2019s excessive free time for video-gaming and participating athletic events greatly benefits to their ingenuity and attitude.",
        "Although reading has numerous benefits, playing game consoles is a powerful way of facilitating creative thinking. This is because, playing games can lower the barriers of established behavioural norms and routines by offering new rules and sometimes even new realities. For example, a study conducted by MIT showed that high school students playing one hour daily on consoles such as Play-station and Nintendo outperformed their counterparts by 25 percent in doing brain teasers. Therefore, engaging in game consoles have proved successful in fostering creativity skills that are neglected by just reading.",
        "Next, occasional sports competition contributes to developmental outcomes for a healthy lifestyle rather than individualization while reading. This is due to the fact that through sports competition, children can learn about physical, social, and cognitive skills. For instance, an article from Nature implied how the influence of coaches and family members that children receive through sports competition was important for children\u2019s social, psychological and emotional transformation. Consequently, sport is a great alternative to reading and a powerful tool that breaks down all the barriers and helps us feel good about ourselves.",

        "To conclude from the examples and arguments given I firmly believe that performing entertaining activities gives a child permission to think and behave differently, and this is where the magic starts to happen."
