        "Dear Manager,",
        "I am writing in regard to a regrettable experience I recently had to go through when I attended your cinema last week.",
        "Some of my co-workers and I gathered after work on Friday 1st October to commute together to the cinema. We were hoping to have a great time considering that it was the end of a rather exhausting week. We arrived there early to make sure no one would take our spots to watch the premiere of Top gun that would showcase that Friday night.",
        "To our surprise and since the premiere became such a major event, the 10pm function got overbooked and because of that, we could not utilise our appointed sits. We tried to complain about this with the assigned staff, however, they said they could do nothing about it and if we still wanted to watch the movie we would have to do so sitting on the side stairs.",
        "I would expect such an unpleasant experience would get rectified, so I kindly ask if you could submit a total refund for each one of our tickets as our night got ruined by the disorganization of your staff members.",
        "I would appreciate a prompt response as soon as possible.",
        "Yours sincerely,",
