        "It is often argued that computer games are necessary to erase the stress. Some people might think that the electronic plays are not good for young people with all of the aspects whereas, others insist that these games are distributing youth\u2019s development. In my opinion, although it is useful to develop children\u2019s brain work, computer games might harm to young people. This essay will address the both sides of the computer games and the opinions.",
        "First of all, many computer games may affect young people\u2019s social behaviour. When the majority of children tend to focus on gaming, their lifestyle might be isolated due to the disconnection of the interaction with families or friends. Moreover, some of the games obtain some side effects such as addiction or violence. For example, when children play an abundance of aggressive games such as shooting games, their social attitude would be deteriorated because some stimulative scene of the games might attract young people to follow. Thus, it is not appropriate for some youth who do not determine their behaviour properly.",
        "On the other hand, it would be helpful to improve the children\u2019s creativity. In other words, children might think seriously to win the games because the number of video plays may require some tactical strategies such as sports games. For instance, they might share some brilliant opinions each other to experience the success of the battle because they desire to win which means very positive to work wisely. Furthermore, some strategical plays may be beneficial to distribute children\u2019s brain.",
        "In conclusion, in spite of the fact that some games are contributing children\u2019s development, I personally think that a plenty of computer games is harmful to young people. I assume that we need to encourage children to reduce playing games for their life."
