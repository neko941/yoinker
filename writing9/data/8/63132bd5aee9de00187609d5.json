        "Some people opine that to be successful in sport, athletes should be fit physically , while other individuals commence that  mental fitness is more crucial for a sportsperson. In this essay, I will look at both views and explain why I think that both mental and physical fitness are  equally important for a sportsperson to be successful in sports. I will explain my reason for it in the following paragraphs.",
        "On the one hand, physically strong play a great role in a sportsperson's life and every athlete needs to be strong physically. For example, in wrestling athletes needs to be fit physically, this is because in every match all players are much heavy and strong so athletes need to be  stronger physically to defeat their opponent. Also, physical strength can also enhance endurance for a sportsperson to play longer period. Some games need strong body power for every move such as Volleyball, In this game, people need to be a strong hand to hit the ball  every second.",
        "On the other hand, mental strength also plays a crucial role in a sportsperson's life to be successful in the sport. For example, in wrestling along with physical strength athletes need to be fit mentally which helps them to be cunning in their every move to defeat their opponent in every single match. Furthermore, whenever a sportsperson is  under pressure like fewer scores and low winning percentages, their mental strength helps them to cope with these problems very effectively.",
        "To conclude, after considering all, I think that both physical and mental fitness an equally important for athletes to be successful in sport very effectively."
