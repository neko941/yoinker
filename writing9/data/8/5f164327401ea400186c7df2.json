        "Global trading has become an interesting topic to discuss in recent times. Most economically strong nations are welcoming this to increase their economy and exchange traditions, language and knowledge. While some commentators argue that this kind of advertising taking local businesses' profits. I strongly suggest that international advertising should allow with certain limitations where local business owners do not get affected. This essay will discuss key issues from taking examples from business journals.",
        "To begin with, international businesses can  potentially increase nations revenue, however, there should be certain limitations where they are allowed only in urban areas. This is because small businesses in communities completely rely on their trading. The recent survey run by, The Times Magazine 2019 edition revealed that encouraging international marketing throughout the Australia significantly dropped locals economy, in the view of the fact that global commercial companies are supplying daily goods for lower prices. As a result, the public are interested in getting from them.",
        "Secondly, global marketing can significantly help give employment to graduates after their studies. In the same way, it can also develop a healthy relationship between both countries through sharing their opinions in developing their economy. Additionally, the public will be interested in trying different cultures and languages. The latest statistics revealed by The New York Times states that The United States increased their annual global trading by 25 % in 2019, this is because they welcomed new global businesses in their country. Moreover, they relaxed tariff by 3.5% on exported goods like steel. Therefore, healthy understanding between countries will help in developing their economy and learning new skills from their counterparts.",
        "In conclusion, i firmly believe that international marketing should operate in every nation, because it helps in circulating the revenue. Despite, they should be some restrictions where local owners do not loss their income."
