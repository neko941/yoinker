        "In some parts of cultures in different countries of the world, children are often given the message that they can accomplish everything they prefer if they work hard sufficient. In the following paragraphs, both benefits and drawbacks outcomes of this message will be discussed in detail.",
        "The possible advantage of this message is that children can have a great opportunity to be successful more than before depends upon the great effort and intention that they had put into works and life. It can be seen from the newspaper that many famous people, such as Elon Musk told that when he was in an institution, he had studied at least 8 hours per day for the exam. Consequently, nowadays, he has achieved his main goal faster than his classmates and therefore being one of the prime examples for many teenagers.",
        "On the other hand, this message has pressured them too much, and thus lead to the fact that many children these days have stress and cannot release it because they want to accomplish the goal that they have dreamed for, regardless of caring their mental health. Many experts had written through the internet blogs that the proportion of the children that decide to suicide themselves since they do not get what they want, for instance, the perfect grade from the academic test, has dramatically increased in the modern day.",
        "To sum up, even though this culture of telling their children to try hard can be a positive outcome for many youths by their increased chance of accomplishing the goal, but it can be led to the stress problem if they do not take care of themselves."
