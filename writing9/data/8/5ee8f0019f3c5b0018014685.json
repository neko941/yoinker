        "These days, there are different types of relaxation exercise preferred by many individuals. Some argue that choosing mental activities are far better than any other activities. I, however, agree with those who think that physical activities are the best way to keep oneself relax as a person feel energetic.",
        "On the one hand, some believe that mental exercise is good to keep oneself relaxed. This is because, doing monotonous work person gets bored and by playing chess, sudoku and crosswords an individual feels relaxed and rejuvenate their mood. For example, in the recent article by the Times of India in January 2020 found that 35% of people who are engaged with playing such games are more active and fresh than those who are engaged with other physical games, and not only are they smarter, but also their IQ level is better than any other person. However, such mental activities give a chance any individual to put on the weight and become obese, which gives me a valid reason not to agree with such views.",
        "On the other hand, some argue that doing physical exercises is the best way to feel active and relax. To elucidate, many people believe that doing exercise daily for 30 minutes to 1 hour, such as walking, jogging and cycling, keep them fit, active and relax. For example, in India, it is scientifically proved that the person who does walking daily for 1 hour is free from any diseases and remains energetic throughout a day. This results in them doing any work with more energy and more productively. Hence, this gives me a reason to agree with such thought.",
        "In conclusion, while some argued that playing mental games such as, crosswords and chess keeps a person relax, I agree with those who think that doing physical activities, such as, small walk or yoga on a daily basis, the person feels relaxed and active entire a day."
