        "Opinions differ as to whether the best way of getting news is by reading a newspaper or using  media platforms. While newspapers seem to be much more trustworthy I believe other media sources are a better way to get news.",
        "Newspapers are still one of the most popular ways of transferring the news ,especially among senior citizens. On the one ,hand since all newspaper companies are registered and work under some related authorization; their publications tend to be more accurate and truthful which makes them more reliable. Moreover, every piece of news will be checked by professional journalists therefore the quality of the news is also good which will keep the reader satisfied.",
        "On the other hand media platforms like Youtube, Instagram, telegram, etc, are easy to access and usually free. These platforms are most popular with  youngsters because they seem to be adapting better to the developments in technology. With the internet being available all over the world, anyone can have access to various sources and this means that there is a great amount of information going viral every second. More , important since the process of publishing a piece of news on social media takes less time, news spreads faster and it is more likely for someone to hear about an event for the first time in the media than newspaper.",
        "In ,conclusion there are differing views on choosing between newspapers and media platforms for the best way of getting the news. For the reasons mentioned ,above it seems to me that people should adjust to the new and improved ways of news transfer like the media platforms and use them more often."
