        "History plays a vital role to learn things from the past. It is a great source to learn things. Some pupils argue that history has no value meanwhile some others think that it is a necessary thing to learn from our past. In this essay, we will discuss both sides of view and I will share my opinion regarding the given statements and give some relevant examples on this matter.",
        "On the one side, Some communities believe that there is no value in this modern world. Most pupils are not giving preference to  past data due to modern technology. Due to advancements in every field, some communities are not caring about past information. For example, most pupils are using present modern products to be healthier rather than the older methods.",
        "On the other side, Some communities still choose history as their main source to gather data. From the past, we will get more useful information. Even in present days, if modern methods do not work properly then they prefer the past data as their source to get accurate results. For instance, In the process of developing any new technology, most scientists first prefer  past data as their first resource.",
        "To sum up, In my opinion, I believe with the second statement, that it is necessary to learn  things from past history. Past history is the main source to present generations and future generations. Past engenders  develop new technology. In this way, past history will be beneficial in many ways to develop the modern developed world."
