        "It is an irrefutable fact that, in the world of globalisation  lots of people are moving from one nation to another to have a better lifestyle, gain more knowledge and earn more income by working in their field.It is true that country becomes more fascinating for others and progresses faster as compared to other countries when they have diversity in their population.In my opinion, it is important to have a variety of people to have proper growth and development in different fields for a nation. This essay  will  discuss the constructive benefits of migration before reaching a conclusion.",
        "The first and foremost reason to have a mixture of nationalities is that it provides  human resources to the country.Individuals from different parts of the country are provided visa to migrate on the basis of their education, intelligence and skills.This criteria of selecting people provide diligently skilled as well as semi-skilled employees to the country.Moreover,the country also becomes interesting when people are their knowledge and experience from different backgrounds.For instance, In Canada, we can see people from different regions of the world.They share their customs,culture and food with the natives which make the country an interesting place to live.In addition, the immigrants work in various fields where they show their knowledge and experience  which automatically brings constructive outcome for the nation.",
        "The second point worth mentioning is that  it brings economic benefits to the government.It is commonly seen that in countries like Canada and Australia lots of humans migrate from different parts of the world for education.Most of the income comes from migration for these countries.International students are paying taxes and tuition fees in schools and colleges which directly or indirectly goes to the authorities.The government uses this international fee in other departments like the health care system and setting up new infrastructure.So, it is evident that country is having monetary growth by collecting education expenses.",
        "In conclusion, it can be seen the different type of people play their different inevitable roles for the progress of the nation.For a nation to flourish better is important to have a mixture of the community from different parts and background."
