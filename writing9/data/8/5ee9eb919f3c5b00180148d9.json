        "Nowadays, the most of the students would spend more time studying the academic courses.  Although it is the key to career success defined, but I still believe that the learners also benefit from extra-activities along their studies",
        "On the one hand, there are various benefits of complete education despite the fact that it requires so much effort and times. First, be studying those courses hardworking at high school, the students are equipped with the fundamental knowledge to continue their higher education, especially science field. As a result, in order to become an environmental scientist, the students certainly need to acquire the complex knowledge, which required that the students must spend so much effort learning when they are in the  middle of finals. Secondly, academic courses are conditions conductive for graduates to land higher-paying jobs. In fact, the highest-salaried employees are required to have complex understandings of their disciplines, which can only be achieved if they have taken academic subjects.",
        "on the other hand, the allocating time for other activities while the studying has a great deal of benefits. The main benefit, they can refresh after a long period of studying and concentrate on the education easily. For example, by playing the sport, such as basketball or volleyball, which help them to maintain their health and remove the pressure of learning. Furthermore, by participating in the clubs in their school, especially social skill clubs, these clubs will be environments conductive for them to improve the soft skills. For example, the college students could get new relationships and improve the their communication, which are a vital importance of high status in the life.",
        "To conclude, students should not spend all their days on studying their board programs. They should spend their time on extra activities as much as they can because these activities will give them a practical exposure and a better understanding of life."
