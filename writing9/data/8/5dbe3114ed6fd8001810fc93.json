        "Some psychologists mention that the recent increase in violent crimes among adolescents is related to the inadequate psychological and social support provided by parents and teachers. I totally agree with the idea that adolescents require more attention from adults so that they can share any concerns and issues before they present with anti-social behaviours as a means of getting attention from their family and teachers.",
        "As our society is becoming more and more competitive, teachers and parents tend to focus on children's academic achievement, wishing for their success in the future. In other words, less attention is paid to their social and emotional needs, and this leads to negative consequences such as dangerous behaviours and unlawful activities among teenagers. Some students with a high academic performance maybe behave in a violent manner due to the excessive stress from study and their personal lives, while others may engage in violent crimes as their parents and teachers label them as a failure for not meeting their expectations. Thus, adults should pay attention to children's psychosocial needs rather than how well they do at schools.",
        "In addition to the above-mentioned point, most parents are busy at work and less time is spent with their children in these days.  The lack of interaction with close adults gives fewer opportunities to learn basic emotional aspects such as love and affection. For instance, statistics show that children whose parents are absent from home engaged in antisocial behaviours such as smoking cigarettes and alcohol intake more frequently, and they had difficulty in interacting with others with respect. If their parents had more time to spend with their children and teach them basic human skills, the number of violent crimes among young people would not have been as high as now.",
        "In conclusion, academic pressure and parents' increasing work commitments contribute to violent crimes among adolescents; therefore, adequate parental supervision and support are advisable."
