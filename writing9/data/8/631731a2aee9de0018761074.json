These games are increasing influence the masses  as well as sometimes this game becomes the cause of death . To explicate it , all games are not equal . For playing these games there are ample criteria . So if these games are played  without rules so sometimes we injured easily . For example , in the tournament of football in 2005 a gold player that was Ronaldo , he injured in this game by the other player's mistake . Thus , it is a good way to save their lives so lawmakers should ban these games .",
