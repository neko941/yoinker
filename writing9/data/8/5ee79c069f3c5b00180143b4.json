        "Government spending on improving Internet connection often constitutes a large chunk of the national budget, causing some public controversy in recent years. Although some might oppose this idea due to its seemingly high costs, this is among most beneficial ways to spend administration's fund",
        "There are a number of reasons why governments choose to improve Internet access. First, the Internet has been proven to be the most effective and efficient way to connect people, even if they are in different countries. In fact, since the cost of Internet communication is very low, even zero in some areas, both governments and citizens can start to give up landlines, which in turn saves a great deal of money. Second, many countries have recognized the significance of a knowledge economy, which entails constant communication and exchange of ideas. Plenty of evidence suggests that by streamlining the flows of ability, a country\u2019s economy can grow faster as there is a causal relationship between the two indicators.",
        "However, I believe that upgrading the Internet access is the best way to allocate the national and local authorities money. The primary reason is that the broadband connection in most countries is slow today, which could disrupt the nation's development. For example, in Vietnam, hardly do individuals have to wait a long time for a web page to load, therefore an improvement in the quality of the Internet supply can be deemed obligatory and urgent. Furthermore, the budgets that the nation spent on improving internet connection will be returned to the authority's resources through tax payment. The growth of the economy will bring enormous business in the country, so the more tax collection will be expected to come from business and employment. This will enable the government to allocate more funds in the health, education, and infrastructure that will benefit all the members of society. For example, Singapore has been voted in ASEAN as the most livable country in Asia because of its development in technology alongside with other government benefits that everyone is receiving.",
        "In conclusion, improving Internet entry is the best way to spend government money these days. It not only connects people at the lowest cost but also fosters economic growth in a variety of ways."
