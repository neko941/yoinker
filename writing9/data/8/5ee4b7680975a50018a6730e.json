        "It is claimed by some individuals that the government should provide financial and private sectors should provide financial support to the sports player of domestic level. I totally agree with this notion because it helps to provide better facilities to the player and raise awareness among the new generation.",
        "There are many reasons to support the above notion. First of all, sponsoring money to the player to help them buy expensive equipments and other essential tools, which can be used in their training to enhance their game performance. Secondly, financial sport also propel player to show their game worldwide, which may help to improve the reach of their team and the nation. Thirdly, better sports facilities also motivate youngsters to take participate in various games. Hence, interest towards sports abstain them from bad activities. Such as, drugs and criminal activities.",
        "",
        "Furthermore, in the case of women's player, support from regime help them to show women power and a chance to get equality in their society. For example, in Nepal, the government spends huge amount of revenue on women games to provide the equal treat as men as from their society. Last but not least, cooperator sectors can also advertise their brand to stem their sale. For example, according to statics OPPO, a mobile company sponsored IPL every year in India, is improving their sales by 90%.",
        "To conclude- financially support to the player provide them a better type training and spread awareness. I believe this is the better way to boost the economy of a sector."
