In this essay, merits and demerits of buying these products will be discussed in depth.",
        "One of the main advantages of having these instruments is that they allow you to have easy access to heavy flows of information. For instance, if someone is dealing with technical work issues, by having access to the internet through laptop, he can find the best solution or at least communicate with an expert. Distance learning is another great achievement that became possible with the help of well modern devices. Anyone can enrol on a favourable course from any place with less cost.

        "However, buying these instruments may cause serious problems. The most devastating issue that people are having is their lack of privacy. Every gadget consumer is in contact with digital manipulation which can have severe outcomes. Secondly, the  Bad physical condition is another issue which is a result of high time usage of communication gadgets.

I personally think, by making these instruments impenetrable and learning the best mode of their usage, they can be everyone\u2019s best friend."
