All other services, such as education, health and social security, should be provided by private groups or individuals in the community.\n\nTo what extent do you agree or disagree?",

        "Generally, it is the responsibility of the government to deliver all the necessary facilities to the public, because they are elected by the people to serve the nation. However, some groups have a perception that an administration should not only provide roads and water for its citizens but also the other basic facilities. Whereas others have an opposite opinion that education and hospitals must be a contribution from private organisations rather than depending on ministry. I agree with the viewpoint that only council must allocate all the liabilities to the general public.",
        "A government\u2019s duty is to serve the people not only by issuing new railway lines, transportation and construction of water tanks, but also to develop the existing schools, building new schools as well as hospitals. The main reason why authorities should do such activities is because every individual is paying taxes to the state and central authority for their salaries and for the products they buy, then automatically they expect the ministry to carry out these projects. If such duties are performed by the higher authorities then common people will be benefitted more. For example, with the building of government schools in villages and towns, many children are able to acquire a basic education of up to 17 years. Indeed, with this knowledge they will be able to look after their survival and support their family.",
        "The private sectors also play an equal role in developing the society and nation, but still maximum business heads try to make only profits in the works that they are implementing. Moreover, the schools, colleges and hospitals, which are constructed and operated by reputed organizations are demanding a huge amount, for education and health care and the ordinary people cannot afford such high prices, which is the reason for them to rely on the general public amenities. For instance, nowadays the private educational institutions are imposing nearly one lakh rupees for the kindergarten admission, which is equal to the first-year engineering fee.",
        "To conclude, it is better that, the administration takes care of all the benefits which are mandatory for the public, rather than approaching personal establishments."
