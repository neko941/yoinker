        "Learners are becoming ever more dependent on technology, such as the Internet and mobile devices. This essay believes the main dilemma associated with dependence on computers is the lack of original thought and copying original work from others and suggests critical thinking classes and writing analysis programs as the most viable solutions.",
        "The principal complication with over-reliance on technology is people not being able to think for themselves and piracy. With access to so much information, students often rely on other people\u2019s opinions instead of forming their own. As well as this, they often use search engines to answer a question and simply copy the text from a website, rather than thinking about the question. This practice is not only prohibited in schools and universities but also stunts a student\u2019s intellectual development because they will never truly think for themselves, which is what university is supposed to really be for. For example, many teachers complain that students copy web pages straight from Wikipedia word for word rather than giving a reasoned answer to their questions.",
        "Solutions to these worrying problems are special classes to focus on critical thinking and teachers using anti-plagiarism software to detect copying. If teachers create situations where students have to infer meaning and express opinions based on a small amount of information, this will ensure that students have an opportunity to develop these skills. Also, if students know that their assignments are being checked for plagiarism, this will be enough to deter them from doing so. For instance, many universities already use this kind of software to scan coursework for plagiarism and it could be extended to include all homework, by learners in both secondary and tertiary education.",
        "In conclusion, the main problems with the overuse of technology in education are the lack of original thought and plagiarism and these can be solved through special classes that teach students analytical skills and the use of plagiarism detection software."
