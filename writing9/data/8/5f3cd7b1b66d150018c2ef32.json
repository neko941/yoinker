        "To be honest, I thought that I would have enough free time to go out with you. However, as it was a business trip I had to give lectures about a piece of new equipment in our branch office. In addition, the head of the branch asked me to go on a field trip with topographers\u2019 team to provide a demonstration of the equipment work in practice. Actually, I was totally occupied with the training of my colleagues that I even did not have a minute to sit down and relax.",
        "Anyway, I think that we will definitely meet in a couple of weeks because I am coming for my sister's wedding and you are invited as well. Let us meet on 8th September prior to the wedding and go together or if you have other plans I will see you at the celebration.",
