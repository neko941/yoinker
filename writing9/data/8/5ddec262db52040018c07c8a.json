        "Computers have brought an alluring twist in this fast paced world. Despite its many merits, its usage by children is refuted by some people because of its negative consequences.

Similarly, important days like exam, fee paying dates, birthday can also be kept in the reminder application.",
        "Secondly, the computer is a boon to children because of its transcendent features in communication. It enables them to connect them with their peers and faculty instantaneously to clear their doubts.

        "To conclude, Today's children are tomorrow's leaders. So, I accept, the computer in the hands of children will help them to spread their wings and embrace victory in the future."
