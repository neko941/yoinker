        "Despite developments in the agriculture sector, there still are people worldwide that suffer from hunger. This essay will explain the reasons for this issue and will underline some solutions to tackle this problem.",
        "On one hand, the difference between rich and poor people is very marked and known. Developed countries have control of the economy and the movement of money. In this way, where the economy can develop and increase, there is money that goes around. Agriculture is a basic need for people to eat and in wealthy places, it is possible to find food and even different kinds of it. Instead, people that live in poor places go hungry because they do not have enough money to buy them food and as a consequence, it is also hard to find it or it is very expensive. For example, it is common to see African citizens suffer from hunger because they do not have enough money to afford this necessity.",
        "On the other hand, many things could be done to tackle this problem. First of all, people should waste less food in the places where eating is affordable. Generally, everyone should consume less. This can help organisations and nations to distribute the food better, even for the people that can not sustain their lives. For instance, governments should co-operate and establish rules with which they can provide food for everyone, giving everybody the possibility to eat daily and sufficiently .",
        "In conclusion, while there are still many people that suffer from hunger, and this is because agriculture and food, in general, follow the economy, there are many ways to reduce, at least, world hunger, one of the main problems of these times. Governments should be more active in this issue and set rules that will include poorer people."
