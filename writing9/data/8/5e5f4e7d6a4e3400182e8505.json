        "How are you doing? I\u2019m writing to thank you for checking up on me and to give you details with regards the Coronavirus disease epidemic in Nigeria.",
        "Let me explain our situation in more detail! About a week ago, a confirmed case of the disease was confirmed in Nigeria. Although the individual has been quarantined, there has been uproar in the country and this is not unexpected, as many citizens doubt the government\u2019s ability to contain such a deadly virus.  Some people fear that the outbreak that will wipe us out has finally landed on our shores, while some think the government is capable based on their Ebola virus experience.",
        "The world is definitely interested as to how Nigeria will handle this because platforms all over the world has described the country\u2019s handling of the Ebola epidemic as top-notch. So far, no case has been confirmed in my city, but that has not put me at ease. Recently, I\u2019ve stopped going to work neither do I go to big gatherings. Hopefully, the government and infection agencies will control it soon enough so we can go back to living life to the fullest.",
