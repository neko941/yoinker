        "In some countries, there is a tiny number of people that has a huge amount of wage. It has been argued that this occurrence is favourable to the country, whilst others say that it can not be beyond a certain number. This essay agrees that it is good for the nations, therefore, it will discuss both views.",
        "The first perspective is high income can have benefits to  society. Firstly, it is a form of appreciations for dedications and hard working. Many professionals, as we have known, work beyond their working-hours just to finish their task in time. For example, RnD teams are working longer than any department because they are the companies' heart. Without them, there are no new products in markets. Therefore, it is understandable that they get more money than others. This can be used as a way to give an award to those people. Secondly, this incentive can be used as a motivation for others in the same field. It is aimed to encourage people to become more productive.",
        "However, some believe that there must be a maximum limit for people's incomes. This, because a higher salary can cause envious to colleagues. This is supported by the fact that many people dream to be rich, so, when their friend has more money than they have, it drives an envy feeling. What's more, it can cause criminals. For instance, since they know that their colleague has a higher salary than they do and they realise they can not earn it. It is very common for people to commit a robbery to get that money. Furthermore, it can increase the criminality rate that would be a new government's problem.",
        "In conclusion, although, it is true that higher-income may cause envious and criminals, many hard-working people are also needed some appreciations of their contribution at work in the form of money. Hence, it is not necessary for government to set the maximum limit for wages."
