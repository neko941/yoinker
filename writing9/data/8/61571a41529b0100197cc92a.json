        "These days, shopping has become increasingly popular among people. Many people believe that more than anything, age demographic is the indicator of what people buy. In my opinion, although age is an interesting element, social class is the more significant determinant of shopping habits.",
        "To commence with, I agree with the fact that age has a big influence on what you buy when shopping. While people who are born in the digital era spend more money on computers and mobiles and their relative accessories, people who belong to the less modern ages spend more money on books. Also, the way they shop may vary due to age. For instance, a 20-year-old person may search the internet for online shops and buy everything there as it is more convenient and less time-consuming for them, while their 80-year-old grandma goes to shops personally to experience the material and make sure of size and colour.",
        "On the other hand, in my opinion, the primary indicator of shopping habits is a person's wealth. If someone is a first-class citizen, they can buy top-notch brands and even more things than someone who has a minimum wage. For example, if a wealthy person wants a bag, they can choose from different brands like Prada and Versace, while people with lower income have fewer options and maybe lower quality materials to choose from. And this is accurate for all ages, despite being old or young people shopping habits vary depending on their salary.",
        "In conclusion, despite the apparent difference in a person's shopping habit generation to generation, financial stability influences individuals shopping dramatically. I believe that both age and wealth should be under consideration when speaking of shopping habits."
