        "However, undoubtedly, there are few negative points even in online shopping. for example, we cannot have a physical touch feeling while we are buying  online and moreover everything is happening only on just assumption basis which may not work all the times. On the other hand, there are many possibilities to have fraudulent trading\u2019s during  online shopping. As per  recent Google survey findings,  online shopping complaints are increasing especially during  festival times.",
