        "The global environment is detrimental at an alarming rate in this contemporary world. The majority of people feel that it is an utmost priority to safeguard nature, but no one comes forward to do it. In this essay, I will discuss the important reason behind this phenomenon and the possible actions that an individual can initiate to save  mother nature.",
        "On one hand, a lot of members of society would be ready to speak on the importance of nature protection, however, when the practical situation comes regarding contribution they would take a step back. To be more precise, every individual feels that the community surroundings protection is the government's responsibility. The litter spread on roads, for instance, will not be cleared by any citizen, moreover, they feel the whole responsibility lies on the government. These behaviours have caused greater damage to the environment in the form of water, land & air pollutions respectively. Everyone's contribution to saving  nature is the need of the hour absolutely.",
        "On the other hand, there are several actions that can be initiated by every responsible person. The primary one being, banning plastic usage across nations to save water and land contamination. Due to the non-degradable nature of plastic, for example, all rain bodies are polluted to cause the extinction of aquatic animals. Adding to this, encouraging  green energy production and utilization helps to reduce  fossil-fuel consumptions substantially. If the rooftop of every house is installed with  solar energy panels which are available at a subsidised rate, for example, will eventually reduce water and coal consumption that is used to generate the electricity.",
        "To conclude, while the majority of society members feel that  nature protection is the utmost important aspect at any point in time, no one makes any efforts to participate. I think the important reason for this cause is the accountability of citizens. However, there are remedial actions like plastic usage control and an increase in greenhouse energies production that will save the environment from  global warming."
