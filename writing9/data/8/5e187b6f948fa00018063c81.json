        "In a modern world, people likely to quit their jobs and create their own business. This essay will examine the reasons that people leave their works and the possible disadvantages of being self-employed.",
        "Firstly, the most important cause of individual's quitting their jobs is job dissatisfaction. In a time, myriads of people worldwide got bored with their jobs and became unmotivated to do their job requirements. For example, conflicts with the manager, cruel and competitive work environment are the effects that create this situation. Moreover, the second reason for job dissatisfaction is hope. People tend to dream about having a high income from their own business and live in prosperity, in consequence, put trust in themselves and step into adventure.",
        "However, there might be severe disadvantages for these brave people, which are hard to compete with huge companies and sharp results in case of failure. Wealthy firms such as holdings have much more extensive budget and experience compared to adventurous individuals. These holdings succeed to operate in low costs and increase their profit margins within decades. Furthermore, if business going somewhat unwell, the individuals might face with pressing consequences. For instance, an individual who is unable to pay the debts of his/her company might step on the court and sentenced to prison, or he/she be homeless.",
        "To conclude, the leading reason that people give up their old-work is job dissatisfaction, and the possible causes that contribute to the growth of this problem are conflicts with the manager, harsh work environment, and hope. Then, the potential negative outcomes of this situation are hard to compete with high-budget companies and severe results."
