        "The computer is the most useful technology the human race has invented. Computer technology is used in numerous fields such as health, military, communication,  science, and education as well. \u0130t has numerous benefits for communities. Although some believe damages are more, I fiercely consider that it has plenty of advantages.",
        "The computer is an inseparable widget of the modern age as societies use that invention in  every field even education. Therefore, there are many advantages to people's activities. To begin with, data storage can be very simple. As we know computers are able to store terabytes of  data. Second,  computer technology can provide a universal connection to the lecturer. To illustrate, information can be shared with  other students through computers. Additionally, tutors can prepare and introduce tutorials more easily. Moreover, Students have a chance to easily take notes and  do homework. Further, papers can be saved with the help of computers. For instance, a teacher or a pupil has the advantage to create assignments with the help of the computer and save time.",
        "On the other hand, an eminent part of  society considers that overusing computers causes   numerous problems like health problems. First, according to  scientific articles, more using computers can lead to  eye problems, anxiety and other complications. For instance, computers spread radioactive light which has a negative impact on the eyes.  Second, it also imposes people's feelings and creates anxiety. Finally, it helps to create a lazy community that cannot do duties without the help of the computer.",
        "\u0130n conclusion, the computer is an indispensable part of our normal life. The thought of doing work without computers is pointless. I consider that society cannot avoid using computers, but they can  use them for a limited time."
