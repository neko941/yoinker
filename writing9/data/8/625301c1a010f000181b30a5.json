        "It is stated that geometry is a key to a successful business. While I agree that one of the most integral parts of conducting a successful business is a good command of this discipline, I would also argue that great business accomplishments do not revolve exclusively around this.",
        "There are various reasons why calculus represents a cornerstone in the business field. First of all, to become proficient in basic arithmetic is to make an initial step to financial literacy. By learning to manipulate digits and making the right calculations not only can we keep our books in order, but also avoid unnecessary expenditure and ensure proper budget planning. Moreover, as time is synonymous with money in business, those with excellent math skills would be able to make high-quality decisions instantly not based on their instincts, but on exact figures. Finally, the more competent trade people are in the calculation, the more successful they are able to charge raw numbers in reports and statistics into market expansion and revenue.",
        "Nonetheless, the role of the other similarly significant components of doing a flourishing trade needs to be acknowledged too. One of the prominent examples of this is a visionary mindset. Most successful field founders are frequently those capable of thinking ahead of their time and those who invest their knowledge and time in a groundbreaking idea rather than another average project profitable from a financial perspective. Next would be leadership skills and emotional intelligence. No matter how disappointing an employment owner's mathematical knowledge may be, it can still result in success, should this person gather, manage and lead well those who are competent in domains including, but not limited to finances,",
        "To conclude, although algebra is indeed essential in the work world, we should not undermine the importance of the rest of the factors mentioned above."
