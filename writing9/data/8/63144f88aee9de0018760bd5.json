        "Dear Sir/Madam,",
        "I am writing this letter to express my infuriation regarding the swimming  pool's cleanliness, hygiene qualities and timing constraints. I am a regular customer of your pool for the last 7 years and I have never encountered such problems. But, Now as the situation is different and I would like to elucidate the copious motives in the forthcoming paragraphs.",
        "To begin with, the first notion, Recently, I noticed there is a huge amount of dust particles, green leaves and mud stuff got accumulated inside the tank. In addition to this, the colour of the water turned  yellow  instead of sky blue. Furthermore, staff members are not following timings and they are irregular. It causes a lot of issues as we need to wait for them. I immediately brought my concern to staff notice, they  registered a ticket and conveyed that, it will be tracked on high priority and the issue will be sorted out as early as possible.",
        "On the other hand, I would like to suggest that it is a good idea to cover the pool area with mats when it is no longer in use. for instance, in the recent reports, The Canadian government imposed robust strategies in prioritising the importance of cleanliness, health and hygienic conditions mainly in the sports activities like swimming, football and rugby. However, I recommend, that every individual should feel responsible and accountable to keep the bath premises clean.",
        "Please do let me know if my request is possible. should you have any concerns or further clarifications, please do not hesitate to call on my mobile. Looking forward to hearing from you soon.",
        "Yours Sincerely,",
        "Ram."
