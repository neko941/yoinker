        "People hold different views as to if being blissful in life depends upon a person or it is influenced by some external factors. In my opinion, I completely agree with the latter view.",
        "On the one hand, some people believe that emotions can be controlled by an individual, and thus remains unaffected by outer environment. This is because of living an ascetic life and having a minimalistic approach towards it. For example, a renowned businessman, in the United States, living in a small apartment owning only four pairs of clothes and two shoes. The reason is to not attach its emotions with material things and choose to be self-content in life. Moreover, such people often rely on meditation, which is proved to be helpful in controlling the emotions of an individual. This shows that adopting a simple way of living and performing some breathing exercises, a person can control its happiness.",
        "On the other hand, I believe that with globalisation and improved standard of living the happiness of a person may be affected by external factors like earning wealth, having possession or achieving fame. In the contemporary era, a human needs and emotions have been evolved and are attached with some factors. This may be to accomplish something in life or possessing some valuable things; hence, emotions are relied on chasing their dreams. For instance, according to a survey published by Stanford University, in the UK, concluded that 84% of people accepted that they remain unsatisfied unless they achieve their dreams. Furthermore, is it also evident on a child that unless it is provided with the desired things such as a toy or a video game, it remains unhappy.",
        "In conclusion, although there are few instances where people have control on their emotions, largely it depends upon some external factors."
