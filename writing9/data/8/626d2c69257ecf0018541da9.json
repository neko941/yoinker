Hence, they gain weight rapidly. Moreover, people eat junk food such as pizza, burgers and so on because street food is very tasty and convenient they enjoy this type of food very much as compared to House food. Fast food contains more calories and fat which is unhealthy for people. For example, according to a survey by the World Health Organisation ,people prefer fast food more than house food. People who eat fast foods are usually overweight this type of food is the main cause of overweight while house foodstuff is very good for health",
        "On the other hand, the effects of this trend, overweight people are usually unhealthy and surrounded by critical diseases which are very harmful to their health they have to take many types of tablets to get rid of these diseases.
