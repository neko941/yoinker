        "Dear Meena,",
        "I am writing this letter to brief you about the annual conference of epidemiologists which the company sponsored me to attend in Hobart, Australia as part of capacity building.  The seminar was a great avenue for me to learn about the recent medical diagnostic equipment maintenance  like CT-scab   . For instance, I can convincingly repair the damaged and abandoned equipment in the company store that has been devoid of all mechanical intervention in the past. In addition, I am so grateful for the rare opportunity to learn from  capable resource persons.",
        "However, I will also use this medium to express my grave displeasure about the state of the facilities provided by the hotel you booked for me. The air conditioner was so noisy that I cannot even have a sound sleep as a result of the disturbance and  the shower is faulty, although the staffs were so courteous.",
        "Subsequently , I want you to compensate me for the bad experience by relocating me to the five stars hotel near the conference centre and furthermore, stop booking hotels with poor facilities for such an important conference. Hence, I hope this letter will be treated with urgent attention needed and lastly, thanks for your anticipated cooperation.",
        "Yours Sincerely,",
