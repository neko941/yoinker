        "While some people think that the best way to hire new employees for a company is an interview, others believe that there are some ways that are better. I will discuss both of these views and give my thoughts.",
        "To begin with, an interview has been used for many years when many companies want to find new employees. Some people think it is the best way possible. Additionally, it is also simple, does not take too much time, can be even less than an hour per candidate. Despite its simplicity, there are some drawbacks as well. For instance, many companies nowadays, especially in Thailand, just gather candidates\u2019 information from their resumes. By this, some people can make up their profile to look good, so they can get hired by the company they want, hence a company may not get the best employees by only interviewing.",
        "On the other hand, some individuals argue that if employers want the best from their employees, there are better ways to do so and I agree. As far as I\u2019m concerned, an interview might not be the best way to hire the right person for the job, some jobs may require more abilities than others, such as programming. Instead of interviewing, candidates should be given tasks to complete, which like what they have to do at the workplace, whoever can handle the task better will get the job. This might be one example, where the company should not rely only on traditional hiring methods.",
        "In conclusion, even though having interviews has been used to hire employees for decades and some people have been thinking that it is the most suitable for every job hiring process, there are other ways that might be better for some jobs as well. Executing a given task, for example, is one thing that can be done."
