        "I hope, you're well and everything's going OK. In your letter you ask for my advice about the course I took last year at Istanbul University. You explained you should decide within 3 weeks according to my suggestion.",
        "You know that I'm an agronomist so I attended this course for my career. This course encourages you to attend to the lands where the people grow the crops. The students have visited the surrounding areas 60% of the time.",
        "I highly recommend this course because it not only has research labs but also the best lecturers. Although it lacks the teaching material, you'll find it useful.",
        "However, applying to the course can be tricky since it has few steps. First of all, you should apply online and then attend one or two exams. If you pass these proficiency tests, they allow you to go forward and you should request the reference letters from your old teachers. If you've any questions, please don't hesitate.",
        "I look forward to hearing good news from you as soon as possible.",
        "Best regards,",
