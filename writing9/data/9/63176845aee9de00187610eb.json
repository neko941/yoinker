        "In the modern era, enormous people from the countryside have increasingly immigrated to urban areas, which is a concern in numerous underdeveloped countries across the world. In this essay, the causes of huge immigration and the adverse effect on  humanity will be presented before my conclusion is reached.",
        "The first reason that leads people to move into the big cities is a better opportunity. There are more available jobs, which provide a high salary compared to rural zones. For example, a fresh graduate can work as a receptionist in hotels, an officer in prestigious companies, a teacher in schools, and so on, but it is very difficult to find these types of careers in remote areas. Furthermore, the capital city has  better infrastructures including shopping malls, schools, universities, hospitals, cinemas,  etc., which facilitate citizens to have better well-being. These two main reasons encourage individuals to move to  urban zones.",
        "Despite career advancement and better livelihood,  urbanization has disastrous effects on individuals. To begin, overpopulation in the capital city can contribute to anxiety and depression among citizens due to  traffic congestion. To illustrate, living in Bangkok, Thailand, the highest rate of traffic jams city in the world, I have to spend more than an hour on the road every day  commuting, which makes me  stressed and bored. Moreover, pollution attributed to  urbanization can trigger related health problems. Residents living in  urban are prone to various illnesses such as asthma, migraine, and so on because they are surrounded by smoke released by cars and buses.",
        "In conclusion, urban immigration is the predominant concern for all countries worldwide. the main cause of the problems is that people seek   better careers and well-being in life. Eventually, mental and physical health problems become the detrimentrious effects of  urbanization."
