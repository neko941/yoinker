        "I had a lovely time with you all in the company.I can never forget those initial days when I was finding it hard to settle and adjust to the climate, and food.Furthermore,it was all thanks to you that I was able to overcome homesickness.I doubt I can find such a pleasant working atmosphere   in my hometown.I will always miss you and hope that you can give me an opportunity to host you when you visit India.",
