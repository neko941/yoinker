        "I am writing this letter to draw your attention to the food served in your hotel. Our company had an all-day meeting last Saturday and the largest conference room was rented. There was a survey among participants and people loved staying at your hotel for several reasons. First of all, the people who participated in the meeting were pleased with the spacious rooms. Additionally, the stunning vista from the majority of rooms was an edge over other hotels. Also, many pointed out the high level of service and hospitable personnel who were eager to aid in any circumstances.",
        "Nonetheless, myriad participants called for an action towards the food served. On that day seafood was not fresh enough and some could smell a foul odour near mussels. Moreover, the restaurant turned out to be overcrowded posing an inconvenience to members participating. They had to queue for a long time and were tardy to an afternoon part of the meeting.",
        "Our company is planning to host some more meetings and I would appreciate your immediate attention to this matter in order to iron out the aforementioned issues with food.",
        "Yours faithfully,",
