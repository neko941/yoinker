        "While one group thinks that watching movies on their own digital device is able to replace cinema, others argue that cinema is more enjoyable. I personally feel that going to a cinema would be more exciting and fulfilling.",
        "To begin with the latter's point of view, they may probably enjoy going in a public where various people are interested in the same movie and watching it together. More audience can be even more fascinating and enjoyable because each person's reaction can be seen. In addition, good time spent with friends or family can be used wisely. For example, going to a cinema with new friends is considered a wonderful starter of a relationship. Furthermore, the majority of movies shown in cinema are new and renowned, unlike the outdated movie that is available online and is shown freely in public.",
        "On the other hand, own device such as a smartphone or computer is more convenient in terms of location and cost because they are able to see any film on their own without going to other places. The former group can be viewed as cost-saving where they just reduce unnecessary activities out of their daily life. However, from my perspective, I disagree with this because the way of this convenience is a negative habit that can directly affect their physical health, which is eyesight. Compared to the size of the cinema's screen, this kind of device is extremely small. As small as it gets, the worse eye damage's individual can receive.",
        "In conclusion, the former group's view is about convenience in terms of location and cast. In contrast, the latter may consider mental factors like joyousness and friendship. From my experience, I would say that I enjoy seeing movies shown in a cinema rather than on a device screen because of the reasons I have mentioned previously."
