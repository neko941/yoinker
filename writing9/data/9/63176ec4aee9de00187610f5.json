        "I'm so glad to know that you are planning to spend your summer vacation at a campsite, this would be amazing for an introvert like you.",
        "You are going to have a lot of fun there. I know it's your first time but think about making so many new friends during the trip. Some of them will definitely continue to be friends with you even after the trip, same as my two friends John and Phil. Also, consider living in tents, it is an amazing experience. Those are nothing like usual houses, it's open and very near to nature. However, there are a few things I must warn you about before your trip. Since it is summertime, expect insects around so must carry a repellent cream or a spray for your safety. Although tents are a great place to stay, there is a disadvantage as well like one common washroom. Hygiene is really a challenge there but it is still manageable.",
        "As I think about it, I feel I could join you for the camping trip. Wouldn't it be great if both of us are together! Let's do this.",
