        "Dear Sean,",
        "Thank you so much for the invitation and I`m already excited about the trip. I booked the tickets yesterday and I`ll be landing there on 14th May at 4:00 am. Although I started packing things up, I`m quite struggling to figure out what I`m supposed to bring and what not . Hope you can help me with this.",
        "Firstly, I need to buy gifts for your parents. I heard your father likes Nike t-shirts but I have no clue about his collar size. In addition, I need to buy a gift for your mom too. I was thinking of buying a perfume hence you could tell the brand she prefers the most.",
        "Secondly, what types of clothes I should bring? If we are planning to do some activities, for ,example fishing in the Mara lake, I guess I need to pack at least four swimming shorts. Are we planning to go on bicycle rides as well ?",
        "Finally, I would like to know about the food. I heard people in Denmark love to eat meat, however, I`m allergic to all types of red meat and milk. Do you think I can buy Salmon from a grocery shop nearby to your house ?",
