        "It is often argued that making primary schooling  free can be  fundamental to  guaranteeing everyone accesses to education . Some people believe that it can be considered an effective  solution to poverty. In my opinion, I completely agree with this view and think that free schooling is the best way to fight poverty.",
        "Firstly, Government should make elementary studies free of charge because it can help students  not abandoning school and then become  positive and productive members of  society . There are plenty of families  in developing nations that cannot fully afford to send their children to school. Consequently, these students  will be forced to abandon their studies and be exposed to be unemployed and in some cases criminals in order to earn money to afford their living . For example , researches show that nations in which the level of unemployment is higher suffer more from economic problems . That is why this method can be a useful solution to this issue .",
        "Secondly, primary learning helps children to develop several skills and abilities. In other words, education will help individuals to grow because they will obtain a better understanding of life and get more knowledge and skills . therefore , pupils  will gain financial stability  in the future because they may have the possibility to land a good job and a high paying salary.",
        "In conclusion , I strongly believe that making elementary free of charge can offer a long term solution to the country's economy because it may reduce the problem of abandoning schools   and  helps  children to develop  skills and abilities ."
