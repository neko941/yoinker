        "Unemployment is becoming a major problem mainly in developing countries. By in large, youth is struggling with the lack of job opportunities. The following paragraphs will examine the cause of this issue which is of paramount importance and recommend some solutions.",
        "There are numerous causes of minute job vacancies in poor countries. Firstly, if a country is undergoing a financial crisis on a big scale, it would definitely result in the declination of employment offers. For example, for over a decade, some Asian countries remained unsuccessful in providing a way to earn for their fresh graduates. Moreover, individuals migrated to developed countries for the sake of better work facilities. Secondly, a low literacy rate can play a role in a huge percentage of unemployed mankind. It would be unwise to ignore the educational aspects which are directly proportional to the rate of employment.",
        "On the other hand, it is crucial time to control this unpleasant matter. To tackle this problem, there are several things to be done on both the government and the public level. Initially, the government must pay special attention to making education affordable for the common man. Also, it would increase the figure of literate citizens. Additionally, jobless but educated groups of people must opt to learn technical, labour and other required skills as per need. For instance, instead of relying upon nine to five jobs, they must be encouraged to start earning through some sort of private business.",
        "In the nutshell, unemployment is an acute issue because it gives rise to hunger and poverty. Even may lead to an increase in the death rates as well. The serious attitude of both the government and the public to address it is the anterior solvent. Even though the challenge is improbable to be entirely eradicated in a short span of time there should be concrete measures to mitigate the detrimental effects it is having on the nation as a whole."
