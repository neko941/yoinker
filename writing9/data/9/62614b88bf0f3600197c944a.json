        "I think that I would be a suitable candidate to employ as previously I used to work at a nursing home for children. Hence, I am just not aware of what diet should be given to the child but also know how to handle the situation in  case of emergency.",
        "In my leisure time, I would like to explore Australia as it is known as a scenic country with many adventurous places such as beaches and hill stations.",
        "Please feel free to contact me if you need more details. I really hope that you would consider me for the offered job in view of my past experience.",
