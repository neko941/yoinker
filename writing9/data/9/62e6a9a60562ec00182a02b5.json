        "Hence, we would like to invite you to contribute your valuable thoughts and suggestion. Having said that, we are looking for availability to conduct this meeting and please do not hesitate to call us on provided numbers if any additional information is required.",
        "I look forward to hearing your response with your calendar availability and hope it will come soon.",
