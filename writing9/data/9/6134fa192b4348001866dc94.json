        "It is thought by people that one of the most vital contributors to happiness is money. In this essay, I will be discussing the reasons why I believe people can achieve it without having much money as well as other contributing factors to being happy.",
        "There are others who can achieve contentment without having a great sum of money. Primarily because there are some products that can be bought at a lesser value. For example, the Philippines is considered a developing country wherein there are numerous open-air markets that offer second-hand appliances. Filipinos tend to purchase such belongings in these areas. Consequently, they become contented because they bought items that serve the same purpose at a cheaper price as compared to those offered in shopping malls.",
        "In addition, there are other contributors that can make individuals happy. To begin with, a strong support system can develop this. A young boy who experiences hardships at home, for instance, has friends in school who support and love him unconditionally. As a result, he feels content and can achieve a more positive outlook in life. Another is the work of a person. If a doctor saved a life of a patient, he or she will feel fulfilled. This is because some individuals feel rewarded by gratitude given to them.",
        "To conclude, there are believers that money is one of the most important aspects of being happy. People can achieve happiness even with just a little amount of money because there are things that can be bought inexpensively. Additionally, satisfaction can come not only from the right people but also from a rewarding job."
