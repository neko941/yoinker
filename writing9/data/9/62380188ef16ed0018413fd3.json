        "I am writing this letter to bring your attention to the malfunctioning of the laptop I bought from your shop two months ago.Actually, it worked smoothly for one month but then it started having battery problems. The laptop does not get charged 100% and is having short- battery life.",
        "It has created a lot of issues for me.Firstly, it suddenly gets power off deleting all my unsaved files. There is a waste of a lot of time in making those files again. Moreover, I have to attend online classes and sudden shutting down interrupts my lessons. Sometimes, I miss a few important points which result in a poor understanding of the topic.",
        "I would appreciate it if you send one of your employees to check my laptop and solve my problem. Further, I hope you will handle any kind of trouble in its functioning as it is under warranty.",
        "I will be thankful to you.",
        "Best Regards,",
