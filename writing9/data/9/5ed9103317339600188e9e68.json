        "Dear Mr Reynold,",
        "I would like to thank you for allowing me to join the month-long training programme that you will be organising. Anyway, I am writing this letter to express my interest to become the social events\u2019 organizer on how to show cultural sensitivity at work as one of the participants in your training programme.",
        "In the past, I have volunteered in different social events like organizing a picnic for a huge number of students at my junior college, throwing a welcome party for my company boss after closing a very successful business deal abroad, and organizing a Christmas party for the local community members in my area. I have even helped organize a fundraising event for a local political campaign in my town.",
        "So, it is fair to suggest that I do know a few things about organizing social events. By the way, I would like to get some additional information on the events, such as what kinds of guests are expected at the events and how large would be the gathering. I will await your response.",
        "Yours sincerely,",
