        "I am interested to work in the museum because I think that I could enrich my knowledge about ancient objects on which I am planning to do a project for my final year.  In addition, I noticed that it is a part-time position and I still need some time to prepare for my studies.",
        "Moreover, when I was in high school, I had an opportunity to work as a volunteer in a local museum where I assisted in arranging the objects on display and answering the phone calls. I believe I have relevant experience to work in this position.",
