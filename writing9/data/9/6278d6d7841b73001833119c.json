        "I am writing this letter to share the experience all participants had during an all-day meeting which I arranged for my company at your hotel. We conducted a feedback survey in order to know the experience participants had, we found that they all loved the hotel. However, they expressed their dissatisfaction with the food served during the meeting.",
        "All attendees had a great experience. They admired the courteous behaviour of your staff. In addition, they praised the cleanliness of the hotel, especially of restrooms.",
        "Sadly, most of the participants were disappointed by the food quality because they found it way more spicy and oily. Some of them even experienced respiratory problems after having  lunch. Moreover, they told that vegetarian options were not enough.",
        "I would like to suggest improving the quality of food by adding more varieties related to vegetarian dishes. Besides, the spiciness of food can be kept at a minimum level and customised as per the customer's need.",
        "Thanks in advance for your support.",
