On that day, I have an appointment with my personal doctor to check up on my health that it have fixed 2 months ago. I fully understand how important this party means to you. I should have informed you about this matter, and I wish I had known about this incident earlier. For next time, I will postpone all appointments for you that you can assure. Please forgive me this time.",
