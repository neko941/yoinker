        "Firstly, your workers could not be recognized due to their various casual clothes. As well as, racks arrangements are not good because foods and vegetables were in the same racks. Additionally, I had to wait half an hour to pay my bill due to the number of cashier counters are not sufficient.",
        "Most staff members were not helpful and  friendly. They do not know, how to treat their customers attractively. Furthermore, few staff members were in dirty clothes and their appearance was not better.",
        "Kindly, I suggest you, if provide appropriate uniform and shoes to your workers, customers can easily recognize and it might be well their appearance. On the other hand, if you can arrange racks in  an appropriate manner, consumers can choose their needs quickly. As well as, increase the number of cashier counters. Then consumers can go out quickly otherwise they will be fed up at cashier counters.",
