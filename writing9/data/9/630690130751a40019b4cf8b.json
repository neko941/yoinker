        "I was so happy when I heard that you wanted to visit the Netherlands, I think I can show you around when you come when I don't need to work. We can work it this way : you arrange your stay in Amsterdam on Saturday and Sunday and visit the other cities on other days.",
        "I would suggest you  book a hotel without a kitchen in zone 4. The price is more affordable there yet transportation is reasonably convenient . Please be reminded a hotel room with a kitchen is much more expensive and not worth the price, there are no tourist spots around there and we are not likely to use the kitchen anyway.",
        "The best months to visit Amsterdam are May, June, September and October. The hotels are still not charging peak rates yet and the queues everywhere are not that long. On the other hand, the daytime is long enough and it doesn't rain too frequently.",
        "I am looking forward to hearing your plans. I just can't wait to show you the beautiful windmills and canals.",
        "Best wishes,",
