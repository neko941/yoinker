        "This is to inform you about a problem that I faced during reading one of the articles in your last issue. Although it might look like a minor mistake, it would affect your reputation since I know other friends from my region who read your magazine. Let me explain more about it.",
        "The problem is relevant to one of your articles about nationalities who live in middle-east. Even though you explain all regions properly with their language and their origin, it seems you made a few mistakes regarding Iranian nationality. Despite the fact that Iran is placed among various nationalities such as Turk, Arab and Balouch people, the majority of Iranians speak Persian or Farsi. However, your writer denoted that the language of the region is Arabic which is right partially but not generally.",
        "As a result, I would like to bring your attention to this mistake and ask you to correct the article in the next issue. Also, you may need to employ a person from the region who can proofread the contents before being published.",
        "Thanks for your time and consideration.",
