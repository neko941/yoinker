        "Some people believe that alternative means of transportation should be endorsed and global law should be imposed on car ownership and use. However, in my opinion, to heal the environment, and to reduce toxicity in the atmosphere, various ways of public transport should be adopted. In this essay, I will propose possible examples for the same.",
        "First of all, the number of vehicles has increased since the 19th century, which means the daily life became much easier than before. The most used type of transport is cars which make cities more crowded, especially in the countries' capital. In addition, cars cause pollution by releasing dust due to fuel usage. Although cars save much time during travelling or going to work, they need much amount of Oil which will be finished one day from the whole world. Moreover, in the future, if the fuel finish, at that moment human beings will need another transportation type such as solar cars, but in this case, the size of the car will be smaller.",
        "",
        "On the other hand, It is necessary for governments to find other alternatives for vehicles. For instance, the Japanese government encouraged people to alternate cars with metro and bicycles few years ago. Besides, I think governments should promote taxes on car owners and increase these taxes as long as the number of vehicles increases. They can encourage them to reduce utilizing vehicles by providing them with free bikes or giving them honours.",
        "In conclusion, governments should motivate people with many ways to reduce having vehicles due to traffic jam and pollution. And It is important to find alternative transport and release awareness among people that reducing cars is needed."
