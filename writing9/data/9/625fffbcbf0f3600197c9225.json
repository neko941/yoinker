        "How have you been? I hope this letter finds you well. I've just received an envelope containing all the pictures of our holidays and I absolutely fell in love with them. They took me back to our vacation time in Australia.",
        "First of all, I wanted to thank you for all the photos as well as for providing me with great hospitality in your home. I had a wonderful stay with both of you and couldn't ask more. I really loved all the scenic adventures including beaches and hill stations, particularly the live city called Sydney where we enjoyed the live performance of Swift Taylor.",
        "Secondly, I wanted to apologise for not writing before. Although I wanted to but couldn't because as soon as I landed here back in India, my mother fell sick. Since then we've been running around looking after her. However, the good news is that she is recovering pretty well and will be fine very soon.",
        "Next month, we will be celebrating our anniversary. I'd be delighted if you could come over and stay with us. Besides, you'll also get a chance to meet my family and see a bit of India, especially its rich culture. I hope you could make it.",
        "Take care and hope to see you soon.",
