        "Dear Sir,",
        "I am writing this to express my dissatisfaction with the new shopping centre I have seen on the internet last week on the news. com, that is planned to be built around the Livia Lout's Complex in Nevada, where I currently dwell.",
        "As I have a 5-member family, where all present some difficulties, I am afraid this construction might not be a good idea for a few reasons. First of all, it seems to me that the disabled population living in the.is location was not considered. I furthermore believe that the city will be losing plenty of green areas, as the principal park situated a few km from the shopping centre's future location. Moreover, some species may have their habits ruined owing to this plan. I thereby feel concerned with how the citizens will handle the development of this in Nevada, and its side effects both in the short and long term.",
        "I would appreciate obtaining any additional information concerning this project, especially the city's government position in relation to its involved costs, besides the situation of local parks in the city. In addition, I might also be aware of what's the plan we might expect so that household residents not  be affected by continual noise when this place is finished.",
        "Yours sincerely.",
