        "Dear Mr Smith,",
        "I am writing to you regarding a potential job you have in one of your restaurants. My name is Bishoy, I was sitting next to you on the flight that was heading to Perth, Australia from Ontario, Canada on the 7th of July. We discussed your new restaurant in Ontario, which will be specialized in Chinese cuisine, and you asked me to contact you to discuss a job offer.",
        "I would like to work as a cooker in your new restaurant. I am relocating to Ontario from Australia with my wife and my child. I believe that my qualifications and experience would be of great benefit to your business.",
        "I have a vocational certificate in Chinese cuisine from Perth General college. I spent 5 years in China working as an assistant cooker in a fine restaurant in Bejing. After that, I opened my restaurant when I went back to Australia and I have been working in it since then. I hope you could arrange a specific timing to further discuss my qualifications.",
