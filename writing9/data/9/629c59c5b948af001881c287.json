        "How are you? We haven't seen each other for a while now. I entirely miss you! I'm writing to tell you that I've just moved to a new home, so I'd like to invite you to visit me in my new place.",
        "As you already know, the house I was renting had a college republic nearby. It did not bother me at all, at first. However, when the summer began the youngers started throwing parties every single night and the sound coming from the outside was too loud. Therefore, it annoyed me very much since I couldn't sleep!  In addition, complete strangers would come and go across my street for enjoying the republic and it made me feel really unsafe.",
        "Nevertheless, now I've just moved to a really nice place. It's a huge detached house with two bedrooms, two bathrooms and a very delightful fireplace. My new home is located downtown, just across the street from the public library. It also has a breathtaking view from the lake behind, as I believe you're going to love it.",
        "Why do not you come over for dinner, on Sunday night? I can cook some pasta for us, then we can watch a good comedy movie and have some refreshing drinks. You might bring your children as well if you want.",
        "I'm looking forward to seeing you soon. Please, give my regards to your parents.",
        "Best wishes,",
