        "I am Nofal from ARMR company and I recently organized a meeting at your hotel. I would like to provide my crucial feedback along with suggestions regarding the overall experience.",
        "The participants really liked the seating arrangements and the ambience provided to conduct the meetings. The hall was very quiet and everyone was able to listen to the speaker. All the overall services were satisfactory except for food.",
        "The meals included in the lunch seems pre-cooked as they were not fresh enough and the variety was limited in food options. Many guests are suffering from minor food poisoning due to a lack of freshness of items. Additionally, the ice was never served with the room temperature drinks.",
        "I would suggest discussing this matter with your colleagues and further with the cooks. I understand some preparations have to be done in advance, but they must be guided to maintain the quality. You would need to establish proper systems for this purpose.",
        "I hope you would take all the necessary actions in order to avoid these problems in future.",
