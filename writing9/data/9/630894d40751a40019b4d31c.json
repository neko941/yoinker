        "Dear Mr James,",
        "I am writing this letter to request you , to postpone my presentation to a fortnight . As you know already, my sister's wedding is scheduled  in Spain, one week after my presentation . However, now the wedding day has been moved one week before ,due to some personal family emergency.",
        "Suddenly, my grandmother fell ill and the doctor informed us that she doesn't have much time left and she is already on her deathbed. In fact, her disease is  in its last stage and cannot be cured. Given her situation, we as a family decided to change my sister's wedding to a former day , so that she gets a chance to see her granddaughter's marriage.  At this point in time, I don't have an option left, other than attending my sister's wedding and also spending some quality time with my grandmother.",
        "Moreover, I would like to remind you of my accomplishments to date. I never missed a class or never lagged behind in my academics or projects. Despite  completing  my  project thesis much before the planned date, I am not able to present it . Therefore, I am requesting you humbly ,  postpone the presentation date to a later date.",
        "Looking forward to hearing from you soon.",
        "Yours sincerely,",
