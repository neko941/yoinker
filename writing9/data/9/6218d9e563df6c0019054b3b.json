Furthermore, I would like to do the job in the department store as a store manager if you have that occupancy still available.",
        "Moreover, I have 4 years of experience in that particular area in the ALDI stores since 2018 I was working there as a store manager and quality manager. It was always busy and pressurised work and I am keen to handle these kinds of stores. Unfortunately, I have moved from that area and it is very hard for me to continue that job because it is  far away from my current residence. I have done my qualifications in  hospitality management and  additionally, I have done my master's in  business administration.",
