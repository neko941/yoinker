        "Dear Sir or Madam,",
        "I am writing this letter to bring it to your notice about a minor mishap that occurred with me at your super mall.  I am Lily, a local resident, living a few blocks away from the departmental shop.  I have been a loyal customer of this store since its establishment about 6 years ago.",
        "Two days ago, I visited the supermarket and met with an accident over there.  I was piling up my groceries into the cart and moving towards another section when I happened to collide with another cart.  An old man was pushing his cart and it accidentally bumped into me causing me to fall to the ground and hurt my knees badly.  The elderly person was not at fault, it was the slippery floor that caused him to lose control of his cart and it knocked me down.  Moreover, the lights in that corner are also very dull adding to the situation.",
        "Many people visit the outlet for their requirements including small children to elderly people.  It is the responsibility of the maintenance staff to take care of all these arrangements.  It would be greatly appreciated if proper lighting is provided at the corners and dry the floor before opening for the public every day.",
        "I hope you will give immediate attention to this matter.",
        "Yours faithfully,",
        "Lily"
