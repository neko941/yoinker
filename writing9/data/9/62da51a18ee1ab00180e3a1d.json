        "Consumption of prepacked products is increasing in this modern world and they may take place of homely food and cooking would change. In this essay, I will agree with this statement. Firstly, I will explore the rising number of packed food and moving forward, I will discuss changes in cooking style.",
        "To begin with, we can observe that the eating habits have changed drastically down the road as we are getting busier in our lives, although we don't have even 5 minutes to cook an egg for the morning breakfast this has replaced with ready to eat meals. For example, working adults are found of having a fancy diet rather than eating home-cooked dishes, as a ,result it is giving birth to the new processed products such as bean cans, pickles etc. Furthermore, societies are tired of preparing healthy foods as both the men and women are working for a living they are not taking care of their health. In addition, people are moving towards a materialistic world whereas all are equally fascinated with exploring new cuisine. For Instance, buying an industrious food packet from a supermarket and eating it in just 10 minutes is a trend nowadays.",
        "On the other hand, In this contemporary society, communities are losing the skills of cooking at home because they are not in the practice of preparing the food at the house though parents are following the same tradition even their children follow them, therefore, It would vanish the ability In a human race. To Illustrate, parents are changing their buying behaviour by not cooking fresh dinner at home this leads to serious Illness and may cause cancer. Moreover, social media and technological developments are the main reason for this problem and people are unaware of the bad consequences that may affect their bodies. Exemplar, adults' wants are never ending and they seek  new tastes as well as, a unique style of having bread.",
        "In summary, traditionally cooked foodstuff is getting vanished from the human culture and industries may come up with developed items for our consumption and make a profit by hurting our diet which is very unethical for human beings. In conclusion, I feel that people are the one who has to change their diet plans and stick with strict organic prepared day meals."
