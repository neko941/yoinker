Moreover, getting home late  after work coupled with overtime culture on weekends would have done  serious damage as physical activities are totally discarded from the priority list.",
        "These aforementioned problems could be resolved if the government shows concern in the form of awareness campaigns and organizing sports events. For example, the administrative authorities could perform their part to educate the public via advertisements after prime-time or running educational campaigns within societies to spread awareness about the benefits of healthy eating and detrimental consequences of unhealthy food. Additionally, the communities services could be funded to organize sports matches to attract the youngsters to the grounds. As a result,  individuals would be motivated towards healthier living.",
        "To conclude, it is certainly true that clean eating habits and performing physical activities at regular bases has lost its significance in our societies. This essay had explained the reasons for this along with possible remedies imperative to be done for  better community health standards."
