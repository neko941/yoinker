        "Please be informed that my neighbour in room 505 is so annoying at night, especially, from 10 in the evening. Her stereo is too loud and I cannot sleep because of this. I already discussed to her that it is fine to listen to music but not too loud because it will disturb the other people in the unit. But, she never listens to me and she totally ignores me. This is really frustrating since my work start at 8 in the morning, therefore, I need to go to bed early.",
        "Thus, I appreciated it if you could explain to her my complaint and give her a warning. If it is still no progress, kindly please transfer me to other units. Please do let me know if my request is possible.",
        "Should you have any concerns regarding my letter, please do not hesitate to contact me on my mobile number. Looking forward to hearing from you.",
