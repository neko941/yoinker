        "Penalizing,nowadays,is considered  an impressive approach in order to revise scions' behaviours to prepare them for entering society.Whereas some debates have always existed about this treatment,in my point of view,it would be beneficial if is used properly.However,not only its associated footprints but different types of punishments are also uttered here.",
        "One of the most highlighted benefits of that has to do with their prosperity in terms of making linkage with others,which is a necessary ability for humans to survive probable drawbacks.To illustrate, on the majority of occasions people require to persuade their employers to hire them for example,therefore,it is infeasible to become  prosperous if they do not know how to behave politely,which they should learn in advance when they are younger.Furthermore,it is easier for them to tolerate divergent light punishments during their childhood than the harsh ones that usually are utilized for elderlies.For instance,they may be jailed by a conviction from a court.",
        "On the other hand,it is crucial to be aware of the result of employing different penalizations.As a vivid case,depriving offspring of watching their favourite programme on Tv is suggested by experts in this realm,whereas physical reactions are totally banned,due to the negative side effects that can have on both their mental health and similarly on their bodies.Moreover,in some situations praising them would as well be fruitful if they really deserve it.In other words,it would sparkle such a competition between children of the same age to grasp the gift by striving to depict their capabilities in the targeted sector.",
        "To conclude,while some detrimental results are interwoven with punishments,to me,its favourable aspects surpass in many ways if guardians are aware of the consequence of their actions by consulting advisors.Namely,depriving youngsters of their leisure activities would be efficient to modify their treatments,based on related research."
