        "Now, for you and Stacy to be best of friends, make sure that you give her a nice bath in the morning, after which a nice breakfast will do. Furthermore, allow her to play around the living room till midday when you can now take her for a walk. Depending on when both of you are back, give her a treat by letting her have her favourite food kept inside the red can in the fridge. Then,after all the bustling and hustling of the day, let her lay low and pet her to sleep, she usually wants to sleep by 7pm in the evening.",
        "Lastly, lest I forget, there are rubbish bags to be thrown out if you don't want rodents visiting you. Also, it's getting windy nowadays, so don't forget to lock up the windows in the rooms or else everywhere will get dusty by morning, but then after you wake up you can open it again.",
        "I have to leave you to enjoy yourself with Stacy, do have lots of fun together.",
