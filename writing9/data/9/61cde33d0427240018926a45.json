        "In lifespan, individuals have opportunities to work with a plethora of  job-mates with a particular character.  Personally, I believe that attitude considering job obligations is the most pivotal  a coworker should have since it  increases companies' profits and helps with career growth. Although  the willpower to know new things and to be hilarious  plays their role. This essay will shed light on both sides of the view and provide evidence to prove the arguments.",
        "On the one hand, a serious attitude regarding companies' obligations  soars  enterprise income. In other words,  devoted professionals grow a team, which is the ultimate goal for employees.  60% of employees were reported  fascinated by  working with  dedicated inmates because they  accomplished their duties on time for instance.  Furthermore,  they were responsible for the increased salary  inside these enterprises.  As a result, workers' social life was enhanced and communities were delighted.",
        "On the other hand, the desire to learn new duties and the capabilities to make others  laugh was the source of the community staff unit. Because of the interest in learning new activities  along with being connected through laughter,  workers were more united and  it advanced the enterprise environment. For  example,  the recent  investigation carried out by the University Zambeze pointed out  that  40% of the staff of  a reputable consortium were more closed due to their inmates' techniques to  make fun and  learn new  tasks. Hence, stakeholders  were hilarious to work with the company. Moreover,  it  escalated the  consortium income.",
        "In conclusion,  despite all of the three  aspects pointed out being relevant  to  enterprise growth, I still believe that  the first is the most advantageous. Therefore, I  recommend  group top staff to  hire  employees with these skills for sake of  the increased yield and  happy environment."
