Last month, our manager told us the person who is able to speak Japanese fluently would get a promotion opportunity. I incredibly would love to get this chance to go to a further step in my career.",
        "I know your major was Professional Japanese when you were studying at university. I wonder if you could share with me several methods in terms of how to study this language quickly.",
        "I would like to invite you to come to my home this weekend to talk about your experience of learning this language, which would be extremely beneficial to me. If you just simply don\u2019t have time, I can completely understand.",
