        "Dear Alima,",
        "I hope this email finds you well. I'm writing this letter to apologize for rescheduling our meeting which was arranged to be held next Wednesday, 20th April. Due to an urgent task at work, our meeting should be put off to the beginning of May. The location is the same.",
        "It was never my intention to cause anyone distress and I feel awful about this situation. I remember that you even booked a conference hall in advance.",
        "The fact of the matter is that a new project takes more time to be accomplished than we expected initially. There were some changes from a customer. Also, our one-size-fits-all schedule for any projects poses more difficulties. Junior-level developers, who are not accustomed to the process, wanted to carry it out urgently and because of that, a few shortcomings have been found. This new app is going to be rolled out by the end of April.",
        "I once again sincerely apologize for this inconvenience. We hope to see you soon!",
