        "How have you been? How are parents and siblings? It's been a long time since we met last January. I got your letter inviting me to celebrate your birthday this Saturday, but, unfortunately, I can't make it. As you remember, my job in Astana wasn't well-paid, and it was just a stepping stone to landing a high-income job. Therefore, I made up my mind to send my CV to various companies. Luckily, I was offered to take part in a project invested by the chain of supermarkets. However, I had to move to Almaty, where their office is located.",
        "By the way, I won't be available for some time. Usually, I work like a dog, and when I knock off, I'm exhausted. My work schedule is hectic.",
        "Hopefully, you can visit me here in Almaty. I reckon you'll enjoy Almaty which is cosmopolitan and buzzing with top-notch hotels, restaurants, and cafes. Let me know when you can come.",
        "Best regards,",
