        "It is believed by some that sending youngsters to single-sex schools can bring many disadvantages later in life. Meanwhile, many parents choose to send their offspring to these schools because they think that it is more beneficial to them. In my opinion, this can have many negatives. In this essay, the reasons for this statement will be discussed.",
        "To begin with, sending children to single-sex schools can make it hard for them to learn how to interact and cope with the opposite sex . To illustrate this, recent studies have shown that spending time with kids of the opposite sex is essential and can facilitate the development of youngsters' communication skills. Moreover, they can learn how to interact and be members of one group and work as a team. Therefore, sending offspring to a single-sex school can make it harder for them to cope with children from the opposite sex.",
        "Lastly, if young boys go to a different school than young girls, then the quality of their social life in the future can be damaged. For instance, scholars reckon that when kids from both genders go to the same school and spend time together, they can learn about their differences and cope with them. As a consequence, they are more likely to have a successful marriage and it will be easier for them to find friends from the opposite sex when they are adults. This shows that there are many benefits to encouraging boys and girls to interact with each other. Thus, sending our offspring to schools that accept both genders will be more beneficial to them and their social lives.",
        "To conclude, it is reckoned by some that sending kids to schools that accept only boys or girls can cause issues for them later in life. In my view, this statement is completely true. Given the current circumstances, it is best to encourage kids from both genders to interact with each other more often."
