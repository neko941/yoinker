        "Firstly ,some reasons for this can be considered. For example ,we all know most old buildings are destroying these days and replacing with high rise flats and apartment blocks. It would seem that most of these places were historical places where people can find the history of their countries. The reason why they decided to know more about these buildings is to improve recognition of the past. Moreover ,there is enough information that can be found in these constructions about classical architecture. Understanding  old methods of architecture can be helpful to shap new homes and accommodations. Therefore ,this makes it clear there are many reasons for this trend that can not be ignored.",
        "Secondly , there are multiple ways to collect information. For instance ,a common mean in today's modern world is the internet. Needless to say ,all sorts of things can be found on websites that have some essays related to the history of some constructions. Additionally ,another way is digging up. Some people opine excavating the homes can help to know more about things that they are required. However ,this can not be a successful way because of requiring noteworthy money to spend. As a result ,it becomes apparent ways that can be used to collect reports about this trend are different and various.",
        "To summarise ,this issue has numerous causes as well as existing many means to know more about it. It is predicted that to continue searching the history of human's building they will inform about all items in the near future."
