        "Dear Sir,",
        "My given names are Antony Prata, and I am writing in relation to my hand luggage that very likely I forgot on seat 474A, during my flight from London to Vancouver last Wednesday  the 1st of February, around 1 P.M.",
        "I am afraid that as I was expected to get home after a 30-min period to attend a working meeting, I ended up missing it there. It is black Spanish luggage tagged with my first name Antony and my surname Prata. I am not concerned about the item itself, it is a cheap one. What worries me the most are the documents that I left inside my wallet in this accessory. As I will work tomorrow, I should have my credentials to get access to the company headquarters in Vancouver at 7 A.M.",
        "Therefore, I would appreciate it if the flight company could inform me if the luggage has been found. I furthermore would like to keep posted about this. I will look forward to hearing from you any time soon.",
        "Yours sincerely,",
