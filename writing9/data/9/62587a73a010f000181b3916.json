        "Dear Sir,",
        "I am writing this letter to express my displeasure with the services rendered to me by your taxi company on the 15th of January 2021. I boarded your car from the John Kennedy International airport to my home address which should take about fifteen minutes at the maximum. This trip took longer even without traffic and it last for 40 minutes because the driver wanted to surcharge me by getting more money. He also drove very recklessly, spoke loud on the phone all through the journey and was rude.",
        "Following this, I called your customer care line and lodged my complaints and I was told a representative will get back to me in 3 working days. It has been 2 weeks now and I am yet to hear from anyone. Hence, I am asking for a refund for the inconvenience this has caused me.",
        "I hope to hear from you soon regarding this matter.",
        "Yours faithfully,",
