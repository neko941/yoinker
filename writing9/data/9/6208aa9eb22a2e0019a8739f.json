        "I am joyful that your magazine is looking for reader 's opinion on their favourite book. I love reading and I would like to participate in this study and advocate for my all-time favourite publication: \u201cLosing The Habit Of Being Yourself\u201d.",
        "The author teaches his readers about self-awareness with the incorporation of science examples, especially how our brain works, and how we can use this knowledge to take control of our lives. It is fascinating to know that all things are made up of energy and there is a quantum world (un-material plane) where every human being can access and tap into their true power.",
        "This work has helped me improve my self-esteem and quality of life. I have found out that my environment can not dictate my destiny. I have learned great techniques to meditate and increase my awareness of my thoughts. This book also discusses life\u2019s meaning and guides me to find out my true purpose in life.",
        "I was blown away by this book when I first finished it. I always come back to read it again every year and live by it. Dr Joe DIspenza is a great brain scientist as well as a writer and I am confident that his works will change millions of lives like it has changed mine.",
        "Sincerely,",
