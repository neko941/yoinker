        "It's been a long time since we met last time. How have you been? How are your parents? Anyway, I'm glad to receive your letter asking for a piece of advice about opting  to go to college or to land a job.",
        "Honestly, I don't think you would relish studying at the college. You wouldn't love being in the classroom for long hours. These days there is a plethora of theoretical subjects which you may find dull and useless.",
        "In fact, landing a job would be much more beneficial. First of all, you can try the vast majority of professions. In other words, you can quit the job if you aren't cut off for it. However, if the job is interesting and suitable for your personality, you can get a degree anytime. Another pro of working rather than immediately going to the college is that you can gain experience which is going to be valuable in your CV.",
        "As I know, you've always been very outgoing and sociable, so there are some types of jobs like a tour guide, a shop assistant and a waitress which can be apt for you.",
        "I bank on that we can meet and hang out together. Let me know when you have free time.",
        "Best regards,",
