        "In our new era, nations have been gripped by many issues, especially the education part of the government, and a lot of authorities advocate that it is better to pour more money into accessing the internet for the purpose of free usage. I believe it would consider as one of the notions, and I totally agree with this statement.",
        "There are at least two significant reasons why some people disagree with this idea. Firstly, despite the fact that free internet is appealing to everybody, allocating more budget to it means that the government may diminish the other sectors' budget, and it would be irritating for those who do not interest in it. For example, the ageing population would prefer an increase in the welfare state budget  rather than the internet. Thus, they could be mad about this decision with the government. Furthermore, they assume that there are far too many fraud men that could abuse this zero cost internet for aims that are do not reconcile with the government's goals. Downloading movies and surfing social networks could be the best examples of this.",
        "On the other hand, I presume free internet is compulsory these days to guarantee both teachers and students health. it could be wholesome for other citizens to avoid unnecessary travelling throughout the city and dispersing virus among the people, namely in crowded cities, and towns which conform fewer protocols. Besides, this type of internet not only is perfect for students who are studying in big cities, but also it brings a unique opportunity for those studying in the countryside. Regarding its benefits, Therefore, free-cost internet contributes society to enhancing in education level.",
        "in conclusion, although there are some people who do not support this theory, it could be wholesome for every single individual in the country. I think by finding the best solution to resolve this issue, experts could convince opponents too."
