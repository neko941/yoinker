        "I am writing you concerning a problem I noticed on my newly acquired laptop from your company. Recently, I noticed that the battery doesn't charge well enough to the maximum percentage, meaning that if I have to unplug and work, the laptop will shut down sooner than expected.",
        "Actually, I would have not bothered you with this issue. However, it is obstructing my work, because once I disconnect from a power source, the laptop will shut down and I will automatically lose all my unsaved work, and that to me is devastating.",
        "Therefore, I would kindly request you to send your technical support to my office in order to have a look at it and profer a solution to this anomaly. If we have to do any replacement of any parts, I believe your company will handle that because the laptop is under warranty.",
        "Finally, I will be waiting for your company staff to come around for the pick-up, do have a wonderful day ahead of you.",
        "Yours sincerely,",
