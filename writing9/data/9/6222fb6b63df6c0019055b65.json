        "Hope you and your family doing amazing .I was your tenant for the past year and I have always been satisfied with the environment here . But recently there was a new neighbour John moved in . Unfortunately, his habits are seriously affecting my life.",
        "As you know I was a full-time date worker and I need rest at night but the John that moved to my side is a rock singer who likes to play his electric guitar late at  night. I understand that as a singer he needs to practice his performance , But I think he also needs to consider other people's sleep time . I did not have a good sleep since he move in and this seriously affect  my work.",
        "I would appreciate it if you could speak to him and maybe ask him to change the time that he practices to the morning or turn down the volume. it will be great for both of us.",
        "Thank you kindly in advance and please give my best regards to your family,"
