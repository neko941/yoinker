        "How are you? hope you would be having a good time. I'm writing to let you know about the accommodation and relevant details.",
        "Five years back, when I was in university, there was no hostel facility on the campus; however, the nearby residential areas famously known as Karachi Housing Society had plenty of boys' hostels. So, I got a room in one of the hostels and believe me it was great.",
        "Now, I have heard that a hostel on campus has been built; thus, I'd like you to first enquire about the vacant place there. If you succeed in getting a place there, It would be helpful because you'll have all the students from the same university. If not, then you should go to the student affairs officer because they have all the info about the nearby hostels for the students.",
        "I'd recommend you to choose the one which is near to the campus because you'll be on time and not miss your class ; also, you should make sure that it's adjacent to public transport so that you don't spend more bucks on private cabs like Uber or Careem. Apart from this, avoid those expensive hostels which offer 3 times meals, TV halls or common rooms because you will rarely take advantage of these facilities.",
        "Lastly, If you follow the aforementioned instructions, you'd save a lot of time, energy and money. Hope to see you soon.",
