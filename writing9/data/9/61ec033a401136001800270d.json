        "Some individuals commented that the use of fauna in the medicinal investigation  should be  abolished. However, others argue that it is crucial and scientists should continue. Personally, I advocate  the second view opposing to the first since the research analysis benefits all. Although it  is against the fauna protection rules. This essay will shed light on both sides of the view and provide evidence to prove the argument.",
        "On the one hand, the animals' used in pharmaceutical experimentation  produced  reliable  results.  In other words, this sort of research has shown  robust information in the past, thus, it is vital their application today. For instance, the coronavirus vaccine was initially tested in  monkeys, once the wild species body has a similar functioning  mechanism to human beings, and the antibiotic was produced in a record period of time. As a result, trustworthy and  appropriate  medicine is made. Furthermore, it is the  overriding reason for pharmaceutical  field development these days.",
        "On the other hand,  the utilization of zoos goes  against  protectionism laws. Because of the necessity to  safeguard  terrestrial or marine  species, there is a misalignment  between the  environmental activists and the  medical researchers making their dispute over  whether it is the right  or bad thing to use  guinea pigs for example. Hence,  there are  one-side  communities that  are critical and others are in favour.  Moreover, the therapeutical  use of  wildlife is pointed out as the prime reason for heated debates nowadays.",
        "In conclusion, notwithstanding  some critical ideas concerning the utilization of  zoos into scientific overhaul,  it is pivotal to continue the saga because it results in extremely advantageous scoops not only for   supporters of the ideas  but for every individual. Therefore, I still advocate the animal application."
