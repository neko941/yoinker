        "But I'm having a problem right now. I have been trying to find my wallet in all of my bags but I couldn't find it so I think I forgot my wallet in your house and it's probably on the table in the living room. I was in a hectic situation when I lelf the house so I didn't check my stuff before I go. That's my mistake.",
        "I want you to help send it back to me and I will definitely cover all the costs. Would you mind packing my wallet in an envelope and deliver to the post office? I have seen a post office nearby your place and it's around 5 minutes by walking from your back door. I'll be very appreciative if you can do it.",
