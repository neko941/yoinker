        "I feel dreadful after what happened. I know how much it means to you, and I am incredibly sorry about that.",
        "Let me explain how it happened. I had the camcorder with me all the time, as you said I did not give it to anyone. But it happens as such that I was taking a picture, and I got a pushed, which was unintentional by my uncle, and the camera fell off my hand, and so the lens got damaged. I know I should\u2019ve been more careful, but it just occurred in a fraction of a second.",
        "After that, I took it right away to the company store, which was nearby. He examined the camera thoroughly and suggested that the lens cannot be repaired and had to get it replaced, so I placed an order for that, and it shall arrive in two to three days. Fortunately, all the memory is safe, and none of them got deleted.",
        "I do apologize, and I would let you know as soon as it gets repaired, and I would personally come to give it back to you. I hope you understand.",
        "Regards,",
