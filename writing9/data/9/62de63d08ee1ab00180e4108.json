        "In many nations, criminal activities are one of the greatest concerns. Some are of the opinion that enhancing the police force around the city is the best solution to cope with criminals. In my point of view, while I believe that increasing the number of cops on the street would eventually decrease the crime rates, cheaper and wiser remedies can be found to tackle this issue.",
        "Having more human force would surely be effective in the case of reducing criminal attempts around the streets. This is to say because hiring more policemen would deter people away from committing a crime since they would be scared of serious threats such as encountering a cop while trying to rob a store. However, I am afraid that this solution may create a financial struggle for the government since the salaries of polices will rise as their number increases.",
        "On the other hand, there can be more logical and economically manageable ways to cope with the crime rates. Technological advances should be taken into consideration in order to fight violations. For instance, security cameras can be used more frequently in order to record all the activity that is happening on the streets. As we know that these devices do not only capture pictures and record videos but also record voices and recognize faces as well. Therefore, a guilty person can easily be located with the aid of these video cams.",
        "In conclusion, although I agree with the fact that increasing the number of policies would undoubtedly cause a fall in criminal activities, I feel that this might cause an economic problem, and more sound solutions can be implemented rather than this."
