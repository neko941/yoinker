        "How are you? Hope this letter finds you well and I am writing this letter to let you know that I move to  Vancouver along with my family. I am planning for a dinner party outside to celebrate my 30th birthday and as you know I am very new to this  place and still searching for the best place.",
        "It`s been a long time since we did not have a party outside of the home and we decided to have a lavish party in one of the best places. We are especially looking for some of the best vegan food restaurants and also it should be very near to home as we do not have any car. If possible we are ready to have an advance booking to avoid rust at the reception. Despite  high prices and items, we are more worried about the hygiene of the location.",
        "I knew that you are the right person to suggest to me  the best hotel in Vancouver and please feel to drop your notes as soon as possible. If possible please send the hotel contact and their reviews as well. Nevertheless ,You are most welcome to join our family party and I cannot wait anymore to have a great party.",
        "I look forward to hearing your suggestion and hope I will get it soon.",
