        "In the contemporary epoch, there is irrefutable debate among schools about the dressing of students contrary to the other institutions. While promoting the same dress has a lot of benefits beyond some flaws. In my perspective, the merits are more than the demerits. In this essay, I am going to examine both edges in the forthcoming paragraphs.",
        "To begin with,  There are copious inhabitants who argue that the advantages of this trend outweigh its impacts, as it promotes equality and Justice. According to a recent survey, those pupils who studied at school where there is a rule of the same uniform are helpable to the poor and to the society because they know that everyone is equal in this world  just like in class. Grace to the other benefits it provided, not only one does  work when it comes to being effective but also it is helpful for the rest of life. As a result, All these merits stand in  good stead, as far as augmenting the chances of prosperity and excellence is concerned.",
        "On the other hand, another pivotal in the aforementioned proposition is that it is helpful in one way but excels in various ways  Furthermore, If one thing follows a system, does it means that it is successful in all fields. That is why  some individuals are not in the view of school uniform because maybe it is expensive or some pupils  do not feel comfortable in it. However, these flaws are undeniable compared to the merits.",
        "In the nutshell, according to the four named quarrels, despite having some disadvantages like affordability and comforts of not wearing the uniform but the festivity vantages and amenities it will provide for the future life surpass its disadvantages."
