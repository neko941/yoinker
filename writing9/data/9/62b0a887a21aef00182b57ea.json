        "I am delighted that you are coming to Singapore next month. I think it would be great if you can stay with me and my family, who send you their best wishes. Otherwise, if you prefer, I can reserve you a cheap but comfortable hotel near the beach so that you can be more independent.",
        "There are lots of things to do in my country. If I were you, I would spend some days on the beach relaxing and one or two days sightseeing in the city. There are several interesting museums and temples that I am sure you will enjoy.  Also, you ought to go to our excellent night safari which is about an hour away by bus.",
        "You do not need to bring a lot of clothes because the weather is normally warm and sunny. However, in the evening it is a bit cooler, so you may need a jersey and jacket",
        "Please let me know exactly when you are coming so that I can meet you at the airport. It will be great to see you again. So we can get up-to-date with all our news",
