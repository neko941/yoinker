        "I'm writing this letter to thank you for giving me the book for the preparation for my entrance examination. This was a competitive examination book written by Mr Gopal Kumar who is an expert in writing these types of books. The book name is Staff Clinical Trials with the latest 7th edition.",
        "Apparently, this book contains all information that I need to know before the recruitment test. Due to it, I got 31st rank in Punjab State and have my name on the short-list made by the Recruitment Agency. Not only this, You'll be glad to know that I received my appointment letter today and I'll join this job next week.",
        "I know that I should return this book last month, however, I need this book to prepare for my interview which was conducted the previous week by the same Recruitment agency since the short-listed candidates must pass an interview for this job. Therefore, I was unable to return it on time. I'm sure this has not caused any inconvenience to you.",
        "Thanks to you for the book one more time.",
