        "Dear Benjamin,",
        "I am one of your fans and this letter is to appreciate your great voice. You had a remarkable performance during your last concert, so, I decided to contact you to ask for some advice to improve the quality of my work. I would like to explain more about it.",
        "It has been 10 years since I started playing the guitar, and I am interested in a variety of genres such as Rock, Jazz and Blues. Although I learned different methodologies from various teachers, still I have quite a few missing skills. The most problematic part of my work is the ability to play and sing at the same time which causes the notes to become out of tune. However, your concert showed your control over your voice while you perfectly play the guitar, and I thought maybe you can give me a few suggestions to fix my issue.",
        "I would like to ask you to help me address my problem and be able to synchronize my voice with the background theme. Also, it might be best to assist me with a video which allows me to follow your instructions, step by step. In the end, your help is much appreciated beforehand.",
        "Sincerely yours,",
