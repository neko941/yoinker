        "I wanted to remind you about students' bad decisions when choosing accommodation. First, try to find a place near the university, which can save you a lot of travel time. Also, ensure restaurants are nearby so you can have a meal when you are not in the mood to cook.",
        "I hope all of this was helpful for you.",
