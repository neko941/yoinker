        "This is regarding the disturbance caused due to loud noises from some of the flats that are owned by you in the Park apartments on Kello street.",
        "I am Hannah, who lives in A-2, 2nd floor of Park apartments on the Kello street. For the last few weeks, there have been loud noises of music and talking during the late hours of the night from the block of flats right opposite  mine. This is causing a lot of trouble for me and my family as we aren\u2019t able to sleep on time leading us to some health issues.",
        "As this building has mostly families with young kids, you should talk to the tenants about this problem as early as possible. I am not against their party but it would be helpful if they can keep track of the hours and volume of sound. I hope you will take  appropriate action immediately.",
