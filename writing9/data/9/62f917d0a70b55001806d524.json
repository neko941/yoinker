I pursue happiness with endless dreams, sleepless nights, and an overwhelming workload. Ultimately, I lead myself to reach the doctor's advice in order to control my feelings.",
        "After I read this, I realized what  actual jubilation is, now I am a successful business that owns more than what I had a few years back. Moreover, now I have the eternal delight which I had not a few years ago. So, I recommend, everyone to read \"Pursuit happiness\" by Richerd Hackwins, and be happy with what you have.",
