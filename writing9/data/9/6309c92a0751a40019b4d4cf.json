        "As you might be aware this year I'm graduating from university. It took so long for me to finally make it, that is why I want to have a party with all my friends and loved ones. I'll be throwing the party around the first week of October, so please make sure you save the date. I am so keen to introduce you to all my uni friends, they're so much fun, you will love them.",
        "The venue where I'll be celebrating is called Pink Monkey, and it's located right in the centre of the city near Central Station. It will be easy for you to find it because the place is a well-known spot. Once you get off the train just grab a taxi and make sure to tell the driver the name of the venue.",
        "I will be super busy with the preparations so I apologise in advance for not being able to pick you up from the train station, however, you don't have to worry about finding accommodation as you'll be staying at mine. I have a guest bedroom with an ensuite and a balcony that you will love.",
        "Let me know if you need any further directions to the place, I can't wait to see you soon!",
