        "Partaking in physical activities has long been an area of focus and never failed to draw public attention and provoked debates. From my perspective, although engaging in exercises is beneficial, its potential drawbacks should also be taken into consideration.",
        "On the one hand, playing sports provides participants with a healthy lifestyle. In fact, exercise stimulates a wide range of life-enhancing functions and results in multiple desired effects such as boosting the immune system and burning fat, thus alleviating the risk of illnesses and becoming a solution for problems caused by stress and sedentary lifestyle which have been increasingly serious in modern society. An illustration for this justification is that many studies have shown that individuals partaking in physical practices enjoy a longer life span compared to those who scarcely undertake them. Hence, it is not an exaggeration to assert that sports have taken a pivotal role in human well-being.",
        "On the other hand, physical practices can be occasionally dangerous. Despite the positive effects, physical activities are likely to cause enduring fatigue or even chronic injuries, which adversely affect the normal functions of the body and aggravate health if they are wrongly practised. For instance, it is extremely hazardous to engage in long-duration and high-intensity forms of exercise without sufficient stamina. Therefore, it is crucial for participants to take precautions and adhere to the instructions of professionals and trainers in order to avoid unexpected problems.",
        "In conclusion, undertaking physical activities has become an integral part of the development of a wholesome lifestyle. Notwithstanding the benefits, appropriate practice and performance are required to ensure the positive effects brought by sports for the reasons mentioned above."
