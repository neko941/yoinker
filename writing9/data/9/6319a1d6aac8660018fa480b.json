        "Many people argue that the eligible age for marriage is 21 or more. I strongly agree with this notion mainly because of maturity and financial readiness.",
        "At 21 , young individuals are considered ready before getting married because, at this stage, they are classified as mature. Their maturity is based on and supported by their education which they have experienced previously because usually, they have graduated from an undergraduate program. As a result, they will calmly face every challenge in their future married life. In other words, youngsters who marry at an early age tend to ruin their relationship by having more disputes with their spouses. It ends with a divorce due to their lack of maturity which can be seen from the vast number of separations among young Indonesian couples nowadays.",
        "Furthermore, a 21-year-old bride is considered more independent in terms of finances. Economics issues have become the most common problem among couples in Indonesia. Therefore, preparing for financial readiness by becoming well literate in regard to economy, and possessing enough capital, are crucial for every individual. For example, the more ready the brides are financial, the easier their life in the future will be. It is because they have already eliminated one of the potential problems. Achieving such financial independence before adolescence is normally difficult; hence, allowing under 21 years old to marry will cost them many future problems.",
        "In conclusion, issuing a policy requiring brides to be at least 21 years old is the right decision since marriage should be prepared well and supported by the couples\u2019 psychological and financial readiness."
