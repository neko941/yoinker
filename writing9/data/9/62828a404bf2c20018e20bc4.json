        "Dear Sir or Madam,",
        "Residence of Behnam street and I are dissatisfied with your rubbish collection system. Thus I am writing to inform you of this dire condition. I am absolutely convinced that your hired company which is responsible for waste collection is not working properly. Because it is always delayed leads to the accumulation of vermin around them. More importantly, it is dumped on the ground most of the time when garbage is collected and moved. It is generally known that house wastes, especially wet wastes make a contribution to an awful smell. Due to these unbearable circumstances, cats and dogs are seen in our surroundings all night which causes various diseases like rabidity and tetanus.",
        "Since you should take significant measures to end this situation, I suggest you mention it to the relevant company or even consider fines. Also, changing this irresponsible corporation can be helpful.",
        "Thank you so much for your assistance in this matter and I hope the problem is solved as soon as possible by your efforts.",
        "Yours sincerely,",
