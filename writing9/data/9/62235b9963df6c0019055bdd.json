        "Let me elaborate, recently, I have purchased a black colour Samsung mobile from your online store on 5th March 2020. Yesterday, the product was delivered to my home address. But, unfortunately, I am quite disappointed with the product because the phone defected. Therefore, I would like to refund the amount for my purchase.",

As you know, the refund amount is $1500 and I will only be able to buy the gift after the payback.",
