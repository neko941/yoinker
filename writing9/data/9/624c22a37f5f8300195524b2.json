        "I hope you're doing great .I've recently joined a multinational company. and many of my colleagues speak Spanish in the workplace.I studied basic Spanish in high school and have always felt a fascination with this language.Moreover,I believe, I would work more efficiently if I speak it with my coworkers.So I thought it was time to get in touch with you and get some help since you're a fluent speaker of Spanish.",
        "I wonder if you could give me a few tips on how to speed up my Spanish learning? Do you think I should get a self-study book, or watch some video tutorials on YouTube? Sometimes I think about getting enrolled in a Spanish language course , but I'm not sure if it'll suit me. I think you can guide me on this. I'll be looking forward to your tips and advice.",
        "If you're going to be in the area in the next few days, we could get together , and I could pick your brains about this subject.We haven't been to an authentic Chinese restaurant for a while, and we could discuss it in detail over dinner someday.",
        "I hope to see you soon.Take care and stay fine.",
