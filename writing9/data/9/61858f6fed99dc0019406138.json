These days with the coronavirus pandemic the health structure is stretched and shortfalls in human resources to deal with the population, particularly the old ones. As a result,  the  hospitals collapsed and  more than 70% of the crowd are in need of medical treatment. Moreover,  the world economy collapsed too.",

That's why I advocate more  supportive measures so that  these  professionals feel embraced. protected."
