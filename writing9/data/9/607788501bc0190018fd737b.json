Even the risk of getting cancer is higher for obese people. Thus, having a high body mass index that can be the result of not being active and having a healthy diet can put one at risk of getting sick.",
        "To tackle this problem, people should start being active and doing exercise on a regular basis. They should also stop eating high-calorie foods including sugars and fast foods. Another solution would be to be mindful of children and even start a healthy lifestyle from childhood. For example in Japan parents of overweight kids need to get into a health program starting as early as grade1 and the whole family will get education and training on different weight reducing exercises and activities besides having to take some cooking classes. Therefore as can be seen obesity can be treated with the help of a good diet and exercise planning.",

There are some people who have  hormonal problems that need some medication to deal with. However,this rule can a majority of them to have a healthy life."
