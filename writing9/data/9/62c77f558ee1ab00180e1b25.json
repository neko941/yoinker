        "It is factual that one of the paramount skills that contribute to the success of youngsters' performance in the academy is their exposure to earlier reading. This is very pivotal because it increases the cognitive level of the children,additionally, exposure to basic intellectual movies as well as employment of a personal tutor are the factors that help in levelling up a juvenile's achievements in school.",
        "To begin, the thinking state of a kid increases to a high level when he/she engages in a skill such as reading at every age. This is because ,in the process of reading novels, a high degree of thinking will be activated. For instance, when someone is reading me something meaningful, the person will be  forced to understand the context. Thus, when a juvenile is exposed to reading at a tender life, a vast cognitive level is activated at that age which will be of help to the youngster in school later in order to attain good grades.",
        "There are other factors contributing to better performance academically. Firstly, exposure to basic academic movies. What this means is that, when a child watches academic-related films early, it helps the kid to be more familiar with the system. For example, a cartoon that solves mathematics or explains words in English when a child watches them, he/she becomes familiar with them which will not be new to him/her when eventually taught in school. Secondly, personal tutoring always goes a long way in order to attain a good score. It is not a waste of money if parents could employ a home teacher for their offspring at an early age. Nowadays, there are paediatrics teacher who understands techniques to make children comprehend basic things easily.Hence, all these elements contribute to the success of a minor at school.",
        "In conclusion, when teenagers are used to reading at an early age, it improves their level of reasoning which boosts their academic level in studying place. In addition, watching  movies that are related to the academy and paying a specialised tutor to lecture the kid at a tender age are contributing factors to levelling up a child."
