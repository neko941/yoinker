        "Firstly, I would like to tell you that I got promoted a Project Manager this week and as a result, in the coming week, my training has started in which I cannot take any short or long breaks because of the company's norms. So, I would not make myself available. I know you will understand not only my situation but also the significance of my new job.",
        "But don't worry I have arranged everything for you, In fact,  I talked to one of my friends and he'll be coming to see you at the airport and will take you directly to my apartment where you can get fresh up and can have some rest. I'll be free from my organization by 7'o clock in the evening and will be with you at around 8 in the evening. Then we'll have fun and long talks.",
        "Please drop me a line if you're all right with this arrangement. Looking forward to seeing you soon.",
