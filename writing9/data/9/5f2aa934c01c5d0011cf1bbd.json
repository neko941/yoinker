        "Nowadays, the rate of abortion has significantly raised in society and creates controversy all over the world. While some feel that it should be authorized by the law as many people are scared to take care of their own babies, others argue that it should be banned to save the life of the mother. This essay will discuss both views and outline why I feel miscarriage is a harmful act, which has to be shut down completely.",
        "Those who support abortion believe that it is necessary because many couples do not want to take a responsibility of a child. However, they want to settle down their financial situation in their starting life. At this stage, if an unwanted pregnancy occurs, then they think about the financial burden of that newborn. As a result, they chose the way to abort a child. In the USA, for instance, research shows that more than half of abortion cases in 2019 are because of money issues facing by those parents, Hence, many people demand this trend should be legal.",
        "On the other hand, many people think miscarriage is a frightful and irresponsible act that has a negative impact on women\u2019s life. In other words, a mother has to face many physical and mental side effects, which can ultimately increase the risk of her death. For example, the health problems are described by one of the USA doctors, which caused mainly due to aborting a baby. By threat to female health, many think this trend should be closed.",
        "In summary, this essay discussed why some persons believe abortion should be legal, and others oppose it. In my opinion mother\u2019s life is more important than a financial problem. Therefore, I personally feel abortion should be fully prohibited."
