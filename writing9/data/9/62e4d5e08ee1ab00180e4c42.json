Now I am hopeless in doing that. Moreover, I am afraid of falling the card into the wrong hands, because it has the access to all money that I have saved in the bank account.",
        "Therefore, I kindly request you to deactivate the card as soon as possible preventing its misuse. Secondly, It would be great if you can assist me in paying the semester payment.",
