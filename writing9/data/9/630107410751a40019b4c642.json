        "Dear Sir or Madam,",
        "This is John and I saw your advertisement in a local magazine for a part-time voluntary job. I would like to share my enthusiasm to work in your museum as a volunteer. Let me explain more.",
        "Currently, I am studying architecture at Concordia University. Since your museum has some exhibitions on ancient architecture and historical monuments, I would like to freely share my knowledge with your visitors. This would be a great opportunity for them to learn more about our history and the architectural developments. I already passed more than twenty credits on various subjects about  Canadian architecture history and how they are affected by  American and  European designs. Consequently, it would be a unique chance for me to keep my understandings fresh and explain them to your audiences.",
        "As a result, I have attached the essential documents to this letter for your reference. In addition, I would like to mention that I will be available in September during the weekends. I am looking forward to hearing from you.",
        "Sincerely yours,",
        "John Nash"
