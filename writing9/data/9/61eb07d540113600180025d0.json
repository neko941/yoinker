        "I am writing this letter regarding a problem I faced with the MRF tennis cricket bat which I ordered 4 days back from your website. My order number is xyz12087, and I had been waiting for this item eagerly, and today afternoon on 22 March 2022 I received the delivery of this product.",
        "However, with extreme excitement, when I removed the packaging of this cricket bat, my happiness was ruined and I was extremely disappointed after meticulously observing the product because there is a big crack in the middle of the bat, therefore it is a defective piece I received. It was unbelievable, as I was under the impression that I ordered from such a famous exorbitant brand and expected a supreme quality, but I did not hope that a damaged piece would be sent to me.",
        "As this bat can not be used for playing cricket, thus either replace this defective item or refund my money with I paid for this purchase. I have shared the images of this broken product and hope the actions will be taken soon.",
