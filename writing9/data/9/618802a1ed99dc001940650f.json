        "As you are well aware of  the challenges that I faced with respect to travelling to work at my previous place. I was finding it difficult to reach on time as it was very far from my office. so I got in touch with an agency which helped me to relocate here.",
        "Though it is expensive when compared to the previous house, it offers convenience for me to commute to work and make things easier. It has a huge foyer with a beautiful garden and includes one living room, two spacious bedrooms and an open kitchen. Additionally, the view from the balcony is extremely pretty.",
        "Why don't you come round this weekend and see what you think of our new place? My family and I  would love to see you and if the weather is good we can have a barbecue in the garden.",
        "Looking forward to seeing you soon!",
