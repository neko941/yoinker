        "Dear Sir or Madam,",
        "I attended your week-long Indian cookery class earlier this month (from 4th to 10th August) and I am so happy that I got the opportunity to learn so much from you and your staff. The course was perfectly designed and I enjoyed everything I learned from it, especially the introduction to the spices was one of my favourite parts. And perhaps, the most significant thing that I personally have been able to take away is the confidence to give it a go.",
        "I am so glad that I have been able to apply and enjoy the skills that I learnt quite a few times since. I prepared a couple of Indian dishes at home and have since moved to a few other dishes, trying to keep it simple for the time being and focusing on understanding the many flavours and applying the techniques. We even invited a few friends and cooked them an Indian dinner which I must say was a success.",
        "I can not thank you enough. I will definitely recommend your course to a few friends of mine. I also believe that I would be interested to learn a few Italian dishes and perhaps you can offer a course on that.",
        "Yours faithfully,",
