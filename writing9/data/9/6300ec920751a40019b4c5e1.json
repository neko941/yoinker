        "Dear John,",
        "I would be glad to take some of your time with the explanation of an incident, which caused your written complaint to the housekeepers' board. You referred to the noise in my townhouse on Saturday, May 15. I am really sorry for that, however, with the information about the source of these loud sounds you could be more tolerant of it. That day was the birthday of our little daughter, so we held a costume party and brought all her schoolmates to our backyard.",
        "Indeed, I bring you my apologies for that case, nonetheless, I could emphasise that it was  daytime and the youth's screams were not too loud and offensive. Moreover, they were happy and pleasant for the ear of every parent.",
        "In conclusion, my wife and I designed the plan to avoid such complaints. We should greet you and your son at our place during the next party that we will hold soon. I bet you will be amused enough to be a part of these sounds and see our children's delight.",
        "Convey my regards to your wife and son, we hope to see you soon!",
        "Sincerely yours,",
