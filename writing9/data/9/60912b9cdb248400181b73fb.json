        "In this contemporary world, it is irrefutable that schooling acts as a torchbearer for the youngsters. However, it is argued by many individuals that schooling of  young children must be initiated from the very beginning, while others opine that it should not begin before 7 years of life. In this essay, I will discuss both perspectives and argue why I think the former point is better.",
        "To begin with, late education can provide the younger life group ample time to grow, spend with parents. In addition to that, a minor can learn basic manners at home and can form a strong emotional bond with their guardians. A child who is not engaged in formal education tends to have better psychological development than those engaged in study at a younger life, for instance. This results, in better personality development among the students.",
        "On the other hand, youngster enrolled in school at the initial years of growth can grasp the knowledge better and it is long-lasting. Toddlers get attracted to different colour schemes and games that aides them to learn at a fast pace. A child will be much familiar with the world than the offspring who do not attend schools, for example. Moreover, this results in the enhancement of educative skills among early school-going juvenile.",
        "In conclusion, it can be said both the viewpoints about late and learning at an advanced life have their own positive points. But in my opinion, keeping in view all the aspects, enrolling a small child in formal education is a far better option rather than delaying formal learning."
