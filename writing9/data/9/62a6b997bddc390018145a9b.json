Others think it will lead to loss of respects and discipline in the classroom. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.",

        "While some adopt the view that students ought to be entitled to comment or even criticize their professor so as to enhance educational quality, others think that respect and discipline loss will be a result of that. I will discuss both sides of the essay before my point is drawn at the end.",
        "On the one hand, it is generally believed that learners had better be empowered to evaluate their teachers for educational growth. In fact, in  modern days, pupils are inclined to be the centre of the class, which empowers them to raise their voices over their studying issues comprising teachers. If the instructors compelled their learners to follow their path, the youngsters' confidence and creativity would suffer. Thus, it is essential that schoolteachers should encourage children to give feedback, which would help them look back and move forwards. Without such  assessments, the lecturer couldn't internalize new insights from children, contributing to diminishing teaching and learning quality.",
        "On the other hand, however, there is a widely held view among people that cultural values would be a negative consequence. Having said that, the Asian countries, especially Vietnam, traditionally teaching is considered to be the best career, therefore, it is true that pupils had better listen to and comply with their instructors. Nevertheless, that has not been compatible with  modern educative innovation  these days. If individuals still remained that belief, they would not meet the requirements of the globally general growth, which inspires the youth to debate and express their thoughts freely.",
        "In conclusion, human beings deem that the young generation should be supported to evaluate their teachers. Meanwhile, others believe that this will mitigate the intrinsically cultural belief. I strongly think that educators had better listen to learners' ideas to have a far superior tendency of their cultivation while students ought to think over before commenting."
