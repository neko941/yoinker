        "To begin with, let me explain  my qualifications and brief description of myself. Currently, I am a tutor at the Sri Lankan language school. There, I am teaching Spanish and French languages to kids like yours.",
        "In addition to my teaching skills, I am quite good at gardening and cooking. Moreover, I have worked in a well-known Sri Lankan family restaurant, so I am well experienced in organizing small family parties as well.",
        "Finally, let me explain why I am so desperate to have a job. I will be visiting Australia in the next month for research that I am going to do with Melbourne university. So it would be great if I can have a part-time job at that time to cover my expenses.",
        "It would be great if can reply to me as soon as possible, so I can arrange it myself as it is. I look forward to hearing from you.",
