        "Dear landlord,",
        "I am writing this letter to bring to your notice an issue which I have been facing daily and regret to have this kind of experience as water taps are being leaked despite the back-to-back repair. In addition, we also noticed that a few lights are not functioning even after replacing them with brand new lights and switches too.",
        "As you heard, we will be at  great risk as this leaking water may create fungus and evolving infections around the home. Hence, we are more anxious about the entire family's health. On the other hand, the entire family sitting in one room to do their school work and my office work and not sure how to focus on the assignments and I strongly believe that this will lead to a new problem if we did not act fast.",
        "However, I would ask for some solutions to overcome these issues and I would really appreciate it if you could fix them immediately. we have an expert in our town and you may contact them to have a quick look to fix it as we cannot carry this one for a longer time. I am ready to pay their service charges if required.",
        "I look forward to hearing your response to this letter and I wish all these issues will be gone away  and live in a good community.",
        "Best Regards,",
        "Lakshmi."
