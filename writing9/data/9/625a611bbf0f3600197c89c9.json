Unfortunately, my maternal grandmother passed away due to a heart stroke, which we never expected, as she was strong with no health issues so far. Besides, this my mother was hospitalized due to the sudden death of her mother as she could not take it. During this tough, time I had to take care of her at the hospital since I do not have a father or siblings. Because of all these, I couldn't complete the project before the deadline.",

Therefore, my backup will look after me in my absence even if I am not available due to unavoidable situations in the future.",
