        "Dear Manager,",

        "My name is Akila and I'm one of your regular customers from the town. I feel really bad about your driver's behaviour which was uncomfortable for us during our 20 mins drive.",
        "The driver started asking personal questions and when we refused to answer he started playing loud music which hurt our ears. In addition, the air conditioner was not turned on and we were all sweaty throughout our travel time period,",
        "It would be of great help to suspend/ fire him as his behaviour was disturbing to all the passengers. Furthermore, he should be trained on how to behave to the customers by the management.",
        "Looking forward to hearing from you.",
