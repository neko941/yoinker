        "I'm extremely sorry pal, I won't be available on those dates that you have mentioned in your letter. As you may know, I am working on my project these and I am quite busy with it. On the exact dates that you have mentioned, I have to go to the Rantabe power plant to get some readings of the equipment that I have placed to monitor electricity generation. It will take 2 or 3 weeks  since  travelling here is not easy  these days.",
        "If you can please consider doing a change to your plan, and can you visit here by October 1st? During that time I think I will be at home, and sure I will make arrangements to not plan anything beyond your visit. I will make arrangements to make our long awaiting trip to be a reality. I am sure you will enjoy this time ,as usual, enjoying my mother's meals, especially the chicken curry.",
