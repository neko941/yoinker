        "I am writing this letter to inquire you the advert I saw in the newspaper in regards to the vacant position in your restaurant. I'm currently a 4th-year student with a course BS in Hospitality and Tourism. I'm looking for a part-time job where I can learn skills and knowledge that I can use after I graduate. It is also an opportunity to earn money to cover my expense in school. During the years of studying my chosen curriculum, I learned how to interact with clients and treat them professionally.",
        "I'm also good at decorating and sometimes I can be persuasive in terms of handling a tricky situation. Therefore, I can say that I am fit to have this job, with all the qualities I have presented. I'm available for an interview in the afternoon because I have classes every morning. I can come to your office whenever at your convenience.",
        "I am looking forward to your positive reply.",
