        "I, Kuljeet Kaur, stayed at the hotel for 3 days from the 10th of August. I am writing to you in connection with the problem which I faced at that time.",
        "Firstly, I was very joyful to see the interior of the room in which I was living. However, when I switch on the button of the Air conditioner, it did not work at all. Also, it was too hot and humid inside the room due to which I faced difficulty.",
        "Then, I called the receptionist who understands the problem well. Afterwards, she arranged for an electrician who can repair this device. It took around 3 hours in repairing the machine. She was really helpful and she also allot another room to me for that period.",
        "Hence, it would be really commendable if you could please check the technical faults in advance so that every customer is served in a better way. Moreover, it is also suggested that hotels should have an expert who can fix these problems.",
        "Hope you will pay consideration to it.",
        "Yours Faithfully,",
        "Kuljeet Kaur."
