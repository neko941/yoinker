        "Artists require some freedom to develop their creativity. Although some people opine that artists should be totally free to express any thoughts and ideas, however I fully agree with this opinion. Therefore, my inclination is justified in the ensuing paragraphs.",
        "Out of all arguments, the stronger one to prove my view is that liberty is required to pour out the inner feelings of an artist because an artist always utilizes the emotional quotient to create something unique. One best example is the picture of Mona Lisa which is a true depiction of the painter\u2019s views regarding women. Besides, another reason is that artefacts normally reflect a complete set of stories altogether. For instance, the everlasting monument of love which is a Taj Mahal holds a comprehensive story within it.",
        "On the contrary, other people counterclaims the mentioned support. The foremost argument they put forward is that freedom of expression using the form of artefacts is often misused and could eventually lead to hurt emotions of people. Blasphemous posters of Prophet Muhammad are evident examples of this. The events like this took place multiple times, which adversely affected many believers worldwide, which pushed the whole world to redefine the thin lining of liberty of expression in the form of poster art.",
        "To conclude the above mentioned, despite the assertion of wrongful usage of art. Yet, my reasons for emotional reflection through art-mediums and storytelling are logically accepted. To explain, people should be encouraged to use creative methods to express their views, but must be aware of its long lasting effects on others."
