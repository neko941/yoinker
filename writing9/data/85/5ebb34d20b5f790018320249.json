        "Traffic congestion in many cities around the world is severe. One possible solution to this problem is to impose heavy taxes on car drivers and handling this capital to make public transit better. This essay will discuss the benefits and drawbacks of such a measure.",
        "One of the first benefits of such a measure is that the heavy taxes would discourage car owners from using their cars because it would become very expensive to drive. This would mean that they would begin to make use of public transit instead, thus reducing traffic problems and pollution as well. Another benefit would be that much more need would be made by public transportation if it was improved. It is often the case that public shipping in cities is very poor. For example, we often see old buses and trains that people would rather not purpose. High taxes would generate enough fund to make the necessary changes.",
        "",
        "Nevertheless, there are drawbacks to such a solution. First and foremost, this would be a heavy burden on the car drivers. At present, taxes are already high for a lot of people, and so further taxes would only mean less cash at the end of the month for most people who may have no choice but to drive every day. In addition, this type of tax would likely be set at a fixed amount. This would mean that it would hit those with less pay harder, whilst the rich could likely afford it. It is therefore not a fair tax.",
        "To conclude, this solution is worth considering to improve the current situation, but there are advantages and disadvantages of introducing such a policy."
