As you know, these quick meetings are never quick. It really went on for 2 hours and as it was with the CEO, I couldn\u2019t even use my phone to inform you.",
        "However, as I was using my laptop during that meeting, I tried contacting you by email but I guess you didn\u2019t check my email at that time. After all the haywire, when I finally got free your number was out of reach. Believe me, I tried it so many times.",
