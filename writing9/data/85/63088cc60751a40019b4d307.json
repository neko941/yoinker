        "I hope you and your family doing great. I'm writing this letter to request you,  share the recipe for the blueberry cheesecake , you baked on your wife's birthday.",
        "My daughter's birthday  is on the 1st of next month and I'm throwing a surprise party  for her. As I told you earlier, she was delighted , after having  your blueberry cheesecake at your party. She had told her dad and brother about it numerous times  and made them feel terrible for missing it. In fact,  my husband and son plead with me  a lot of times to bake it. However, I choose to do it on my girl's birthday. Now, I exactly  need the same recipe from you, so that I can bake it on my own and astonish her with my skills.",
        "Therefore, I am inviting you and your family to be my guests at the party. I would personally message your wife next week  when I get free with all these arrangements. Although it's your recipe, I want you to try it and provide your feedback.",
        "Looking forward to hearing from you as soon as possible.",
