        "I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing this letter with mixed emotions as I decided to sell my beloved car due to a financial crisis in business. Furthermore, I need to pay my bank debts as well to avoid additional interest rates.In addition, I cannot drive this car as it requires a huge maintenance cost  during the maintenance window.",
        "As you know, my car is the best in the market with phenomenal features. The car's performance is immaculate when compare to other cars. Therefore, you will be over the moon during the trip. Last but not least, it  also has a substantial space in the trunk despite the model and I am sure you can keep a big suitcase for your vacation.",
        "Hence, I would love to invite you to see my car's condition during your free time. It would be great if you could confirm at least two days before  so that I can keep the car in the garage to have quick look. If you have any question regarding price, model & features please do not hesitate to call me.",
        "If required I will book a cab to visit my place and do not think about expenses and they are on me.",
