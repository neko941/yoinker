        "Dear Colleagues,",
        "I am writing this letter to thank you for the awesome present and the best wishes that you sent me.",
        "As you all know, I have been promoted recently to the new position of \"Manager Operations\" on behalf of my performance and to make this a memorable day, I was having a party last week. However, I am very obliged to all of you to become a part of my celebration and bestowed me with a fascinating gift of a mobile phone along with a colourful card.",
        "My phone is about to die and I have been thinking to replace it for a long time but you guys brought me a new cellular phone which is surely going to be very helpful for me. Since the position of Manager is the critical one, as it requires a lot of responsibilities to be handled, demands reporting on a regular basis to the higher-ups and replying to emails on time. All these tasks would become quite handy to do with this device. I will keep it to myself all the time rather than a laptop because it is small in size, easy to fit in my pocket, has a long battery life and has an additional feature of built-in emails.",
        "I am very grateful for this note-worthy gift for this special moment.",
        "Yours sincerely,",
