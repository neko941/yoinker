        "Dear Sir/Madam,",
        "I am Mary Coppola residing in Austin, USA. I am writing to express my dissatisfaction with the poor quality of the car that I rented from, 16th January 2020 to 15th March 2020.",
        "I hired an Audi car for a round trip from Austin to Houston to spend my vacation. Initially, the air conditioner was working well, without any glitches. However, on 3rd February 2020, it did not function as usual. Hence, I contacted your company's customer support at 1887773-977-98776 and filed a complaint. The customer service executive Mr. Shane was very unprofessional with his response, thus corroborating my doubts that he was drunk during duty hours. Finally, he gave me a reference number as 28766538 and disconnected the call without a proper response, which irritated me to the core. To add fuel to the fire, until now the technician has not reached out to me to fix the air conditioner, which is ruining my travel.",
        "I urge you to either send a mechanic to end this problem or please replace this car with another one, which is in good condition as soon as possible. Also, I request you to provide me with a discount of 50% on the total bill for the inconvenience caused.",
        "I am looking forward to hearing from you.",
        "Thank you",
        "Yours faithfully,",
        "Marry Copolla."
