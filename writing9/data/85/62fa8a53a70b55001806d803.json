        "In today\u2019s ,world we can find vast diversity in cultural and social aspects. People choose different types of clothing styles all around the world. This makes them special and different from others. Some people think that the way of dressing of individuals, it is obvious to guess their culture and personality. I believe that this could be possible to judge someone\u2019s character and living custom to some extent from their clothes. In this essay, I am going to discuss some arguments which will support my claim.",
        "To begin with, the majority of different customs have their own traditional dress or the way of wearing some clothes. This is because this kind of dressing represents their ancient people and the way they  lived. For example, the tribe call Banjara in India,  wear a white top and trouser with a hat which usually illustrates their early lifestyle. So, when people see someone in this kind of dress, they can easily understand that these people belong to that particular cast.",
        "Secondly, it has been in practice for such a long time to dress in certain kinds of clothes when you are at work. The type of clothes people wear at work,  gives an indication of their job position and character. For instance, if we see someone in an apron in the hospital with some kind of medical treatment-related equipment like a stethoscope, then we can guess that he/she would be a doctor. As a result, when we visit this kind of place, we can recognize their character and job profession from their dress code.",
        "In conclusion, although we cannot be sure about individuals living styles and characters by just having seen their clothing style, there are some common assumptions we can make to identify their culture and what kind of personality they acquire."
