        "It is true that unemployment citizens could receive  benefits when they need them from the authorities in many nations. Although it will enable someone to go through the difficult times, I believe that it also has a negative impact on countries\u2019 progress.",
        "The effect of unemployment payments is that struggling individuals and families are able to survive challenging periods. A good recent example of this would be the record unemployment rates in the wake of the 2020 Covid-19 pandemic that millions of workers lost their jobs. To be more specific, many families can not afford their living expenses and without government , the support they might lose their homes or struggle to obtain everyday meals. As a result,the benefits allowed them to pull through a difficult period and use their time to look for a new job. Moreover, with a good amount of benefits, they can try to find a quality job rather than settling for the first position offered by a company trying to exploit the historic jobless rate to recruit workers with lower salaries.",
        "However, although providing benefits can help people sustain their lives, it has a largely negative development because it has wide-reaching effects on society. Firstly, helping the most difficult groups out of poverty may have a massive influence on the social workforce. It is likely that some people choose to claim benefits rather than working as they are no longer motivated to find a job. For example, some individuals found that the relief payments are even higher than their wages so they prefer to stay at home instead of going to apply for  new employment . Furthermore, this will result in society not having enough labour to support its development because fewer people are willing to look for jobs again.",
        "In conclusion, unemployment benefits are a great boon for those without jobs in the short term, but I do believe that it will cause a shortage of social labourers and all citizens should be encouraged to work to earn a living and support themselves in the long term."
