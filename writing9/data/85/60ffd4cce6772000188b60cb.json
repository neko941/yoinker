        "Let me explain to you in more detail. I think that I got this disease mainly due to the poor hygiene condition of the office toilets. Often it has been observed that they are not clean. The housekeeping staff are cleaning it once a day that is not enough considering the number of employees working here.",
        "Can I please suggest you  look into this issue?  It is better if you have a discussion with our administration department and increase the number of cleaning staff. Moreover, the introduction of a training program for employees to educate them on basic washroom habits will also be of great help. I will look forward to hearing from you.",
