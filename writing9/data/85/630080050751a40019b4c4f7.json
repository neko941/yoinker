        "It has been argued that strict laws should be imposed to ban taking photographs of children of public figures or young celebrities who are under 18. Personally, I strongly support this idea for a number of reasons.",
        "To begin with, some people believe that taking photos of celebrities\u2019 children and the young who are famous can benefit them and  also  ordinary children. From their perspective, this group is likely to play a role model for their peers. For example, famous young athletes can motivate other children to be more physically active. Moreover, publishing photographs of new young celebrities may contribute to being seen by the public and gaining reputation.",
        "In spite of this, I hold the view that the photography of people under 18 should be forbidden since it seems to bring about serious problems for them. Firstly, this action indirectly conveys a message to children that they have to be always perfect in both appearance and conduct. While, it is possible for them in many cases to be immaculate  for instance, sometimes they are bored and can not behave as an adult. In addition, as they are constantly judged by the public, this may mentally affect them. By way of example, paparazzi pages on Instagram share photographs or videos of children and sometimes criticise them that it can put a lot of tension on them and consequently causes many disorders such as depression or anxiety.",
        "In conclusion, I fully agree  that laws should be imposed to prohibit taking pictures of famous youth under 18 who are popular in society because it is occasionally unbearable for them to act as an adult and can put them at high risk of developing different mental disorders."
