        "I am writing to share my gladness and thank  your cookery course, which provided such an informative  class. Although I am not good at cooking, learning through the course helped me to refine my conventional cooking methods. The oats and biscuits mixed with butter are an outstanding item and it is palatable. The most interesting section was the live cooking and discussion regarding the recipes.",
        "According to my family ,comments I am satisfied with joining the course. Last Friday we celebrated my elder sister's birthday and I served the most delicious mixed fried rice to all gathered at that party. Their appreciation filled my heart. I shared about the course with them and some relatives asked for the contact number to join in your next batch.",
        "I heard that in the summer holidays you are going to conduct new sections for Italian food, that I am waiting to join.",
        "Kindly inform the details in my email.",
