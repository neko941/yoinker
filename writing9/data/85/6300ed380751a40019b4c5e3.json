        "I, Priya , stayed at your residence 2 weeks before and I'm from London. Hope you recognized me, I had a great time at your homestay. After my vacation, I returned back to Canada and realized that my wristwatch was missing whereas the rest of my belongings were intact. Although  I am aware that it's my dad's gift to me on my birthday, I take little care of it. It's a golden-coloured watch with a black dial of size 35mm. If I had checked it earlier before leaving your home-stay, I would have found it.",
        "I am pleading with you both to check in my room , where I stayed , which is suite 202. I'd kept my belongings in the cupboard next to the laundry room. I'm assuming that I might have left it there, while picking up other items. Therefore, If you're able to locate my watch , please send it to the enclosed address. I'll pay the charges for the mailing.",
