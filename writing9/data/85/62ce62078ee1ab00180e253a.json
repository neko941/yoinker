        "I hope this letter finds you well. I am excited to write this letter and happy to recommend you a few things regarding the best time to visit and make your travel plan as well. As you know , Canada is the coldest country and we cannot even think of travel during the winter season. Hence, I would advise you to plan your travel for the month of September and this would help you to escape from the winter and freezing cold too.",
        "We have a wide range of accommodations available here such as shared rooms, hostel and town-house as well. It all depends on your budget and requirements. For example, if you would like to have all the options like utilities, heating and hydro along with Internet then, I would ask you to choose the high-rise apartment wherein you could find everything in one package.",
        "I am sure that, I will make you feel happy during your stay at my place. I have prepared a plan with a list of different places such as Moody park visit, Ocean play games and last but not  least downtown exploring over the weekend. I cannot wait to see you and heartily welcome you to my place.",
