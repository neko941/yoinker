        "It is assumed that the main purpose of tertiary education is to create more job opportunities for students while others argue that the benefits of higher education are much wider than that for both graduates and society. In this essay, I will discuss both opinions and give reasons why I support the latter statement.",
        "On the one hand, it is thought that the main reason why students embark on universities is to secure a high-paid job after graduating. To explain, at school, students will be equipped with useful knowledge and relevant job skills through some academic subjects such as mathematics, physics, and languages which may be helpful for their future career path to some extent. Moreover, firms are increasingly looking at candidates with qualifications and experiences in a particular field today, which means that bachelor's degree holders are more likely to have advantages over those without. Therefore, more and more people lean toward formal institutions after graduating from high school nowadays.",
        "On the other hand, aside from being employable, students and society would gain more advantages from pursuing higher education. On the individual level, universities tend to provide their attendees with a healthy environment to develop their personalities. For instance, we can boost our confidence and lead active lifestyles by working in groups or joining more social events at university. Furthermore, on the societal level, it is believed that schools would prepare students to be members of society by teaching young people moral values such as tolerance, and integrity. In other words, a cultured student might be less likely to commit a crime than a young adult who does not pursue tertiary education. As a result, it would reduce crimes at a young age and contribute to a safer and wealthier society.",
        "In conclusion, formal university education could guarantee graduates land a lucrative career while I insist that schools would hone students' social skills and cultivate them to become better men for the community."
