        "Books and movies are some sort of entertainment for people to spend their leisure time. Some people think that reading fiction books brings more enjoyment than watching films. Personally, I do not agree with this opinion. These paragraphs will explain some reasons for my opinion before.",
        "Firstly, video formats are offering richer content than books. While the books tell the stories with text and some figures, movies show us some stories with moving scenes from their actor. Moreover, the supporting audio like sound effects and songs. This extensive kind of media can bring a stronger message from the filmmaker to the audience. Besides, it enables viewers to experience the same condition as the actors have in the film. For example, in horror movies, the director applies some horrifying sounds to build the vibe. Also, a film can touch human emotions whether it's a sad or happy scene. Therefore, I think it is more enjoyable due to the immersive experience that movies offer rather than books.",
        "Another reason, movies can be completed in a certain duration. Usually, the movies time length is about two hours. It contains a full storytelling structure like opening, conflict, resolution, and ending. In contrast, books usually take a longer time to complete. For instance, there is an Indonesian novel that tells an introduction of the main story in about 50 pages, which normally takes days to complete at a regular pace. If some individuals are not patient enough, they can be get bored and not getting an enjoyable experience.",
        "To sum up, watching movies is more enjoyable than reading fiction books. It is because movies offer a lot more content to touch human emotion and can be completed in a shorter time than book reading."
