It's been a long time since  I was with the same employer but unfortunately, I did not see any growth in my compensation which is crucial to all of us. Hence, I decided to look for a new job and finally, I  accepted the offer and joined in Microsoft organisation.",
        "As you know, Microsoft is the best company in the software industry and as part of my daily job, I need to work with multiple stakeholders across the globe from different industries. In addition, I may need to extend my support to other teams despite my regular schedule calls. The funniest part is working with the MS excel application and sometimes I feel over the moon.",
        "I believe, you still remember your last visit to my place during the summer. It was like a phenomenal trip in my life with all back-to-back travel plans and hiking. This time I am planning to go with my local friend. Hence, I would ask you please share your thoughts if any. I will try to make my trip to your place during the winter and I will keep you posted with the travel plan.",
