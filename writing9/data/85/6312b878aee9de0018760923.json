        "Engineers often say that nuclear energy is a better source option of energy for the future globe. Despite the fact of some people disagree with this statement, I extremely agree that nuclear power is a great alternative for humankind's needs. This essay will discuss this viewpoint.",
        "First of all, nuclear energy is a clean energy source, which has zero emissions for the planet. In addition, this produces minimal waste compared with other energy sources. For example, according to the Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI), the United States avoided more than 471 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions in 2020 since the country started to utilise nuclear sources. Hence, nuclear energy is a better sustainable choice.",
        "Furthermore, this also keeps the air clean by removing thousands of tons of harmful air pollutants each year. These pollutants contribute to acid rain, smog, lung cancer and cardiovascular diseases. For instance, the University of Rio de Janeiro released research showing that the number of respiratory diseases decreased by 23% since the implementation of nuclear electricity in the city in the past 5 years. Therefore, this can have a great impact not only on the source of power but as well as, residents\u2019 health.",
        "To conclude, from the arguments presented above, it is undeniable that nuclear power is beneficial to the planet. If a country starts to implement this, it will lead to a better healthy community.  Although some people do not believe in it, I strongly agree that nuclear power is a sustainable and healthier alternative to the globe."
