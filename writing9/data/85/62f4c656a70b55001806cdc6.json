I have this idea and knowledge for the improvement and enhancement of our local areas such as sports and cleanliness program. Being a youth, the basketball tournament is one way to distance them from using drugs, and at the same time maintain their physical fitness. Moreover, I have suggestions to enhance the place such as cleaning the walking tracks and children's playground.",
