        "First and foremost, the reason is lower employment. Many communities prefer to delve jobs which is nearby their residence areas. It is expensive for workers to do jobs far from their houses because of their expensive rate. Another concrete reason is, that the crime rate may increase if the government establish building outside of the cities. The community can feel unsafe doing work in specified areas. According to the research, rape cases have been inclined in Delhi for two years due to unfavourable working places for women.",

In addition to it, traffic problems may create air pollution for the whole globe. Consequently, it becomes harmful to the world.",

        "To conclude, I restate my opinion that there are numerous advantages o this productive step. Nevertheless, I believe that it is, joblessness and crime rate will increase due to long-distance working place, And it may wrong prove for the economy of the countries."
