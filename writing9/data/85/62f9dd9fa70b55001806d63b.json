        "Some would argue that official calls for personal minutiae when they are approaching  jobs has great significance while others say that providing particulars relating to their activity preferences and marital status is irrelevant. Although this categorical material serves no purpose meant only for written records, I believe that these details help managers in optimum activity allocation.",
        "On the one hand, some employees  argue that individualistic characteristics should not be mandatory because these minutiae do not fulfil any object. As most of the time questions such as family history and choices are asked in the interviews . For example, a survey report of River Valley corporation  shows that bio-data questions included in the interview pattern are generally to make job seekers comfortable and that data is needed  for  various record purposes which are kept confidential. However, these details are necessary as some sort of information about the candidates needed to be kept because it plays a tremendous role in contingencies.",
        "On the other hand, some individuals believe that employees\u2019 records are compulsory which becomes base for job assignments. Officials list the interviewer\u2019s areas of interest while interviewing. There is a fact behind that because the person should be allocated with the activity which suits to their qualities, interest and preferences so that the work is done by an employee in the best possible manner. For example, according to the American Institute of Management, the performance of the employees multiply by two if that work suits their interests. This demonstrates  how basic details fulfil a great objective.",
        "In conclusion, although casual information has only been treated as official material, I firmly believe that getting data is by far the most proven method for task allocation."
