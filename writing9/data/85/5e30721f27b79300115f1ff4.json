        "I am writing this letter concerning a valuable watch I lost on the train. It is an old-style watch and it was a gift from my grandfather. It is made from gold, and it bears my grandfather's initials, J.K, on the back. Plus, the size of the watch is quite distinguishable because it is small.",
        "I was on my way back to my house and the moment I entered the house, I noticed that my watch was missing. I recall, that I have taken the express train and I was sitting in the first-class section of the train. I have removed the watch from my hand because I have spilled some coffee on myself. As a result, I set the watch just on the seat next to me, on the right.",
        "This is a valuable watch for me not only because it is expensive but because it belonged to my grandfather. I would appreciate it if you could find the watch and possibly keep it in a secure place in your head office. You may contact me on my mobile number: 987-76565, once you have found it.",
