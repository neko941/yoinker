        "Over the past few decades, environmental problems have become a pressing issue. While some opine that the general public is accountable for maintaining their surrounding, others think that it the government's utmost duty. In this essay, I will examine both sides of the argument and discuss why both the individuals and government should actively participate in taking care of the environment.",
        "To begin with, some opine that it is the role of people to keep their environment pollution-free. Nowadays, air pollution has surged drastically. Car exhaust legal fumes and contain gases like carbon dioxide and nitrogen; hence, pollutes the environment. If people are able to reduce their car usage to rare instances only, then this can greatly reduce the level of air pollution. This action of the people can help to protect the environment.",
        "On the other hand, some believe that the government play a pivotal role to safeguard and maintain our neighbourhood. They can implement certain measures to prevent the deterioration of our natural resources. Like, a ban on the use of plastic should be imposed and create awareness among people about recycling. Furthermore, they can lower the prices of bio-degradable fuels which can less hazardous to our environment. Diesel and petrol, for instance, are widely used by industries and vehicles because they are economical and easily available. On the other hand, bio-degradable fuels are expensive; so the low cost of such fuels can encourage people to buy them and combat  environmental problems.",
        "To conclude, people have miscellaneous views about who is responsible for environment protection. In my opinion, the joint effort of the government and citizens would result in an effective way of preserving the environment."
