        "Some individuals claim that promotions can be very effective for convincing customers.Another side asserts that marketing is so popular because for this reason many public sometimes doesn't care about whatever they see.I believe advertising may be both a sufficient and valid method for affecting people's buying habits.This essay will be discussed herewith both these ideas.",
        "To begin with,marketing has a persuading impact on society's shopping preferences because of a logical case that is a considerable exposing amount of advertisements.Many humans are being exposed to a variety of advertisements when they are watching and using social media.Therefore,their subconsciousness can be impacted whenever they look at these documents.To illustrate that,people who follow advertisements want to buy what kind of promotions when they realize.To give a clear example,lots of adolescents want to purchase that are being shared frequently by influencers such as clothes,make-up goods and shoes.Thus,the number of products which are sold can be increased via  enabling displays commonly.",
        "On the other hand,promotions might be insufficient for influencing buyers' attention due to drawback circumstances which are boring.Oodles of individuals don't pay attention  to advertisements since they are bored owing to promotions thickness.For instance,many ranges of brands prefer to send messages in order to recognize the qualities of their products.However,many people who receive these messages would rather block these advertisements so as not to be disturbed.Hence,promotions are very unnecessary due to this eligible reason for some folks.",
        "To conclude, when all of these factors are taken into account advertisements play a prominent role in the change in the community's buying routines whereas other individuals agree that these might be much more irritated due to their constant cases.From my point of view,sellers had better care about the frequency of advertisements in order to sell more goods."
