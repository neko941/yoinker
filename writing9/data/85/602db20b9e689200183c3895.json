        "People always have different views about the role of TV in education. While some think watching television is an effective method for teaching students, others argue that it is ineffective and has  potential problems for children. In my opinion, it can be very useful if it is used under supervision.",
        "On the one hand, Some argue that teaching by television may cause a range of problems. First, most programs do not require much thought which may sometimes have a negative impact on students such as violence and crime. As a result, it is possible for children to imitate and influence their physical and mental health, even have a negative impact on society. Second, compared with teachers and books, there are limited educational resources on televisions because  most of them are entertainment programs, sometimes with advertisements. Consequently, students cannot learn too much especially in their areas of interest from the television.",
        "On the other hand, there are lots of benefits in obtaining knowledge by watching television. Firstly, television programs can be informative  and educational which allow viewers to have access to a huge variety of channels, For example, there are two programs in China which called \u201cThe Animal World\u201d and the \u201c Historic Talk\u201d, people can learn different spices and Chinese histories by watching video records. To be more specific, televisions can make  boring subjects more attractive and easier to understand.",
        "In conclusion, although television has some drawbacks because of the lack of control, I strongly agree  that it is a good tool for teaching due to it can stimulate people\u2019s interest in learning. In addition,  colourful videos make all knowledge more interesting and real."
