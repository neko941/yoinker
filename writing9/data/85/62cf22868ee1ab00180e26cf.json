        "I am writing this letter to inform you about the changes in our scheduled meeting.",
        "Since it is already in your knowledge that, we have scheduled to meet at conference room tomorrow in the morning but now our meeting has been shifted to the lecture hall. Secondly, it is no more a face-to-face meetup instead I have invited the whole department to join us. Moreover, I have incorporated the review of the technical performance of the company in the agenda along with the commercial figures and the individual performance of the employees.",
        "I feel sorry that I am letting you know about the amendments in the 11th hour but unfortunately we have to manage it effectively as we do not have much time to take it to the next week due to the end of the fiscal year.",
        "The reasons for changes are that. we have to analyze the overall position of the firm rather than just focusing on the technical figures in order to bring improvements. Besides that, one-to-one sessions with all the colleagues will provide a clear picture of their individual contributions to achieving our targets so, we can set their appraisals accordingly. Lastly, the conference room is too small to accommodate all workers and the air-conditioning system is not working properly as well so, I moved it to the lecture hall.",
        "I look forward to your kind support.",
        "Yours sincerely.",
