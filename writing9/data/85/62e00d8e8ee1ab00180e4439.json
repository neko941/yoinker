        "I am writing this letter to inform you about my discontinuation of the evening course despite my good academic scores and progress in the course as I need to do a job to look after my family's responsibility due to the financial crisis.",
        "As you know, I come from a very poor family and I need to pay my parent's medical and hospital bills  every weekend. Having said that, I cannot work in the evening I will not get any funds and eventually I will be in a critical situation which is not at all good for my family. In addition, I have to pay my huge examination fee which I cannot even think about that considering the other needs. On the other hand,  I have applied for multiple jobs and looking for a good salary to fulfil my dreams.",
        "As you heard, I cannot ignore my family being an elder son and I do not want to run away from my studies as well. Hence, I would like to attend this course during morning hours which can be helpful  all the way. If required I can extend my hours in the early morning to complete this course early.",
        "I look forward to hearing your response to this letter and let us know if we have any the best option other than the above-mentioned one.",
        "Yours sincerely,",
        "Lakshmi."
