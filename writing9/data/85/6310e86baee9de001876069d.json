        "It's mixed emotions to write this letter and glad to know about your upcoming tour to my place which is going to have a phenomenal experience during stay in my country. Firstly, you explore mesmerising theme parks throughout  Vancouver city. In addition, we have spectacular waterfalls and breathtaking sceneries in the middle of the province to have a splendid experience.",
        "As you know, the Vancouver downtown is the best place to stay despite the skyrocketing rentals and additional charges. On the other hand, we do have some shared accommodations if you are anxious about rental charges which cost you an eye and a leg.",
        "Having said that, I would like to suggest  your travel packages which are going to save your's extra expenses. Hence, please do not forget to bring some ready-made food items and also not to carry any drinks in your luggage  which may cause an issue at customs check. Last but not least, an umbrella is mandatory as we do not know when the rain comes to the city.",
        "I cannot wait anymore to meet you and I look forward to meeting you at the YVR airport.",
        "I wish you a very happy and safe journey.",
        "Best Regards,",
