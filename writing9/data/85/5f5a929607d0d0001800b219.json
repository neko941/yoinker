        "My name is Jazzy and I am a resident of Queens Harbor. I am writing in connection with parking problems which I have been facing for the last three weeks.",
        "Actually, the main issue is that spot 59 is associated with my suite and I always find one white car parking in my spot. Also, I have to call the concierge every time to get rid of the car late at night and we all should know that all the parking spaces are designated for every unit.",
        "Another problem is water leak which usually happens due to condensation once in a while and it has damaged my car so many times which cost me a thousand dollars. Moreover, I want to make all of you aware because it can happen to your vehicles as well.",
        "To overcome parking , residents can ask the front desk to find associated parking. Also, we can ask the management to get the repair or replace the pipes. I want to propose to all of you to have a common meeting whenever it is possible. It will be a good opportunity to get to know each other and we can discuss further issues.",
        "I look forward to hearing from you soon.",
        "Yours sincerely,",
