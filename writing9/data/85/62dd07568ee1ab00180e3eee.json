        "It has been the norm for most of human history for an individual to have one career throughout their entire life. However, it has become increasingly common for folks to switch careers at least once or twice. Amongst younger generations, some people might even change jobs every few years. There are several advantages and disadvantages to both strategies. In my opinion, it is preferable to have a choice in the matter.",
        "On the one hand, if a person stays in one job throughout their life, they will have several advantages. Firstly, they will become experts in that field, from so many years of experience. Secondly, they will become invaluable to the business and receive significant pay increases over time. Last but not least, they will have much respect in their company for their loyalty and long service. On the downside, however, they may feel trapped and too afraid to change careers, even if they are not happy. Whatsmore, if their employer does not value them, they might pay them below the market rate. In my opinion, being trapped in such a situation would feel like a slow death!",
        "On the other hand, many people prefer to hop from one profession to another, which also has several advantages. For one, a person who has tried several career paths will have a wide variety of skills on their resume. Whatsmore, they will have a greater understanding of what kind of work suits them best. Eventually, they will be more likely to settle into a career they truly enjoy. Another advantage is that they can seek work that treats them well and pays equitably. I believe a worker ought to have this freedom, as they can find a career that suits them and employers that treat them well.",
        "To conclude, both options have several advantages and disadvantages. In my opinion, however, it is better to change careers as required. This way, a worker has the power to demand more equitable wages and benefits. Whatsmore, they can seek satisfying and suitable work, enabling a happier life."
