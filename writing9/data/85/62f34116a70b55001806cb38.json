Furthermore, the entire family is struggling at the workplace as we do not have proper rest at our home. We feel like we are in hell and sometimes it is leading to serious health issues with bass sounds  I even see that our windows are getting shaking and they may get a break if this not going to get stopped.",
        "However, undoubtedly, this has to get stopped immediately without any second thought, if not I am ready to file a complaint in our community as we already paid for the damage and we cannot wait anymore and handle this bigger noise at home.",
        "I look forward to seeing good cooperation from you and hoping this issue will not happen again in our society.",
