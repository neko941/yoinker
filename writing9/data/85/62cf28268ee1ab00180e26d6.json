        "Last year, when I visited London you bought me some jeans and shirts from 'XYZ Brand\". The outfits were classy in look and they perfectly fit  me. I want you to please bring me a leather jacket from the same shop because I liked the quality, the fabric and the design of the clothes.",
        "Once you are here, we will be doing a lot of activities. First of all, we will be having dinner at the open place situated next to the beach. This restaurant has a vast variety of dishes from Pakistani to Italian  and the taste and the quality are too good. Secondly, we will go to the amusement park as it has recently installed some new and exciting rides for adults. Lastly, there is an opening of a new cinema in my area which is equipped with a 3D screen along with the actual effects and the comfortable seats.",
        "One important thing I need to bring in your knowledge is that nowadays the weather is way hot and humid so, they might give you a tough time. Furthermore, the condition of the roads is not satisfactory therefore, this will create some trouble for you.",
        "I look forward to meeting you soon.",
