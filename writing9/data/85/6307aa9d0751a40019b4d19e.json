        "There is no denying that music is among the most long-standing forms of entertainment throughout human history. As society progresses, there is a common belief that such art has developed as an effective means of communication connecting people with different personal backgrounds. In my opinion, I fully concur with this view.",
        "Firstly, music possesses no barriers regarding linguistic and educational level, making it effortless for almost every person, even toddlers, to enjoy. In addition, numerous studies have proven that catchy rhythms and compelling melodies can captivate a person\u2019s engagement without that person having to comprehend the meaning of the lyrics. This effect, in turn, enables perceptively different individuals to share the same interest. For example, the prevalence of Taylor Swift\u2019s ballads, domestically and internationally, and the diversity of participants in her concerts, including various ethnicities and ages, offer concrete proof for this position.",
        "Secondly, the ability to evoke one\u2019s feelings inherent in singing facilitates emotional connection, creating a relaxed and comfortable atmosphere for conversation between strangers and thus helping them to speak without inhibition. Specifically, reluctance to befriend could result from a defensive mechanism built up by personal differences, and music is the means to overcome this obstacle. To illustrate, parties often utilize music to arouse the area, break the ice and promote open interactions among the unfamiliar crowd.",
        "In conclusion, while there are other reliable methods for cultivating relationships, I am convinced that music, to a great extent, is a top contender and will continue to remain so for the reasons mentioned above."
