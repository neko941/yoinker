        "We live in an age when lots of scientific and business information has been revealed by a wave of media.  Several citizens approve of these kinds of applied improvements however, in others' opinion the huge accessible surveys would cause damage in academic and political regards. I firmly believe that these trends could have either positive or negative consequences and an academic outlook should be considered to report.",
        "There are various reasons why some journalists are incentivised by some people to get the results of Academic or business studies much easier. Moreover, as a person who has been residing in the 21st century, they do seek the most profitable and scientific-based strategy of life. For instance, ongoing investigations of health, cancer and infectious involved in the most trendy information nowadays are in favour.

        "In conclusion, although it might seem advantageous to demonstrate the details of studies, I claim that the proportion of the importance of news to their announcement."
