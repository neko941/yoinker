        "Dear Sir/Madam,",
        "This is to express my dissatisfaction with my stay at one of your apartments at 334 Bourke Street, on level 7. For your reference, I started living 3 months back from now and never faced any troubles caused by other neighbours. However, there is a tenant who rented the house on floor 8, is causing a lot of trouble and conducting absolutely inappropriate behaviour.",
        "Initially, It all started with the weekend parties and one almost every week, during weekdays. It seems that a lot of his friends are invited and they have loud music which hampers the quiet lives of others. In addition, I am a very quiet person and like to stay organised with my work time and sleep. Therefore, I did speak to him in person to make him realise about all of it so that it doesn't happen and even the neighbour. However, his bad mouth and temper are something no one wants to engage with.",
        "Considering all of this, I would like you to take strict actions against the boy so that everyone can live peacefully. You see, I have come to this city to work and do something with my career and so my schedule is of utmost importance. In case, you want to reconfirm with the others you perhaps, can arrange a housing meeting in order to resolve the matter.",
