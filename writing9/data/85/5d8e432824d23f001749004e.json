        "I am writing to let you know that finally, we have moved to a bigger house! We just could not go on living in the two-bedroom apartment now that the children are growing up and we need more space for indoor activities. So we started looking and finally, here we are in our new home.",
        "I'm sure you'll love it. We have three bedrooms now and two balconies. The house comes with spacious bathrooms and a modern kitchen. The kids are happy because there is more space with the big living room and the garden outside. But James is perhaps the happiest of all because this house is near to his office.",
        "Why don't you come round this weekend and see what you think of our new place? We would all love to see you and if the weather is good we can have a barbecue party in the garden.",
        "Our new address and phone number are below, so give us a call and let us know when to expect you.",
