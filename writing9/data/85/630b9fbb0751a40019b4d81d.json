        "In this modern society, many believe that the old teaching ways should be replaced with the latest educational methods like gadgets or computers. However, a group of people think that these electronic devices cannot take the place of formal methods. Although, both of these ideas have their own pros and cons I honestly agree with the latter.",
        "To begin with, the majority of people believe that the education of children is crucial and they should be taught with new methods. For children, concentration on textbooks is really hard because ,in the process of learning, they need some images or methods that entertain them and at the same time, help them to learn. Hence, computers, TV and mind games can boost the process of education. For instance, the latest research in the UK shows that 90% of children who used board games in their lessons, perform better than others who used textbooks.",
        "On the other hand, it is common knowledge that learning from electronic devices, in long term can lead to some serious problems like eyesight issues, back pain and eyesore. Moreover, entertaining video games can distract children from their tasks and in that case, they need to watch the records over and over to take notes, As a result, they will waste a lot of time. For example, musical cartoons can distract kids from their learning process.",
        "In a nutshell, undoubtedly, using games, computers and TV can help children learn their lessons better and textbooks help them to improve their imagination which will become handy in their future."
