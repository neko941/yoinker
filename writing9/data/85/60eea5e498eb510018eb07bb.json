        "There is no doubt that in this integrating world, overseas education is seen on the rise. This notion is believed by some to have exceptional goodness than education in home countries. Personally, I completely disagree with this trend and this essay will discuss further.",
        "On the one hand, more and more students have shifted towards studying abroad because of the perks brought by the developed countries. As an illustration, in the past years, the number of university students from the UAE were shown as increasing and this is mainly due to globalisation and commercialised education in English speaking countries. These students were mostly awarded scholarships and they now come back from their studies to assist in their national development. Furthermore, some experts indicated that absorbing knowledge in such developed nations could do wonders for international students\u2019 ways of thinking. Having mentioned that, this contributes greatly to the improvement of a country in terms of education, healthcare and perhaps hospitality.",
        "Alongside the beneficial aspects that studying abroad can confer, there are some minimal negative signs linked to a country\u2019s well-being. To illustrate this, the government has encouraged aspirants to pursue education in foreign countries by covering the tuition fees, however, this has caused a budget imbalance within a country\u2019s operation. A clear example of this would be a Vietnamese intuitive TV program named \u201cWays to Olympia\u201d, which sponsored all the costs of studying in Australia. Moreover, a study shows morally related issues should be taken into consideration as youngsters, who have early education without parents\u2019 supervision, tend to behave immaturely in a foreign country. Thus, there might be a likely risk of exposure to illegal acts and crime-related behaviours.",
        "To conclude, although having an opportunity to explore and adopt highly valuable features of the developed countries, there is no guarantee for home countries to expect the benefits of global education as government spending and other cultural aspects might be at risk."
