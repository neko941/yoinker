        "Dear Mr Smith,",
        "It is my great pleasure to recommend Billy Grate to the Master of Business Administration program at the University of Rame.",
        "I have known Billy since he joined my class two years ago, and we had been working together until this semester. Of all the undergraduate students that I have had the chance to work with, Billy is one of the most intellectually curious and enthusiastic. He proved to be bright and diligent in his studies.",
        "Billy's passion extends well beyond the classroom. During his first year, he demonstrated how well his collaboration and leadership skills by organizing the university's first-ever Financial Club. By the end of that semester, he was able to recruit more than 20 members and organized numerous activities for the club.",
        "I am confident without reservation that Billy would be an excellent fit for the University of Rame's graduate community. If you have any questions or would like me to further elaborate on Billy's skills and achievements, please feel free to contact me at 070-1234-5678 or [email\u00a0protected]",
        "Thank you.",
