        "Some feel that the optimal solution to the current environmental crisis is to raise fuel costs for various private vehicles. In my opinion, though this would have a tangible impact, a more holistic approach is advisable.",
        "On the one hand, increasing the price of fuel would have a clearly identifiable impact. In both developing and developed countries, private vehicles are becoming more common. More expensive fuel costs would discourage individuals from taking long trips and encourage them to seek alternative modes of transport such as walking, riding a bicycle, sharing transportation, and using public transportation. The average family that struggles to pay their bills every month might then decide to stay home rather than take a short trip on weekends if the cost of travel outweighs the potential enjoyment. Governments would be able to clearly chart the effects produced by these taxes and adjust them accordingly.",
        "On the other hand, a wide variety of measures that do not target less affluent segments of society would have a greater effect. A single remedy is unlikely to produce the desired result as the majority of middle and upper-class citizens would not be deterred by minor taxes. Instead, the ministry should consider all the relevant environmental issues ranging from deforestation and single-use plastics to fossil fuel consumption in industry and the methane released in factory farming. To truly and sustainably counter these issues, authorities will need to employ a variety of tactics that will likely include not only taxes but also regulations and various educational initiatives. The tackling of a single cause, such as the fuel used in private vehicles, will have a marginal impact at best.",
        "In conclusion, despite the tangible results that a tax might engender, states should opt for a more comprehensive environmental policy. This is a pressing issue and requires a nuanced, long-term approach."
