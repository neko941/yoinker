I have seen the job advertisement, which was published in the Daily Times, last Sunday. My name is Sara Khan, and I am looking for an odd job to bear my educational expenses. As I live in the vicinity of your restaurant and with culinary expertise, I consider myself perfect for the same post.",
        "What is more, my graduation was completed in 2018, in culinary arts. I have hands-on cooking food and presentation, not to mention, I am a one-year diploma holder in Hotel and restaurant management from the New York School of Food Sciences. I also did a part-time job in New York along with my studies.",
        "Now, I am doing my master's studies, and I attend classes four days a week that is from Monday to Thursday, so I think the weekend would be more convenient for me to join you. I have attached my resume and all testimonials along with this letter. If a chance were given to me, I would leave no stone unturned in discharging my duties.",
