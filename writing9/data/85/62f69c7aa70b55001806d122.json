        "It is believed that unlawful acts that are being displayed in the media are the major cause of the increase in children's delinquency. I totally disagree because wrong parenting is the number one cause, however, age limit to violence-display information and strict parenting could help in curbing this act.",
        "To begin with, children are engaged in illegal activities because of a lack of good parenting. This is because most of the parents are working class which makes them create little or no time for their offspring in order to correct them when they are doing negative things. For example, according to a study carried out in Nigeria in 2010 on crimes among teenagers, it was revealed that children of working-class parents had a higher rate of illegal activities than children of their parents have their time. Thus, the incorrect way of teaching youngsters among full-time parents that are working is the main problem causing juvenile crime.",
        "Nevertheless, there are possible measures to mitigate these challenges. Firstly, there should be limitations on access to some sites for children. What this means is that  an age limit should be implemented which will restrict adolescents' access to most of these dangerous pages. Another solution is that  strict parenting should be practised among guidance. This causes fear among offspring and enables them not to misbehave in  society. Taking a soldier man as an example, a military man does not tolerate nonsense which makes their children  behave in a sinless way in the community. Hence, creating fear in a child always deters him from carrying out any form of illegal activities.",
        "In conclusion, there are increased rates of teenagers committing misconduct acts which many people believed  is  a result of information they got online. I disagree because the fault is on parents and there should be a limit for children on pages that display violence, also, parents should be strict in mentoring their offspring."
