        "Change is the only constant. All of us must have heard of this saying. Some changes in our lives occur due to inevitable circumstances, while others occur because of our choices. Although some people believe in constant transition and wish to try new things every now and then, others prefer to follow their routine life. In this essay, I will examine both ways of leading life and will state why I feel learning or going through different experiences makes your life worthwhile.",
        "Those who like to carry on with their daily tasks in the same manner and do not wish to transform have a few reasons for doing so. To begin with, they feel content and happy about their lives and their ways because, according to them, they have worked hard and are at a stage in their lives where they should just live and enjoy rather than keep themselves engaged in trying on new things. Besides, in my view, the reality is that they fear change. They know somewhere in their hearts that if they try something new and they do not like it or they fail, then that could disrupt their peaceful life. Therefore, they continue with their mundane lives.",
        "There are, however, others, myself included, who constantly thrive on change and, basically, have two major reasons for having such an attitude towards life. Their ideology is that life is too short to be doing the same stuff every single day and not trying different things, say food or travelling to new places. These people are brave and adventurous in their approach to life. Secondly, the thought of living a monotonous life scares them, and they think that trying new things will add to their existing skills or will improve them. Moreover, it gives them a sense of joy or thrill, and they feel a sense of accomplishment. For instance, people go to adventurous spots to try sky diving and paragliding in order to experience that high. Admittedly, there is no better way of living life than this one.",
        "In conclusion, even though living a comfortable life can be a choice for some, in my opinion, in such a short life, we must seek transition. If we control our fearful emotions and be brave, then we will know that living a life is very different from just leading one."
