        "I am writing this letter with regards to an advertisement that was on the Tourist Board, inviting proposals for the Best City. I would like to move my town Bandar Sunway as a likely prospect.",
        "My town is located in the heart of Petaling Jaya  and is only roughly 5 kilometres from the city centre. It can be accessible by road, which takes approximately 15 minutes without traffic and almost 45 minutes during peak hours.",
        "Although we have one of the largest malls in the city called 'Sunway Pyramid', the main attraction is a water theme park which lies adjacent to the shopping centre. 'Sunway Lagoon', or locally known as 'Lagoona' is the most happening place in the locality. On a normal day, the average number of visitors count up to 1500 persons, which is high considering that this is a township.",
        "If this town is selected as the winner, it would profusely change the lifestyle of the locals in the area, as more number of tourists would pour in, resulting in enhancement of business such as hotels, transport and accommodation.",
        "I hope that my suggestion is of interest to you, and looking forward to knowing the result of the selection.",
        "Thanking you,",
        "Yours sincerely,",
