        "Humans are planning different ways to earn pleasant money and secure their families. A section of society holds a notion that running a self-business is safer than working under some organizations. Although in own business one is his own boss and can plan the revenue accordingly, working under a reputed firm could  ensure income stability in case of some unforeseen circumstances. In my opinion, I strongly believe that a person must work under a bigger firm.",
        "To begin with, there are myriads of reasons why individuals prefer self-run trade. First and foremost, due to no time constraints in working under home business. As one can plan the work according to their own  schedule, because of no accountability to others. For example, a person running his own shop can reach the place  anytime during the day by completing other household tasks or personal assignments, if any. Secondly, an individual is the boss of his own company, hence can plan the profit of the firm suitably. While revenue depends upon various market factors like demand, an entrepreneur can work and get the task completed as per the demand of their products and can earn desired income. Moreover, various decisions regarding changes in the production or modification of existing lines  of product can be made at the sole discretion of the owner. To exemplify, involving other staff to work overtime for completing some bigger market orders can assist businessmen to earn surplus profit and can procure new assignments similarly.",
        "On the contrary, there are also numerous reasons why people prefer working in some renowned organizations. Firstly, it ensures the stability of income for the family. Since there are lots of ups and downs in the market due to various factors like inflation and  demand, a salaried person can earn fixed remuneration on a monthly basis despite all these factors. To exemplify, in the economic crisis of the year 2008, almost all the smaller businesses failed, however,  people working in the big firms survived due to receiving a continuous monthly salary. Lastly, working in a renowned firm likely provides multiple other benefits as well. Such as, an  employee can get group medical insurance, leased accommodation facility and many other extra benefits  if the cash flows of the firm are strong. Therefore, due to all these reasons, many individuals prefer working in some reputed companies.",
        "To conclude, despite having no time constraints of working under own business, I believe that a human must prefer recruitment under a renowned company because of having numerous other benefits such as a health insurance policy, a facility of leased accommodation and many more."
