        "I  hope you are all well and I am sorry for my late reply. Last week, you asked me to tell you a big news item that recently happened in China. What a coincidence, I happen to want to share a piece of up-to-date news with you.",
        "These days, I noticed that a lot of tourists have been stuck in the tour resort Sanya in Haina Province because of Covid 19 Pandemic. The local government asked them to finish two Covid acid tests within 48 hours, before which visitors were not allowed to leave the city. In addition, visitors had to pay for the accommodation by themselves, and the price of aeroplane tickets has surged to a ridiculous price.",
        "I am taken aback by the news as I have always loved to travel. I can imagine how they would feel facing such an accident. Nowadays, I don't plan to go anywhere in case I will experience what the tourists have ever experienced in the last week. I hate the Covid pandemic, and I am so longing for a normal life before the pandemic broke out in which I could travel around the world.",
