For example, in a servey happened last year it was concluded that the areas where at least four months of year was a snow season now its almost a rare thing to expect snow in those places.",
        "Furthermore, The global warming has major impact on the forest, as in the recent there been number of instances when forest fires are seen and that became the reason for extinction of the particular species in a country. For instance, Australian forests were vandalized by the fire whose ignition was found to be increased temperature which even destroyed some part of commercial and residential areas too. In these fires, the underfire places",
