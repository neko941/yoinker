        "In order to avoid global climate change, some people believed that individuals play a vital role in this phenomenon. However, others hold the opinion that solution done by individuals is ineffective and it is only huge factory and goverment can solve this problem. Both perspective have their own right as this essay will demonstrate.",
        "First and foremost, most of the daily activities that done by individuals can impact on global climate change in a number of ways. Activities such as driving, smoking and burning rubbish will release a toxic gas which is carbon monoxide that cause significant global climate change. Therefore, if ones can decrease the number of doing these kinds of activities, it will definitely help to prevent global climate change.",
        "Nevertheless, some people support the opinion that action done by individuals is ineffective and the only way to solve this problem is contribute by the changes of factory or government. Indeed, government contain the biggest capable to persuade people. Owing to this, government can conduct some of the activities and give knowledge about the drawbacks of global climate change to people. Moreover, huge factory namely chemical factory produce many waste products that may increase the seriousness of global climate change. If these factory or company can reduce the production of waste products, undoubtedly, will have a better result in prevent global climate change.",
        "From my point of view, I think that it is important for individuals, government and large company to collaborate together in order to produce a effective method to slove the problem. For instance, government can held an activity and invite individuals and large company to work together. It is more powerful when everyone cooperate in doing one thing.",
        "In the conclusion, individuals, government and large factory also play a significant role to help prevent global climate change."
