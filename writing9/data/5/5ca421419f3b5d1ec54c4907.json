        "Children are flooded with play items from all their relatives, especially their parents, on various events like birthdays. While, there are certainly benefits of having many toys, as they help in mental growth of the young, they also have associated health and habitual problems.",
        "Children, at this age are learning whatever they experience around them. During this age, a baby recognizes and remembers the figures a toy represents, like an elephant or a train. This is very important for their mental growth, as they are gaining the ability to picturize and store what they see. As more of the games are kept near them, more real world things they will be able to relate and identify. When my niece, who is 3 years old, visited the zoo last week, she was able to relate her elephant shaped teddy with the animal in the park.",
        "If we look at disadvantages, the top contender is the health hazard. Many toys, these days, are made of rubber, which is not suitable for any child. With too many of the toys around, it can cause infection to them, and can result in more complications because of their young age. The packaging of these articles itself mentions that they should be kept away from the children as it can cause suffocation. In addition to this, another downside what parents usually face, is that children get habituated to having so many toys around them, that they cannot stay at any other place except their home.",
        "In conclusion, while the growth of the brain increasing is an important advantage, the health issues and wrong habits arising from excessive number of toys are unfavorable conditions."
