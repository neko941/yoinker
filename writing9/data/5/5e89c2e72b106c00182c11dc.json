        "There are split opinions about choosing the living places. Some believes that urban areas are the ideal place to live , whereas others believe that living in the country is better which can lead to the healthy and happy life. I think that living in a large city creates a wide variety of opportunities in terms of education , job and entertainment.",
        "On the one hand, it can be argued that most people prefer to live in an urban area. This is because it is very likely for individuals to find a job that is relevant to their field of study. Nowadays , job market is strong for a wide range of industries that attract young professionals. For example , it is unrealistic to get a technology-oriented job in a small town when these rules are packed into urban centers. Moreover , there are more educational opportunities and a lot of information and news to improve study skills.",
        "On the other hand, it is believed by some that rural areas can offer more opportunities when it comes to improving health or living in the neighborhood where there is a sense of belonging among people. In the countryside , people can enjoy unspoiled air unless there is no big factory near there , which in turn increases their productivity and job satisfaction. Another fact is that residents of the small towns have a reputation for having strong social bonding , and it creates a peace atmosphere where everyone can feel himself/herself as a part of one society. Finally, rural living can offer a less stressful life. It is considered as the most appropriate place for the sole proprietor or remote worker who is looking to exit the race of traffic jams and noisy cubicles.",
        "In conclusion, I would say that rural areas are the most ideal places to lead a healthy and happy lifestyle , despite cities also have its benefits in terms of educational and job facilities."
