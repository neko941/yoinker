        "It is one of the fundamental duty of authorities to spend equal amount of money on sport facilities as they do on college libraries. Physical activities function as an important facilitator to improve health of the students which yields positive impact on their studies as well. I strongly believe that the college administrators should concentrate on both, the academics and sport facilities. This essay will explore the reasons for this.",
        "To begin with, there is no doubt that scholars and toppers are helpful in building reputation of any educational institution. However, the role of physical education in the life of under graduates cannot be overlooked. In today\u2019s era, due to advancement in educational system, an intense pressure is built on the student to perform better and score higher grades in examinations. A competitive environment leads to stressful circumstances and demotivates the candidates if they are not able to fulfill the expectation of his family and teachers. Therefore, it is vital for every university to have sport centers and invest in sport functions, so that candidates are able to cope up with the hectic situation and work hard in their academics as well.",
        "Secondly, everybody nowadays is leading a sedentary lifestyle due to busy schedules. Less importance is being attached to physical health of candidates. Sports and fitness activities help us to live a healthy life. Universities should help in building overall well-being of student by creating recreational facilities for them. For instance, a student who does not indulge in any kind of fitness activity might makes his brain dull, thereby making it difficult for him to indulge in studies.",
        "In conclusion, I personally believe that equal importance should be attached to health and educational facilities. Therefore, universities should equally allocate their budget to the libraries and sport facilities.."
