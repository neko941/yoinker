        "Books have not avoided the process of modernization. Thus, nowadays people keep information not in paper, but in digital storages on the Internet. I believe that this has more benefits than drawbacks.",
        "There are certain disadvantages connected with storing knowledge on the Internet. Firstly, because the Internet keeps billions of information units, it is often difficult to find reliable source that can be trusted. For example, such a situation leads to a rise of gutter press that with the help of the Internet can spread not proven information all around the world. Secondly, keeping all the information on the Internet, we are making the process of plagiarism and infringement of copyright easier. As result, books get downloaded without giving credits and money to an author.",
        "Despite this, there are the number of advantages. By storing knowledge on the Internet and not in physical books, we are making the process of knowledge and skills obtaining easier. Couple of decades ago, people needed to have money to get necessary informaton. Now, nearby with pay-per-view webpages, there are thousands of free sources everyone has access to. Moreover, books are not reliable in comparison with modern technologies. For instance, in the wide range of countries in different periods of time knowledge stored in books was eliminated because new governments in these countries were not agree with authors' point of view and these books were considered as a threat to their political regime. If there had existed the Internet in those times, a lot of knowledge would have been saved.",
        "Summing up, I stick to the opinion that advantages outweight disadvantages because they are proving that the Internet helps knowledge to be saved and multiplied."
