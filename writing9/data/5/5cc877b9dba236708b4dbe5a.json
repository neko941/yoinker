        "There has been an unending debate in the society as to who is responsible for proper maintenance of our environment. Some hold the view that onus is on individuals to ensure a clean environment while others believed the state should oversee this. I believe keeping our surrounding clean is the responsibility of both government and the people.",
        "Those that hold the view that individuals should cater for their environment believe so because people are closer to the environment. This proximity give room for citizens to clean their immediate surrounding. This can be done through the use of waste bin, recycling plastics and incineration. By disposing off their rubbish properly; the environment will be tidy.",
        "As for others, who are of the opinion that the state should take charge of this responsibility, they do so because government is expected to provide social amenities and keeping the environment clean is part of this. Since, funds are available to them in abundance, they expect that waste deposal and environmental sanitation should solely be their responsibility. For instance, in Lagos state, there is an agency created by the government to manage waste disposal and ensure clean environment, they also enact laws against open defecation and reckless disposal of solid waste. This has been keeping Lagos tidy.",
        "In conclusion, keeping the environment clean is germane for healthy living. I hold a view that we are all responsible for keeping it fit. Individuals should ensure that they dispose their waste properly using appropriate mean for each category of rubbish and the government on her part should create functioning agency to cater for community waste with adequate laws to support them."
