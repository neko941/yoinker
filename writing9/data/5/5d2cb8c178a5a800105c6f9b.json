        "Concern about environmental degradation has been increased these days and it is only the responsibility of government and large private or public limited businesses to improve the environment whereas there is no role of individuals to protect the environment. I completely disagree with this statement. In this essay I will support my disagreement by giving reasons.",
        "Firstly, environment is not only the home of government officials or large scale businessmen however it supports each and every individual that is living on this planet. For example, oxygen in the environment is utilised by almost every living creature. Secondly, environment cannot be improved just by few people that are taking measures because other person keep exploiting tge resources and even littering on public places . Unless each and every person cannot understands the consequences of the depleted surroundings there is no scope of achieving the targets of having clean and pollution free environment.",
        "Moreover, government can make laws to ensure that people do not deteriorate the natural resources. In addition to this, they can put some penalty on such people. Also large companies can only invest in their wastage treatment plants to make them more efficient. Even the government has now created a new policy that each company has to invest some of its revenue on various environmental issues to make the environment better , but it cannot be improved without the help of common people. Hence, it is very necessary for each individual to take care of this blue planet.",
        "To conclude, everyone\u2019s participation is important whether a person is a government official, CEO of a multi-business company or a common man. This is the only way to protect our environment and make it a better place to survive."
