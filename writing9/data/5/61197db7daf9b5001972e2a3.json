        "There is a big number of markets which are offering its products by the internet. In consequence, many customer have migrated to buy some product in online shopping, but there is a part of customer that continue going to the physical stores. It is disagee that online store will lead to all stores in towns closing. Analize the importance of experience of shopping, as well as the necesity of assistance to buy some kinds of product, may helps us to understand why stores in towns will not close.",
        "First, a great number of consumers buy things because they enjoy the experience of going to the physical shop. For instance, Apple's stores offer to their clients a great experience to its clients, let them the oportunity of interact with all the devices that they sell in the store. This experience can not be offered by online shopping, just might be achieve in physical stores. For that, shops in cities will not be closed as a consequence of online shopping",
        "",
        "Second, the adquisition of many things need the support from experts to understand which product will helps us. For example, when a client need tools to repair their homes, they need all the materials to do the task, but they also need an explanation of how the tools and materials must be used. Even if we recieve this assistance by the internet, I think the support will not be the same if we talk face to face with the expert. As a result, companies will maintain opened stores in towns, so those will not be replaced by online shopping.",
        "In sumary, in some markets, factors as the experience of buy and the needess of support to know the products will help to maintain opened the stores in towns. It is disagree with the statement that Online shopping will lead to all physical shop closing. In the future, the companies maybe will offer both kind of stores."
