        "Older advancements in technology  were more efficient and it transformed the lives of the ordinary people  than current technology will.",
        "In my opinion,i completely disagree with this assertion as they  were very slow and it  required more expertise to carry out .",
        "A major reason why the  electronic gadgets used in the olden days were  not productive was  because they were not fast in delivering. To further explain, when a message is to be delivered, before it is processed and taken to the intended recipient, a lot of time would have been spent,thereby delaying the purpose of the  message . For example,when  delivery was to be done using Postal box,   two weeks to one month  should have gone by,  before the message is delivered. Hence this made it ineffective.",
        "Another important point to consider is that  most of the employers required a lot of trainings to perform their  duties.To further simplify, due to the low  literacy level seen at the time,  most of the workers were not able to discharge their duties effectively.  Consequently, this stalled their performance . For instance, hybrid computers which was in operation during the early 1900's, needed a lot of trained personnels to be able to operate It. Because people were not literate enough it ,it led to further decline in the rate of technological use .",
        "To conclude, previous advances in technology  never yielded a good outcome more than this present technological devices as    the older  system  had need of hands on trainings to handle its activities and it was unreliable."
