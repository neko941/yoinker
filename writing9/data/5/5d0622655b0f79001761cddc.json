        "It is arguable by many that historic sits and museums should not charge an entree fee to children under the age of 18 years. In contrary, others believe that all people should pay a ticket in order to enter these important locations. In this short communication I will attempt to explain why, in my opinion, these sites should be free for underage visitors.",
        "Visiting an important location from our nations past or seeing an objects of great importance enreach us both intelectually and spiritually. Intelectually, by visiting a museum we broaden our knowledge and learn new facts and events from our history. Spiritually, by using different senses like touch, smell and vision we enreach our imagination and dreams. As an example, by visiting the old city of Jerusalem we can learn about the ancient Jewish culture. Furthermore, this knowledge is combined with the smells, visions and texture of the old city thus further expanding our experience.",
        "As previously mentioned, I believe museums and historic sites sould be free to children and adolescents, since I think it will lead to increased visitations in these locations. Allowing children to enter for free will allow many families who couldn't efford it until now to come. As a consexuence more and more children will be able to gain knowldege and culture.",
        "In conclusion, mueseums and historic sites are imprtant to us all as they teach as about our sociaty and culture. By allowing our children to gain free access to it we maintain our knowledge and histoory."
