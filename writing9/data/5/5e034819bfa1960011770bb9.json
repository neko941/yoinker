        "It is argued that authorities should allocate more money on the education of technological subjects such as science than rest of the study areas. This essay will layout the facts that partially agree with this statement. Al thought it is imperative to have the knowledge of science in the modern world, it is also necessary to students to learn art, history and politics for the future.",
        "Nowadays, science and technology plays a significant part in the world. Every aspect of the life is associated with this particular subject. For instance, thank to the innovations of technology people are travelling quicker than they used to do. Also, equipment such as smartphone has made the life of 21 century more easier. Hence, in order to cope up with the highly technological world, student should have the expertise of this subject stream. Because, without it they would not be able to face the demands of the future world.",
        "On the other hand, increasing the investment on science would discourage children form studying other subject areas. Subjects such as art, history and politics are equally crucial for tomorrow. Think of a society that only have the knowledge of science for example, it would be like living among robots. Because, people should have the capability to appreciate a good song or a drama, which makes them humans. Moreover, there is a significant influence to the world form study areas such as politics. Politicians are the one who control the world if they do not have the required expertise that would lead to great tragedies.",
        "In conclusion, despite the fact that knowledge of science and technology is in fact vital for the future, the world could not survive with only the people who have the technical expertise. Hence, I agree that governments should put more funding to tech science but not the expense of other subject streams."
