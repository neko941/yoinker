        "Nowadays, medical side is open for everyone who take knowledge. All popularity have nearly 20 percent command on medical education. So, some human beings get preference to take advice for health issue. In my thinking it is positive process because today living style is vast . but , sometime taking appointment of doctor is much better option.",
        "To begin with, younger are not interested to visit a doctor because they have busy schedule any way, they prefer to get information via internet. For example, in metro city travelling time is nearly 2-3 hours. Due to these reason, they choose online consultation and then take medicines.",
        "Secondly, some family they do not have ability as well as they are afraid to face physician because they shy to discuss their issue face to face. Although, they go with take advice from home and overcome from health problems. for instance, some women related health affection, ladies do not share their problems frequently in front of a doctor. Moreover, they prefer online treatment.",
        "Thirdly, digital conference are available in different type of sites as well as many application are their. Moreover, medicines are also accessible online via application. In other hand, it is sometimes positive furthermore its negative. For this purpose, people should take online consultation. on the other hand, for other treatment like scanning, X- ray, MRI etc. they have to meet doctor. If they don\u2019t follow these therapy then they get injured for lifetime.",
        "To be specific, every physician do not have online service . equally,  in covid-19 pandemic situation some people get online therapy as well as medicines but they have to visit doctor for collecting blood sample as well as sometimes for scanning also. But one problem is that, at the situation of breathing problem they have bed with oxygen cylinder and because of increasing cases people can not find bed in their nearest hospital. That is the main draw back of online consultation other doctor don\u2019t know about people history to do immediate therapy.",
        "Lastly, in my conclusion, \u201c every coin has two side\u201d online advices save time and they are needful for emergency but, face to face consultation is also beneficial for human. they go for both as per situation."
