        "Some would argue that men are always placed as leaders in their jobs while other says that the government should open the same opportunity for women. I believe that the government should give the same portion of leadership to women because they have the same quality as men and some position are better to be handled by women.",
        "Women nowadays are different from 30 years ago. They now have the same passion and dedication to study and to work in fields that mostly conducted by men such as engineering and architecture. They have also shown remarkable achievement as equal as men and manage to show their hard work, logical thinking, discipline and resilient attitude in order to strive for success. For example Oprah Winfrey manage to have a successful TV network because of her hard work.",
        "Several position are better to be handled by women because they have better strtategy and they also know how to manage it properly and gain trust from their targeted market. Fashion industry is one of the examples and women who rules in this industry have manage to make their mark as one of the most successful leader. Donatela Versace is  one of the most notorious leaders in the fashion industry in the 21st century and known for her successful brand Versace.",
        "In conclusion, the government are advice to save high-level jobs for women because I believe women will show their quality and strength same as men and also will perform better if given a chance to rule in some positions."
