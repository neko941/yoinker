        "It is argued that, it will create many difficulties, if old age people above sixty are allowed to work. In my opinion, I completely disagree with the statement because, as they got vast experience they can be given different role such as handling people or can be advisors for the betterment of the organization.",
        "To embark upon, they are the best diplomatics and are better in handling different types of people. Due to their enormous exposure in meeting different people throught out their career. They can easily judge people and talk accordingly, most important thing is they can motivate people through their experience and knowledge to give best. For example, Indian cricket team, head coach Sunil Gavaskar who was the main pillar in winning world cup   2011, after two defeat in first two matches, he was the one took charge and motivate players by sharing his experience on such a big platform and then after rest is the history.",
        "Additionally, they can be the right person in advising in certain situation and predicting any threat in near future for the business. While expanding any business, they plays an important role due to their immense knowledge of market and they predict quiet easily any problems or threata in near future. For example, Facebook\u2019s seniro advisor Kabir singh was the man behind for buying company called whatsapp for 19 billion and it turned out to be the best deal ever in the history.",
        "In conclusion, I strongly disagree  becauses age old people are big asset for any organization in handling people and guiding for the betterment with the help of their experience."
