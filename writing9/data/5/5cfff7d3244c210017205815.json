        "Economical stability and growth is a crusial aspect in preventing poverty and hunger. Achieveing finicial growth may ocur in different ways and that depends largely on its natural resorces. For example, in coutries where crops can be grown finicial gain can be made through exporting. For instance, Israel export fruits and vegetables all over the world. Another example can be seen in Holland where flowers are grown and shipped worldwide. Also, by mining local mineral many coutries have increased and strengthened their economy. Classic example for this can be seen in African states like Sudan and Congo. Regrdless of the way, Increased production and export lead to influx of money and the increased economical condition of the population.",
        "Regrdless of the way, the main downside of economical gowth lies in the major environmental effetc it cause. Destroying the natural landscape through mining causse devistating effect on the natural landscape and wild life. Furthermore, industrealization and increased air polution is an unwanted effwct caused by increased use of cars and airplains.",
        "In my opinion there are other, substantially better ways address poverty without effecting our environmet. Initially, education on how to raise local crops such as corn and rise can assist the population. Aside from that, using environmentally friendly materials to optimize daly life can drasticly improve poverty. Example to that include the use of recycled materials for buiding houses, and using solar energy for electricity.",
        "In conclusion, although economical growth is an imprtant way to fight overty, I believe we can find better, enviromentaly friendly ways, to assist people."
