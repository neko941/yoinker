        "Foreing films are more popular in society than national films. This might be caused by developed film industry in other countries, productivity of foreign producers, and interesting content of films for local people. In my opinion, local film industries should be provided with financial support by states to imporove the quality and the number of produced films.",
        "As the first point, people like watching foreign movies to reach more qualified content both as visual and technical, and this could be gathered by higher opportunities in industry. For example, movies like the Matrix or Titanic used cutting edge equipment and technology for their time, while advanced actors and actresses shouldered the roles to convey the qualified screenplay to people. Another point is the hige number of films produced by different countries. Especially in industries like Hollywood and Bollywood, it is easier to bring a movie into the world, hence there are several films in various categoies. When we come to interests, as well as the genre of the movie, watching different cultures and perspectives is more attractive for people than seeing local and usual topics.",
        "While inspecting the reason for the popularity of foreign films among the local people, we can say the opinion that government should support film industries financally. Firstly, national industries need economic improvements to enhance the technical infrastructure so that they could produce better quality work. Secondly, it drives actors and actresses to stay in the local industry rather that migration to other countries to look for their career opportunities. Finally, the number films in different types would rise with the help of economic support, therefore more people would be attracted to local movies.",
        "In conclusion, people like watching foreign movies because of developed and fertile film industries, as well as keeping people's attention with different culture and idea sharing. MEeting these criteria for local film industries can be provided by governments by giving technical support. Hence local industries will have the chance to enhance."
