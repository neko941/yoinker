        "Nowadays , most of the family turned into small family year after year. some people think that small family is more better than joint family . There are numerous advantages and disadvantages of having a nuclear family than a large family.",
        "With regards to the positive effect or advantages , while living in a small family parents can concentrate on their children's education easily without any restrictions . For instance if we live in large family with in-laws may refuse some kind of education that are more expensive . Sometimes that may cause collusion between family members . Another important advantage is that , small family make the parents and children are independent and strong in mind because small family teaches the children more focused about their education and also with career . So that make thae children more mature. A case in point is that, most of thae grandparents keep their grand children for carefully and these over caring make the children more dependent and naughty.",
        "",
        "On the flip side , there are numerous disadvantages for small family than a large family. firstly , small family make more responsible than large family . The main problem is that , in a joint or large family all members divide their responsibility and the main controler of thae family the main parent of the house . That may reduce the burden of diffent difficult responsibilies. Secondly , increse the burden of parents especially mothers'. The point is that , for meeting the expenses , womens needed to go for a job , take care about their children and also do work in thier home too. This make the womens' more tired . As we compared this situation with a large family all women caan share the duty with others and that improve relationship between others.",
        "",
        "To recapitulate that, nuclear family and lrge family have its own advantages and disadvantages . The fact is that, most of them like to live in a small family beacause they need more freedom and more space for their enjoyment . For getting these kind of benefits, parents are ready to sacrifice all the problems or difficulties related to the small family."
