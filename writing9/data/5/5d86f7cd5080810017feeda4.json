        "Many technological advances have incorporated computers into education sector. Few believe that they have a positive growth, whilst others disagree that it will lead to adverse ramifications. This essay will discuss both the sides of the argument.",
        "All the latest equipment\u2019s has great impact on kids learning. More information is available which is the added advantage, as it helps to gain knowledge without pain. They provide more stuffs than their teachers. As an illustration, all the school assignments and doubts are cleared with this. Candidates can clear doubts by watching education YouTube channel and also surf more in Wikipedia. By this all activities are done by self and also by own interest. It is therefore agreed that technology is more helpful in this particular sector.",
        "However, they also have other side as they diminish real human interaction. They play a vital role, in keeping up our cultures, teach manners and how to behave with each other. For instance, people tend to communicate with others via skype, WhatsApp etc. Many do not know how to behave in a public crowd, they tend to be the same for all age groups. Due to this there is lack of respect that needs to be maintained with few people those who are elders to them.",
        "In conclusion, while the benefits of technology, particularly the internet, allow students to tap in to limitless sources of information, some still feel that people should be wary of this new phenomenon and not allow it to curb face to face interaction. However, as long as we are careful to keep in mind the importance of human interaction in education, the educational benefits are clearly positive."
