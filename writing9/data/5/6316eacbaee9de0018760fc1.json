        "In this day and age, English is a crucial way to communicate with the world. The argument over whether learning the English language in an English-speaking nation is the best but not the only method to acquire language has long captured the interest of both the academic world and the public alike. This essay will agree and elaborate on some precedents to justify this problem.",
        "First and foremost, the primary merit would appear to be good English education at school. This means that in this modern era, there are many countries considering English as a main subject in their education. Because of this, almost all students are taught English from an early age at school and there are definitely many English exams for students. Besides, teachers are provided a stable platform of this language at a high level . By this way, learners can learn English without studying abroad in English countries to acquire this language. For instance, Viet Nam is a country which considers English as its second language. This is the reason why its students are educated in English from primary school to University. Especially, its learners do not need to go to some English countries to study this language.",
        "Furthermore, a well-known factor relates to the assistance of the Internet . That is to say, in contemporary society, the Internet provides people who want to learn English a huge amount of websites related to English such as dictionaries, grammar checks, or English newspapers. Moreover, the Internet can help them to study indirectly with some native teachers by some online meetings. In addition, learners can learn by using some apps on the internet that improve their English skills. It is a fact that they even can study English everywhere that they only need the Internet. This is also a convincing reason why people can study English without going to some English nations.",
        "As already discussed in the above essay, It is undeniable that people can learn English without going to some English countries because of some upsides including good English education at school and the help of the Internet. To me, I think we can easily learn English by a closer way that we can go to some foreign walking street to communicate with foreigners. This method can also assist us to improve our English skill."
