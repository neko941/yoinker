        "Most of the employed people do almost zero to no physical activity during weekdays or in their leisure time which results in health disorder. Shortage of free time  and house hold responsiblities are th main reasons why people are not able to actively involve in doing exercise. This essay is going to discuss the possible solution to this problem.",
        "Working professional get very less time on weekdays, moreover when they get free time they have other household responsibilities to fufill as a priority. Office goers on average spend 9 hours working and commuting which leaves them with no time. As per a recent article in a journal, there is so much of competition in the market that people have to even think of strategies to combat the competitors even in their free time.So, people are mentally occupied even in their free time either with household responsibilites or office work.",
        "This problem can be solved easily, if the organisation that the responsibility of their employees health. A Health and recreational room inside the office should be built which is equipped with some basic machines and has some free space where people can do aerobics or do simple exercises. In this way, people would be involved in some physical exercise on a daily basis for atleast 15-30 minutes. For example, in my previous organisation, HR people used to demonstrate simple exercises in the recreational room and it was mandatory for employees to follow them. This helps members to move away from the monotony of sedentary lifestyle, which results in less health problems.",
        "To sum up,while people do not get enough physical acitivity during weekdays due to lack of time and household responsibilities, organisations can solve this problem by building Health and Recreational room inside the office premises."
