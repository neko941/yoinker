        "It is an ongoing trend witnessed around the world that many people travel overseas for either work or education. Its is agreed that linguistic barrier is one the serious issues faced by such people. Feelings of loneliness, unacceptability at workplace and difficulties in expression are few challenges endured by immigrants and students who travel to far off lands in the hope of doing great.",
        "Language is an indispensable tool of communication. Learning a new language requires years of practice to attain fluency and command. Inability to speak in the native/local language impacts the confidence of a newly joined employees or students. It makes them feel unwelcomed and are also misunderstood by the employer and colleagues. Moreover, failure of verbal expression gradually secludes them from the social group which at times leads to loneliness and soon depression. It also creates trouble with the government officials and working. For instance, a study done by UNESCO showed Sydney as the second most unwelcoming city towards immigrants.",
        "Furthermore, students who find difficulty in comprehending the language perform poorly at the university level which often leads them to be bullied and mocked by fellow classmates. Many people who find the language complicated to speak and understand face hardships in find locating areas or using the public transport. Chances of getting robbed and tricked by the local goons or shopkeepers, who take advantage of this inability, are high. One of my friends who went to Paris for graduation was deceived by her own classmates and was strangled at a dingy place.",
        "In conclusion, learning the formal language is highly recommended to people travelling or immigrating as this can enhance their chances of adapting to the new country well. Know-how of the language can cause not just social troubles but can also have practical implications on living and lifestyle of people."
