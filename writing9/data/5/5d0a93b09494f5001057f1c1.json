        "Most young lads get involved in social vices as a result of peer pressure. The kind of friends they move with is a function of the environment where they find themselves. For instance, there is a high tendency that a person that associates with a criminally minded person or a person who steals for a living will end being a thief. More also, a younglad that mingles with people with an extremely high taste will want to meet up with such extravagant lifestyle even if it means cutting corners. Additionally, lack of parental care is another reason for this. Most parent don't really care about the children's wellbeing and are less concern where they get the provision from. For instance, a child that lacks basic needs may fend for himself illegally.",
        "However, the government can curb this menace by punishing offenders. This will serve as a deterrent to others. The police should be well equipped with modern facilities so that they can carryout their job effectively and efficiently. In addition, more jobs should be provided. Those in the helms of affairs of the country should establish a program aimed at training younglad as well as providing support to enable them start up a business. This will help keep them busy and also improve their well being and also develop the economy.",
