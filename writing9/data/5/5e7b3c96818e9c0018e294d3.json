        "These days, in many countries, the need for man labor has been shorted as a result of achievements in technology and automation. Many people think that because of this, it is necessary to reduce working time. I agree with this statement and why I will explain below.",
        "To outline the disadvantages of modern technology and automation show that if working hours are short, this can affect the wages of workers. Also, accordingly, labor will decline under the gaze of people. In addition, prices will rise day by day, and this negatively affects people's lifestyle. As a result, problems with high prices and shortcomings arise between the people.",
        "On the other hand, although there are some minuses of reducing labor hours, but this also has several advantages. Firstly, thanks to technology this will beneficial for people, because they will have more leisure time for doing other activities such as sport and improve their health condition, as well as they will be much more time surrounded by family and friends. Additionally,  shorter working hours can give employees more conveniences and this allows them to travel and relax. Finally, this is the best way to combat with stress, therefore  if people work 6-7 hours a day they can pay attention to themselves and be away from unpleasant cases.",
        "To sum up, Despite the fact that this decision will lead to negative consequences, government have to still reduce the working time of people as a result of the growth of automation. In my opinion, the government should look after and solve this problem for the convenience of people in their lives."
