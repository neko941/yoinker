        "Nowadays, spending a lot of rupees for entertainment has become controversial issue. Although, some people find it is positive for everyone, while others see it as a negative aspect. Even, in my view, I think it has a good implementation despite having some negative effect.",
        "On the one hand of argument, regarding its negative development, opponent of this argument who thinks paying money on the ticket price of sporting and cultural events is wastage. In other words, they do not find its relevance for living. For example, purchasing 5 kg apple in cost Rs. 500 have far significance than spending on the movie ticket of Rs. 500, because apple is good for a person's health. In addition, according to them, there are always other options of the entertainment like playing sports, hang-out with friends. Hence, they have defined it as \"illogical spending\".",
        "On the other hand, those who supports the idea of spending on these social activities, find it as an opportunity of economic development. They believe that it has improved the economy of the country because these are the medium to collect taxes from the citizens. Furthermore, it promotes and provide an opportunity to a person who wants to become an actor or player. If no one will watch these programs, there will no chance to get an opportunity. For instance, Sachin Tendulkar got the global platform and now, have become an identity of India cricket because he was supported by people.",
        "Lastly, these programs are so creative in every term that it will definitely benefits audience's vision and insights. Ultimately, audience will develop good perspective.",
        "In conclusion, despite having some negative aspects, it's positive influence completely weighed it down. I think it is good to have an international attention along with an opportunities."
