        "Nowadays,  there are different views regarding the children's educational and development activities.It is considered by a few individuals that children need additional classes apart from their regular  schooling, while others think that they must allocate some duration in physical activities too.In my opinion children should not only have schooling, but also be facilitated with considerable amount of time in physical activities.",
        "Children are required to attend additional classes in situations where if the kid has a very low IQ or if there are any specific subjects which require more sessions for understanding the content. Therefore, in such  situations children are ought to be sent for extra classes.For an example,in the year 2015  i attended  extra classes, because i  was too weak in physics, therefore i used to attend more sessions after my college hours, which improved my score.",
        "Kids are being sent to additional classes to achieve higher marks in their studies, but by involving  their whole day at the sessions, they are loosing their physical fitness which is very much essential for the development of the kids.For an instance, a recent survey conducted at US in 2015, has demonstrated that there is a rapid increase in various nutritional deficiencies in children under the age of 15 years,due to the lack of physical activities.So a part of the routine educational classes, kids must also be provided extra time for activities such as indoor games and outdoor games.",
        "In conclusion, i believe that kids should be  allocated with certain time for the physical activities other than regular studies. However, based on the child's IQ status, if required they should are supposed to sent to extra classes as well."
