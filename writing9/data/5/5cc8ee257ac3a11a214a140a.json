        "Youngsters below the age of 18 are seen as minors, thus many people  think that it is  better not to charge them whenever they visit such places like, museums and historic sites. In my opinion, offering all children free entrance would be problematic, and therefore should be offered to certain minors.",
        "Making these cultural centres open without charges for under eitheens would incur so much expenses for the government and the society. This is because allowing such would attract lots of children thereby resulting to overcrowding, and consequently leading to damages to the facilities due to difficulty in controlling them by the staffs. In order to repair the damaged structures, extra money would be needed which sometimes would come from the funds to be used in other public services. Furthermore, leaving these sites open without entrance fee for kids makes them to loose their values thus, demoting the prestige ascribed to them.",
        "Nevertheless,  few children can be granted access without pay. For example, in schools, certain parents found it difficult to pay tuition  for their offspring not to talk about paying extra money for such things like, escortion, due to poverty. Therefore, teachers could assess these poor chaps in their classes and those who prove more intelligent and smart could be selected to visit as a way of compensating them for their effort. As a result, the poor students are encouraged to work harder in order to be included in all the activities of their schools.",
        "In conclusion, despite peoples' view, I still believe that leaving  museums and historic places without entrance charges for individuals below 18 would not be easy for some countries with bad economy and could only be feasible if selected youngsters are considered."
