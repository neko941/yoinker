        "Nowadays, with development of science and technology, people\u2019s lives have been changed to a great extent, but the arts should not be overlooked for their own contributions.",
        "Arts are important in people\u2019s life, they can teach us  many things. Firstly, every piece of music, painting or  book is a window to another person\u2019s heart. Thus, when people observe art, they can see the world from a new and different perspective. It in stills in us empathy and the ability to connect with others from different backgrounds. For example, listening to certain rap songs arouses us  to sympathize with those people living in  poverty or facing  discrimination.",
        "Furthermore, the arts teach us that there is value in emotions and passion, since these elements allow artists to create awe-inspiring works. Too often are people judged by their ability to think rationally or logically, so the arts serves as a counterweight by teaching the society that other characteristics can be just as useful. For instance, Picasso\u2019s imagination and self-expression have led him to create paintings that have inspired countless potential artists.",
        "Finally, the arts can teach us morals and ethics, mostly through books and texts. It isno exaggeration to say that writers have shaped much of human society, for their words have instilled in us important principles like love and kindness as well as various lessons on life. The novel The Lord of the Rings, for instance, has inspired me to persevere even when faced with challenging circumstances.",
        "In conclusion, I believe that the arts have a lot to offer because they have broadened our horizons, exposed us to the value of artistic characteristics, and teach us important life lessons."
