According to my opinion, I observe that accomodation should be at own home immensely superior and essential experience.",
        "Firstly, there is no doubt living with faimly at home children are exclusively safe and secure. They are under parental support and liable to puntual of the time.Even, they do not have create such chances to become popular in immoralities and out of control. Frequently, these adolescents can be prevent and adequate traffic jams on road.whenever they are leaving from home. Afterwards, time is crucial for students and has protected. Consequently, despite of that personal budget can survived and health issues abstain them from enourmous various sorts of serious disease. Although, to enure that they are completely independent from such part time jobs.",
        "Secondly, it has assured that, the adults living at home rathar than hostels, because these children are hands of their parents.However, parents better understandable for their growing. Parents are always associated with their children and with have correlations. Moreover, these sorts of children obsequious of their parents forever. In order to, that schooling well at schools for their performance and their results are rewarded top(zenith) marks in exam. The whole credit comprises(encompasses) their home living with parents. My riad children want to live at home due to disterbunce at sharing room with others in which they study lonely and derived preparation for exams.",
        "On the other hand, those children who is living at hostels for some their personal issues unfortunately. Simultaneously, either their hostels are on distance and they need significant role of life which is not possible at hostels as they have to follow school necessary general rules in which they are bound. myriads of them are involved in immpermissble affairs with ladies candidates.",
        "By way of conclusion, although it is a common belief that accomodation should be at home. Personally, in my view that children are children. Fundamentally, they have to accommodate at home instead of far away from home until they mature."
