        "Due to high cost of living in today\u2019s world, most individuals spend a large chunk of their adult life working. Therefore, feelings about one\u2019s job reflect the individual\u2019s wellbeing, because of which job satisfaction is required. There are a myriad of factors that contribute to job satisfaction, a few of which I will list below.",
        "One important factor of job satisfaction is an attractive fixed salary. To survive in a world where the prices of daily necessities keep increasing, a good salary is required. People are interested in jobs that provide them a salary in which they can afford to pay rent and other necessities like groceries and bills.",
        "Another factor is job security with a good work-life balance. A person can move forward in life and fulfil all physiological needs only if the basic need of security is fulfilled. People also wish to have enough time to spend with their loved ones which can only be achieved with appropriate working hours.",
        "Good working conditions are also required for contentment at work. Workers need to feel safe and respected in order to perform their best and achieve their targets.",
        "I believe, that these expectations are realistic and can be fulfilled by companies. The managers or any individual at a higher post must understand that the company can develop only if its workers are happy and content with their jobs. Safety can be ensured by behaviour seminars and serious actions against registered complaints. Help lines can be set up to manage stress faced by the employees.",
        "Overall, it may be said that job satisfaction can be achieved in several ways and it is important of the welfare and development of an individual."
