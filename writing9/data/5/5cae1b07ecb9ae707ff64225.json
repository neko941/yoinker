        "These days every single person has a intelligent phone or even a tablet which help them in different ways, but the most common is the interaction. My approach is that it has more positive critireas which can be seen by each day and it helps create new relationships on the way too.",
        "The first and most important reason why is because you can know others more. For instance, the young people prefer making an online friendship and wait two or three months before knowing the other person face-to-face. Although, a great development of friendhood before know them in real life can help to have a trustable and understanding envioronment with the time. Maybe in the future people will prefer only talking in social media than do it in a restaurant or a house.",
        "Related to this first reason another benefit of the technology is to keep in touch all the time. Nowadays, according to a scientific study it is estimated that more people prefer to take roadtrips by themself to explore other countries than be with more people. Meanwhile, their families can be worried about what they are doing and when they are going to be back, because of this the telephones make a huge resource with sensational results because in one second a text is send and in minutes you have the answer. The relationship and the communication the family and the traveler has will never break, thanks to the technology.",
        "In conclusion, the new technology has a mesmerize result in our days with a positive progress of how people interact like know others more and keep in touch all the time."
