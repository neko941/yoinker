        "Nowadays, supermarkets are being expanded and developed rapidly into the remote areas as well, thereby affecting the local businesses too. Some people think that due to the domination of supermarkets, local businesses might get shutdown and ultimately causing the eradication of local communities. While, others think the quite opposite. I strongly agree with the given statement and in this essay, I will discuss both the views and the arguments supporting them.",
        "On the one hand, due to the extensive development and expansion of supermarkets, many people are inclined towards them as they tend to offer plethora of commodities in them. First of all, due to the numerous options and as well as exciting offers provided by the supermarkets, consumers are attracted towards supermarkets and prefer them over the typical local stores. As a result, local businesses get affected and thereby, they are forced to shut their businesses down. Consequently, this results in the unemployment of the people associated with the local businesses as well. Thereafter, forcing the local and remote area people to migrate to other places for better employment, ultimately causing the death of local communities.",
        "On the contrary, the businesses of local stores might increase due to the proliferating competition with the supermarkets. Though, many people are attracted to the offers and discounts offered by the supermarkets, some people go for buying goods at the local businesses only in some remote and rural areas. For instance, some people have issues like lack of trust on quality of goods sold by supermarkets and they prefer goods of local traders only. However, this might not be the case these days due to increasing urbanisation.",
        "To conclude, I strongly believe that supermarkets do affect the local businesses and forces them to shut in majority of the cases, subsequently resulting in the extermination of local communities."
