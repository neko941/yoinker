        "Every businesses goal is to earn profit, as it is essential for survival and growth. Business can not be survived without taking risk. Some people do anything in the business to earn profit at the end of the day. But others do care about lot of things around them. I do not agree to the above statement that businesses should do anything to make profit.",
        "First of all, every business have certain rules and regulations, ethics which should be strictly followed by everyone in the business. Each and every employee in the business should respect the ethics. To earn more profit one should not mislead the government by not paying regular taxes, showing wrong records, threatening other business people for self profit, child labor and many more should be banned. This activities affect the business reputation and business relationship. For instance, in India in many small villages still child labor is been followed. To make crackers, lift heavy items, in construction sites and many more activities are taking place. Some people just wants to earn more money, they don't care about others feelings or life.",
        "In addition, businesses should start to care about environment and people's health. In this growing technology and business market many businesses or industries have least concern about our environment. They just show the world that they follow the protection rules. Many industries leave out poisonous chemical wastes and gases, recycle, air quality is spoiled, water is contaminated, people are suffering from various diseases, cutting tress to build larger buildings, all these are only to achieve money.",
        "Furthermore, businesses should maintain quality while producing products. Should not be provoked to sell illegal items for more money. Because people trust them before using it. Misleading customers by selling cheap goods to market to earn more profit is not legal and fair in the business. Some people start transporting drugs as a side business. Many businesses do corruption to achieve success and profit. This affect their family, friends and the whole world.",
        "In short, businesses should be always legal, care about people and environment. Money is not always the first thing in life. There should be certain limits, rules, ethics, respect to run a business successfully"
