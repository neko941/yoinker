        "First and foremost, one of the principal disadvantage of watching television is having the chances to develop healthy problems such as vision problem. When children spend most of their times on watching their favorite TV programs namely cartoon, the light which released from television will definitely cause their eyes damage. Furthermore, lack of concentration while studying is also one of the drawbacks cause by watching television. To illustrate, children who addicted to watching television will put all their focus on TV and consequently loss the interest on studying.",
        "Nevertheless, it is commonly believed that watching television also contain benefits to children. Indeed, children will also feel stress when live in a circumstance where having plethora of homework. When watching television, it is able to help them release the stress and make them feel enjoy and relax. In addition, allow them to spend their free time on watching TV can prevent them to commit crimes. For instance, one of the reasons of youth crimes is due to children feel bored on their free time. Provide them some after-school activities such as watching TV is one of the effective method to avoid this problem.",
        "In the conclusion, undoubtedly, children who spend their time wisely while watching TV will contain advantages. Despite, we cannot ignore the drawbacks from watching TV."
