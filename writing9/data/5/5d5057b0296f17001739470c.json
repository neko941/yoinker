        "Celebrities, such as actors and singers, are known to be constantly under the spotlight. On one hand, this is in favour of the celebrity who recieves media coverage, a fact that assist in him greatly his career. On the other hand, the media intrudes on their privacy and prevent them to have a normal life which, by many can be very disturbing. Although I understand that being constantly watched by journalists can be distressing, I think celebrities earn a very good salary as a result of media coverage, and should understant it is an invaluable part of their career.",
        "Being constantly under media coverage can affect a celebritiy's life substantially, because it is impossible to have a private family life when every aspect of it is published and reported. Every person, regardless of his profession, wants to go home to his family and have a safe and secure environment, without the need to constantly think about how he looks, and what he says. When this safe environment is gone, people loose their worm place and are constantly under stress and fear, leading to depression and anxiaty. This has been shown in a recent publication by California University, who have shown an incidence of 20% in depression and substance abuse among famous people who received massive media coverage.",
        "Despite that, I believe celebrities should not blame the media for intruding on their personal life, as famous people utilize journalists and media coverage in order to increase their earnings. It is well known, that the more a famous person is exposed on public media, the more he is recognized. This recognition, increases his chances of being signed up for a show, a movie or a commercial, which will increase his earnings. As a result, many celebrities inform their location to journalists in order to increase their chances of being on the news, thus promoting their career. This fact has been used among many celebrities like Sia, Ladey Gaga and others, who even hired a personal photographer to go along with them to post pictures online constantly.",
        "To conclude, having media coverage is, in many cases, intruding and uncomfortable. Despite that, I believe that it serves the celebrities and help them to earn higher income. Being a celebrity in, unfortunately, a full time job."
