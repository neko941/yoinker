        "Sports have now been replaced by computer games where students tend to indulge them in the multiple videos that are easily available.There are mainly two reasons for this kind of behaviour.Firstly,its easy affordability and secondly,can be attributed to generation wave.It is difficult to find a definite solution  but with the help of parents and the school teachers ,along with the government,some strategic policy can be implemented which will help students to focus more on outdoor games .",
        "To stay healthy and active students should engage themselves more in football and hockey.It has become rather common these days to entertain themselves with attractive computer games.This is because it is readily available at home or any multiplexes where they can enjoy playing their favourite video games, but at the cost of high expense about which  they are totally unaware of. To add on,parents also provide children with various sorts of playing videos which have a detrimental effect on the development of child\u2019s brain.Nowadays, pupils have been severely brainwashed by the marvel  comics where they can see their avengers fighting ,which in another  way is literally hampering their studies. Unfortunately,this generation wave is spreading rapidly to engulf the entire youth.",
        "This upcoming problem is really problematic which should be tackled very delicately. Students belonging to the current generation should be handled with proper care since they are vulnerable. Any measure sholud first start from home, where parents can motivate them to play outdoor sports rather providing them with discs.Moreover, specific stress should made on the health hazards like obesity.In this context,school teachers can gude them with proper health education and the benefits of sporting outside. Furthermore, government policies can support with banning of some harmful video content and making outdoor games  compulsory in the school curriculum.",
        "To conclude, outdoor sports is beneficial in many aspects and should be encouraged by all.Students should actively participate in outside activities rather wasting their precious time in focussing on computer games. The problem is in the youth  because of its easy access to these videos and the  mindset of this generation. Although,it seems hard to solve but the problem can surely be overcome by a joint effort of the family ,school and government."
