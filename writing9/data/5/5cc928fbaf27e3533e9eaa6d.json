        "Due to urbanisation, people have started following unhealthy lifestyle which is creating  tremendous health ailments in them. Some are of the opinion that key to solve this muddle is to include more physical activities in education system. I completely accord with this notion as it will be beneficial to tackle this arising issue.",
        "",
        "There are umpteen factors why sports should be inculcated in the curriculum. Primary reason is that is if it is imbibed in the system, people will become more aware about benefits of healthy living and they will start obeying that way of living. Every individual will start consuming balanced diet. Another reason is that living active and healthy lifestyle make people less prone to physical or any mental hurdles. People should commence exercising or at-least walking on daily basis. For instance, The reports have shown that people who are more fitness freaks are healthy and active and are least lethargic in their daily schedule.",
        "Although infusing physical activities will make people healthy, people will not stop intaking junk food. There should be stern actions against the fast foods and unhealthy food items so that individuals will find it difficult to afford them and as a result will stop purchasing them. For example, there are records which stated that levying taxes on tobacco products make people impossible to buy those products.",
        "To conclude, although there are plethora of measures which can assist people in maintaining their healthy and sound lifestyle, having physical education at grass-root level of the child\u2019s curriculum will prove more favourable towards fitness and health."
