        "Some individuals believe that the perfect way to improve everyone\u2019s health is by introducing more sports facilities. While many others argue that the move will show a little effect on people\u2019s wellbeing and suggests that other measures are required. In my opinion, just by increasing the number of sports complexes will not yield the desired outcomes",
        "Increasing the number of sports centers will have a positive impact on the public health condition, but that particular step alone wouldn\u2019t be useful if other measures are not considered. Even though if we are physically active for 7 days a week and if we are not eating healthy, it will not give us expected results. Let\u2019s say, if I work out for 60 mins in a day and eat two big chicken burgers, it does not make any sense, I\u2019m compensating the workout with excess calories. Food habits play a vital role in the public health.",
        "Sports arenas in combination with increased awareness among the public about good health and food habits will provide the best possible results. They are inseparable, good end result can\u2019t be achieved without anyone of them.  Let us consider a scenario where I workout 60 mins in a day and eat good healthy food all the time, it the best combo to maintain the healthy body.",
        "To conclude, I believe that ramping up the number of sports arenas alone will not improve public health drastically. It has to be done in combination with other aspects like public awareness on healthy life style and good eating routines."
