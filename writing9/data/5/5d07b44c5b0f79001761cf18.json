        "Police and public clashes are reality of today's society as well as inevitable in some of the cases. Some districts of United States witnessed a 'curfew' in recent times and young people's movement had been restricted. Though it is a clamp down on civil librarties, my opinion is that, it is a necessary evil and need to be enforced in certain situations. This essay will support and develop the forementioned opinion.",
        "First and foremost, civil movement restriction is necessary for safety of community in certain circumstances. Mostly, the measures are taken after some unfortunate incident. In most cases, such incidents have the potential to break out into a full blown social crisis. For example, in India, such curfews are imposed after a court's decision on some socially sensitive matter. In addition to that, streets oftenly become dangerous for innocent adolscents and therefore, thier movement is kept in check to ensure thier safety.",
        "Secondly, in such potentially incitable incidents, usual policing practices can become ineffective. In cases of mass public outrages, response time of forces may increase, which can lead to total law and order break down in an area. This can be illustrated by police arrival time during Gujrat riots in India. In some of the cases, they took around four hours to reach the spot of incident. In absence of such preventive measures, law enforcement agencies may take a lot of time as they need to cover a lot of ground. This will ultimately result in loss of more innocent lives and damage to public as well as private property.",
        "To summarize, curfew imposement do look like a lot of inconvinience and snatching of civil libarties by the administration. However, it is for protection of innocent civilans and allow them to live peacefully afterwards."
