        "It is considered that, due to the progress and rise of supermarkets, small-scale businesses are not able to run. While some believe that the closing of local businesses will lead to the local communities, I think that supermarkets will diminish the local businesses up to a high level; however, it can also bring positive effects on the local people.",
        "On the one hand, the rise of supermarkets result in the downfall of local businesses. People opting for different products from these large markets hardly rely on items purchasing from local shops and centers. For example, a recent survey by the Asian development bank indicated that the enormous expansion of supermarkets in Dubai leads to the closing of local businesses up to 80%. Thus, the progress of large-scale markets is responsible for the fall of local trade up to a high-level.",
        "On the other hand, however, the boom of large-scale markets can bring advantageous outcomes to the local community. Firstly, gigantic businesses operating are delivering standard products, which would enrich the lifestyle of local people through advancement. For example, diapers available at large markets are medically safer to use for the children than the one available at local level. Secondly, the development of supermarkets is beneficial in terms of the modernization it brings among local people. This is because opting for quality products bring an advancement of behavior and lifestyle in people. Therefore, growth of supermarkets have benefits in terms of providing standard items and modernization.",
        "In conclusion, although some considered that the growth of supermarkets have negative effects on local businesses, as they will closed as a result, In my view, it can be detrimental to the running and operating of local businesses highly; whereas, it can also bring positive outcomes in the form of the availability of the quality products and modern way of lifestyle."
