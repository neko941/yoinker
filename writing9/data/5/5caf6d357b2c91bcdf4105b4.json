        "In these days, many countries are becoming richer as these nations are reducing the size of family. While there are various reasons for this phenomenon and i will examine some causes, positive and negative effects on society in the following paragraphs.",
        "To begin with, there are myriad reasons why develop nations prefer to small family size. The first and the foremost reason is that is education. Women are more educated and they do concentrate on their work so they do not want to marry soon therefore, many female will want delay family children. Secondly, the high cost of living. The majority of the people believe that if they have one or two children then they provide better education, basic needs and medicines. For instance, a recent research has revealed that in 2016, in Bangladesh, 60% females who prefer to own work so they want to fewer having children. Hence, small family size is better for children\u2019s development rather than large family.",
        "Moreover, this trend can impact on society in both positive and negative way. One positive effect is that the population rate will decline with this poverty will decline. Individual have more opportunity to obtain jobs and earn more money. As a result, parents can provide better education which will benefit to society. A negative impact is that there will be fewer young people in the workplace in the future. Thus, the economic growth will make less certain.",
        "In conclusion, although there are some reasons to reduce the family size like education and living cost, and this trend have positive and negative impacts on society however it has more positive effects as compared to negative effects."
