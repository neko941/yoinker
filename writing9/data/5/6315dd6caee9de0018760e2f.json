        "Nowadays, as consequence of technological developments and a hactic lifestyle majority of population get axes to news through Internet and just few of us read newspapers. Conservative people believes, this is a bad develpment, but I think this switch from paperbase to online news is an unstoppable process in humanity's evolution and has more advantages than drawbacks.",
        "Firstly,most people prefer to read the news online becouse of convenience. In comparation with the Internet, which is axesable from every gadget, the newspapers are unconfortable. In oure bussy  mode of living the lack of time is an issue when it is about lecturing, consequently most of us get information about tidings between work and shopping or in the short breaks during the day. For this reason reading  from the phone, tablet or other gadget which ar always on us is more handy than carying with us a jurnal.",
        "More than that, the paper based information are limited in comparation with online reference,which has a large specrum from al around the world.",
        "Secondly ,we should cut the paper use as much as posible becouse of ecological reason. In the last decades the world fights with huge ecological threats due to climat change. Massive rainforests were cuted for human use leading with this to warming the climat. Using less paper we can contribut to reversing the process of ecological decline. Other enviromental problem is the poluation that occure from  jurnals and books prining fabrication. Less paperbased publication means less polution.",
        "In conclusion, although it is a special feeling to read a newspaper , but if we take in consideration the comfortability and some ecological reasons , using the online information is more practical end more protector with our enviroment."
