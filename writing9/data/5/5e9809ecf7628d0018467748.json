        "The homework assignments for people has become a debatable topic nowadays. Some believed that home tasks are necessary for a good education, while others hold the view that children should not be suffering from a lot of homework. Both sides of arguments will be analysed before a reasoned  conclusion is drawn.",
        "On the one hand, giving homework assignments for children has benefited them a lot. For example, repeating the chapter at home helps  students to recognize it better. If such home tasks had not been given, people would find the chapter difficult during the exam. This shows why continuing to give a home work has garnered support.",
        "On the other hand, there is another group who believes that children should rest at home. For instance, students continue to study at home even if they understand the topic in class instead of relaxing. This shows why some are against homework assignments.",
        "Finally, in my opinion, giving homeworks for people should continue because there will be long term benefits to children. Meanwhile, students should be given a little task so they can rest.",
        "In conclusion. It's clear that both sides have strong grounds in their views.However, teachers should give very  few tasks so that students have time to rest."
