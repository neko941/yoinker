        "It is an undeniable fact that the way children spend their leisure time has been altered by the onset of the digital age. Although there are some benefits of this trend, I would argue that the disadvantages are more significant.",
        "To begin with, there are several advantages of using spare time for interacting with digital devices in children. Firstly, children would probably learn computer skills which are supplementation of what they need to practice more at home. It is true that computers those days have been played a vital role in education. Therefore, computer-related skills are necessary to children in order to attain better learning outcomes. Secondly, applications from new educational technologies encourage children to learn subjects more willingly. By playing with mathematical applications on Ipad, my nephew, who is around five years old, for example, is likely to spend significant amount of time in math-related subjects.",
        "Despite above arguments, I would argue that the drawbacks of methods which children spend in their free time are more significant. One reason for this notion is that children tend to play on their own, resulting in lacking of communication skills. This would probably lead to the risk of autism in the future. Another problem is that the way children played in leisure time tend to less relate to physical activities. For instance, they often watch TV or using portable electricial devices, which may give rise to eye strain.",
        "In conclusion, I believe that the disadvantages of changing the way children spend in spare time are more significant that the benefits"
