I believe that distribute a notes of currency as a gift to youth generation is more convenient for their personal use.",
        "On the one hand, many think that by giving them paper money is more useful for the youngsters. In other words, they can buy any gift on their own choices rather than others selected present. Such as, one of the researchers found that 80 % of new young generation people prefer to having a gift on their own preference. Therefore, this persons strongly hold their view that It is more convenience to give them cash finance as a gift.",
        "On the other hand, some people opposing that It could be dangerous to allocate cash money as a gift to youngest people. The chief reason to believe them because they can utilize this cash fund for wrong purpose. Take an example, a young generation boys and girls always prefer to spend their ruppes for entertainment. Thus, these people tend to their view that It is better to give them a gift rather than cash money as present.",
