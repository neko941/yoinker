Some people believe that one way to limit the number of people travelling by air is to increase tax on flights.\n\nTo what extent do you think this could solve problem?",

        "The advent of budget airliners in many countries, in the early 21st century, seems to have created more problems than it solved. While, the growing middle class is cheering the availability of low fare, and long distance transportation, green activists in these countries are raising alarm on the burden it has on the environment. Flights guzzle a huge amount of highly refined fuel and produce a heavy noise compared to other modes of logistics. However, the aviation industry is lobbying hard to get more concessions to fulfill the raising ambitions of the new middle class. However, there are some sections voicing their ideas regarding how to tackle this issue.",
        "On the one hand, some people believe that changes in taxation might have impact on the purchasing decision by the consumer. They suggest raising the fuel tax and rental taxes at the airport to hike the total price and make it un-affordable for most of the consumers. This, they believe will force them to use the flying experience only when necessary.",
        "I believe this works due to its successful implementation in the past. In early 90s, India levied a high luxury tax on air travel and the passenger growth was very minimal. Impact on air pollution was very minimal they were not even required to report to Pollution Control Board of India. However, after the lift on tax, scientists observed huge concentration of NO2 in the air.",
        "On the other hand, aviation industry would not sit idle and see its growth come down. In fact, the last time, the taxation solution failed due to heavy lobbying by the industry. Hence, this solution is not an ideal one. In addition to it, growing economies like India need faster transport to provide food for its billion population. Due to this a lot of push back could be expected on any idea of hiking taxes.",
        "Finally, In my opinion, the right solution for this would be to improve land based transportation like modern railways, or even hyperloop type solutions. While taxation works in the short term, it would not deter people from travellling by air."
