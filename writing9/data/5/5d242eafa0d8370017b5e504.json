        "In recent times advertisements are becoming increasingly popular. Daily people are surrounded by advertisements on television, movies and newspapers. These ads have a huge impact on an individuals life. In this essay, I will discuss why the drawbacks outweigh the benefits.",
        "Undoubtedly, there are a lot of advantages. These days, despite staying at home most of the individuals get updated to the latest products in the market. whenever a new product gets launched in the market people get to know via ads. For example, before they were not aware of branded items and their prices but now because of the advertisements people get to know about the variety of branded items like Nike, Puma, Adidas. Due to these ads, they were aware of the information happening surrounding to them.",
        "Nevertheless, there are a lot of drawbacks. Most of the advertisements are targeting the audience, particularly children. During the younger age they do not know the value of money.So, they tend to pesture their parents to buy new products which they saw on the advertisement.For, instance during my school days after seeing an advertisement of  mobile phones.I asked my parents to buy a smartphone even though i was not aware of using it. These advertisers are not supposed to target particular age groups for their benefits.",
        "Furthermore, in movies , television and youtube the ads are there for every 5 minutes repeatedly with the same content.Because of  these advertisements they are annoying audience. For example, if the movie is for 3hours the ads are being played for every 30minutes repeatedly with same information.Just because they are sponsoring for movies they should not boost about themselves.",
        "In conclusion, the daily lives of people are encircled by ads. Although being updated with the latest trends; targeting children and frequency makes the negative effects outweigh the positive effects."
