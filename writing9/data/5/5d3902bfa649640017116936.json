        "There are various reasons that huge quantity Of individuals move from one nation to another annually. It has some merits and demerits for a person and on a community as whole. In this essay, I will be discussing both.",
        "To begin with, when a person migrate from a devoloping country to developed country it is very beneficial for him because he had better job opportunity which helps them to live better life. Moreover, it also helps society in economic growth for example if a person is working he pays Tax to government which help to increase states fund. In addition , some people believes that their children will have that better future in the developed country such as modern lifestyle and good quality of studies.",
        "On the other sides, there are some cons for an individual and society as well such as when a person moves to a new nation it\u2019s very hard for him to settle down. Besides that migration also decreases  the economic growth of the country from  where one person moves which created world inequality. On the top of that some people start doing illegal activities to survive in new community. For example - drug dealing,  working illegal without work permits. Recently, in Canada a student got deported for act against the law as he was working more than 20 hours per week as an international student.",
        "In conclusion I pendown saying that migration has its pros and cons side by side. Although every year, there is increase in amount of peeps migrating to other nations."
