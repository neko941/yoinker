        "There are various tendencies in the way people encounter problems. Some people appreciate adjustments and they contemplate to different aquainstances. While others takes satisfaction in making thier activities in the same manner and do not to shift. In this essay, iam going to discuss both sides of argument and represent my opinion.",
        "To begin with, the idea of confronting new experiences is quite attractive for two main reasons. First, a new awareness can only be achieved by undergoing new advances. To become the best in the fields which people expect to work, they have to be challenged with different and new questions or situations. By training with this method, people will improve their ability to solve problems more wisely and quickly. One illustration of this is that if people want to be a scientist who can invent something modern, they should be able to adjust and take full advantage of modification to finally base on it and create inventions. Second, being entertained with changes is also an ideal way to enjoy life. If people activities would repeated continuously they feel get boared with out any inspiration. Therefore, modifications is key to solve this issue because it will help people to find new opertunities to overcome obstacles and to enjoy diverse and beautiful factors.",
        "However the public who are fond static lives does not show some persuasive arguments. It goes with saying that life with out or little changes are really peaceful and safe. in other words, these people avoid facing difficulties and risks; they do not want to spent their lifes with worries and plans. For instance, normal employee often choose to do boring job, with high salary instead of living in their favourate fields but just can get a living wages. Besides, a durable life style will proctects people's health efficiently because these ones often look at the problems with unintresting eyes, so they intended to concentrate on with a great deal of doing and time. Hence their energy can be uneffected.",
        "To sum up, both sides have thier valid reasons, but iam in favour of positive of change as it is main reason for human evaluation. With out change people could not break their limit to acquire more knowledge and thus the society would not be able to refine and general public might be face upto unsolved issues."
