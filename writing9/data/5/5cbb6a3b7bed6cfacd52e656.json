        "Nowadays more and more people are struggling around the world to make money in order to support their families. In some nations people could make a lot of money which may cause positive prospects to companies, individuals and countries, whereas some people think that government should reduce high salaries. This essay will examine both sides of arguments.",
        "To begin with, first of all increasing salaries may cause good lifestyle to citizen and strengthen the economy of the country.

In addition countries employment rate will increase and consequently crime rate will be reduce.",
        "Secondly, in case of keeping wage in limit from federal side this may cause some negative consequences such as income growing of income disparities, where some people will earn more money and some will less as result it is very harmful for a country to stable their economy and fulfill the need of every citizen. For example the average assets of American top 10 richest men are 90% higher than average income of all citizens of the country, hence unemployment rate increasing significantly which may resultant to crime at the end.",
        "In conclusion, countries who pay higher to their employer often seen happier on the other hands countries who paid less always found stressful, from my perspective the benefits of high salaries outweigh disadvantages are justified."
