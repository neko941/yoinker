However, these days fewer and fewer people appreciate art and turn their focus to science, technology and business.\n\nWhy do you think that is?\n\nWhat could be done to encourage more people to take interest in the arts?",

        "Despite Art is internationally seen as a cultural asset, the number of people interested in working with it has drecreased while other fields such as science, bussiness and technology have experienced an increase of workers. This essay is going to explain why this is happening and what can be done to adress this innequality.",
        "When it comes to choose a career, most of people pick the professions which vacancies are plenty and allow a decent income because they do not want to be unemployed and they need money to support themselves and their family in the future. Since Art is known for not offering many fairly paid jobs apportunities, people are negleting their creative skills and going for what is in demand in the market. As a result, they can become frustrated with their lives and present poor performance at work. For example, a recent research shows that 65% of IT students at Melbourne University who had scored the lowest grades in their assessments would be more satisfyed if they were taking an Art course.",
        "Governments, the responsables for their citizens wellbeing, should take action to tackle this serious issue which can lead to psycological illnesses such as depression. To start with, more vacancies at public Art schools should be created so learning Art could be made available not only to wealthy people but to everyone. Furthermore, Art galleries and Art festival could be subsidised. By doing this, more permanent and casual jobs positions would be offered with minum wages stabilished.",
        "In conclusion, Some people have given up their artistic talent due to the lack of oportunities of making a live from Art which leads to frustration and unhappyness. To solve this problem, Politicians owe to invest in Art so as to encourage people to follow the career they want and find job satisfaction."
