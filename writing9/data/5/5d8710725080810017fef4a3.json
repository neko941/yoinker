        "Success is a subjective term.  For some, it is measured by the stock of material possessions, while others consider a contented life, in terms of good family relationship, a successful one. Therefore, in my opinion, I partially agree with the statement that the qualities to be successful in today's world cannot be learnt at a university.",
        "On the one hand, there are a few professions, where entry is determined by university qualification. For instance, if one wants to pursue a career as a doctor, teacher or lawyer, then they have to undergo the necessary education prescribed for that particular profession. Another important quality, for a successful person, is discipline and ability to meet the competition.  These can be better learnt at a university.  Hence, it is clear that University education is necessary to get success.",
        "However, there are various Industries where a person can be successful without getting knowledge from university or college.  For example, there are not interior decoration firms, the owners of which are almost illiterate. In addition to this, the readiness to take risk is another quality of a successful person.  It is often quoted, higher the risk, higher the profits. Therefore, successful handling of risky situations leads to the emergence of a successful personality. So,  it can be concluded that University education is not necessary to gain success.",
        "Furthermore, in today's word, people with some talent in some fields, for example in the entertainment can achieve name and fame very soon because of social networking handles. Finally, university education has nothing to do with the successful relationships with family and friends.",
        "To conclude, it can be said that the attributes needed to become successful in today's word do not necessarily depend on the university degree.  However in some situations, it is pertinent  to have a professional course or degree to get success."
