        "Nowadays, Teenage crimes become a serious social problem. Some people think the punishment of them who commit heavy crimes should as same as the adults. Personally, I think the youth should not be punished in same ways.",
        "The main reason is that the adolescents who do not have complete personality cannot distinguish right and wrong. Therefore, the main propose of punishment is teach them the right value instead of simply lock them away. Because most of them who come from dysfunctional families that nobody told them the current value. For example, normally, the prisons of juveniles have more therapists who aim to find the cause of misbehavior, and make it right, which provide a way to help them live normal life.",
        "In addition, people of former prisoners who serve long sentansecs when they was young always back to crimes again, because they do not have any skill to make living. Hence another important reason of different punishment is persuade teenage prisoner learning skill during the sentences. For example, a new study is valuing the result of which teenagers who study programming in prison would have lower chance of second crime. it is a good stand that young prisoners can learn a useful skill to live.",
        "However, if the youth commit a inhumanity crime, such as series killing, or massive shooting, I agree to punish them in the same way as adults due to the dangerous that they take for the community.",
        "In summary, I believe that was necessary to have different punishment between adolescents and adult, which gives youth a chance to realize the mistake and back normal life."
