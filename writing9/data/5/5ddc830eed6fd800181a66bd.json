        "Greatest technical inventions that made the world to be connected in today's era are electronic gadgets, which are becoming the reason for keeping the people away from out door activities, and leading to various health problems. I would like to differ with this statement. Planning a day with righ amount of time allocations for electrocin gadgets, physical activities would benefit the individuals to save themselves from illnesses.",
        "On the brighter side of the coin, every invention has a cause, and should be used for the same reason to avoid misuse of it. A day-to-day schedule with right amount of time allocations for electronic gadgets and physical activites will keep individual's away from health issues. In a 24 hour day schedule, 7 hours of minimum sleep, 2 hours of physical out door activity, 9 hours of office work, 2 hours of electronic gadgets usage and rest 4 hours for social life with a proper diet leads to happy and healthy life. For example, statistics generated in UK reveals that, proper planning of a day results in health and happiness.",
        "On the other side, addiction to electronic devices is leading to major health issues. Continuous watching of television and computer games more than 4 hours will lead to laziness, which inturn leads to obesity. Also increases the dizziness, which leads to tumor in some cases, because of the electro magnetic radiation delivered from devices. For example, 80 percent of obesity patients reason is over usage of the TV and Computer games.",
        "To summarize, In my opinion, a thougtful invention should not be a reason for health issues. A well planned day and an appropriate usage of electronic goods with right diet in place will solve all kind of issues."
