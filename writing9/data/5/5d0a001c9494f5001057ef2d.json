        "Nowadays, a significant number of young adult population in some countries has increased compared with the elderly person. This essay will argue that the advantages of this outweigh the drawbacks. This essay will first demonstrate the impact on productivity, innovation and creativity by a full-grown adult, followed by an analysis of primary disadvantages, namely the negative influence on traditional culture.",
        "There is no doubt that the state's economy is mainly relied on the manpower of young adults. In addition, the behavior of young people is energetic and healthy so that they can contribute a huge mark on the capacity of the country's GDP.  If the ratio of the young and the old was unbalanced, what would happen? For example, one of the developed countries, Japan, come across with this circumstance. The steady increase of elderly people has affected the productivity of that nation. As a result, the government has changed their policy for foreign workers recently. Before it happens, Japan has very strict rules for immigration for employees from abroad. Besides, the technologies are becoming more advanced compared to the last three decades. The majority of young people are a technophobe, whereas the huge number of old people is technophobia. Apart from that, the adults have creative thinking with this state-of-the-art high-tech so that they can be technology innovators, entrepreneurs as well in various sectors. They can raise the national economy, for instance, Singapore has become one of the richest countries by selling the hi-tech even though this small nation is poor in natural resources.",
        "The drawbacks is the full force on civilization. Generally speaking, the nature of young adults focus on the new technology, their professional work and academic life rather than historic cultural values. Apart from that, most of the young adults today are materialist and they are easy to follow the global trend. On the other hands, the elderly people value civilizations and they are very eager to preserve such a kind of values. For example, we can still see many old men and women with their traditional wears around Tokyo, however, most of young adults follow the western style culture.  In order not to disappear the traditional civilized values, the elderly persons need to relay to their generation and over next generation so that the young will be aware.",
        "On balance, despite of some disadvantages on traditional culture by a growth of young adult population, this is certainly true that owing young adults human resources can hit a huge impact on the strength of the country economy. As long as the community is rich, there are several methods to retain the traditional culture values."
