        "Nowadays, In most of the countries, the government funds ample amount of money in sports. Some of them are aganist to the concept while others support the point. Let's discuss in detail regarding both the views.",
        "Coming to the support view. Firstly, Almost all the nations allocate ample amount of money on their players, in order to participate in the international games. This not only encourage the sports, but also develops the healthy relationship with the other country. For example, Players of rival's states meet in the game, have an chance to reunite them. Secondly, Citizens tend to play more, as to reach to global level, will tend to increase their health. For instance, those who engage in outdoor excercise, will be usual have better body when compared to rest.",
        "Regarding the other side, their statements can't be neglected based on the few samples. Initial one is, Poverty, In every territory, we will find poor and are seeking for help. In this case, Instead of spending, huge amount of money on the it, it can be utilized for the development of the poor. Next, Development, The ruling party can lay roads and provide better facilities for the people, which may attract global organisations. For example, If we have Global standards of infrastructure, then multi national organisations, will try to establish their branches and in turn cause benefit to the localites.",
        "In Conclusion, I agree to the point, that the betterment of the people should be given preference first, rather than the extra circular activies."
