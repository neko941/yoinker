        "Single-sex schools are a common phenomena. Most of the convents and religious schools in middle ages throughout the world seperated classrooms by gender. Convents in many European countries, Hindu religious schools in India and confucian schools in China, had this practice of gender segregation at schools. However, during the 19th century, co-education schools became prominent and are now a default mode of education. However, regarding the benefits of both, there are some disagreements.",
        "Some believe that single-sex schools have disadvantages in the long term. They opine that lack of exposure to opposite gender deprives them of specific skills which they learn from each other. Also, once they commence their careers in the industry, communication between the both suffers, as they would not have interacted in a professional environment before. It is also believed that mingling with other sexes is an essential part of social life. But all that glitters is not gold.",
        "Firstly, while I agree to the points they made, I believe that the benefits of single-sex schools outshine those that of the co-education ones. One advantage is that the innate urge of humans to impress other gender would not arise in the case of same-sex schools. Teachers, in a recent research reported that pupils tend to be less aggressive and more interested in the subjects when the other gender is not present. They also did not shy away from experssing their lack of knowledge or asking doubts, which is a definite advantage. In addition to this, learning could be tweaked to suit the specific gender\u2019s needs.",
        "Secondly, the disadvantages of boys/girls only schools are easy to overcome. Though boys and girls do not interact in schools, they could meet and converse in other places like sports classes, religious events or even public functions, like NSS, every week. There are also work shops available these days to groom them to work in a professional environment.",
        "In conclusion, I believe gender specific schools have an edge over the co-education schools. Though there are valid concerns over communication aspects, they could be resolved using other, equally effective measures."
