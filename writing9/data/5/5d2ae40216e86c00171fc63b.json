        "In modern life, we can see that technology has changed the way many people connect to each other so much. Technology has changed not only communication but also making relationships in many ways. In my opinion, this has become both a positive and negative development.",
        "Most of the ways technology make interacting with each other of people is such as Internet, telephone, social networks, youtube, TV, radio, facetime, livestream, chat online applications, \u2026With connecting to Internet, we do not need to be face to face that we can still speak together. We can chat online by messenger, mail, zalo, hangouts, lines, \u2026Not only that, we can see and speak with each other by facetime, open meeting online. Second, using telephone, mobile phone, or smart phone make people speak togerther easily, companies care business and interact with customers better. Third, students can study in online learning websites that they do not need to go to class. Livestream is also used popularly to business or share everything with people. And, companies can advertise for products and companies\u2019s image through TV, radio, youtube; we can sharing video which we own or enjoy for people to watch. Specially, social networks such as Facebook, Instargram, Twitter, Zalo, \u2026 help us connect to many people, share our personal statuses, experiences or discuss about problems and people can comment them. Topic of discussions could be literature, math, history, music, comic, novel, science, food, drink, \u2026So, if we are interested in a topic we should take part in a group to debate this togerther. Businessers always create their sale page to post product informations, chat to customers to build relationship and sell their products.",
        "Not only is technology positive but also negative with making the types of relationships. Due to technology, we can speak with each other in anywhere that we need not meeting or being face to face. Making friends with people in the word and connecting person to person is more easier. We can trade and keep good relationship with costomers. Besides  that positivities, this still brings negativities. With convenience of technology, we do not want to go out to meet friends because we need to be online, log on Internet that we can chat or speak together. Online meeting is virtual  and not real, some people addict to use social networks, waste time for it, and do not care their real life that make their relations worry. Because of online network, we can not check quality of products we want to buy that lead to they are bad quality.",
        "In conclusion, technology is very important for us to contact, communicate and create and keep up relationships. It brings us many benefits but we should use it in right way, not abuse it to avoid depending on it."
