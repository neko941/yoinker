        "Choosing a leader for a nation is not a joke. It is a very important position as he has to guide all the citizens in a society, but many people nowadays are reluctant to cast their vote due to which percentage of voters in a democratic election is decreasing. In this essay, I would discuss the problems associated with this and try to find a solution.",
        "Firstly, voting for the country is not just a right, but also the responsibility of a citizen as a part of a society. this trend will not affect the non-voters, but it indirectly disturbs those how to cast their vote for their leader, for ,instance BJP was not able to form an independent government in Uttar Pradesh, due to low voter  turnout and was forced to form a coalition government. Secondly, there are some parties who tend to buy votes from these non-voters, for example during the last Uttara Khand election police caught a group of political party members trying to bribe citizens to ballot in their favour.",
        "However, these problems can be solved by taking some measures by the government. First of all, awareness programs explaining the importance of ballot and election process should be conducted by the local government, and then some new laws and punishment should be introduced to punish those how doesn't cast their vote, for instance, a registered voter who doesn't cast their voter should be penalized. Last but not the least, Leaders should also keep the promises, that they made before the election. This would reestablish peoples faith in a democratic elections.",
        "To sum it up, voters play an important role in shaping the government and their future. Because of the far-reaching impact that an election can have, people have to cast their ballot if they want a good destiny for their life."
