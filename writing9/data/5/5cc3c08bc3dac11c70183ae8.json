Paying workers on the basis of production and sales undertaken by them is a method used generally. However I do not consider it to be the best one.My Opinion will be justified in ensuring paragraphs.",
        "To begin with, production and sales depends on external factors climatic conditions and market forces. For example, in agriculture sector production can be reduced if their is drought or flood. Similarly, can be affected if the demand of the product in the market because of availability of alternate product. Pages or remunerations set on level of sales and production made is not justified.",
        "Moreover, variable payment system exploitation of work force. As the control lies in the hands of Companies and corporate for deciding what is to be paid. In poor countries, Bangladesh, for instance, the work force with no predecided payment rules foreign companies exploit the label class by undertaking them stating their low sales as a reason. This, in order to curb such Mal practices and to present work force's interest government should set minimum wage criteria ensuring that workers are payed at least good enough to support their basic needs. However extra incentives can be paid depending on manufacturing and sales achieved.This will motivate the work force and help developing level of satisfaction among them.",
