        "There is no open place for construction of houses, whose demand is increasing rapidly, except countryside. However, some people argue that it should be protected. In my opinion, I disagree with them and provide reason for building homes in outskirts.",
        "First and foremost, cities have become over crowded due to urbanization and people have only free space in countryside. As more and more people are migrating to cities for better future, and already available space for the construction has been used. To meet this demand of land, people are turning to countryside areas. For instance, in a recent poll conducted in china by real estate firm customers are preferring the city surroundings to live. Hence, to meet this increase demand of space moving away from city is good option.",
        "In addition to this, if construction is done in the areas away from the city we can reduce the negative effects of urbanization. Due to the crowded city centre citizens are not only facing the problem of traffic but also the pollution. For example, in a city of south India there is a 40% improvement in air quality which have been observed because of building homes around the city instead of in the centre. Thus, to improve the quality of life in an urban area it is a better solution.",
        "However, there should be strict rules in regards with construction of buildings with proper ventilation, vegetation zones and spaces between houses in countryside construction.  So, to prevent the bad impact of development in those areas.",
        "In conclusion, as population is continuously moving to cities for better prospects; there is simultaneous increase in the demand for shelters. Therefore, countryside lands can be utilised for this purpose to meet the need and to curb the effects of overcrowding."
