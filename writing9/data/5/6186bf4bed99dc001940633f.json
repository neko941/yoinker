        "Few experts think that learning a second language should be started from childhood viz a student can learn a foreign language from the initial stage would rather acquire than high school. Though this is an argumentative discussion, I firmly believe that perceiving a target language is a must long process to gain and also reckon that attempting to achieve the second language should be begun from the early stage.",
        "Learning a new language opens the door provided that it becomes an International language can not be overstated that how much important is to be communicative.",
        "However, learning a language focuses on the four stages which are listening, speaking, reading and writing. It is proved that a child can learn better than an adult, which is seen in a native learner for instance an infant listens to his mother language first then he becomes able to speak afterwards reading and writing process learning by heart by and by.",

        "Moreover,  implicit learning which is described as natural learning  is more effective than explicit learning.",
        "To be concluded, A new language is to learn needs hard work as well as efforts although an offspring can learn it more effectively than the other learners  who give their effort consciously."
