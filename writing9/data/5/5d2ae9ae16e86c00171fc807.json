        "There exists a hypothesis that consuming local food can save cost and environment, although I do not negate these advantages, in fact, it is not supposed to be effective and rational. This theory cannot be implemented in many regions and limit the development of culture as well as economics.",
        "Many people consider food transportation from far distance or overseas nations to a specific place not only contributes to pollution but also wastes cost and raises higher price for end-users. However, it is an essential solution to provide victuals in urban areas and guarantee the quantity of food to meet local demand. Residents in rural areas can consume food cultivated indigenously, on contrary, municipal citizens can only purchase food which are conveyed from other places since there are no argricuture cultivation activities within urban areas. Besides, whilst a number of states and countries produce surplus products and others are short of food, import and export food are an apparently subsequent result in trade activities.",
        "Regarding cultural and economic growth, utilizing local food and ceasing trading food with national and global market would narrow the opportunities to widespread local cuisine and minimize the developing process of regional and national industries. For instance, it is impossible for people over the world to taste sushi or pizzas which are unique parts of Japanese and Italian culture and these would become dishes depicted in essays. Another part is that if the food exchange among domestic and international places disappeared, some regions could lose a hefty amount in industry income.",
        "In conclusion, taking advantage of local food brings improvement on environment and cost efficiency, nonetheless, it can only be carried out in some locations and in general, it do not possibly stimulate economics and widespread cultures."
