        "Nowadays, numerous international students fraternise at local campuses. While, some students are content studying in their own country, many others choose to study abroad. About this essay will discuss why many students follow their dreams on home soil, but why many view it benefits to study overseas for future careers.",
        "On the one hand, the main advantages is that students of studying overseas will get extremely experience challenges of foreign culture, international languages and people come from around the world, etc. moreover , many students may learn another style of living with others who have their own way to leading independently live.

Of course the benefits of studying cannot be denied.",
        "On the others hand,that studying abroad have some reason negative impacts like currency exchange rates, accommodation and plane ticket etc. Especially many view will get homesick for their family and friends on their home town. Certainly, they are  might be influences by unfamiliar and uncomfortable with the culture,environment and international language of the new country. Although , studying in foreign language is a difficult tasks to many others if they failed to the language and communication skill. Therefore, some of students are rather choose studying on their local countries even with a normal quality of education, maybe some issues with the costing abroad is burden to some parents are not affordable.",
        "In conclusion, although studying abroad it is possible for a students to feel the pressure away from home and faced communicating with the locals, but still have  more benificial of values education qualities and definitely learning new knowledge and culture from overseas. I believe also that studying abroad after graduates can get An excellent opportunity of work in new country."
