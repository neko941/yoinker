        "Societies have developed rapidly over time due to many advances in technology. Technology has changed our lives. Some people would argue that there are many advantages of the advanced technology while rest of the people think that the advancement of technology is causing more damage than good. I believe this trend has more drawbacks that I will discuss in the forthcoming paragraphs.",
        "On the one hand, technology has given us orientation and improve our standard of living mostly on communication skills. We can easily communicate our opinions and principles from the smart phones, computers and various electronic gadgets. Nowadays, the smart phone has become an indispensable device. There is no doubt that internet has revolutionised our lives in such a big way that we can delve any information by just clicking of a button. For instance, we have online shops to fulfil our shopping needs, online banks to manage our cash, social media to stay in touch with our close ones.",
        "On the other hand, there are numerous dangers with the excessive use of technology. People who are more exposed to technology live in isolation. This can often seen in teenagers spending most of their time on internet. Children are becoming more isolated and are not able to concentrate on their studies, thus getting the low grades in their exams. In addition to that, children are growing up in an environment where everything is just a click away which has affected their communication and interpersonal skills, hence they cannot express themselves clearly. Furthermore, technology decreases the social connection in young generation.",
        "In conclusion, to a certain extent, I would agree that the easy access to various information could be harmful to the humankinds. However, the advanced technology also brings a lot of benefits to the societies."
