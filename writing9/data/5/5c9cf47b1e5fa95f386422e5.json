        "How powerful money is in the 21st century! Being wealthy in modern life is definitely what humans beings are looking for. There are plenty of things can be done by using cash such as make a payment, buy some stuff, or do charity. However, sometimes money is not a solution to help people. In my opinion, I disagree with the statement and do believe that life still has another thing more valuable which known as love.",
        "Having a lot of money nowadays is everyone's dream. Recently, most people define people through the question of how rich they are instead of looking at their personality or their morals. Sadly, it particularly happens to the young generation. The more money you have, the more friends you have too. No one in the world likes to be alone and lives without support from others. Unfortunately, people tend to love to make friends with wealth rather than the poor.",
        "Cash can give people everything. In fact, humans cannot live without money. Buying cars, buying properties or go shopping, everything could not be done if there is no money. In some countries such as Vietnam, Myanmar or China, money can buy you a position too. That is how cash works in present. However, money also can be used in a good situation; for example, charity. Many donations have been done by wealthy people around the world, such as Bill Gate. Honestly, most of the charities are really work and it helps a lot of unlucky people around the world.",
        "Sometimes, the best solution to help people is not money even though it can buy humans a variety of things. Have you ever thought or seek about what do people need you to support before you assume only money can help? Most of the time, people run to the others do not mean they need economic supporting. What they expect from us is our sympathy, listening, or more over is a person that they can trust to share about their feelings. The more bad feelings they hold, the more they feel hurt. Money cannot solve that problem, but human beings can.",
        "Money is important, but not the most. It can give us opportunities to make our dream come true or to help people. However, it cannot buy us real love, real relationship and real friends. I do believe that there are many ways to support people, not only cash; for example, using your big hearts. You can earn a lot of money when you alive, but it cannot follow you after you pass away. Instead of trying so hard to earn money, take a breath, live slowly and enjoy your life. Nothing except love stay forever!"
