In many cases, the people being monitored are unaware that this is happening.\n\nDo you think the advantages of this development outweigh the disadvantages",

        "In the last 10 years, there has been an increasing amount of people who feel concerned about protecting their private life. However, in nowadays, technology is often utilised as a way of monitoring people\u2019s activities. Yet, many people do not know that they are being monitored. In this essay, I shall, in a first part, expose the positive outcomes of this way of using technology, then I shall explain why they do not outweigh the negative outcomes.",
        "Many technological firm like Google or Facebook argue that they monitor people\u2019s private life in order to improve the quality of their service. For instance, Facebook tracks down its users in objective of targeting them with specific ads. According to the CEO of Facebook, this method increases the probability of a person being interested in purchasing a product marketed in an advertisement specifically designed for him. Henceforth, people are more likely to buy something on the Internet.",
        "However, I believe there are many problems behind such methods. Targeting potential consumers with specific ads without notifying them is, in my opinion, highly unethical. Although it was not its initial purpose, technology is now used to monitor what people do in order to increase the sales and thus the profits of compagnies. Sadly, these firm do not care the fact that they purely violate the privacy of their customers. To a larger extent, this participates to the process of dehumanisation ; indeed throughout these immoral practises men are reduced to the level of consumers. In my view, no company should be allowed to know what are the people\u2019s opinion. By spying on us, these compagnies violate their proper integrity.",
        "We could conclude by stating that, although monitoring people with technology might be interesting for businesses who want to increase their sales, it is still a huge threat to the people\u2019s privacy. To a further extent, we could compare the use technology to monitor us in our society to the novel 1984 written by George Orwell in which the main character Big Brother monitors people lives thanks to drones and CCTV cameras."
