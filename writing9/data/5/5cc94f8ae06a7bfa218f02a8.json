        "In some countries like Britain, when the some people get old they move to home to live with people of the similar. In certain circumstances the government pays for this care, while in other situations the family bears the cost for this facility. I'm in opinion the cost bearer of this facility is highly co-related to the development status of the county in which these facilities are provided.",
        "Many Asian countries where the development status is still not matured in comparison to countries like USA, the old-age care facilities can't be borne by the government due to many financial constraints.  Families therefore let their grandparents or old parents live them, so their health and well being can be taken care by the family themselves. While, the cost for same is spent from the family's income. Another thing to consider is that, when many basis infrastructure issues of these developing or underdeveloped countries is still be fixed, the government would find it difficult to provide financial assistance for aged people. In very rare occasions the government would provide financial to old people who have worked for the government, even in those cases the complete cost is not covered. the major cost is still borne by the citizen or their family.",
        "There are many developed countries like UK and France where old age care facilities are provided by the government. One of the main reason for the same is that the government has a lot of surplus funds after attending to the basic needs of it's citizens. Also, the medical facilities in these countries are well organized and it can facilitate options like old age care, child care etc. In few instances the cost is shared between the family and government. In such a situation the government will be the major cost bearer.",
        "To conclude, the old age care facility should be provided by the government in developed countries, whereas in the developing or under developed countries the cost should be borne by the families."
