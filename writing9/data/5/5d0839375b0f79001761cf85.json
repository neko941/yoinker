        "In each and every news broadcast is going to decide by Editor. Not only broadcasting but also in papers that we need at early morning. Let's discuss some of the major reasons as below.",
        "Regarding the decision made by head will be decided based on the point's like, to increase viewers for their media, not make the readers panic. Former, is mostly considered in the present days. For example, instead of covering go green rally, if they cover celebrity in the same place, the number of people who tend to view it will be more. Coming to the latter, Some of the  information that create panic in general public, will be hidden and slowly released by parts. For example, Inflation in a country, will not published all of a sudden on the fine day, but they prepare the mind of a person by releasing it in part by part.",
        "Above is one side of the coin and other side is quite oposite. Some of them, tend to publish everything in an negative way, so that they can grab the attension of as many users as possible. For example, during the elections, some of them take an path of particular part and propagate negative aganist the other party. It's create an adverse impact on the other side, which will beneficial for their side. In this case, we read more of bad news and got use to it. If good is shown then people tend to read it and chances of them implementing the same. For example, the news regarding the gold medal won by a particular individual, will inspire others and make them choose it, which is an good sign.",
        "In Conclusion, none of the data provider's should be baised. Apart from that they should communicate more details of positive and just an context of negative."
