        "It is thought by some people that the mainstream , nowadays, is that students learn online rather than attend lectures at university.From my perspective this is a positive development as this is an appropriate way of learning and more economical.",
        "Firstly, e-learning is more convenient for undergraduates. This is because they can study where ever and whenever they want. Most of pupils have benefited from Internet courses where there is a vast amount of classes online which are reliable and helpful. While learning at university provides more interaction with their lecturers, pupils are hardwired to take online academic courses instead. For example, I have a friend from Lebanon who is studying engineering by attending online classes. This is more flexible than going to the university as he learns at their own place.",
        "Secondly, by taking subjects on the internet, a person can cut the extravagant university tuition fees .This is due to the fact that education costs are ,for instance, 10,000 dollars per year or term,which are more expensive for a person to pay ,whereas studying from your home is much less as you can opt the most critical classes you desire to attend. In addition to saving money,you can save more time to study these courses. Hence, most student learners have the tendency to study online.",
        "In conclusion, although the courses at university foster face to face interaction and a sociable way of learning , in my opinion,I feel that e-learning is much easier and has less financial value."
