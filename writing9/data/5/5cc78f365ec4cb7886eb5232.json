        "There are many factors that determine whether employees will want to work in an enterprise.While some people believe that a good pay is essential when selecting an industry to work,others believe that a conducive environment in a workplace is more necessary. This essay will discuss why a high stipend is a necessity when choosing a firm to work in.",
        "On the one hand,some individuals think that a juicy pay is of utmost importance when selecting where to work and I agree.This is because a good salary will lead to the overall increased productivity of the firm because the workers will be more focused.In other words,if the staff of a company are paid well,they will put in their best to do what is expected of them.There will be less distractions.Take for instance,oil firm workers are usually paid well so that they can focus once they are at work and the resultant effect of this is an overall boost in the company's output.So it can be seen that high stipend  can boost the general productivity of the firm.",
        "On the other hand,others think that a nice working ambience is more essential to selecting where to work because when an environment is neat,the staff will be more healthy.That is to say that there will be less people in need of sick leave as less staff will fall sick.",
        "To sum up,while there are varying views as to what is more important when choosing where to work,in my opinion,I believe that a high take home pay is a necessity when choosing which firm to work in."
