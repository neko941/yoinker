        "The finance for public education is a subject that matters for parents, teachers and students. Since schools have a finite budget to share through different programs and student\u2019s necessities, if wrongly used affects the entire system. Because of that has a discussion where the money is better expended, while one will agree that technology to class rooms is important and should receive more investment, others say that teachers are the most essential asset for children\u2019s education and should be priority when it comes to money resources. I personally agree with the last statement.",
        "In one hand the use of computer in the class room could be pointed as important tool to students\u2019 learning because children nowadays are more exposure to technology and it not could be used to assist to complete the activities as an approach to diversify the way of learning. For that reason, some people believe the money should be allocate to schools purchase better and more advanced computers and tablets or create laboratories such as for robotic.",
        "On the other hand, and that is the opinion that I share, without teachers none of this is possible, and raise the wage of them should be the first priority for schools and governments when planning where to allocate the money. Teachers play the main role for children education, they are the responsible for idealizing and putting in practice the pedagogical methods and supervisor student\u2019s achievements. Provided that, as any other work class, teachers productivity is correlated to how appreciated their work is. The increase of wage is the major form to show that.",
        "In conclusion, despites that technology in schools is highly beneficial for students learning, I believe that teachers salary has a direct impact in student\u2019s outcomes.  Consequently, to improve the educational system teachers should be the first priority moneywise speaking."
