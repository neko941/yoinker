        "Children play a crucial role in the society, because today's children are tomorrow adults, who are responsible to development of the nation. Thus, it is everyone's responsibility to take measures towards their career. Because of this, students who are under secondary education level are restricted to scholl with fulltime work rather than any other activities, which implemented by the law enforcement agency in some countries. However, there are several merits and demerits of this situation.",
        "To begin with, while adolescents are under the control of school management,they feel safe and happy, because they are protected from crime actions such as child murders, kidnapping. Secondly, schools are not permitting children to outside of the school, because they have to answer to parents, if anything happen to student. Moreover, they are learning and developing their educational skills, lead them to better future. By involving in lectures without any absent, also fosters better knowledge in group discussions and team management.",
        "On the other hand, there are several ill effects to the children, if they are only allowed to study in school rather than any extracurricular activities like sports and culture. Furthermore, they are only tend to know about class knowledge, not general knowledge, which relates to the outside environment. Owing to all these, teenagers may get stressed and bored with the inside environment, which leads to myriad negative effects.",
        "To conclude, I reiterate my statement by saying that students are not only permitted to studies by school professionals, but also encourage them to involve in games and social activities."
