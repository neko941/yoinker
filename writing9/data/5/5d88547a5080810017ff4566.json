        "To begin with, advance technical tools like, email and skype, can let anyone to be in touch with office teams and complete the task, irrespective of their location. This means, professionals can work from home and can spend more time with family and finishes up the task assigned to him. To illustrate, one of my friend who works for ABC Inc., usually takes work from home upto 5 days per month if needed.",
        "What is more, nowadays, people are able to travel upto quite a long distance to office due to convenient and improved travelling option like carpooling and Metro in big cities. Since travelling by these is quite fast and convenient to reach workplace, people prefer to travel long distance and stay with family rather staying near to the office. For example, 30% workforce of Gurgaon comes from out of the city everyday by travelling almost 40 kms.",
        "On the other hand, few drawbacks like stressful family life and less time for recreational activity would arise, if one over use the above mentioned advancement. Firsty, often work from home might disturb the family life of the person which could lead to stress among partner. Secondly, when people travel for a considerable about of duration, it become hectic and leave the person with no or less time to carry out any recreational activity like exercise or yoga.",
