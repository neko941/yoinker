        "Presently, it is true that many families prefer to buy a vast number of toys for their kids. Even though there are numerous benefits for this, there are also negative issues which need to be considered which will be further discussed in the following essay.",
        "On the one hand, there are various advantages to children. The first and most significant is the advancement in creativity. The reason for this is nowadays most toys are flexible to children to create their own styles to play, resulting in inspiring children for not fix in their minds. Moreover, they can also mix different toys to make a new one like a fantasy town or an incredible vehicle depending on their minds. Apart form this, another point is increasing the knowledges due to many companies such as National Geographic try to add several knowledges about chemistry and physics to their toys. This leads to children can learn many subjects during playing their toys.",
        "Despite the positive effects, some negative impacts need to be considered. The most essential is a lack of interaction between people due to most children only pay attention to their toys, resulting in they spent a lot of time with themselves. Therefore, they prefer to stay at home instead of doing outdoor activities with other children. A further point is harmful for their health. This is mainly due to toxic chemical substances in toys may cause some side-effects if they do not play properly and careless.",
        "In conclusion, while there are a variety of benefits, there are some drawbacks as well. If families explain their children about an importance of toys and how they play properly, then they will receive more benefits. Therefore, it is my belief that the overall advantages to children seem to outweigh the disadvantages."
