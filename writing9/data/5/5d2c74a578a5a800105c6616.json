        "These days, whether governments should invest more capital on building rail rather than roadways has sparked a heated debate. Although such issue is contested by many, it is regarded thoroughly both constructive and positive by a substantial number of individuals. As such, there are both merits and demerits to this trend, but I am of the opinion that the former outdo the latter.",
        "To begin with, investing in a modern train system will reduce the travel time of passengers to the destinations. Particularly, trains can achieve a faster than cars and train passengers do not struggle with congestion most road users experience. This is because trains have a clear track and they do not have to face any blockages like automobiles do on the roads. A recent research conducted by the Transportation Department of Norway also show that people can save up to 3 hours of their commute thanks to the trains.",
        "Additionally, locomotive tend to be more environmental friendly than automotive. Particularly, train can carry more passenger than a car or other combustion engines. In other words, adding more trains is resulting in lesser number of vehicles on the road. Consequently, the carbon dioxide emission is reduced and air quality is improved thanks to the reduction in traffic.",
        "In sum, government should invest more funds for railway infrastructure since it helps commuters to spend less travel time, and it causes less adverse effect on the environment."
