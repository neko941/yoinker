        "Over the last decade, there has been an increasing amount of people who use social media applications such as Snapchat and Instagram on a regular basis.",
        "We could ask ourselves wherever new technology has a negative positive or impact on social bonds betwen humans. In this essay, I shall defend both cases.",
        "A significant amount of people argue that modern technology tends to make humans more sociable beings. This point of view is perfectly valid. Thanks to the arrival of cellphones on the market, we can observe that people are able to communicate with each and other from any where on the world. Henceforth, new technology makes it easier for people to keep in touch. In addition social networks like facebook or twitter encourage people to share their lives with their friends and family. As a result, humans are becoming much more sociable.",
        "On the other the hand, many sociological experts argue that modern technology has a terrible impact on our lives. According to them, face-to-face discussions are essential in social interactions between humans. However, the new ways of communication enabled by the birth of Internet are purely virtual. Consequently, an increasing number of people prefer staying at home chatting on facebook rather than hanging with their friends outside. Of course, this kind of attitude raises the question wherever humans are becoming less sociable.",
        "In conclusion, new technology is becoming a real sociological concern and people hold different points of view. While many trust modern technology to be a social tool, some are much more skeptical. In my opinion, we should allow ourselves more time on the question."
