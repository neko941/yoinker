        "Recently, autonomous cars have become increasingly popular. This is because of development in Artifical Intelligence and it should be seen as a positive development as it will reduce number of traffic accidents.",
        "",
        "Due to advancements in technology, people rely more on Artifical Intelligence to carry their daily tasks, including driving. This is because softwares used in such cars do not require special type of programming every time.A simple algorithm is embedded in the software and it will start learning on its own.For example, Tesla have developed self-drive cars which use simple machine learning algorithms. This algorithms learn about the environment on their own and also share this data with other autonomous cars.",
        "",
        "Automation in vehicles should be welcomed because  it frees people from the tedious task of driving. People can also use it to navigate maps, predict traffics and prevent road accidents. Also, using this cars will prevent road accidents as the algorithm detect the threats before hand and avoids the collision. Recent studies have shown that a car developed by Google is very accurate in navigation and avoid traffic. Also it can calculate number of collision and threats to car and hence avoid it before hand. The car was self-driven for miles and had only one accident. Whereas a car driven by a human for same number of miles have had more accidents.",
        "",
        "To conclude, we are able to use such autonomous cars because scientists and engineers are pushing the boundaries of technology. This development will definately improve our lives and make it even more easier."
