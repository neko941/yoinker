        "In the recent times,natural environment have been explored to enable development. Thereby promoting the protection of wildlife. It is a debated issue whether these wild animals have no place in the 21st century and also if their protection by keeping them in a zoo is a waste of resources. I agree that these animals should be protected and taken care of with they following points.",
        "Some many animals are going extinct because other animals prey on them. These endangered species need to be protected to enable procreation and continuation of life. Furthermore, keeping the animals in the zoo enables scientists to carry out scientific experiments,genetic modifications etc that will be of benefit to the animal world.",
        "Although most people believe that its a waste of resources in keeping these animals in the zoo, similarly,many zoo are used for tourist attractions which in turn helps to generate money for the government. For instance the South African parkway zoo, millions of people from different parts of the world visit the zoo every year and money is generated. In addition, schools can learn about wildlife by going to excursions at the zoo. Finally, in as much as development is the major attribute of the 21st century, these widelifes are always put into consideration. Proper care and attention is given to each one of these animals which is what every living thing needs for survival.",
        "In conclusion, i pen down sayin that these wild animals should be protected and not to be left to survive on their own."
