        "Globalization process have positive and negative sights. One if the drawback is obeseness among children, which is increasing in the developed country. Some people think, that promotion for junky food, desserts and sugar items need to prohibit in educational establishments like schools and colleges. I agree with this statement and in this essay, I will explain some reasons and effects.",
        "Firstly, according World Health Organization (WHO) the number of obese children and adolescents (aged 5 to 19 years) worldwide has risen tenfold in the past four decades. This negative tendency are result from leading unhealthy lifestyle as parents so children. What I mean here is that consumption junky foods, candies and sugars snacks, which kids and students can easy buy at the school or college. In this occasion advertisement stimulates and encourages children desire to consume unhealthy food. Because, advertisement triggers young generation with attractive, colorful pictures and video. Moreover, at the school or college children are not under parent\u2019s control, consequently they are easily accessible from vending machine and cafeteria in school and college.",
        "On the other hand, banning adverts for unhealthy food is not the main solution. It will be more effective when parents and children will educate themselves about the health problems like obesity, diabetes, hypertension and cancer. In most cases, parent do not need to educate their child, parents should to show with themselves examples and to be role model of healthy person for children.",
        "To sum up, it is evident that childhood overweight is serious question in worldwide. We know a several causes and variety negative effects of obesity. Nowadays, people need simple to combat with this problem."
