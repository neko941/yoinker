        "Archaeological remains have always been a rich source of region's diversity. Some people are of the opinion that useful information can be unravelled if we dig into history while others regard history as useless entity. I believe that history provides us with numerous indispensable facts which we are unable to appreciate otherwise. This essay will look into both views.",
        "Man's thirst for the knowledge of history is unquenchable. By unfolding various archaeological marvels, man has been able to carve his future better than his past. For instance l with discovery of architectural remains of Harrapa,modern man has been able to design buildings that are resistant to natural calamities like earthquakes and storms. With the moto of \u2018People who don\u2019t learn from history have to repeat it\u2019, archaeologists have been able to excavate valuable objects. Clay pots, for example discovered from the ancient Mohn jo daru have allowed us to create utensils of several sorts. Akin to this discovery water canal system discovered from Mughal empire still serves as a useful mode of irrigating farm fields.",
        "However, there are people who think that history has no value in our daily lives. They believe that squandering billions of dollars in exchange of few non productive items is not justified. They think that money should rather be invested in future of man kind. For instance, creating spaceships and rockets that have tendency to bring us resources and habitats from other planets, is more useful than wasting money on learning lessons from the past.",
        "To conclude, excavating into past is resourceful to human race as history can many valuable lessons that cant be learned in any other way."
