        "In recent times, technical advancement and globalization have sparked heated debates about whether people must remain to the conservative ways of life or resort to modern trends. Some people think individuals need to venture into some noble experiences in life, whereas, other may think that individuals should be refrained from doing new things and must stick to traditional methods.",
        "On one hand, some people believe that staying in the same job for a long time enable them to gain expertise in that domain. They become source of knowledge and guidance for new comers and also they get to establish themselves as an authority in their field. They, further, argue that people, clearly, will not need to learn new things as they are already more cognizant about activities that they habitually perform. People, who love stability in life, hesitate to change their jobs, routines or lifestyles, often have this opinion. For instance, in this era, the seniority group will find it confusing to read newspapers on electronic tablet due to the fact that they are not aware of its new features and proper operation of the gadget. For those reasons, geriatric individuals do not need to learn the settings and the high technology applications as it will take them a long period of time to adapt this product of technology.",
        "It is also believed that changing jobs and routines frequently, on the other hand, might seem daunting but it does not really have to be if one  knows what one is doing. In this age of possibilities, coming out of comfort zone is the only way to learn something new and explore new opportunities. While this might seem challenging, it will turn out to be a rewarding pursuit in the long run. To illustrate, a businessman, who have experienced failures in business, will resort to a new strategies in order to make a business more firm and highly profitable. This can be done by abandoning the old fashioned styles and techniques while accepting the modern ways, which could make the people\u2019s lives more favourable. Seen in this light, it is undeniable that ideology of success can be reached if people will embrace the new-fangled ways of living in the society.",
        "After having discussed the most pertinent points of the issue, I, personally advocate the later view with a notion that embracing changes is essential to learn new things and realize our full potential. What\u2019s more, change makes our life exciting."
