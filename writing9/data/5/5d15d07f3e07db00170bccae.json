        "In recent times there are variety of music in the world and each type serves a different purpose which will be discussed. Also the importance of traditional music and international music will be weighed in this essay.",
        "Music has been known to be a universal language generally understood by people of different cultures and races. This variety ranging from pop, country, afro, rock, jazz, soul, classic music and so on serves a number of purposes in life. For instance, the soul music is used mostly by people who perform yoga and it helps their minds relax better. Also,during party\u2019s R and B , country,rock music are used to lighten up the environment. Likewise, in the psychiatric homes, music helps to fasten rehabilitation process. Finally, legends have been made through music such as Micheal Jackson, Ray Charles and whitney Houston and so on.",
        "Furthermore,traditional  music of a country otherwise known as country music is usually an identity of a particular place. Most times, the history,culture, tradition and even the lives of famous people living in the country are turned into music and this enables the younger generation to have a clearer insight of the origin and happenings in the country. On the other hand, international music mainly unites the world. To clarify, Micheal jacksons music titled \u201cwe are the world\u201d was sang by people of different tribe and culture and also brought people together.",
        "In conclusion, music has so many significance to man. To my way of thinking, various type of music plays a different role. Therefore,traditional music serves its major aim of conveying messages about a particular group of people while international music is mostly enjoyed worldwide."
