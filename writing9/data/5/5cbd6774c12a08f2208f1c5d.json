        "It is argued, regarding environmental safety where one-half of people believe that individual citizen should be responsible to safeguard environment whereas the other half thinks that the government should take a major role in protecting the environment. This essay discusses both the aspects before reaching a final verdict.",
        "Firstly, let us consider the measures that common people should implement to preserve the environment. First and foremost thing is to avoid dumping of garbages on roads or in nearby Canal which gets clogged and leads to flooding, a serious disaster which destroys the environment. Apart from that controlling pollution is also in the hands of people by reducing car usages. To cite an example, if fossil fuel cars are avoided, therefore, decreases the emission of carbon dioxide which in turn avoids global warming which is the major issue currently faced by the world.",
        "Nevertheless, not only people even the government has to take stringent action by creating awareness among the people by hosting awareness programs or by enforcing any law which reduces the environmental hazards. For instance in Tamilnadu recently a law has been passed against the usage of plastic, which is a key material to cause a detrimental effect on nature since it is a non-biodegradable waste. This rule is followed strictly by each and every person in Tamilnadu which is an initiation for protecting the environment from deterioration.",
        "To conclude, although the government takes measures to protect the environment, it is the responsibility of the people to take proactive measures by following the rules strictly with full determination and avoid causing pollution by restricting car usage which will be beneficial for nature."
