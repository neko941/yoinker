        "With regularly encountering the advent of modern technologies and amendments,undergoing changes in life is often commonplace for people nowadays.However,while some people believe that living in the same way without changes is acceptable,I agree with those who feel that changes are always preferable. 46",
        "On the one hand,it could be argued that living with standart lifestyle has benifits on certain ways of life.Those who live in stable life are often said to become conversant with their jobs and lives becouse of constantly focusing on the same subject that it can give them a sense of confidence and self-esteem.Moreover,some believe that living in stability,with the exception of taking risk or change,coukd prevent them from negativ outcomes,for instance,being redundant and homeless and it would be the safer way of living.",
        "On the other hand,I would argue that adapting new points to life has more merits compared to steadiness.Firstly,being on different workplaces and residing in new towns probably make your life full of adventures that can affect your prespective to new things and improve your optimistic outlook on life.In addition.I hold the opinion that due to switching job to another,people tend to learn variety of new skills that often means keeping in touch with different sorts of people.As a result,not only can this help people broaden their knowledge about professions,but it can also influence their social aspects positively.",
        "In conclusion,although some people are versed in their qualification because if living without major alterations,living steadiliy seem to prevent people from more benefits.Therefore,I believe that it is quite reasonable to take changes."
