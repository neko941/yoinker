        "Now a days it has become a norm to be raised by ones grandparents.Since the immediate parents are occupied by their curriers and they can hardly find any vaccant time to spend with their kids.The upcomming essay will elaborate the benifits and drawbacks of being broughtup by grandparents and how it affects the family.",
        "to begin with, grandparents have the experiance and tolerance to deal with kids hence it is benifecial for them to raise the kids. Secondly kids learn a lot form their grandparents in terms of manners,ethics, love and care.Parents are usually more comfortable in leaving their kids with their grandparents as commpared to a babysitter or unknown strangers.kids will learn the warmth and respect for elderly in their youth when their upbringing is done by elderly grandparents.For example the words of wisdem that i got from my grandfather were priceless, he tought me the ways of life that i could have taken me years to learn my self.",
        "There is always to sides to story,when we talk about the disadvantages of being raised by grandparents being spoiled by their love is the first thing that comes to mind.Secondly, when kids spend less time with their immediate parents they tend to losse their respect for their father and mother.Kids will no longer be emmotionaly",
        "attached to them any more and that will cause a gap in their relationship.As the kids will grow up they will fill this gap with drugs or crime.",
        "To conclude, it is both healthy and unhealthy to be raised completely by grandparents.Grandparents should always be a part of kids life and they must play a vital role in their upbringing but similarly parents should not entirely hand over their responsiblities of raising their own kids to their parents.It will create a psychological gap in the kids minds and will result in violance and crime in the long run."
