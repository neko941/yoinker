        "People have different views about government must  motivate national economy instead of public supplies. In my opinion, I support the view that improving citizen\u2019s lives is more significant than the former.",
        "On the one hand, creating a worth-living environment in which people live in peace, justice and respectation is a sustainable factor to develop country. It is the fact that a country, which has a well education, healthcare systems, always attracts many foreign investors and tourists leading to more profits than those political unstability. For example, according to World Trade Organization\u2019 record in 2010, Vietnam, a stable country in the Southeast Asia, had earned annual more than $ 3 trillion with tourism. By contrast, the Middle East countries, which always experience in civil wars, became poorer and poorer because no one invest in these internal unstable nations. The less dispution, the more revenue.",
        "On the other hand, there are several reasons why authorities should not concentrate much on national economy instead of improving their people living standard. First, if a country earns more money without developing their infrastructure, they would soon face to civil war because the distance between rich and poor civilian will be far. As an illustration, India is the country in which they don\u2019t have any skyscraper but they include both of the richest and the poorest person in the world. Secondly, people who were excellently educated and well healthy cared are likely to work hard and get more taxes for government. That is, coutries taking care more about social services will be returned by their citizens.",
        "In conclusion, I strongly believe that government should spent more effords to developing the infrastructure and national society because of the above reasons. This will create a worth-living and powerful country."
