        "The interactions of people with each other via technology has become a contentious topic. It is convenient that the way of interaction has been changed dramatically by the intervention of various electronic equipments which is appreciated by most of the people in contrast with which some people think it has some genuine negative effects.",
        "A few years ago, when technology was not superior in one's everyday life, they had to wait to contact with their relatives or friends. People used to communicate with their nearest and dearest one via letter or by visiting them personally at their houses which had reflected their passion about the relationship. Though the communication was not any easy task one loved to maintain the relationship as because of their affection.",
        "Nowadays technology like mobile phone or email or social sites has made it easier to contact with the relatives or companions which has brought the world closer termed as \"Global village\". People need not to wait for any letter while they can contact with anyone within a few seconds even including the unknown one which has also turned a wide range of people impassioned about the relationships. Because of technology the trend of visiting relatives house has been rarefied especially when they live at a good distance, as well as, because of being involved in virtual relationship with unknown people relatives are being ignored in the days of modern technology.",
        "In spite of having some negative effects of technology the relationship goals can be maintained at ease by the blessings of mighty technology."
