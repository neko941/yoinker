        "It is often opined that whether internet is making people closer or making them far away. there are thoughts on both the sides. I will discuss both the postulates along with my rationale associated with appropiate exemplification in the subsequent paragraph",
        "At the outset, nowadays people are endulging more and more in the use of internet. Some people reckon that using social sites like facebook, instagram and whatsapp making their life easy to contact any one without visitng their house, which helps them to save their time. For instance, as per a survey report conducted by the Times of India, 30% of people agreeed that using whatsapp kind of site they saved their a lot of time which were wasted in traveling. Furrthermore, utilizing these websites helped them to stay in touch with them who lived quite far away like overseas or foreign. Internet proved beneficial to contact with them because it is not a piece of cake to meet them. To illustrate, a reported published by the Nationa Airport Authority , stated that they had seen a degrade in the groth after launching of whatsapp because people prefer to interact onine rather than visit.",
        "on the contrary, many people think these social media sites are detreorated the face to face interaction, owing to this people become less social. for example, as per a survey report conduted by the National Social Authority , 60% of people had avoided social event as they wanted to spent their time on internet. Additionaly, most people opined that people find friend online seprate them from family and real friends. They isolate themself from everyone and keep endulging on internet. Which make a deep determental effect on their mental health. Quintessentially, as per a survey report published by the National Health Organization, 49% people was suffering form perturb and isolate due to a lot of use of internet.",
        "To conclude, after perusal of aforementioned point it is conspicuous that internet are affecting peoples' life on a large scale. It has became an essential part of everyone's life. Use of internet should be regulated strictely."
