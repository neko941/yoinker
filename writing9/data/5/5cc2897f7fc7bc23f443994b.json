        "Several nations today, consist of single-gender and mixed-sex schools for parents to choose. Though few people are in favor of girls/boys only schools, some guides express disagreeness and consider it to be disadvantageous later in lives of children. This essay agrees with the statement because attending a single-gender school will cause problems in their personal and professional lives.",
        "Due to very less communication with the opposite sex, one\u2019s professional life is affected badly. A friend of mine, Maya, went to only-girls school and grew up to be shy and weak. Maya\u2019s shyness makes her colleagues and boss feel that she is not capable of performing under cruel circumstances and hence not provide her any challenging tasks. Whereas people who have attended mixed-gender institutions, have proven to perform excellently under any critical situations. Hence, individuals who did not attend co-ed institutions are not able to grow and develop professionally.",
        "Not only careerwise, but also single-sex school students suffer loss in personal lives in their adulthood. Opposite-sex shyness is proven to be one of the reason of anxiety and depression. But people who were mixed-gender schooled, have better social as well as personal lives. Being able to talk freely to the opposite gender make a good friend and a great companion. Yale University researchers have proven that single-sex schooled sons and daughters suffer more psychologically than co-educationally schooled ones.",
        "To conclude, mothers and fathers of many nations a option of choosing between mixed and single gender institutions and few people consider the latter as harmful. I agree with those people because it leads to social-shyness and awkwardness resulting in unsuccessful social, personal and professional lives."
