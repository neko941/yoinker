        "Restricting anyone because of the demographics from any opportunity does curtail individual\u2019s freedom. This essay agrees that it is a positive development to prohibit employers to reject a candidate based on his/her age because; it is immoral and has worrying consequences.",
        "Freedom is a vital pillar of modern society. The society may fall under its own weight if we compromise with this pillar. When we start compromise with something as important as this, then we never know when to stop. Therefore, end to the road for any society is not pleasing which begins by curtailing the chances of employment because of age. For example, the next practice may be to deny someone because of gender and then religion. This will shred the very fabric which is keeping the community together. Therefore, new law is beneficial for the harmony of the nations who adopted it.",
        "Denying employment other than skills and productivity is detrimental on one\u2019s confidence and their personal life. We live in a society where it is essential to be employed to run a family. One may looses their moral and may get stressed because of trivial reason such as age. No nation wants their elder citizens to be unproductive and stressed. For example, if a person who is in his early 50s and have kids in late 10s and wants to get employed and is also sole bread earner of the family. The trivial leash on his chances can have humungous detrimental effects on whole of his family.",
        "To conclude, the countries that have prohibited denying jobs because of how old they are is fantastic because it helps to improve the harmony of the society and let people live with less stress."
