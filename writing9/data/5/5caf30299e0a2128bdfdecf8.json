        "There is a kazakh phrase, \"person who knows more languages has more souls\". This word flourished in our modern world. Nowadays, learning new language - is a trend. Even though, the belief of extending the list of languages you speak will have a positive impact for your portfolio, there are some dispute over the reasons why to study new languages. Some people think this is done solely for travel or work. However, learning new languages is done for something more than short-term motifs, such as cultural aspects, and extending your way of thinking.",
        "First of all, studying foreign language will lead to discover of the cultural aspects of language. Every language is not just a means of communication but evolutionary process which has rich history and interesting background. To put it simple, it is more enjoyable to drink juice than water. Here the water is the liquid that you should drink like the language is the means of communtication. Analogously, juice is the language with its cultural aspects, i.e. it has more flavor in it. So, it depends on personality to drink a juice or water. In conclusion, studying a language is not solely for a means of communication but also for its cultural context.",
        "In addition to the cultural value, there is something about discovering new language, that is related to enriching your inner mind. Owning a language means having an access to the literature bank. You can access unique pieces of art, poems, and other literature creations of foreign language. This will broaden the mind, and make it more flexible and richer. To sum it up, learning a language shouldn't done just for communication purposes, but broaden your point of view.",
        "In summary, cultural aspects of language and thinking broadly are 2 aspects that should be treated as a communication part of the language."
