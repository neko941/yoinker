Many believe that keeping too much transparency sometimes invite the unwelcome circumstances while on the contrary, other\u2019s says that it\u2019s a right of every individual to know the on going events of the world and its a duty of every organization to circulate information in public without keeping any secrets. In this essay will discuss both the viewpoints and my opinion will be outline in conclusion.",
        "On the one side, there are many research work carried out in the world by different organization which merely known to common person, consequently, The reason behind such act of privacy is to protect the circulation of false rumours. For example, from last many decades the NASA is working to find life on the planet Mars, however, so far they have not found any clue through which they can clam that human begin can survive on Mar. But the news spread among the people by various sources mostly through that social media that life is poosible at Mars, Furthermore, NASA also started to sale lands on the planet. To restrict people to get irrational news it is manditory to keep certain information secret.",
        "On the other hand, some people says that keeping secrecy is a sign of betrayal, moreover, hiding things indicates that illicit activity is taking place by without the knowledge of the public. To not bring negative thoughts it is important to keep things transparent, along with this sharing information also increase the knowledge and understanding of the people.",
