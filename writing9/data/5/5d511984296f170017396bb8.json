        "n most of the nations in these days, people are usually preferring in urban areas either alone and in the nuclear family rather than tend to live with joint family. In my opinion, I believe that this will be led to the negative trend among the people, because of less parental support and even lack of moral values and etiquette have seen in among the grandchildren.",
        "One negative consequence is being seen among the people who are living alone in major cities, that is lack of parental support. In other words, people in these days might be suffered from various levels of struggle especially youngster, who have less knowledge and experience about how they can able to cope their problem in this fast pace era when the level of inflation is reaching at the highest place. At this moment, they really need someone else who has much more experienced regarding these kinds of fundamentals problem and stimulate them to tackle their problem such as homesickness. As a result, without parental support, people are usually struggling these kinds of problem which may be mere addressed by living with parents.",
        "Another possible consequence is that, lack of moral values among the children who are living in the nuclear family far from their grandparents. To put it on another way, people in these days are more money minded both parents are working now that is the reason behind this, they have less time to spend with their teenagers who often spending their most of time playing aggressive video games and watching violence videos such as WWE. This may turn the children to become more aggressive and stubborn. Therefore, children have less etiquette and ethics because they are unable to get a chance learning these kinds of moral values from their grandparent while living in a nuclear family. Consequently, this will be also led to reducing the love and sense of security among their children because they are unable to acquire sufficient etiquettes and values in an earlier time, which they may be needed to become responsible citizens in adulthood.",
        "In conclusion, I think that it will absolutely lead the people to live in a negative way without having the support of parents and living far from their joint family."
