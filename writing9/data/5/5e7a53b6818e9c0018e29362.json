        "Applying for and being granted a credit card, is lot easier thesedays. Nevertheless, many people face consequences when they arrear in their debt payment. In spite of this, I assert that the benefits of plastic money overwiegh its drawbacks, if used responsibly. As it, not only helps in payment of large sums easily, but also is portable and secure.",
        "",
        "The most significant drawback of having a credit card is accumulation of excessive debt on a person's account. Since there is usually no limit on the amount to be spend, majority of people generally overspend than their actual budget; consequently accumulating a debt beacuse of high interest rates. As a result, they find it difficult to pay the bank, however, this situation can be prevented by being more responsible while using credit cards.",
        "",
        "Nonetheless, there are numerous advantages of using plastic money as it can be used to complete transactions involving huge sums of money conveniently and swiftly. To be precise, a person need not to carry bulk of cash, but the amount can be smoothly transfered using net banking in matter of seconds, which is lot quicker as compared to the past. For example, majority of people around the world use plastic money to transfer funds directly to the bank account, not just nationally, but also while dealing globally.",
        "",
        "Moreover, credit cards are easily portable and secure in comparison with paper money. Furthermore, use of electronic money has given a huge boost to globalisation as transactions can be done around the world with lightning speed. If the card is misplaced, then its misuse can be prevented by just cancelling the card; thereby making it more secure than traditional money. To cite an example, my father lost his credit card last year, however, he called the bank immediately to report the mishap and freezing his account, making the card redundant. Thus, plastic money is way more convenient, secure and quicker than paper money.",
        "",
        "To conclude, I would reiterate my opinion, although credit card has few drawbacks, yet its benefits massively overweigh its disadvantages. As compared to cash, bank cards are faster, easy to cary and more safer."
