        "In this contemporary era, movies play a vital role in an individual\u2019s life, it is considered as a stress buster.  And also particularly famous among youth.  Many producers investing a plethora of money on movies to be a big hit. But, it is not necessary for a film to be successful merely if it\u2019s a high budget movie. Movies which are low budget can also be big film.",
        "Firstly, let us considered the movies which are huge expensive. Furthermore, it takes a long process to make a movie. A movie needs a numerous casting like actor, director, technicians and many people to work with. For example, let\u2019s talk about the recent movie \u201csahoo\u201d, which is a high budget movie but failed to impress the audience. There are plenty of films which are more expensive and did not work on box office. So, it is not true that the movie with high budget will be success.",
        "In addition, there are lots of other movies which are less expensive and got a huge response from public. For instance, movies like \u201cTaare zameen pe\u201d and also the most famous film \u201cDangal\u201d, which are less budget films but successful. Because films like this have a concept which wins the audience heart. Movies which are based on true stories or having a good story type and have good casting effects the film and can run greatly. While there are movies which have more investment but failed to be a hit, as I mention in the above passage.",
        "In conclusion, it is very clear that any movie with excellent story and good casting can earn more money than invested. Although for some movies, massive budget is needed but it is not compulsory to invest lot of money to produce a successful movie. If the major factors are implemented correctly, than the chances of movie becoming successful is higher."
