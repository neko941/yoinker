        "Nations with nuclear umbrella, have managed to avoid any large-scale conflict with their counterparts. It has been decades, since, the nuclear technology came in the hands of the humankind. We have opened numerous doors for its applications, ranging from medical to military operations. In my view, nuclear energy has come as a boon for the human civilization.",
        "Some protagonists, see these mass weapons as means of divulging from any future wars. Each country, realizes the potential repercussions of getting in a nuclear war. Scientist have also stated consequences of nuclear breakout, where generations will have to bear its effects: cancer, skin allergy, mutated cells are among the various abnormalities that we might have to face because of it. Thus, every nation wants to have sustainable future, and nuclear power ensures that.",
        "Other than the military applications, today, countries are using nuclear energy to generate power that can lighten thousands of cities. Among the advantages of nuclear energy, their low cost and wide scale uses have motivated growing economies to adopt this technology. Earlier, the use of conventional resources, was burdening our natural deposits on earth, which in turn becomes a menace for our future generations. Today, more than 75% of electricity in India, is provided by the nuclear power-plants.",
        "Despite some disadvantages of nuclear technology, I truly believe nuclear energy is the future of the human civilization. It has allowed has to go to the moon, and is seen as a viable energy source for future space   exploration programs. Humans have learned a great deal of things about the nature of atoms, and how they behave in the universe. Therefore, it is merely the start of a new technological revolution.",
        "To summarize, nuclear energy does present a threat to the humans, but its advantages outweighs its disadvantages. There are wide range of applications that this technology can have, and it must be used wisely."
