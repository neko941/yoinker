        "Spending of money by government is always debatable among the people. They believed that expenditure of amount on the arts is Profligate and it should be expended on other things. In my perspective, I strongly agree that this fund should be utilized for the betterment of health and education system.",
        "First and foremost, health is one of the crucial issue for every country. Every day new diseases are prevailing around and people are getting affected by them. Although, a lot researches are going on by the scientists for remedial, but additional funds are required for the fruitful results. To illustrate this, every year USA allocates billions of dollars for the researches in the health system in order to get the positive outcomes.  So, there is no doubt that government should devote finance to health facilities rather than disburse it on the arts.",
        "Secondly, in this era of advancement, education is the key factor for the progress of any country. In spite of this, quality education is becoming a dream for common people, because the expenses of this are getting out of the range. For instance, last year, a survey conducted by the University of Karachi across the Pakistan stated that majority of the parents do not send their children to schools because they could not afford the high fees.  At this point relevant authorities should step in and spend more money on the education and make it free for all.",
        "To recapitulate, disbursement of money on the arts is extravagant and I believe that concerned institutions should use it on the improvement of most important facilities like health and education."
