        "Nowadays, it is also very common for artists or celebrities to express their views on public opinion. This has both good and bad sides.",
        "On the first side, this issue has a lot of benefits not only for them but also for the general public. Firstly, the artist or celebrity will become more popular. They can rely on public opinion to push their careers further.Secondly, they can mention a lot of important information that ordinary people don't pay attention.Because of people's indifference to everything around, like climate change, ice melting,etc, celebrities have used their popularity to remind people to wake them up.",
        "Although there are so many good points, there are also many bad points. First, because this is their personal opinion and their expertise is not much, it is inevitable that they make mistakes or propagate misleading issues. Not only that, thanks to their popularity, they can cover up other important information or exaggerate it. For example, a celebrity can lead the public by spreading fake news that makes the truth go unnoticed.",
        "In short, celebrities may not understand a certain topic, but their opinion is still important because many times people don't pay attention to this important information. In this day and age, it is important to capture all the important information and each person's point of view in order to come up with the right solution."
