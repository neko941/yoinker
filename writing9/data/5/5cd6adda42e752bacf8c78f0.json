        "Earth is occupied 3/4th by water and the rest by land, where the term Land includes the forests, buildings, vehicles, everything. But increasing ratio of population is demanding a place to live either for shelter or for offices, which has highly sweeped the trees for such living, creating lot of problems to the mankind. This expansion has passed till the countryside areas, as there is no other place available for construction of houses, due to the unavoidable inclination of people.",
        "Decrease in the forests, result in the declination of human and natural resources that are required for mankind to lead life. For example, when trees are cut, it impacts in reduction of oxygen supply that is compulsory for a being, ultimately, water supply are drastically falls, as there will be hardly any rains. Obviously, paves way to the rapid attack of diseases, devastating the human life. Moreover, animals, birds and other species that live in the country side lose their shelter, food, etc., due to which species may die simultaneously.",
        "On the flip side, countryside lands expose the scenic essence of that Nation, bringing beauty to the country with their colorful naturality. Infact, they can be considered as landmarks, can be converted into exhibitions or places of visit for pleasure trips, and so on.   Well, children can be driven to educate them regarding the growth, necessity, advantages and disadvantages, practically. Many-a-times, family trips in the week ends can also be planned, in order to get relieved from the official and emotional pressures, consuming memorable time with relations and friends.",
        "Community has to recognize the benefits, that shall  walk to them, engrowing greenery should be considered as a gift to all, that can be act as an engraving cherishable memory in a remarkable way. I opine, it is better not to touch the outlands, rather look for alternatives within the city limits for a better, safe, happy, joyous and healthy living."
