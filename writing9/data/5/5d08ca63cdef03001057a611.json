        "Social interactions with people we share a building or a neighbourhood are among the crusial aspects in creating a safe and welcoming environment to our family and children. Unfortunately, these social interacitons are now seen less frequently and people know their neighbours much less.",
        "The decreased communicative interactions among those who live side by side is a reflection of the crucial changes that ocure in our communicative and social skills, as a result of the increased use of the internet and social medias such as Facebook, Instagram and others. It is much easier and accessiable to meet people online through different platforms, rather than going outside and talk to our neighbours directly. Also, virtual interactions allow people to be who they wish to be and hide different aspects of their personality, like physical diabilities or illnessess, if they are not interested in it. As a consequence, people nowdays tend to hide behind the computer and talk to our surrounding much less.",
        "Despite the above mentioned, their are ways through which we can increase interactions with the people we share our neighbourhood. First, direct meeting between neighbours can be encouraged by creating social events such as local parties or dinners. As a result, people will be able to engage in direct conversations and learn to know our close community. Second, spending  more time outside, playing soccer or riding our biccle, rather than infromt of the computer will increase the chances of us meeting other tenants.",
        "In conclusion, social interactions with our surrounding is important and should be encourages. By meeting the people who live around us we will be able to sustain a nice a flurishing community"
