        "These days more and more students are opting for abroad studies. Although, the main advantage of studying in foreign countries is that students are more focused in their studies, however, it is quite a herculean task to live away from family. In my opinion, studying in a different country has more advantages despite the challenges that they  will face inevitably.",
        "The Greatest benefit of acquiring knowledge away from country is that it makes students more focused and determined towards their study goals. Human by nature is a complexly designed Creation of the God, with the ability to adapt to every harsh circumstances. Being away from home, the inner conscious of responsibility makes a student more focused, committed, and determined towards study targets. Furthermore, the inner belief of achieving success encourages him to stay firm to attain the impossible ones. For example, when I studied in Qatar for two years, I used to work for twelve hours a day continuously without being exhausted. For these reasons, studying out of country has advantage because it keeps students in a track.",
        "The main disadvantages that students can face while acquainting knowledge out of country is the fact that they will be away from their families. This significantly puts them under immense psychological stress that can lead to depression if not coped with. A study in America, for instance, shows that growing number of foreign students  living there, are consulting their psychiatrists due to chronic stress and home sickness leading to depression. Due to these reasons, staying in some other country for purpose of education is a tough ask.",
        "To sum up, a toll taking number of students are studying outside their countries as part of their degrees. Although, it keeps them focused on their studies, however, it can put them under depression as well. But having said that, the advantage of studying abroad  is far more advantageous than the disadvantage of possible depression."
