        "Living in a foreign country, where an unknown language is spoken, could results socially and practically hard situation. In my opinion, it is not as dramatic issue as it seems for the first time.",
        "When we are moving to another country, we could feel ourselves  be lost. If we could not understand the language of our surroundings and we have no friends in that country, that situation could be really depressive. For example, when I have moved to Nottingham, I had zero friends there. I had been sitting in my room and I felt really frustrated. Due to these negative feelings I started to learn English much faster than before. That helped and a month later I started  looking for a new running group near  me. Moreover, the infrastructure of a new place could also be challenging. May you do not know how you should buy a train ticket or use  public transport. These problems also will be changed, as we will be more familiar with the language. However, this progress needs a lot of work.",
        "In terms of  more introverted people, this time could be really hard. To meet with new friends, who could help you to learn the language more quickly and experience  the new culture, it could be problematic if you are not open to new things. In this case, this frustration could cause serious social and practical problems. In the meanwhile, you could get help from a psychologist.",
        "Based on my experiences, I think the problems which are made by the foreign environment and the lack of a common language, could disappear easily, if we work hard to learn become more familiar with the new surroundings."
