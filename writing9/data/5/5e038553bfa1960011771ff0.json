        "Climate change has become an contentious issue resulting in debates on national and international level. Some people say that government should take intiatives to mitigate the problem of climate change, on contrary, others say that small steps taken by individual will make the difference. This essay will discuss both views and will give my opinion.",
        "To commence, individuals small steps could make the big difference to prevent the problems of climate change. For instance, if individuals opt to limit the use of plastic bags and recycle their plastic bottles instead of throwing it, this step could somehow help in mitigating climate problems. As plastic and milk bottle harms the environment when thrown, so instead of throwing them recycling them seem more  wonderful. In addition, individual can also choose to ignore the usage vehicle and use biycycle instead. As private vehicles are harmful for the environment because these things emit greenhouse gasses which directly influenced our environment, making it unbearable or specifically, making our climate more contaiminated. If private vehicles usage got limited then it will surely aid in reducing pollution.",
        "Futhermore, Government can make a big contribution in reducing climate change problems compare to individual. Temperature is increasing in atmosphere and major causes for this change is logging and toxic waste released from factories. Authorities can completely ban the wood in terms of industrial use and could impose strict rules or fines in the restricted areas. Moreover, Government could increase the number of trees by planting more trees. In addition, legislative should impose strict laws on masses to reduce the usage of fossil fuel and use renewable energy instead. As fossil fuel harm the climate when used by big vehicles such as trucks, and when used in trucks it emits carbon dixode which further harms the environment. And if renewable energy is introduced to masses it surely mitigate the problems of environment.",
        "",
        "In my opinion, Individuals and government should join hands to reduce the changing temperature in our atmosphere, this can be achieved by planting more trees and limiting the uses vehicle.",
        "",
        "To conclude, To alleviate climate change mence individuals and authorities needs to co-operate with each other."
