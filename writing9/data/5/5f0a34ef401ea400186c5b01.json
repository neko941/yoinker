        "There are many health complications for people who are working all day long resulting from doing little or no physical exercises.",
        "People who are working all day long are likely to get health complications due to doing no physical exercise. This essay will first suggest that hectic schedule is the primary reason why working individuals do not get enough exercise and then submit educating people concerning health hazards of sedentary behavior is the best solution curbing the damaging effects of this heinous trend.",
        "These days individuals lead to busy working days and as a result they are at a risk of numerous health concerns like obesity, heart related problems. When they get back home they get hardly any time for physical activities as well as stamina for doing physical activities. Moreover, due to addiction to television programmes and video games prevent them from doing also light physical exercises during their leisure time. Evidence shows that, the highest percentage of employees lead to sedentary behavior after working hours, which is accounting for 65 percent.",
        "Creating awareness among workers regarding detrimental health outcomes is the best remedy to eliminate this issue. As most people do not have any knowledge about the risks of being physical inactive to their health and well-beings, they tend not to do short activity breaks throughout the workdays. Short bouts of physical exercises throughout the day may have mood enhancing effect and can enhance immune function. According to recent research, employees who break their sedentary time by doing exercises are less likely to suffer from harmful effects of being inactive.",
        "In conclusion, the lack of planning and structure in our lives is likely contributing to the overall reduction of activity levels which lead to countless health problems. Encouraging physical activity is the best solution to mitigate this problem."
