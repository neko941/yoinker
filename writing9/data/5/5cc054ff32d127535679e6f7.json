        "People have different views on the stucture of the houses as some agrued that new homes should built in the same condition as the other older houses. Meanwhile, some suggest it would be better to design the homes according to the owner's preferences. In this essay, both of these notion will be discuss further.",
        "First of all, constructing a similar blueprint as the old homes has its' perks. It lends a classic look to the neighbourhood. Besides that, the residents will feel the sense of equality as it gives the impression of the neighbourhood standard of living is similar to theirs. Furthermore, the architects usually design the houses based on condition of the land and functionality of structure of the every part of the abode. Therefore, altering the structure of the homes may be unsuitable to live. For example, the extending the height of walls can be a huge issue if the resident unable to escape during emergency situation.",
        "On the other hand, designing homes according to the owner's tast may not be such a bad idea. Ones would say a home is a reflection of the householder's personality and similar home styles lack of character. Moreover, special features in the house is needed if the tenant is disable or to make their living more comfortable. For instance, a disable person may need a rail in the house instead of stair in order for them to move freely around the house. In addition to that, adding CCTV camera to modern home, aid in preventing burglar entry.",
        "In conclusion, though traditional homes is safer, in my opinion, modern touch in the abode would be a better as long as the construction follow the essential safety measure and more functional."
