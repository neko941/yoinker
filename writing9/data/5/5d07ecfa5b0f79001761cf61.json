        "In recent times, there is high demand of common consumer goods despite the fact that it is of no use to those living in the environment where it is sold. This is therefore a true reflection of advertisement. In my opinion, I believe advertising has truly had great influence on the choices people make.",
        "With the advent of modern technology, disseminating informationto the public has become easier and stronger compared to the pas, thus, making a lot of individualshave myriads of unnnecessary items in their possession. For instance, the social media platform was used by the apple company to advertise latest iphones such that there was a sudden crave for this hand-held device by the people, causing many individuals to acquire it despite the fact that they still had phones they were using before.",
        "Furthermore, another platform via which the people's minds have been captured is through advertisement displayed on billboards and this is no surprise because they are placed in very promnent locations such that everyone passing by is able to see it . Commonly displayed information is usually about the new product in the market and they look so captivating that whoever sees this advert is compelled to purchase the item whether they need it or not. For example, there was a billboard advertisement for a type of hair lotion few months ago near my residence which looked so enticing, thus, making several people to desire to have it even though they did not need it.",
        "In conclusion, advertising truly has great effect on the people's expenditure, thus compelling them to acquire items they do not utilize at all"
