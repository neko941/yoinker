        "The vast majority of professionals support the idea that children should start to learn foreign language at primary school, not secondary. This essay will argue that the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages. The essay will first demonstrate that the earlier individuals learn basis of non-native language the more likely their educational process will be smoother in future, thus they will be able to achieve natural sense of language understanding. Conversely, many students struggle to realize fundamental basics because of their lower ability to educate.",
        "The main reason to start learning process early in the fact that fluency and grammar understanding skills will mastered easily because of the proper approach to education, which is possible in many ways, this is because children are more passionate to explore new fields when they are younger. Moreover, young students will have more time resources in their scope to improve their knowledge from year to year, which is almost impossible for secondary school students who are cluttered with a numerous subjects such as chemistry or physics.  For example, in Scandinavian countries such as Norway or Sweden people speak English, as it is their native language since English taught from the very young ages. In addition, a recent survey from Harvard University found that children who studied a new language before the age of 6 were significantly more likely to achieve higher scores in art-related spheres such as painting or music.",
        "Those opposed to this say that it causes the child to become confused between their native, mother-tongue language and the other language. However, there are no evidences to support this view, moreover from my personal perspective children from bilingual families do well in both languages.",
        "In conclusion, the fact that early learning of foreign language leads to higher fluency as well as development of creative potential for a young explorer."
