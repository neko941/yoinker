        "It is said that people who read books have a better vocabulary, creative thinking and imagination compare to those who are more partial to watching TV. I completely agree with this statement due to a few reasons that I am going to discuss further.",
        "First and foremost, when you are reading you need to imagine the visualization by yourself, otherwise, you will not be thrilled by the book. It relates to diverse genres such as business literature, fiction, novel, fantasy and even history. Usually, while people reading, they do not have any illustrations so they have to transport all words into pictures.",
        "The second one is that reading forces brain functions so people can learn and remember a lot of fresh or uncommon words, especially, learning a new language that helps to broaden your vocabulary and enhance the manners to speak. Though, in order to learn a new language, it is also important to watch TV, or even better to use the Internet.",
        "Watching movies must be the best way to get used to a new language due to the reason that you need to have not only good reading skills, yet also listening and speaking skills. Some movies, probably, can help with imagination, particularly, when we are meaning fantasy with multiple storylines.",
        "To conclude, in order to enhance imagination, I incline to read, and to improve language skills in an additional language, I prefer watching."
