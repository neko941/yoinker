        "It is a common trend in many countries for individuals to purchase garments and groom themselves in line with the fashion in vogue. In my opinion, this is a negative development, which has an adverse effect on cultural background. This essay will discuss the reasons for this trend.",
        "The obvious reason why individuals pursue latest fashion trend is due to social peer pressure. The need to constantly mingle with others in the same social status without feeling left out is the driving force for individuals who keep up with fashion trend. An example is the Lekki Wives club of Lagos, where members are compelled to adorn themselves in line with the latest attire and hairstyles, in other to avoid been a social embarrassment to their club. Thus, members constantly strive to dress in vogue rather than in the old fashioned way.",
        "However, I believe this assertion has a negative effect on individual\u2019s cultural background. Clearly, people are recognised based on their cultural dressing and way of life. Hence, the quest to adopt the latest trend in both dressing and hairdo would lead to loss of cultural identity. For instance, the Aboringal, the original dwellers of Queensland in Australia, have lost their cultural identity. In a report given by James Smith in 1990, he attributed this to the constant drive of the dwellers to purchase sophisticated garments from other countries over a period of time. As a result, their cultural dressing as gone to extinction.",
        "In the whole, people pursue new fashion and hair styles because of peer pressure and I opine that this has a negative effect on a community\u2019s cultural identity."
