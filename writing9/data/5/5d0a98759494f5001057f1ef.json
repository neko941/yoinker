        "Forests produce lot of oxygen which is critical for human kind, in order to survive. But, every year the amount of area under forest is getting decreased. As they maintain the Eco balance, still we aren't considering the decrease. There are lots of reasons but few of them are discussed below.",
        "Firstly,  Food production, As there is rise in head count, food production need to be increased. In order to meet the demand, lot of land have been converted to farming, which made reduction of trees. Secondly, Rise not only required meal but also shelter. This also contributes to the cause. Third, Industrialization, In order to supply essential good more industries are constructed and for their establishment, they have choosen the area which is outside the living space. To meet such requirements, Jungle became the primary source for them.",
        "As we have an look on reasons for cause, now we will discuss regarding the effect of cause in future. Because of reduction, foremost cause is Ecological imbalance. It not only create less oxygen, but also impacts percentage of rainfall and in turn affects cultivation. For example, we will find more cool in villages or hilly area and place with lot many trees. After that, Global warming comes next. Because of damage of balance in nature, they will rise of temperature across the globe. Because of this, many people suffer with sun strokes and may lead to death of some.",
        "In Conclusion, To avoid problem's in future we need to go as much green as possible, by plantation. Government and NGO's with the help of common public should avoid deforestration. Educated should take responsibility to teach other's regarding the problem's."
