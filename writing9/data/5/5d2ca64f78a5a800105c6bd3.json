        "These days both in business domain and individual purpose, people either professionally or socially interact using technology, and not in-person. This essay will discuss both the benefits and drawbacks of availing technology for communicating purpose.",
        "There are several positive outcomes of using technology for communication. To begin with, using technology for communication purpose is beneficial for businesses, in terms of time and money. Top executives and employees need not to go for meeting with another firm or company\u2019s personals, as they can now interact with each other and discuss business issues through the use of latest technological applications, which, in turn, means saving time and budget, as corporation\u2019s personals would not need to travel and also save the expenses of commuting. The technology invention such as the Video Conferencing application, for instance, facilitates groups of people, by providing live videos streaming for people staying in even different countries uninterruptedly. This, in turn, save a huge amount of time and money for companies. Another advantage is that individuals can interact with their friends and family members in seconds, through a few clicks of computer buttons. This is because the internet, a worldwide application has certain programs and software\u2019s, through which people can see their friends and relatives who are staying far away from them. Social media platform\u2019s, Facebook and WhatsApp, for example, provides a free video calls, voice calls, voice messages, and text messaging facilities, through which one person can communicate to another, the same way if they are meeting in-person.",
        "There are also disadvantages of this change. Firstly, technology may not be efficient in some business cases. There comes certain situations in corporations which cannot be handled by the use of technological applications. A firm may be dealing with another organization for more critical and serious matters, as well as there may be disputes arise among businesses. This, in turn, means such circumstances can only tackled through face-to-face communication among persons from companies. Secondly, using technology for online shopping by individuals may be sometime not a good experience. People purchase products online, by just seeing them in the interface, a specific company\u2019s website is providing; however, they would not be able to judge the quality of an item. This is because the product they received after purchasing may not be same in quality, which they were thought of.",
        "In conclusion, technology is beneficial for businesses and people, in terms of saving time and money, as well as easy interaction with friends, respectively. There are also drawbacks such as inefficiency for companies and inconvenience for individuals."
