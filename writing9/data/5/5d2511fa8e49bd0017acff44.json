        "Books are thought to be an invaluable resource for all people; and reading books helps them to become better and more mature. Consequently, reading is also one of the most significant skills in children\u2019s development. To know how to read early, gives children great advantages compared to their classmates in performing their academic studies. Therefore, reading skills are really necessary for them. In addition, some other preschool factors influence well to children\u2019s achievements later, too.",
        "For not only adults but also children, reading skills give the brain which is the most important part in our body facilities for starting and moving, then contribute to strengthen children\u2019s growth. Besides, reading makes children enhance their power of thinking, as well as, expand their ability of imagining and creating about what are surrounding them. Imagination and creation get children to become more excited and emotional. In addition, reading is one of the most basic and necessary skill for children in academic study later. Children who know how to read before going to school could advance in their study more easily and better than normal students; since they have more time to practice other subjects and skills. Moreover, reading early builds up not only concentration and patience, but also competence of communicating and expressing. Of course, the earlier children read, the easier they fall into the habit of reading and the more they get many benefits.",
        "Although early reading skills give children many good things in their process of development, there are lots of other preschool factors having significant influences on their achievements afterwards. Firstly, playing sports, often helps children keep good health and strong body, and in addition, improve their speed of thought and reaction and also helps them to develop skills of teamwork. For example, playing badminton requires you having dexterity and agility to observe and parry a shuttlecock from their opponents exactly. Playing games also is a useful way to heighten their intellection. Secondly, group games including many kinds like hopscotch and running games, help children to become active and competitive. Furthermore, parents should attach special importance to teach them some life skills, including how to communicate, help others, deal with fairness, manage money and plan everything little by little.",
        "To conclude, early reading and many other preschool factors, such as sports, group games and music, enables children to achieve intelligence and perform better in their higher studies. In addition , parent's advices and involvement in the child's development is crucial"
