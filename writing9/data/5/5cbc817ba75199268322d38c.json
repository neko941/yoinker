        "In the worls where appearance matters the most, it becomes difficult to design a building based on its usage. While designing, it is important to consider the use of building rather than its exterior. This essay will argue why it is important to design according to its function.",
        "On one hand, all famous building are known for its appearance rather than its function. Architects and planners are pushed to an extent to design for the outlook and in doing so the function is compromised. These building sets as an example and changes the mindset of client that the appearance is more essential than the usage. For instance, Famous architect Zaha Hadid focuses on designing the form of the building first and then tries to fit in the function later according to the shape. This situation results in compromise the building's function to a certain extend. Her works are known for its appearance which eventually creates a view that the exterior is considered highly needed.",
        "On the other hand, all logical thinkers agree that it is mandatory to focus on the planning of  the building than its outward appearance. There is famous ideology of one of the famous architect - ' form follows function' which means, a building should built based on its function. During ancient era, people built structures for survival, as technology started they started to adapt to the changes by adding elements to their structures. For example, Building a wooden structure on a earthquake prone area is utterly useless because it doesnt serves the purpose. Here the apperance of building will certainly cause problem to the entire structure. This clearly explains why it is important to design according to the usage rather looking after the appearance.",
        "This essay argued that why it is necessary to plan a building according to its usage. In my opinion its extremely important to design a structure based on its fucntion rather than its appearance."
