        "Getting married is the most beautiful thing in this life! Nowadays, the gay wedding seems to be normal in most of the country, but people still have lots of question marks for this phenomenon. Some people afraid that gay marriage can cause plenty of drawbacks for society. However, there is another group thinks it is right to let gays get married. In my opinion, gay marriage should be legal and people should have a positive view with gays. I do believe that there is no barrier exist in love.",
        "As we all know, having a gay wedding in the 21st century is not a strange thing. Homosexual people are being treated better and equally. Gladly, they do not afraid of society like before and they have a right to fight for themselves. For a long time, not only gays community but also other genders were asking for legalization of gay marriage. In fact, this law does not approve of around the world. Why is it so?",
        "First of all, people still afraid of the drawbacks that gay marriage can cause. Some parents do not discriminate the gays, but they afraid their children will look the homosexual like a trend and follow it. It is truly happening in most of the Asia countries, the place that everyone thinks the goal of the marriage is producing the new generation. In addition, the previous generation still cannot accept gays and think that this is a negative development.",
        "However, society still has another group which supports and thinks that gays get married is right. Gays are like other females and males, they also deserve to have a happy ending and a great family. It is called gender equality. No one says that the definition of \u2018\u2019marry\u2019\u2019 is to have kids, or it has to be done by men and women. People still have a happy family without children even the normal couple. Humans should have positive views for them because they have been trying so hard for many years to prove to the world that gays also have a right to live, love and to be loved.",
        "Homosexual people are not able to choose their gender and they deserve to have a legal gay marriage law. I have a gay friend and I know it is hard to live as gay. It would not be a negative development if humans have positive thinking and feeling.",
        "In conclusion, I do believe all the genders are having a right to love. I hope that gay marriage will be approved over the world in the future. Love has no right or wrong and it depends on your feeling."
