        "Children are the future for their country and they are the one's how create or decide prospect of the world. In some nations, teenagers are deployed in practical learning and others are deployed in traditional learning. In this essay, I would explain, how schools equip their students to get ready for the world?",
        "To embark on, educational institutes should include current technologies, trends and, subjects related to demanding skills in their syllabus. For example: These days computer education is requires for all trending jobs, hence most of the schools, in my country, have included computer education from the basic level. It would help students to get familiar with computers well before they are ready for work. Inclusions of these types of subjects help students to apply for any kind of jobs. In traditional way of school all these subject were not available and it caused many issues regarding job ready work force.",
        "Secondly, educational hubs should focus on practical and theoretical equally and must emphasize on way of implementing of learnt knowledge. For instance: during my collage days teachers were more focused on application of physics law, rather than cramming this law. If school develops this type of habits in student, it would definitely help firms as they get trained workers.",
        "To sum up, it is necessary to include modern subject and modern way to learning from initial level of schooling. After including these changes, schools have had skillful workers, Instead of students who require one more level of training before deploying to any workplace."
