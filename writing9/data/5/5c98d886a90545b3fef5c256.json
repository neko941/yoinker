        "Animals form a chain of ecosystem, and exploitation of these creatures will lead to imbalance in nature, as they reduce in umber, so they should have same rights as humans. On the other hand, employing animals and using them for consumption and research leads to scarcity of animals while, they too have equal right to live. In my opinion, animals should not be exploited by people since they too have the right to live.",
        "Animals should be given equal importance as humans, we can find industries producing commercial goods made of animal products. For instance, hand bags and belts are found to be made of animal skin, which are used by large population irrespective of gender. Furthermore, animals are trained for human benefits where, they are bought from forest into the city and trained to work in circus and also exhibited in zoo. Moreover, most of the products are clinically tested on animals in laboratories in order to prove that they can use it safely. Besides this, humans consume most of the animal meat which leads to killing of animals to satisfy human hunger. All these have resulted in reduction of animal species and some are at their extinction.",
        "Some people think, animals are meant to fulfill their various needs as they are easily reproduceable and can be cloned to increase in number. For example, parties are incomplete without non-vegetarian diet, and high society people use expensive e accessories made of animal products, all these are matters of prestige which are fulfilled at cost of animal life and important for them to maintain their standard. However, I feel animals should have freedom and equal right to live their life along with their families and should not be exploited by people.",
        "In short, animals are also living beings and all living life have right to live according to their will so we have no right to mistreat or kill them."
