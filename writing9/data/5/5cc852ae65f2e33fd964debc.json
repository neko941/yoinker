        "In the world of today, the arguments around whether the government or the residents should be responsible to the managing cleanliness of living areas is becoming increasingly common. The last few decades have seen enormous changes in the way people think about who should be responsible for cleaning the areas where people live. While certain demographics of society believe that government should be responsible for cleaning the environment, many are of the opinion that the cleanliness should be managed by people living in the street. This essay will discuss both views in depth but emphasize on why it is essentially necessary for people living in a locality to be responsible to managing the sanitation of the environment.",
        "From an overall perspective, government should be responsible for ensuring environments where people live are safe from dirt. Firstly, they have the power and authority to make laws and policies. They can also force people to adhere to this policies by attaching penalties. For example, the government created a law that prohibits people from dropping wastes while driving from cars and this has led to great improvement in the cleanliness of this area.",
        "Conversely, People should be responsible for the maintaining neatness in the environment they live since they are the ones affected by the dirt of the area. As an example, suburb\u2019s residents took the responsibly of managing the cleaning of the environment has it has been very productive.",
        "In conclusion, while having the government take the responsibly of maintaining waste pollution-free environment is not a bad idea, I believe quite strongly that having people manage the environment they live is absolutely imperative. If the government give the people necessary education, they will manage their environment better."
