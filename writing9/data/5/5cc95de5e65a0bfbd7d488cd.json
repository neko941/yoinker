        "Opinions vary on whether History is less trivial than Science and Technology. I can understand the reason why some people think that, however I am opinion  of History plays a vital role in school.",
        "It is undeniable that there are some benefits in studying History to some extents. The first element is students can gain a vast knowledge  about their country , for example, In Vietnam, one of Asian country  which  suffered from a difficult  period time of war and seperation , learning History help students enhance their national identity and patrionism . Another point is the fact that enables youngsters to be open to new ideas when pursue to World history . The world development is contributed by much success and failure , students can withdraw some lessons from historical events in the past about humanity and tolerance, which is a effective way to motivate them into a law-abiding citizen in the future.",
        "Despite the aforementioned argument, Science and Technology have hold different responsibility in term  of technology innovation and the nature of everything. Regarding the former, given that the development of technology, the important role of science and technology is emphasized, the job market requires more employees graduating from science university. It is substantial to concentrate on science and technology to meet the requirements of the career. The other beneficial aspect is that science and technology subjects at school are the basic steps for a higher understanding of the nature of how everything runs and provide soon-to-be scientists and inventors.",
        "In conclusion, both these subjects are extremely necessary at school."
