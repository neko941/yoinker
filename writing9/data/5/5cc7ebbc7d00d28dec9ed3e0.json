        "Agriculture is the a very important source of food globally and for this reason, lots of investment and advances have been made in this sector. Despite this, hunger is still a problem among many people. This essay will examine why this is so and possible solutions to this problem.",
        "To start, famine is still a matter of global concern today more so in underdeveloped African countries and Asia. The list of causes of hunger in these nations is endless. Civil war to start with, is at the top of the list. Countries currently in civil war crisis experience unbearable famine. This is because agricultural activities are scuttled in war situations and few agric produce destroyed by grenades and bombs. Yemen for instance suffers a great deal of hunger due to war crisis ongoing for years there. Other causes of hunger among nations of the world are corrupt government misappropriating funds for agricultural loans. Global warming and green house gases negatively affecting farm  produce. Lazy youths avoiding outdoor farming no matter how advanced and mechanised it is.",
        "Not withstanding, these causes and problems are not without solutions. Global warming as a challenge mitigating  against advances in agriculture and food production is far reaching. Government should make policies and device strategies that will will cut down on activities that worsen global warming. For example, reduction of fossil fuel use, alternative fuel and energy sources, measures against deforestation and desertification  will enhance yield of agricultural produce. The result is more food and less hunger. In addition until peace is restored in warring nations, the populace would not benefit from the developments in Agriculture. Corruption should be fought seriously for citizens to benefit from international funds on agriculture and food production.",
        "In conclusion, this essay has examined the causes of hunger amidst global efforts and investment in agriculture, as well as the possible way out. Advances in agriculture will continue to be futile if these solutions are not implemented."
