        "As it says, necessity is the mother of invention; people keep trying to invent convenient ways to live life comfortable manner. More and more researches are carried out, so that people can avail facilities in life. There are many benefits of having ready to eat food, however, there are certain drawbacks to it too, that a person should keep in mind, in order to keep a good balance between its merits and demerit. This essay shall discuss both and will suggest a plausible conclusion based on rational justification.",
        "There are two basic things that define living a modern life, first and foremost is the power to purchase facilities like; all the luxuries and comforts of life. Secondly, the ability to enjoy them and both are connected with another two factors such as, money and health. One has to earn enough money means spend more hours on work and that is only possible when a person spends less time on any other activity such as, making food to him or herself. It is one of the most times taking and tiring activity that needs to be done on daily basis. The use of preserved food has reduced this problem to a great extent, now individual has no need to spend numerous hours in kitchen. This saves time as well as energy, as it is quickest come easiest way of having meal. For instance, a working woman can save its time spend on preparing food and can spend quality time with family, in this way she can keep a good work-life balance.",
        "In contrast, as mentioned above, ability to enjoy greatly depends upon good health. Eating processed food all the time also adversely affects health; it got a number of harmful chemicals used for preservation. These days, it is a taboo talk how cancer is spreading due to the use of cane foods, due to excess use of it, as now; people prefer more of quick good than homemade healthy food. Other health related issues includes, obesity, increased insulin problem, high blood pressure are some of the most common consequence of using these products are. Further, it cannot beat the hygiene that, a family member can maintain when preparing food for their loved ones.",
        "In conclusion, in order to pace with this modern time, people has to adopt facilities available to them and no doubt despite of having many disadvantages, its advantage overweight its negative effects ,but, for that, person should try to keep a good balance between a homemade food and ready to eat food so its dreadful effects could be minimized."
