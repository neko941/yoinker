        "As tourism industry is gaining more attention, according to some English language will become the only verbal communicative way around the world. While single spoken language can damage other cultures massively, i believe that it will bring more financial gains by making interaction easy.",
        "The main drawback of English becoming single interactive language is that it will harm other cultures. This is because, people will no longer have the interest  to practice their own language rather than English. As a result, they will lose contact with their native culture and will lose connection with their heritage. In this process they suffer from identity crisis which will massively hurt their art and film industry. Nevertheless, one communication language will lead to easy access to different countries and can lead to massive financial gain.",
        "Having one communication method will make interaction much easier. In this era of globalization if a country want to improve their business, they must need to interact with other country effectively. This is because, the underdeveloped and developing countries are earning revenues through exporting goods to developed countries. For example, the GDP growth of Bangladesh was 7% in 2019 due to the fact that they have exported a massive amount of garments to Canada and this become possible as they introduced English as a second language in their country. This is a clear indication that how same verbal language can contribute in a countries economy.",
        "In conclusion, Although one language can harm a nations culture, i believe that it brings much financial advantages which can lead to prosperity."
