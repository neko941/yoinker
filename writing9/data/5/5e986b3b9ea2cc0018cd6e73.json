        "Many people tend to use things which are used on a daily basis  only once, then throw it away:  clothes, plastic utensils and bags which are compiled in our environment. An increasing number,  might consider that these kind of selfish behaviour is due to  our growth into  a 'single use culture '. I, however, completely agree that  reckless disposal of trash and reusable stuff is an undeniable proof of our narcissistic behaviour as a society  and metamorphoses into this negligence and 'one use culture'. this essay addresses the issue and discussing viable solution.",
        "One reason to support my opinion is that modern lifestyle of leisure and redundancies has contributed greatly in the  situation. furthermore, people are actively using more and throwing way more than ever before  and that prove how a  materialistic world we live in.",
        "",
        "",
        "Moreover, companies should have invested in high quality, durable merchandize instead they are mass producing low quality single use cheap items which in term filling our environment  as waste. although, some people consider new is always better, I genuinely think that it is crucial to use things to their fullest. Additionally,  we should try to abolish the stigma behind the use of old items and repairing them, and only then we could change peoples attitude toward the problem.",
        "To sum up,  governments   must play a key role in  enforcing  the recycling process on major economic entities and legislate strict laws to make sure the manufacturers and the consumers abide by recycling guidelines that would be later announced."
