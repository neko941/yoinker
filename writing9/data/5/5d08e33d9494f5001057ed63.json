        "Nowadays, braindrain is becoming a common trend and more students travel internationally for higher studies. Whereas some people reckon that there are numerous benefits of studying abroad while others oppose this phenomena. However, both merits and demerits are associated with it.",
        "To begin with, migration to developed nation for study is beneficial fir certain reasons. The chief advantage is opportunity to experience a new culture. In other words students will learn the culture and language of other nation. This way they can acquire more knowledge about the traditions of other community and become multilinguistic. Furthermore, it is undeniable that developed countries are more sound in technologies and facilities than underdeveloped nations, therefore, pupil will have more academic benefits when they will use scientific facilities and advanced technologies which are unavailable in their native nation.",
        "On the other hand, negative consequences of this phenomena are also remarkable. First and foremost is home sickness, the students who move to foreign countries for study have to stay away from their home and family and it is obvious that they will miss the love and warmth of their parents which can cause stress and anxiety in them, hence, their academic records might declined. Moreover, study in other country is expensive and sometimes it is unaffordable by impoverished states. Currency changing procedure, for instance, as people have to expand a lot of their money when they exchange it with foreign currency.",
        "In conclusion, I personally believe that the upsides of braindrain is greater than its downsides, so, this trend should be progressive in spite of its extreme cost."
