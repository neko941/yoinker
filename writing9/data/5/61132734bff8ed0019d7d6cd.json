        "Age:63 years",
        "I am writing this letter to update on Mr Friedan, who requires follow-up care at your service as he is recuperating from a total hip replacement surgery. He is being discharged today.",
        "Post-operatively ,although the surgery was uneventful ,he seemed to be disoriented which is suspected as the anaesthetic effect .Whilst our care, he is provided with regular dressing and treated with Aspirin (100mg) ramipril (5mg )and pandeine forte (6 tablets daily )to relieve pain as well. He uses a wheelie -walker to assist motion and wedge-pillow, which is dispensed from our facility and he will need toilet raiser also; however,a raiser has been recruited for two weeks by the help of a local medical supplier.",
        "In view of the above ,it would be greatly appreciated, if you could come up with all the actions required for his optimum level of functioning by providing the suggested stretching exercises.",
        "Please note that he will have to check with full blood examination along with urea creatinine and electrolytes.",
        "Should you have any queries, please do not hesitate to contact.",
        "Yours sincerely",
