        "It is seen that in many cities around the world, nowadays, junk food or street food has become an integral part of the daily lives of people. This trend, however, has been questioned by some for having negative impacts on public health and well-being. I firmly agree with this claim as this fast food trend has been seen bringing detrimental effects on people,especially children and youngsters.",
        "One of the prominent reasons to condemn the outside food is the way it is being prepared and served in a very unhealthy environment. Because of this mal practices, those who eat junk food put their health at risk. It has been reported time and again in various research papers that such foods are prepared by adding unhygienic materials to enhance flavors and if eaten regularly, people would fall ill consequently. The obesity data that has come up the highest in this year in the USA where fast-food culture has ubiquitously accepted, which is an alarming situation.",
        "Another reason behind supporting the claim of negative effects is the way it has made people\u2019s routine lives disturbed. In other words, owing to the readily available fast-food, many people tend to skip the home-made food which is supposed to be healthier. Those who have fast-food items in their daily routines are highly likely to take more oil, sugar and carbohydrates which in turn produce bad cholesterol. Ultimately, certain diseases like hypertension and diabetes have become common among the people, which was not the case in past generations.",
        "Henceforth, it can be strongly conveyed that fast food varieties are prone to increase the health hazards.  Due to its preparation methods and its role in people\u2019s routine, fast food culture has deteriorated public health gradually."
