        "It is argued that,to achieve the success we should take risks,while others think that careful planning is good step to get success.This essay agrees with this statement,firstly, it will dicuss the fact that how careful planning is best way to be successful and secondly, it will show what factors can be done to achieve success in life.",
        "To begin with,a good plan can lead us to success because firstly,with a plan, we make lists of the goals that we want to accomplish. In other words,we know clearly what we have to do and how we can get what we want easily.For instance,a students makes their studypaln to get good grades in the school, which is very helpful method. . However, taking risks is not a good because we never know what can happen.To put it another way, risks are dangerous step, it all depens on the luck and they do not have surity, while plans have less risk of failure.",
        "Another factor to consider is that, when people organise the success plan, they  get to know how much time they need and finiancial requirements it has in this way, they learn to become patient and know deeply what there aims are. It allows people to find an easier way to reach their aim. To illustrate, a recent research carried out  by Cambridge University showed that, planning is the key to success because people know what they have to do and this thing lead them to be  more motivated rather than taking risks.",
        "In conclusion, after having discussed pertinent points, I believe that we should organise the things in good way so in the future we can easily achieve our goals."
