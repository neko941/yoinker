        "Reading books is the only place where, we keep our ego aside and completely submit our self to the vision of the writer. So some parents argue that kids should not read entertaing articles, instead reading only educational novels everytime. In my opinion, I agree with the statement because knowledgeable books develop a way to lead a life and also forces young minds to think about purpose of your life.",

Educational articls does gives a clear picture how, to be desipline in life, at the same time it gives immense confidence  to be oneself and speak with their mind. One of the best examples of this kind of book is Author Ian Rand\u2019s Fountainhead, In this last four decades, it was the most famous self helped book, how to  to be strong and confident to face the real world for childrens.",
