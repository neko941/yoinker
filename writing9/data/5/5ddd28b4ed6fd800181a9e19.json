        "Travelling by own vehicle will give you immense pleasure that too with your loved ones.While some people argue that travelling  within a city by car is better. however, others argue that bicycle is better. In this essay I will discuss why bicycle is better, but why travelling in the car is far more superior.",
        "Many people thinks that travelling is bicycle is the best way of transportation. because bicycle will help in reducing pollution and best for exercise. To illustrate this with an example, when a person suffes from obesity, the first advice doctor tend to provide is to switch for bicycle rather than a car or bike. secondly as a  bicyclist you can enjoy the clean air while travelling. Wind will strike your face, this will makes people contempted. Thus travelling by this mode will be more suitable, in case if you are travelling alone.",
        "On contrary if you are travelling with your family the most suitable way of transportation is by the car that too within a city. Travelling in the car will help you to spend quality time with your dear ones which is not possible in earlier one, and also it will make the journey a comfortable one. for example,the car can accomadate atleast 4 to 5 persons and It will enable you to continue your journey; even during a bad weather conditions.To sum up this car is the best way of travelling, when considering to travel with leisure and with peoples.",
        "To Conclude this, travelling within the city by your own vehicle will give you pleasure.However, in this essay we discussed why some people prefer bicycle, while others prefer car. In my opinion travelling via car is more safe and economic in tearms of travelling with more people"
