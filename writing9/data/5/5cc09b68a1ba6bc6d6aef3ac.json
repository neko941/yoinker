        "Improved science and technology brought people a variety of food in changing quality. It is argued by some that this change is a positive development. On the other hand, it is redeemed as harmful for others. In my opinion, changes on food as a result of science and technology is an improvement.",
        "On one hand, cutting edge technology and scientific improvements enhance food industry. Firstly, new research and developments results in increase in efficiency on agriculture. For instance, fertilizers gathered from worms brought a huge increase on the harvest, therefore many farmers started to use this type of fertilizer instead of traditional ones. Secondly, food quality has risen due to recent technological advances. Systems like drop-watering keeps crops hydrated even in very difficult circumstances like shortage of water. As a result, food will be in a better quality.",
        "On the other hand, some people worries about the developments in technology and science will be harmful. People claim some technology like genetic changes will result in diseases such as cancer, however, researches show no evidence for this hypotheses. Also, it is believed that latest scientific developments for production pollutes the environment in a high rate. For example, people believe that agricultural chemicals result in soil and water pollution, however developed methods brings more clean solutions due to the previous knowledge.",
        "In conclusion, it is true that science and technology improvements changed the variety and quality of food that people can buy. Some people believe that it is an improvement, but others believe it is dangerous. In my opinion, science and technology affected food in a positive way due to developments in food industry and food quality."
