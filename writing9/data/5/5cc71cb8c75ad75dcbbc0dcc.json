        "Leading economists estimate that by 2050, the global population will have increased by more than 7 billion. In fact, some people believe that right now, humanity's greatest challenge is regulating the growth of the world's population. In this essay, I shall expose the reasons behind this phenomenon. Then I shall explain why I believe that it is indeed the greatest problem faced by manking",
        "During the twenty-first century, the global human population is predicted to mostly increase on the African continent. The main cause behind this exponential growth in Africa is the development of new technologies which enable the dowrise of diseases. Indeed, thanks to medical improvement, there are less and less children who die at a young age. It is known that African people tend to give birtht around 5 or 6 children because it is a tradition. As a result, populations in Africa grow at very high rate",
        "In my opion the rise of the world's population is probably one of the biggest threats to mankind. We ought not to forget that on our planet we have very limited ressources. The uprise of the global will have some drastic consequences. A significant amount of scientist believe that there will not be enough food and water for everybody. Henceforth some people will die as there are too poor to nourrish themselves. The increase of the population will also require the construction of new houses and apartments. However due to the small amount of space on Earth, an substantial amount of people will become homeless.",
        "In conclusion, many reasons are behind the growth of the world's population. We could argue that there are potentially many elements at steak with this gloabl trend. In my point view, if we want mankind to live in a noble and civilised way, we must immediately take actions in order to prevent this tremendous increase."
