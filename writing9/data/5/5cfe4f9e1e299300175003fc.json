        "Most people would argue that today, preparing food is simpler than it was in the past. I think this has enhanced people\u2019s lifestyle.",
        "Undoubtedly, modern appliances which play an important role in making food easier consume electricity. For instance, my family has noticed a dramatic rise in electricity bill amount, by 2000 rupees, after starting the usage of the microwave and electric stove in food making. This means anyone, whose with low monthly income is very low such as 10000 rupees, cannot afford to pay 30% of his salary to electricity bill in this fast-growing expensive lifestyle. where he has to manage other expenditure of daily household. In short, some people may not be able to improve their lives by adopting easier food making strategies.",
        "Nevertheless, contemporary methods of food preparation has improved our livesfe in many ways. For example, quick food preparation means savinge huge amount of time. My wife and I both work for at least 10 hours a day. Now if she cooks without modern appliances, she will spend more time in the kitchen only, and cannot give much attention to other activities. On the other hand, with the help of modern cooking methods, she prepares breakfast like scrambled eggs in just a minute in the microwave. This has helped both of us in maintaining our work-life balance.",
        "Furthermore, citizen\u2019s health has also improved with today\u2019s food making techniques. When it used to take longer was lengthier to prepare food, most people who lived far from their homes prefered  to eat outside food. This meants eating in low quality food and with fewer nutrients. This has resulted in many dangerous diseases, such as food poisoning and stomach cancer. However, today anybody can bake food anywhere. For instance, I prepare my evening snacks in office\u2019s microwave. Moreover, during my college time, my roommates and I were using electric-stove to make most of the food, like noodles and, bread, and so on in ourt hostel-room.",
        "In conclusion, it is clear that nowadays cooking has become very easy and this has ameliorated human\u2019s people's living standards by saving their vital time and improving their health."
