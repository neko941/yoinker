        "Over the past decades, technology has advancing in an extremely rapid and unpredictable way. There are a lot of new online applications which can create a more convenient life among people such as social networking. Seemingly, getting to know new friends via online or face-to-face has sparked a hot debate recently. I personally think that they are both feasible and there have no conflicts between them. Reasons will be showcased in the following.",
        "To start off, making new acquaintance through online social platforms can definitely break the geographical barrier and makes interaction between people easier.  Without the limitation of time zones and locations, online users living from different parts of the world can interact and communicate freely. Moreover, it can enhance globalization as people can share different information about their hometown\u2019s culture and background via the internet, make the world as a whole.",
        "On the other hand, internet chatting networks are definitely easy to use and manage. What users need is just a hardware such as a mobile phone or a laptop, and there are a great variety of networking applications which can be downloaded by free. The instructions provided by most of the applications are always simple to be understand and follow. Thus, people living in the global village can start a new friendship whenever, wherever and whoever they want in a liable way.",
        "Meanwhile, except knowing new companions via the online, a face-to-face one is also encouraged in the modern world. By different kind of body language, facial expression and tone of voices, people can have a solid grasp of a person\u2019s character and personality. Hence, the quality of a conversation can be raised. However, it is concerned that people who live in a cosmopolitan will have difficulty in meeting new friends in the real world since they often have a busy lifestyle which making them hard to spare time on it.",
        "To sum off, I deem that both views have their advantages and there is no contradictions between them. I believe they are indispensable to people living around the world and I can foresee there will be more new technology coming to facilitate communication between people."
