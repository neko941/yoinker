        "Parenting is a critical course when comes to their overall progress of children in terms of an education, career and settlement, etc. Due to this phenomenon parents are imposing a lot of pressure in order to achieve the maximum possible success in their life. In my opinion, with this progression of imposing un-necessary things on kid\u2019s only drawbacks comes in plate as results.",
        "To begin with, the majority parents want to keep their children ahead of package, such as the education, career and an overall success in settlement. In order to fulfill their concerns, they used to impose a tremendous pressure on kids about an education to get the good marks and a proper job etc. For example, a survey conducted by the Unicef Inc. in 2015 in relation to \u201cCauses of Stress in Children\u201d, and results were extremely shocking. In most of the similar cases, around 2/3 times the parents are completely responsible for stress in children which result in poor all in all progress of a child.",
        "In addition to this, another aspect of this issue need to be noted which is too severe as, kids commit suicide due to unbearable burden by guardians. They are pushed to their limits to give their best in the life. For instance, a continuation of a same survey Unicef Inc. illustrate one more downside of this issue called \u201cMental Illness\u201d and the reasons were same as above.",
        "In conclusion, by imposing extreme burden on children will only affect them in terms of education, mental health, difficulty in relations with parents and career etc. In my opinion, with this strategy parents will get only adverse effect on their children."
