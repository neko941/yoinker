        "Celebrity status has both positive and negative aspects in people\u2019s lives. This essay believes that the advantages of being famous outweigh the disadvantages, as celebrities have access to VIP events and have great financial rewards. However, they also have a lack of privacy that will be also discussed in this essay.",
        "Celebrities around the world have access to premier events, which are just for few important people that have access to. This is due to they are known and they will attract the media attention, bringing benefits for both companies and artists. Take the Golden Globe as a example; only people that were invited have access to the red carpet. In addition, famous personalities receive high payments that allow them to live a comfortable life with their families. For instance, Super Bowl in the USA every year choose a celebrity to perform at their stage during the game break and they pay thousand of dollars for this presentation.",
        "However, being famous have some drawbacks and the major complain is about the lack of privacy. Many artists have to deal with Paparazzi in their day-to-day lives, since they follow them everywhere in order to have breaking news. The TV program E!, has many journalists following celebrities everyday to take a picture or recording a video of their private moments to publish in the gossip magazines.",
        "In conclusion, even though celebrities have to be aware that their lives can be exposed by the Paparazzi, the benefits of being famous far outweigh the negative aspects, since they are very well compensate with high salaries and access to events that can make them even more famous."
