        "Many young people find it difficult to get a job in their chosen fields upon graduation. This inability has caused fresh graduates to take up job offers in another/entirely different field and some are even forced to accept below graduate level jobs. In my opinion, the root of this problem lies in the outdated higher education system that should be modernised.",
        "One obvious point that resulted in graduates not being able to get jobs in their respective field is that the traditional education does not prepare students for their first job for a number of reasons. One of them is that many programmes are too theoretical, highly educated graduates lack simple skills required for employment. For example, the knowledge of IT software; employers prefers candidates with hands-on experience. Another reason is that universities offer too many courses in popular fields, such as business, law and management and do not admit enough students for engineering and science programmes. As a result of this, the labour market has an over supply of management and law graduates and a deficit of engineers.",
        "A reform of higher education could alleviate many of the problems but would require joint efforts from universities, employers of labour and the government. Universities should work closer with employers, this will avail the students to be taught practical skills that companies look for. Meanwhile, the government could develop guidelines on the number of students to be given admission in each subjects in accordance with the market demand.",
        "In conclusion, to reduce the challenges faced by school leavers in getting jobs in thier field, the government and universities management should work together as a team to update the contents of courses to suit employers demand. Furthermore, number of students admitted in each school subject should be in line with the market demand."
