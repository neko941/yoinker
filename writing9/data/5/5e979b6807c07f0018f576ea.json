        "Many individuals think that animals are deceived by humans because  they are not given equal right as a human. Others think that animal can be used to satisfy  various needs of humans. According to me, Human does not have rights to exploit animals and use them as slaves however ,animals can be used in ethical ways .In this essay i will discuss both view points and give my opinion on it .",
        "There are several reasons why people feel that animals are exploited and should given same rights as humans.First ,animals are used in labs for research for testing medicines.Labs person will purposly infict pain on animals to do medicine testing or just to know the reaction  of animals .For example, rats , monkey owl dogs main labs animals to be used in labs in various countries. Secondly ,animals are kept in wire cages just to served in our plates. Most  animal in the cages are deaseased or dead and most them never seen a sun light.lastly animals used for travelling and entertainmant purpose which is another selfish way of using animal and  abuse them.",
        "animal can be used in more ethical as it is not possible for humans to live without depending on animals .",
        "goverment can impose rule so that animals will suffer less.The nonessential use of animals can be stop such as in labs,circus or zoo. In slaughter houses, people can provide atleat living environment to animals to so  that they can have good life before getting killed.",
        "to conclude that,It is not possible to give equal right to animals as humans however goverment can impose some rules to stop the animal exploitation and abuse.Animal feel same pain as human to use them for selfish means is inhumane according to me"
