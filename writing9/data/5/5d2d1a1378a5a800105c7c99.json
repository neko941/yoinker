        "Reading books is the only place where, we keep our ego aside and completely submit our self to the vision of the writer. So some parents argue that kids should not read enternaiment articles, instead reading only educational novels everytime.

Educations articls does gives a clear picture how to be desipline in life, at the same time it gives immense confident to be your self and speak with your mind. One of the best example of this kind of book is Author Ian Rand\u2019s Foundahead, In these last four decades it was the most famous self helped book to be strong and confidents to face the real world for childrens.",
