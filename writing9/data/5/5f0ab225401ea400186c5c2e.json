        "Nowadays, single efforts can barely make a difference because of the alarming climatic issues at a larger level. This essay agrees with the statement because of the deforestation at the global level, and it is not the one-man revolution to tackle this. Secondly, automobile pollution is every state's concern, but without the government's intervention and public support it cannot be resolved.",
        "Deforestation is one of the biggest environmental issues that can be seen at the global front, which one country cannot solve at its own, instead, the collaboration of every state is the need of an hour. If a tree planting is carried out by every nation only then problems associated with the forest clearing such as floods, an increase in the fire incidents can be controlled. The World environmental organisation has said, if every country plants 1 million trees a week, can help in the restoration of depleted natural resources over which survival of humankind depends.",
        "Secondly, very few people who own private vehicles are using public transports, which doesn't help in reducing the number of cars on roads causing air pollution. Due to this, air quality has worsened",
        "that requires the attention of every state government and people. Governments must bring in new laws with a strict enforcement, and making people aware of the consequences they have to bear if timely and appropriate steps are not taken. In Delhi, the capital of India, a joint revolution of media, NGOs, and the government was started, which was to encourage people to board public transports, instead, of using private cars and motorbikes. New vehicle law is also implemented, which has brought a positive change in improving the air quality index.",
        "In conclusion, environmental issues such as deforestation and vehicle pollution must be countered with effective and collaborative efforts. Tree plantation at the global level will eventually help and protect the current and coming generations from unprecedented dangers. Correspondingly, vehicle pollution can be controlled if people as whole understand its negative outcomes and adopt other alternative ways to control it."
