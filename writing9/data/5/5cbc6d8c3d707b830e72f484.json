It is a huamn tendacy that work-holic person can not spare his time for new subject. Instead of this, he can adjust his time if there is an appointment with his mentor. For example, owner of the company is the busiest person in the company and to learn new thing such as swimming, he can only allocate his time if his appintment is alreay fixed with the swimming teacher.",
        "Another reason is evaluation of learning outcome. Although answers and samples of learning output are available in the market, it is still hard for one to get step by step understanding of result which is only possible with the person who is master in the particular subject. For instance, while learning and practicing of writing test for IELTS, it requires a professional person who can evaluate essay correctly which is not possible with the online available correction tools.",
