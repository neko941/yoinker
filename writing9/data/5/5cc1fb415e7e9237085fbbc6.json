        "For the sustainable and speedy economic growth of any country, well developed transportation system plays a key role. There are some who believe, the government should focus more on expnading the railroads, while other opine that all the components of transportation should be improved. In my opinion, railway is worth spending because it is more safe, economical and fast, these advantages outrace all other transport means.",
        "To begin with, it is an undeniable fact that railway offers safe and comfortable commute for people and the businesses. the number of traffic accidents and highway casualties due to roads transport are much higher than the casualties by train.If the cities are well connected with fast train tracks, it will not only save a great deal of teh precious time of the commuter on the daily bases, but will also reduce environmental pollution. For example, Shanghai has highly organized and advance network of city railway which has reduced the traffic congestion on the roads and also provides economical tour.",
        "Secondly, if all the transport mechanisms, roads, air and other public transport are modernized, it will enable us to have variety of options to chose from depending on the affordability and personal choice. For instance, during the Chinese new year, its hard to get train ticket, so people choose air and bus services to return to their homes.",
        "In my opinion, although a country should have a modern infrastrucure if it needs t progress in true sense, but fast railways is the need of the time due to its environmet friendly.",
        "In conclusion, after careful considering the aforementioned advantages of railroad system, it is obvious that the government should opt this mean of transport for real growth."
