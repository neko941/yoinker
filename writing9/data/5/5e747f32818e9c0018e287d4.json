        "This essay will examine the main causes for unhealthy life style and some possible solution to this problem.",
        "There are two main causes of people become overweight and their poorly life style.",
        "Firstly, nowadays machinery plays main role in people life. Addicting to the technology that make people  obese. That it means, using automation to make life more easily. Most people using technology for their day to day work, such as chatting with friends, get to knowledge about foods. For instance, most children like to play video games at home also watching Tv. Children usually watching Tv more than 6 hours per day, while they are watching tv such a long time, their missed chance to play outdoor games as well as  losing the chance to communicate with those, that make children lazy in their day to day life even though they become fatty.",
        "It's clearly seem that using more technology do harmful things to people.",
        "Secondly, one of the most popular fact in society is fast food. Eating more fast food people get sick within time. Although people can't get enough vitamins, proteins from eating those kind of food. Not getting enough vitamins and proteins is the one reason for health issues such as, skin problems, bone problems.",
        "For  example, nowadays teenagers favourite kind of fast food places is Mcdonals, Buger King. Having more burgers even though kind of incidents which use for make burgers are harmful to the human body, those ingredients might be reasons for cancer also so many sicknesses.",
        "For this issue, there is some solution people can follow.",
        "First thing is government should increase the price of fast snack even though should decrease the value of organic foodstuff, because of ordinary  people are more addicted to fast food because, quick meal is in lower price also easily getting also easily get it from anywhere. Organic meal, which are very healthy also can get more vitamins. Those natural cuisine are sold at higher price in the market, that the reason to buy those kind of foods. It's clearly seen that decreasing the value of natural cuisine people can be a void in fast meals. Moreover everyone should start eating environmentally friendly products.",
        "The other solution for an unhealthy lifestyle, in particular country  government should recommend a healthy diet plan for people, even children also recommend some outdoor games that help to stay fit. In the diet plan there some important fact should be included, such as vitamin C,  greens, drinking more water, 30 minute workout per day. Following those steps people can keep fit.",
        "In conclusion, unhealthy activity  is the main  trouble in society. For this       question                  there are the main two reasons  such as addicted to the automation and fast food.  To get ride of those kind of problems people can kick off habit to follow diet plan also the government should decrease the  value of organic cuisine. Following those suggested resolution people can take care of themselves."
