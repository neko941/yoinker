Whereas, child staying with grandparents their bond will increase and also grandparents know how to take care of a child as they are experienced ones. Children will get to know about old stories, games. Children will learn other qualities from grandparents such as respecting elders, helping them.",

However, in infant ,care there are several other children of different caste, religion and language. Moreover  will  tolearn make a bond and mingle with other children not only that but also children will adapt to this environment at an initial age.",
