        "It is true that many species of animals are in danger of extinction because of the loss of natural habitats which is caused by deforestation, illegal hunting and an increase in word population. I would argue that protecting animals are very necessary and there are several that could be taken to resolve the issue.",
        "There main reasons behind conserving species of animals from illegal hunting and to deter detrioration wildlife habitats is to balance the earth's ecosystem.In other words, if the species extinction trend continous for a long period of time, then it will affect the environmental food chain system . Ultimately, it will become impossible  to maintain the biodiversity of the planet where people are living. For example, if people continue to destroy forests and hunting illegally some precious kinds of birds, there would be a loss of these types of birds lead to the extinction of other species, since these birds are food sources.",
        "The best solution to takle with this problem is that, the governments should penalise and implementing some laws to ban illegal hunting of animals and to prevent deforstation. Beside this, natural areas and wild animals especially endangered one should be conserved by investing money from governments and businesses. Another solution that could solve the problems effectively is that educating people about the importance of conserving animal species.",
        "In conclusion, due to deforestation , urbanization and illegal animal hunting many species are at the verge of extinction. These species have a great role in balancing our ecological environment and possible solution for preventing this trend is to impose some strict laws, severe punishments and create awareness of among people regarding importance of animal conservation."
