        "On the other hand, there are some drawbacks associated with online learning. This includes the limitation to the type of courses that can be taken . For instance, practical related courses such as chemistry cannot be taken on the web. In addition to this, a student that studies on the internet cannot interact or brainstorm with other colleagues which make learning less interesting.",
