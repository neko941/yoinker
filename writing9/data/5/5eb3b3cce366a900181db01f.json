        "Economic power is indeed considered the most important indicator of a nation\u2019s success. I believe that some other factors are just as important as an economic power. And without these factors, a country cannot exist, as well as without resources and a strong economy.",
        "Firstly I know, that poor countries, where there are a lot of resources and the economy of this country quite well, just can't give its citizens normal benefits of living, like a good salary or products. And in this particular situation, resources for a country mean practically nothing, because its citizens simply survive and make ends meet. A state that has natural resources must properly dispose of them.",
        "For example, such a strong and economically large provincial like India simply cannot date, its citizens enough goods for a comfortable stay inside it. High technology and overpopulation simply cannot get along in one country and therefore not everyone in India lives at the level of such economic development. People receive smaller salaries and are unable to pay for living, and sometimes food. India is an example where an economically strong country cannot provide the benefits of living.",
        "In conclusion, I want to say that all the factors of a successful country are very important and if even one is missing this country can hardly be called successful."
