        "Success is made up of a number of contributory factors, one of which is perseverance. Facing a difficulty, many tend to tackle in a lot of ways: some quit, but others stand up to their objectives till the last minute. In my opinion, I highly approve of the latter solution which require you to try harder.",
        "To begin with, those who consent with bad situations, the first thing that springs to their minds is to turn a blind eye and quit trying. Firstly, they find it hard to accommodate themselves to the reality keep getting frustrated in thinking of solutions.  Moreover, they think that it is safer to keep the matter balance rather than causing side effects. One clear example is gambling or lottery in search of instant money can put humans at serious risks.",

        "However, strong-willed people learn to enjoy challenges and give the problem a better try. They tend to think outside the box and renovate their method of doing the tasks. By doing this, challenge-takers can overcome all trouble and climb to a higher level in life.",
        "Personally speaking, a lot of effort must be made if one wants to achieve his goal, apparently. Despite a great deal of hurdles along the way, keeping to targets is of prime importance . Having said that, we should also draw experiences from failure in order to get a better view of the whole situation and may, hopefully, come up with a wiser solution.",
        "In conclusion, everybody is certain to cope with a lot of obstacles  on the way to fulfill dreams. As far as I am concerned, before truly making decisions on how to handle the problem, people should consider possible methods and keep constantly making efforts.",
