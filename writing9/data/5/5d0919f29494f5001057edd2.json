        "It is observed that residents in metropolis encounter challenges in their day to day living. This essay will discuss the problems associated with residing in the cities, and I think the authority ought to encourage the citizens to relocate to the country side so as to decongest the overpopulated urban areas.",
        "To begin with, one of the most significant problem faced by urban dwellers is the amount of time spent in traffic. This is because people living in the suburbs and the cities have their place work mostly in the metropolitan areas, as commuters move at the same time to resume duty. To illustrate, it was published recently by the New York times that 80% of workers get late to work due to traffic congestion on the roads. In consequence, individuals who are resident in cities find it difficult to meet up with appointment due to problematic traffic system.",
        "Furthermore, it is advisable that the government should persuade the people to move to the regional towns, because this will reduce the population in the cities. This means that the authority will make provision for job opportunities and improve the standard of living in the remote areas, which include: good electricity, portable water, conducive housing and abundance of food supply. For example, the United Kingdom government was able to reduce the population in London by 5% as at year 2000 through the availability of jobs in the suburbs. Thus, encouraging more people to migrate to the regional settlement will cause the number of people in the cities to decrease.",
        "In conclusion, the major hurdle confronted by the people living in large cities everyday is traffic hold up which results into delay, and I suggest that the government should encourage people to relocate to the regional towns so that there will be reduction in population strength."
