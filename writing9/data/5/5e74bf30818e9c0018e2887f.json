        "It is generally claimed that railways, which is  one of the most used mode of transpotation ,  should be aided by the government in higher amount  than that of roads.In  my opinion, while l agree  that their are significant reasons, which conform the importance  of trains in travelling,  I belive in moving  with automobiles also crutial for  our  conveniance.",
        "Undoubtedly, conveying goods and moving from one place to another can be done  in vast scale  by trains. This means that  with large number of vagens   and travelling boxes in trains ,  many passengers can travel as well as  transfer their  materials,  which are in large portion,  conveniantly. For instance, in Sri Lanka, fuel transpotation  is mainly done by rails in large  scale throughout the country. Furthemore, most of the  emplyees use trains as their mode of transpotation not only for their comfot but also  cheapness of the fee compared to",
        "other modes",
        "On the otherhand, travelling in roads also significant in day to day life because it is very common  among the  people ,who are frequanetly move  on,  in their work. For instance, school children mainly use buses and vans to reach schools and come back home. Furthermore , not like trains ,which work according to a sheduled time frame,  private vehicles can run according to the need of an individual any time as they wish.",
        "",
        "In conclusion, funding to develop  both railways  as well as roads  by the government  is equally essential, as both modes are notably important in transpotation."
