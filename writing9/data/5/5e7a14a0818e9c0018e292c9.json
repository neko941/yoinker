Because if you are afraid to be the heart of the center, even a behalf of your belief, the listeners will have no leg to stand on yours and change their minds.",
        "The second highest that was suggested is adaption which plays a vital role in helpful abilities. It was supposed that the public speakers need to be familiar with all the different changeable situations which could be the contrast between their new audiences every night and your viewpoint or the unexpected problems. Moreover, flexible thinkings such as different ways to observe all aspects of the problem in your speech were belongings to adaptive ability.

Not every audience is going to love you or agreeing with you at first, the ability to stick to it without giving up \u2013 hang in there \u2013 is one of the emotional success factors. In term of the struggle to be the president, when the candidate persuade the citizens that they would be the most suitable for that position, the determination plays a role to express their characters even though apart of those have objected to.",
        "In summary, the career of a public speaker is a difficult one \u2013 not as difficult as coal mining, perhaps, but difficult nonetheless in its way so certain characteristics are important. There is the consistency of confidence, adaptation and determination are such a good way as to experts in this field. Indeed, the public speakers have not only inspired the value message, shapen for the wrong thinking but also help humans think outside the box so that the interesting world will be created."
