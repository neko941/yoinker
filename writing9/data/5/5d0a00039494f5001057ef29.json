        "Visiting tourist  sites located in other countries is becoming increasingly popular unlike in the past.  While certain individuals believe this is a welcoming trend, others do not. In my opinion, I  agree  that  it is an important development as it would lead to the development of the tourist home country.",
        "",
        "On the one hand, It is often believed by some people that traveling  to other countries for sight seeing is an acceptable   phenomenon and i agree,    because   the development of the host country of the  visitor  would be actualised .  To further explain, visiting   recreational  parks  outside the shores  of an individual's country  would expose him or her to other valuable tools  used in a nation's development. As a result, they  learn about it and come back and practice what they learnt. For example, the Kenyan president,  Keys Agre, stated in an interview that the establishment of the  wild life parks and reserve,  kenya, was possible because  he travelled to London  for relaxation, and  learnt how to develop a  wild life park, after which he brought  some of the animals  sold at   Wild game reserve  home . People pay money to see these creatures, and consequently , the revenue  realised  is used to build   durable roads.",
        "On the other hand,  there are few  persons  who opine that it is an unacceptable norm as it inculcates bad habit to the youngsters. By this I mean, different forms of  social  vices would be learnt by these young ones who leave for other regions of world for recreational purposes . To illustrate, the daughter of the Russian president, Kim kamaar ,stated in an interview that she was negatively influenced on one of her vacations to   kiman  Tourist Centre, Paris where she learnt how to club and engage in excessive alcoholic drinking.",
        "To conclude, while opinions may vary ,I believe that travelling to  different  continents for the purpose of sight viewing is a gratifying occasion as the  visitor finds out various ways to grow his or her nation."
