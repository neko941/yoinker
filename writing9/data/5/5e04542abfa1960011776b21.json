        "It is a matter of debate how the environment can be saved from the adverse impact stemming from the use of latest technologies. On one hand, many critics believe leading an ordinary life is the solution; on the other hand, some states that the innovation itself should take care of the environment. Both of these perspectives are elaborated on below along with my own viewpoint.",
        "First, by making our daily life simpler is one way to reverse the impact of advanced technological innovation. In order to achieve that people can focus on being \u201ccarbon neutral\u201d while using the modern toolkits. For example, using as less fossil fuel as possible, via choosing energy efficient options for cars and home appliances would help.",
        "Second, we should ponder on saving energy. This is much easier, since we subconsciously waste gas, fuel, water, paper so on and so forth. Therefore, being careful about our usage of gas stoves, electric tools and water taps at home we can conserve the environment.",
        "Third, through technological advancements this critical issue can also be dealt with. Giant companies such as Tesla, SolarCity etc. needs to step ahead and make a change in their business model by shifting production and turning factories into green. For example, Tesla the electric car manufacturer has shown that with cutting edge technology people can still ride cars and not harm the mother earth by emmeting harmful substances into the air.",
        "Forth, the government needs to play a crucial role by promoting more plausible green alternatives. For instance, Germany already started promoting windmill and solar energy based factories and offices. These efforts from the authority will exert into good results.",
        "Hence, I believe that the government should come up with schemes toward adopting green and clean energy; further, we as responsible citizens should be committed to increase the awareness not to waste the energy while using the modern technological instruments."
