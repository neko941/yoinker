        "A decade ago, people tend to choose teaching as an occupation, however now this trend is dramatically decreasing in many countries.In this paragraph, we will discuss both the drawbacks and their respective solution.",
        "First of all, The wages of a teacher are far less than expected,for instance,a lawyer in the UK earns 5 times more than the salary of the teacher having the same experience. In order to cope with this problem. The government should increase the salary of the instructor significantly.So the teacher can earn their well-being.",
        "Moving on, The next critical obstacle is that the workinghours for the school teacher are pretty high. More-ever the teacher has to check papers and assignments.On the flip side, they are not able to spend their quality time with their family .So to address this problem, the Government must hire more staff in secondary school so the workload is distributed among the staff.",
        "Finally, the last issue is the behaviour of the students towards the teacher, Some of the pupils did not behave well in class which frustrate the teachers of a highschool, As a result, they decided to quit their jobs. The solution of this obstacle is that the parent should teach their kids how to respect their instructors as well as teach manner because the teacher is a key to the development of a society.",
        "In a conclusion ,There and many critical issues such as salary,working-hours and kids behaviour. The possible solutions to these problems are to increase the salary, Limit the work-hours and change in the attitudes of kids. The governments and parents are responsible to cope out from these issues."
