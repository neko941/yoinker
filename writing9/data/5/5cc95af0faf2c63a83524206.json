        "In modern life, many people believe that over choice is becoming a phenomenon. I totally agree with this opinion, and this essay will attempt to find the reason for this.",
        "Many people blame the increase of options to select on our modern life and modern technology that we use to find our options for each decision we make. Examples of having too many choices include university options or travel options if ones use search engines as advisors to find the best decision. Then, they have to make selection for one option from thousands of equivalent availabilities of choices. Not only that, the decision-making process tend to be overwhelming with the overloaded information about the outcomes and the risks of our selection.",
        "On the other hand, many people would suggest many cases in which we do not have that much options. For example, if students are given an opportunity of lifetime to study at their desired university, they would not have a second thought to pick up this choice. However, I think that they are misjudged as there will always be possibilities that things could be done. Of course, some might have arrived at that decision immediately, but I think they had carefully consider the suggestions and advice on possible outcomes from other people like family. Alternatively, some students might select or at least consider other better options if they are offered full grant from other universities, for instance.",
        "In conclusion, I agree with the idea that we have too many choices. While many people find modern life as the main cause, I think that the decision making is complicated itself and choice overload is natural."
