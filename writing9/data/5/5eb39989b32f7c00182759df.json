        "People have always debated whether film is essential part of art as we are an able to witness a number of fans of this. Hence some people come up with the idea that, there are others modes of art like literature and painting which is considered as an important one. I do believe that, although we are highly likely to witness several types of arts in our modern society, that does not mean film is not as important as others.",
        "From the one angle, there are those who believe literature and painting is considered as an important than film due to some reasons. First and foremost, both type of art literature and painting have a longer history compared movies which has began showing in the nineteenth century namely people have adopted to do painting and literature since ancient times that shows they were highly valued. Moreover, in most parts of the world you are likely to witness sculptures which is considered as a symbol of certain countries that refers to film is not as  popular as other types of art.",
        "From the another angle, film and movie are believed to be crucial in terms of some aspects. Firstly, film is a thing  includes people that are deal with art namely actors actresses, musicians and others and many people find their way and money by this, this also shows it\u2019s importance. In addition to this film industry have helped to certain countries throughout the world as an example Hollywood and Bollywood which helps to fulfill one country\u2019s economy. Film also considered one of entertainment type of art.",
        "To sum up, having evaluated of both aspects, although some people regard other types of art more important than others, I am of the opinion that they are all equally valued due to above mentioned reasons."
