        "Whether or not tourist destinations benefit from international tourism is a debatable issue. To some governments, the local economic benefits are worth the overcrowding and hiked prices of the tourist season. However, there are environmental and social costs and other risks of relying on tounsm as a major source of annual income.",
        "Sleepy coastal communities can be changed beyond recognition by mass-market tourism. Package holiday companies operate huge numbers of low-cost flights to high-rise hotels in developing countries every summer.",
        "This means, of course, that easy money can be had servicing this seasonal influx and the government sees increased tax revenue and local employment. However, when the tourist season comes to an end. employment ceases and the area becomes a ghost town. The social cohesion of a small community can also be blighted by the seasonal migration of people to the cities to look for work out of season, leaving only the elderly behind. This is perhaps made worse by second home owners, who drive up house prices beyond the means of local inhabitants.",
        "On the other hand, the local community do gain language skills and other fringe benefits of cultural exchange. Such a large volume of travellers every year can cause environmental problems to fragile habitats and historical sites. Age-old stone remains can be worn away and traditional buildings demolished in favour of bland international hotels. Local infrastructure can also fail to cope with large numbers of visitors, leading to pollution and litter. However, over time this can change as the economy improves and tourism becomes more of an established industry. Local government investment in infrastructure should ensure repeat trade and further benefits for the economy.",
        "Overall, tourism can be a good source of income for countries blessed with natural beauty or sites of historical interest. However, governments must ensure that the wishes of local businesses are not put before the needs of the local community and that any revenue generated by tourism is reinvested in the area to protect the local environment."

Prolged life is,  the e hand, a welcome change for many individuals, yet I believe this is completely not a good idea for old people to ctinue to work due to several reass related to their deteriorated work performance and capability to adapt to new technologies. Breakthroughs in medicine and heightened awareness of nutriti are the two key factors leading to lgevity. For example, nanotechnology, with tiny robots being injected into patients\u2019 body and mending all their damaged organs, are believed to the e of the secrets to obliterate any currently incurable diseases such as cancer. Additially, people nowadays are better aware of the importance of a good diet, and such wise csumpti can ensure good health and csequently extended age. However, extending people\u2019s working age can be a catastrophe to both senior citizens and companies. The majority of people at the age of 65 or over, especially in developing countries, are unable to maintain the same degree of performance as their younger counterparts. This would eventually give rise to many unwanted repercussis that affect the company\u2019s overall profits and the persal life of the aged workers as well. Also, the fast-paced life requires quick adapti and adjustments to new technology, and this is something that the elderly may never be  par with the younger es. It is not an overstatement to say that it is a torture to work in a place where you are both physically and technologically inferior to your younger co-workers. In cclusi, my firm cvicti is that old people should not be involved in work any lger than their designated retirement age now. If the need for workforce is urgent, old people can, to a certain extent, work as csultants or mentors rather than the main labor force. 30 minutes \u2013 323 words \u2013 computer-delivered",
