        "What type of employee deserve promotions in the workplace has become a hot topic of discussion these days. Some people perceive that we can only promote stuff with more seniority to the managerial positions. This essay will discuss the reason why I believe we need to give priority to the employee who can better fulfill the requirement of those positions.",
        "There are various compelling reasons to explain why it is believed by someone that the length of work time is essential when it comes to promotion and the prominent one is because the expertise and experience of work they have accumulated over the years which is beneficial to the company. To illustrate, a recent research conducted in Japan has revealed that nearly 80% of enterprises in the country tend to do internal recruitment for the higher positions due to their work knowledge and skills. In addition, their stability and consistency in the career is also significant to the business.",
        "However, people need to realize that the seniority is not the only factor we need to consider as there are other equally important factors including age and creativity. Many people are skeptical to the young generation due to lack of experience but a young management team can represent innovation and creativity and also have more courage to cope with potential future risks. Let\u2019s take Huawei as an example, one of the fast growing technological company globally and the average age of their employee is around 35. As can be seen, employee with required skills can generate positive impacts to the business.",
        "To sum up, it is argued by someone that higher positions can only be provide to those who has a long history in the organization. Taking everything into consideration, I\u2019m inclined to say that we can help businesses flourish by examining employee\u2019s comprehensive abilities then provide them the right position."
