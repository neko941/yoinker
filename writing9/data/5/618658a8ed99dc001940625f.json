        "In the old days, people tended to keep everything written down on a sheet of paper in order not to forget. However, the advent of the internet makes uploading information online seem more appealing. In spite of its undeniable utilities, keeping knowledge online has several drawbacks and whether the advantages outweigh the disadvantages will be discussed in this essay.",
        "On the one hand, the internet is a great application to preserve and pass on knowledge. This is owing to the fact that the uploading information is digitalised and stored as a form of binary, unlike traditional books which can be worn out by external conditions. In addition, since new knowledge is uploaded online, everyone can have free access to the information and it can be so pervasive that it spreads around the world. For example, Wikipedia is one of the largest knowledge- sharing site on the internet. Everyone can easily access or contribute their understanding in enriching the data and this reservoir of knowledge is kept on expanding without any loss or deduction.",
        "On the other hand,the internet flexibility provokes uncertainty among users about the information reliability. Since all walks of life can participate and update new knowledge, there will be faulty information which is uploaded intentionally or unintentionally. For example, some criminals post unjust information to traumatise the nation affairs and create a wrong belief that the government is suppressing the people. As a result, this unjustified source of information can lead to great consequences ranging from health problems to political rebellions.",
        "In all, I think the benefit of the internet in the field of storing information outweighs its drawbacks because the expansion of knowledge necessitates people to find such effective method of preserving data. However, we can still minimise the impact of fault data by collectively choosing the reliable source of information."
