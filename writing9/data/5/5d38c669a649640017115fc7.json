        "Nowadays, many people wants to visit for a brief period of time to the other part of the world to work or to study, There are ennumber of benefits to it, at the same time there are some draw backs to it. It is a big learning experience for an individuals because, leading a life in abroad give an opportunities to exploring other culture, meeting new people and most importantly being independant. At the same time, cooking food and taking care of bills,",
        "To embark upon, Life is all about exploring and embarcing new things, as life is all about knowing and learning something from people. There are different cultures and traditions in this world, at the same time there is a strong belief system for following or embarce this tradition. For example, In India there is a tradition to have bath in Ganga river after every alternate 12 years tp purify an individual soul, which is famously calledas \"Khumb mela\". In ancient books knows as \"puranas\" says Lord Shiv used to visit this river after every alternate 12 years to purify himself.",
        "In contrast, living far away from family is hard to prepare tasty food for oneself and looing after all finance related work. Living abroad far away from famiy it is very tought because since childhood preparing food taken care by mother and father takes care of financial work. So, when suddenly one has to deal with is quite difficult some. For example, preparing food in abroad and studying or working at the same time required lots of hardwork not everyone are capable to handle both easily.",
        "To conclude, Though there are flaws in staying abroad but benefits are immense to exploring world and knowing some fasicinating facts of other traditions outweigh all other small things."
