        "Three ways of funding superior education undoubtedly possess tangible benefits to both individuals and authorities to have to derive income. Either these necessary funds are merely offered by the government and students or through low-interest rates by the national banks. The key advantages of these possible ways need to be discussed in the upcoming paragraphs.",
        "Who could consider the government should pay all cost for tertiary level education offers benefits to students. Initially, these funds support many intelligent students whose parents are financially unfit to manage their studies. It describes that scholarships provided by authorities encourage many parents to have a dream to foster their child for graduation level; therefore, they can fetch good jobs and earn handsome money. A Punjab government; for example, contribute significantly to educate many students of Punjab state at a higher level because they are providing scholarships to below poverty line people; quality of life and literacy rate will increase exponentially.",
        "On the other side, students could pay all the fees for their higher education. To start with, it offers advantages not only to undergraduates but to the government, also. what it indicates cost paid by students allows them to concentrate on studies and get benefits of it significantly because they would comprehend the value of that money. Consequently, it supports to extraordinary results in studies. On top of that, it equally benefits the government in the sense to allocate that funds in other areas like road development and industries to create more employment opportunities.",
        "last not least, students would pay maximum fees for education through loan programmes; it offers benefits to both the government and a student. Loans at low-interest rates encourage any student to achieve an exponential education without any hurdle in life. This happens when students can return money in installments to national banks which may not cause any pressure on parents or pupils. Ergo, students also appreciate the value of money and produce good results in examinations. However, the government equally possess benefits from this process; they will earn money from the public in the form of interest rates which would be allocated to many sources of education.",
        "In conclusion, ways of funding higher education offer consistent benefits to students and the government; to increase the quality of life of people, to generate revenue, and to encourage pupils to get well-versed education without any problem."
