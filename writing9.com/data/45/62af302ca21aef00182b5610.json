        "Thanks to the great invention of the internet and increased use of social platforms nowadays, most of the people from the working class made the choice of working from home. This may cause the problem of feeling lonely and lack of communication. However, we can not deny the fact it benefits most of the employees out there working from home in every possible way.",
        "Firstly, workers benefit from the flexibility of time. It shows how they can manage the time of working hours beforehand. Furthermore, they can also ignore corny nine to five working hours. Which makes it easier for them to make the time for their family and friends. Such as normal workers might not be able to spend time in the morning with their kids and watching their kids go to school. That alone obviously  shows they can balance the life between their job and their family.",
        "Not only that but also they can cut all the unnecessary expenses. Since they have been working from home, all the unnecessary expenses such as commuting fees are all cut as well as the time they have used to travel from their home to their workplace. Which results in workers having more hours to complete their work without needing to sacrifice the time for their family. Which can also mean productivity for their job is increased.",
        "With all that being said it is true that some people might have been suffering from feeling lonely and stressed because of lacking communication and overworking. However, flexibility of time and minimizing expenses are far greater. It may be the case why so many people make the decision to work from home."
