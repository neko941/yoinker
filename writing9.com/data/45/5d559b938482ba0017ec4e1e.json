        "Researches and development have greatly improved on new technologies and changes the ways teenagers spend their free time, however there are many advantages and disadvantages as a result of the new and emerging technologies. These advantages have an up hand as against the disadvantages. This essay will show the superiority of the advantages against the disadvantages of new technologies on the way and manners youth spend their free time.",
        "Information is very important and more importantly is the free or easy access to information. Without the right information youth would hardly make any headway in learning new skills and new technologies. Before the advent of new technologies youths especially student find it difficult to get access to materials for their studies and project work, they will only really depend on the limited and outdated books in the library, but with the advent of the technology called Internet; getting the right information is just by the click of the button, fast reliable and affordable. Youths are more creative and could be self-taught as they can easily learn new skills ranging from photography, photo editing, music production, programming etc. to mention but a few. These have helped to put kids away from violence, drugs and troubles.",
        "However, there could be some disadvantages arising from the inappropriate use of the new technologies, as the increase of social media have made many youths to be lazy, as they spent more of their time chatting away with friends on things that are irrelevant and do them little or no good, some have even taken to crime and fraud all because of the wrong exposure they get from the use of advance technologies.",
        "Despite the downside, the disadvantages cannot be compared with the advantages derived from the used of new technology, as it has empowered many more youth, as so many are now enteprenun as they have learnt some valuable skills using technology and have been able to create a brand and do profitable businesses.",
        "In conclusion, the advent of new technologies have done more good than arms, if the right polies and controls are put in place to control the uses of these technologies in no distance time the negative effect  on youth from the use of new technology will be a forgotten issue."
