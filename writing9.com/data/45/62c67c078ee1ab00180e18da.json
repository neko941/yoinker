        "It is said that one of the strongest forces that can gather people from various cultural background and ages is music. I agree with this argument that music is a universal language that is understandable to all.",
        "Firstly, musicals are understandable to almost everyone in the world. Whenever we hear of any songs no matter what language it is sung, people immediately perceive that it is a work of art and think it is worth listening. Musical is like a fluid that can flow into the hearts of people without having a special permission. Having conquered the hearts, songs bring people together in concert halls or other places to have themselves listened again. People usually go to concerts to listen to music. If music were not played in concerts it would be hard to collect them into one place.",
        "Secondly, debates and disputes usually separate people from one another, while musicals help them come together. Since music has no polarizing aspect, people listen to it without having any superior attitude to anyone, as a result, under the effect of songs people can easily be gathered. For example,  in several eastern countries people collectively come together to wedding parties where songs are usually sung.",
        "In conclusion, some say one of the most effective ways to collect people is music. I also believe that it is like a universal language which can easily collect people."
