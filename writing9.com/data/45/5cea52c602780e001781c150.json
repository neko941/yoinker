        "Globalization, industrialization and evolution in technology has led to exponential increase in competition between individuals, corporations and countries. Each country aims to be the best in varied areas like economic development, trade, bilateral relations and so on. International sporting events provide countries a unique platform to display their supremacy in various indoor and outdoor games. A school of thought believes that spending taxpayer\u2019s money in training sportspersons to win medals in competitions, should instead be diverted to improvement in infrastructure and public welfare schemes. I do not agree with this opinion.",
        "It is extremely difficult to be the best in areas like economic development, trade, etc. This is because countries are connected to each other closely as a result of globalization. Any negative event in one part of the world has an immediate cascading effect in another country. In times of recession, this becomes worse. Take the example of the global recession of 2008. United States including countries across the world, whether it was Singapore (i.e. dramatic decrease in exports) or Asian countries like India, Vietnam (i.e. fall in software exports), etc. faced the brunt of this event. Let\u2019s look at the recent example of a major fire breakout in China\u2019s major shipping port. This destroyed several corporations\u2019 goods, including those belonging to Jaguar Land Rover. Since, it is headquartered in the UK; the impact of the catastrophe was felt there in a big way.",
        "As stated earlier, international sports competition like the Olympics, Commonwealth Games, etc. provide an arena where countries can display their might in physical fitness, agility. These events act like a glue; they bring all citizens of a country together in terms of patriotism. When sportspersons win, they bring fame to both themselves and to their respective countries. The recent example of the Cricket World Cup in 2011 was won by the Indian cricket team and led by Mahendra Singh Dhoni stupendously. Not only he, but also the entire team including its support staff and India received tremendous name and fame.",
        "Based on the above facts, I believe that a government spending public money in training sportspersons for international sporting competitions is the right step indeed."
