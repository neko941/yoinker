        "Some individuals believe that the adolescent life brings more enjoyment, while others think that adulhood is the happiest time. Although adult life can give more financial freedom, I believe that teenage years are more happier beacuse of the less responsibilities.",
        "On the one hand, people think that adult life is filled with happiness because of their income, despite the greater responsibility. That is to say, they will be able to spend money on purchasing things and pleasure activities without depending on anybody else. For example, a recent government survey showed 60% of the working people are happy with thier lives because of the financial stability they have. However, I believe that the adults have more commitments which sometimes may cause stress and health problems.",
        "On the other hand, many say that teenage years brings more contentment because of the fewer responsibilities. In other words, young peole have more freedom and time to hangout with friends, watch movies and much more. Further, their daily expenses are taken care by their parents and are free from tension related to money. For instance, research conducted by the Times showed that 70% of people are are more joyful in their teenage days than they are now. I believe that this thought of school is apropriate beacuse teenagers have less burden.",
        "In conclusion, although adult years is free from money concerns, the joy and",
        "happiness is more in teenage life due to fewer responsibilities. It is pridicted that by 2025, 20% more adult persons will suffer from anxiety due to their family burden"
