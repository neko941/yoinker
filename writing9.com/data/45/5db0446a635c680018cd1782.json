        "Perhaps the major reason we need to deal with is rising of fast paced lifestyle. Owing to hectic schedule, people could find barely spare time these days. That is why, they can not be interested in the hobbies. A second issue, presumably, is the competitions related to professional sports and music which require sophisticated ability and effort. As it is known, today approximately all contests are bound to money- business. This is inevitably leads people to change their minds about hobbies. The third place, belief and traditional rules, responsibilities would play another significant role in falling down of propensity for hobbies. Notwithstanding world is quickly,  there are still some countries governed with religious laws, such as Iran Islam Rebuplic. In these countries, inhabitants are forbidden to do several activities they want. Last of all, human being by their vary nature are inclined to compete with others and defeat to show their power. As a result, some of them who intended only to participate to recreation force to give up.",
        "The effects of this have been and will continue to be serious. First of all, since people have no interest in the hobbies, they are unable to go up their motivation. According to recent research, leisure activities have a substantial positive impact on people's life and character. In addition, not having hobbies would bring about both mental and physical health issues. To cope with these problems, such as stress, obesity, people must have a spare time and join clubs.",
        "In sum up, it is evident that there are a few causes of reluctant to hobbies, and also a variety of effects of this. Unless proper attention is paid to hobbies, these problems will remain unresolved."
