        "It is sometime argued that the salary plays the most important role in view of job seekers. While I accept that this may suit many people, I believe that others would consider different  elements as the key reasons for pursuiting their jobs.",
        "On the other hand, there are many reasons why the high salaries are the ideal condition for job\u2019s seekers. Firstly, they can provide upper, high life conditions as their desire. Because  a good salary is not only support them to meet our basic needs but also give them an opportunity to afford luxury holidays, buy modern applications , therefore they can enhance the quantity of life. Secondly, jobs with appealing salaries are always associated with attractive awarding perk.  This perk will help them raise their motivation for work and gain more profit.",
        "On the other hand, there are people who make their career decision based on other conditions. Such as whether it is suitable between the work and their individual human being  including their characters, lifestyles or their expectation for work.  Futhermore, the contribution of this career for the society is also an important elements for them to take into account. If the jobs break the law of the country and are considered harful for the civilized society, it is hardly acceptant for them to do these jobs. For instance,  selling heroines or human organs is illegal and just a little proportion  of people taking part in even thought it is among the jobs with highest salaries.",
        "It is true that some people decide their job depending on the salary  but  I also think that there are people who choose their job with others requirements apart from salary."
