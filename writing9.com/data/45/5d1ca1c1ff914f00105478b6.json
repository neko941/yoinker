        "In the salad days of millenium, reallocating to metropolitian cities has become an usual phenomenon; owing to this, population from rural area and small cities moving to metro cities are burgeoning exponentially in a search of employment and new avenues. This essay will explicate the various obstacles which major cities will have to face in future due to overpopulation and will suggest some ways forward.",
        "To commence with, overpopulation will leads to numerous devastating repercussions for enormous cities. Firstly, a significant hurdle will be of scarcity of resources. For instance, with blosomming of pupils, the scarce resources such as houses, water, and food, etc., will be inadequate to fulfill the basic necessities of migrating citizens. As a result, deforestation will increase in order to provide shelter and food to people. Secondly, overpopulation will leads to trafgic conjestion because with enlarging population vechicles for commuting them will also rise. As a consequence, it will deteriorate the environment by increasing the pollution which will also brings many respiratory diseases associated with them.",
        "Nevertheless, there are potential ways to alleviate its repercussions or atleast minimize its possible effects. One effective solution is to provide adequate facilities in rural areas for which people are migrating. For example, facilitating enough job opportunities, building quality infrastructure, adequate edducation and banking facilities because these are basically the fundamental reasons why people reallocate to metro cities. Consequently, people will find it convinient and will not leave their home town which will also save the cost of living in different areas. Another possible way to control this menance is by offering subsidies by government to business groups who set up their branch in backward areas. Eventually, it will attract many business organizations and also offer job opportunities to native people of that town.",
        "To recapitualize, I firmly believe that overpopulation can bring severe hurdles like deforestation, traffic conjestion and pollution which can only be curbed if rural areas are well developed by providing advanced facilities."
