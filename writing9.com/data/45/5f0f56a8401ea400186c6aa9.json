        "life of today is fast then fater, as we all are living metro lifes and at the same time everyone is addicted to technology. No doubt due to technology we are living comfortably in some aspects, but in this robotic world indivisuals are depending on the machinery therefore become lazy ,couch patatoes.although no one is giving enough time to do exercise and facing health issues. I am going tto discuss few causes and solution in subsequent paragraph.",
        "To begin with,humans are depending on machinery ,and in the race of earning money .Therfore, every individual is doing their jobs day and night and neglecting their health.employees start their work early in the morning and finish the shift late at night as they are tired and du to bound to the jobs they have to start their work early in the morning in next day also.because of  busy schedule no one has time to do exercise .Secondly, in  the rat race no one has time to eat healthy food .As there is a trend now to have lunch out by avoiding home cooked  food,reguler eating of junk causes obesiy and caught by cardiac diesease.",
        "furthermore,we can avoid harmful cardiac diseases and other health issues,by adapting healthy lifestyle. people should make a timetable in which they have atleast 10 minutes to exercise and also avoid eating junk from outdoor instead of this they can take their food along from home ,there are some healthy manners like use of stairs instead elevtor ,use of feets rather then vhicles for nearby places.",
        "in conclusion, exercise is a need of strong and  good physic we should do exercise in routine and adpt some healthy manners like balanced diet and avoiding fries."
