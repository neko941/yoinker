        "Many countries are putting limitations on the employment age. Hiring below 18 years is considered as illegal. I strongly agree with the statement.",
        "CHildren are becoming money-minded these days. they want to earn in phone number digits but they are unaware of the fact that doing a full-time job will only provide them short term benefits like buying an expensive car, clothing, shoes, and foreign trips. On the long term, they will only gain menial jobs with minimum education. Thus, proper education should be the primary focus at such a young age for a financially store future.",
        "Furthermore, permanent employment can lead to a social breakdown of the youngsters. For instance, if a 16-year-old opt for a job instead of school, then it often leads to isolation. At that age, we have lots of emotional, physical, and mental experiences with our friends, family, and teachers who make lifetime memories. Children abolished from these memories may face depression and can fall for drugs or alcohol.",
        "As far as the countries growth is concerned, it will suffer from a serious economic crisis. Children are the future of the nation. They are the upcoming doctors and engineers, and uneducated children can be a burden on the country.",
        "To conclude, i totally support the government's  decision of restricting the children to do full-time jobs for their brighter future. It will also help the country in building an economically and socially strong society."
