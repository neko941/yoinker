        "Despite the megacities that has hundrds of millions of people living in, such as Beijing and New York, urban cities as a whole has defects that are giving people a hard time to live in. Problems like traffic jam, or air pollutions are hard to ignore. On the other hard, government definetely should play a role on encouraging adjecent inhabiting life-styles.",
        "There are just too many car running on the road that slows down the traffics in the cities everyday. On average, American housholds occupy 2.5 cars, which explains why 9:00 every morning in New York city, there is always somewhere that\u2019s traffic jammed. More also, people often got late for work simply they were stuck on their roads to work.",
        "Another problem for people who lives in large cities is the air conditions. As we already knew, large infustructures are needed in order to supplement large cities, there will be energy power house, water processing factories, and waste elimination factories. Those factories will have to use certain machanical mechnisim that will eventally produce emissions that could be harmful to people, and for those who lives in the large city will get caught in their daily life.",
        "As the government, they should create incentive policies that makes living outside of urban city more appealling to citizens. For example, the government can offer benefical program that helps people who wants to buy houses in regional towns. Thus, people will find the new living life-style more appealling to them.",
        "In conclusion, those citizens who lives in large cites have problems with traffic jam and air pollution that trouble their daily life. However, governments should have well designed policies, or programs that helps people to make the decision of living in adjecent region more easy to choose."
