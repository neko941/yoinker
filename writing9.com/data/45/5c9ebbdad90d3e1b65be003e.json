        "It is clear that when you construct a new building which will be used by many people have some effects on your region., these impacts not only have positive sides but also have negative sides. In this essay, the advantages and disadvantages of having a university in a specific community will be examined.",
        "First of foremost, the most significant effect of establishing a university is developing the infrastructure in community. While you are building a university, you have to provide a public transportation to this area. Furthermore, the newcomers to the area like pupils, scholars or the staff of university will want to have accommodation which is close to university in order to not spend time while going to college. So, it will be beneficial for local people who have properties to rent out them to these people. Thus, constructing a university in a area have beneficial sides for people who live in that community.",
        "On the other hand, having such immense number of newcomers will affect the area in some bad ways. Take the example of the noise, which will be made by students. Young have more energy than adults, if the community is a peaceful area, also local people would like to live in traditional ways. Newcomers will spoil the peaceful of area. Moreover, the more demand to houses, the more increase in rent prices. Thus, many local people have to pay more than they did before because of  having new settlers in their area.",
        "As seen above, constructing a new university in a community can let people to have some beneficial, nevertheless it has disadvantages. In my view, a university will help community to make a substantial development. Because infrastructure is also related with the taxes which are paid by locals. If the population increase in a district, taxes also go up, and then this allows area to have more facilities."
