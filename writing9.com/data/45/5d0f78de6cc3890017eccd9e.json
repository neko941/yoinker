        "Imposing taxes is how goverments generate revenue they require to run the country. Although the common beleive is that high tax rates are crucial for betterment of public services, there are groups who would argue against this. This essay will demostrate why taxing at a higher rate is neccessary to ensure better public services for all, and to ensure proper wealth distribution in the society.",
        "The economic development of a country is dependant on the development of infrastructure such as roads, electrictiy, bridges etc. The government pays for these through the amount generated from taxes. By charging more taxes, authorities can ensure greater developments of public services. This is evident from the developed countries where they tax you more, but in return you get more in the forms of public services. While in developing countries, as you do not have to pay hefty taxes, you won\u2019t get to enjoy better public services. High tax rates thus serve to the overall development of the country.",
        "Taxes also play an important role in creating a balanced society through distribution of wealths. Taxes are usually not imposed on a flat rate rather on an increasing rate as opposed to your wealth. That means, the wealtheir people pay more tax than those of less fortunates. As tax is used for the betterment of all in the form of publi`c services, this creates a better distribution of wealth within the society.",
        "To conclude, higher tax rates are co-related with better public services. However, taxing at an abnormally high rate may reult in people losing interest in earning more, thus hurting the economy. In my opinion, government should find perfect tax rates that appreciates economy, and also generates enough revenue for the public services."
