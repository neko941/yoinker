        "Discovery of life on other planets is increasingly gaining the interest of the National Aeronautics and space Administration (NASA) these days. The government is spending a huge amount of money to uncover extra-terrestrial life. It is the belief of some people that, this is a waste of resources which supposed to be spent on addressing the difficulties facing the society. This essay will discuss why exploring the space is a waste of resources despite the quest for knowledge.",
        "To begin with, finding life on Earth's cosmic neighborhood is obviously essential in the quest for knowledge and extension of inter-planet relationship if possible, For instance, Astronomers have continually be in search for this purpose, but up till now, such has not been discovered. Although, it was reported by an Astronomer that the next generation of researchers might uncover it. The world wouldn't have been aware of the existence of other planets if not for such discoveries. Therefore, continuous funding of this sector by the government is absolutely crucial.",
        "However, the money spent on space exploration should be diverted to finding solutions to the difficulties in the public. Provision of basic needs and social amenities are extremely essential to the people, rather than finding what is happening outside the world they lived in. For example, it is unlikely that, people who were faced with security challenges or lack social amenities will appreciate such discoveries. For these reasons, government should spend more money on providing a good life for the people.",
        "On the whole, Although, a large amount of money was spent on finding life on other planets by the government, some people believed that it is a waste of money. In my personal opinion, these resources should be used to provide a quality life for the people."
