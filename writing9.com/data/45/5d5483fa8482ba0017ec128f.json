        "Whether or not environmental challenges should be resolved internationally or locally is becoming increasingly controversial. While some people believe that environmental problem should be solved world-wide, other people strongly maintain that it should be dealth with regionally. This essay will discuss both views and give an indepth reason why atmospheric issues should be given a worldwide solution.",
        "There are a growing number of people who stongly believe that the ever increasing international problems need an international intervention because to have a lasting solution, it has to be combated with sophisticated technology and well equipped manpower. For instance, air pollution which is caused by various gases and toxins released by industries and combustion of fossil fuels.If the under-developed or developing part of the world are left on their own to face this menace, many humans, plants and animals will be destroyed because of their porous technical know-how and expertise.",
        "On the other hand,other people think that to find a lasting solution to the environmental problem, local intervention has to be made as every nation knows and understands thier own atmospheric condition as the particular problem does not affect the whole nation at the same time. This will enable the nation affected to eliminate it with the available resources. For example, global warming is not a universal environmental problem as it does not affect globally. Therefore, it is expedient that the challenges hould be eradicated locally.",
        "Conclusively,should the daily environmental challenge be solved internationally or locally? While people have their different views about it, i opine that environmental problem should be combated globally as much result is acheived when team spirit is put in place."
