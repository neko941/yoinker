        "In recent years, university enrollment has become a topic of debate. Although a school of thoughts holds that only excellent students at young ages should be admitted to the university, others believe that going to university is opened opportunities for all students, even those with bad academic results. In this essay, I am going to look at both points of view, before drawing a reasoned conclusion.",
        "On the one hand, fervent advocates of the first view have at least two arguments for their belief. First, it is apparent that the capacity of each university, especially good ones, is limited, while the number of enrollments is huge. That's why universities must use a filter tool to select their students, which is usually the academic results of students in the past. As a result, the fact that the universities give their letters of offer to excellent students who have the best results is fair. For example, last year, the University of Ho Chi Minh city need to choose 5000 students among more than 85000 applicants. This university had no choice than selecting the ones who had the best marks. Secondly, people believe that students having good results in high school usually maintain their excellence in university. As a result, choosing the best students could help the university to maintain its teaching quality and assessment level.",
        "On the other hand, despite the aforementioned arguments, it is imprudent to discount latent discussion of those who believe that the university should open to all people. First, all students, of all ages, are equal. So, it is not fair to choose some and reject others, which could affect negatively to the career path of the the rejected ones."
