        "In recent times there has been much debate about the issue of aging population as the li-expectancy is rapidly increasing. Some reckon that elderly people might bring tension on the government in terms of paying pensions and providing health care treatment, while others state that this age group is of great importance for the country. It seems logical to agree as elderly people might contribute to the society by occupying special work positions and applying their life experience.",
        "There are strong reasons for believing that elderly people could affect the pension and health care system in the negative way as it has becoming more complicated for them to proceed working and  paying for the decent medical treatment. Therefore, the problem of taking care for elderly people might be a burden for government as in most countries they are obligatory to support them for their daily needs and health. This forces the state to spend a considerable part of budget on this age group instead of investing money to support the development of state.",
        "However, being fully involved in the social life aging groups could benefit to the society owing their experience and spare time. Being retired they can occupy such social positions as babysitting or teacher as their life experience and ability to grown up children might contribute to the society and help young families to raise children. Moreover, experienced elderly people might be more valued in such spheres, for example, as medicine or law, where it is essential to know how to solve complex problems and make significant decisions. For instance, last year the United Nations published the world health rating where the Spain took the first place. Notably that the average age of doctors there is approximately 55 years old. This case proves us the fact that aging population plays a vital role in the society.",
        "To recapitulate, taking all the aforementioned arguments into account, I have all grounds to believe that elder people is an essential part of society that not only might take social positions, but also prolong their proficiency. However, there is no denying that due to the age the government should support them by paying pensions and providing medical care, but this burden is funded with taxes that elderly people had paid before."
