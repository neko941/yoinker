        "Nowadays , technology is increasing day by day . That,s why most of the inviduals were opined that administration shound payout money for railways by prefering on roads .I will slightly agreed with this statement",
        "I slightly agreed with this statement because of three main key points . Firstly , when you use train as a public transport you got pollution free environment .Because, the road vechiele can produce more carbon di oxide in the atmosphere .For instance , some experts and scientists beleived that train pollute your environment on a very less ratio.The above explanation of preferance of railway on roads .Secondly, inflation are on a very peak position nowadays .So, trains are very suitable for every passengers in this condition .Thirdly , most important thing is that ration of an accident in a train are very low .You are very secure and safe by using train for your travelling .According to research in california 2014 only 2\u2105train fall by accident and about 400 peple injured in last five years .",
        "I slightly disagreed with this statement because of two key points .First of all, public transport and your own transport or vechiele are accessible to you everytime in every emergency .However, when you have an emergency in your  daily life you can,t wait for train because trains have a fixed shedule .Secondly , By using trains you cannot go to your destination because trains drop passengers only on stations . Trains are the only transport that can be used for intra city .so roads are accessible to you everywhere . For example , according to the survey in new york in 2018 people use trains only for go to other cities people not use this transport in inter city. Beacuse in cities trains have not their stations .",
        "At the end , both transport system have their need every time in every where.",
        "It can be concluded that trains are polluted free and fast but on the other hand roads are acessible every where and usage of roads are more than tracks ."
