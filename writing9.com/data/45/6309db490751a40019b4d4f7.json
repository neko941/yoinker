        "The given diagram indicates the process of how woollen goods are produced.",
        "Overall, it is made through seven or ten stages, which is beginning with sheep and finishing with recycling or hand-made products or machine-made goods.",
        "As the diagram presents, the whole process starts with sheep. In the first stage, the fur of sheep cleans after being cut by the shears, and then, it is dried before being spun. In the following stage, it becomes either string to recycle or wool.",
        "In the next step, the fur of sheep, which becomes wool, is gathered and wisted to be the tufts of wool. In the subsequent step, there are the stages that the tufts are stored and become balls of yarn, which are used for knitting or to make machine-made products such as carpets and jackets and so on. Eventually, through this process, sheep's fur comes to us as woollen goods."
