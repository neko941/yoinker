        "The increasing proclivity of people to have their own cars is in line with the rapid development of a country. In spite of the fact that cars offer considerable amenities for individual in this modern era, the swelled number of car engenders enormous detriments toward environment. The global warming effect along with the human health threat are two severe consequences caused by the accumulation of rising private car number. In fact, such harms are far beyond the eases offered by cars as they are irreversible and have long-term effects.",
        "It is undeniable that cars provide conveniences in today\u2019s world. The high mobility of modern people along with present-day demands can significantly be bolstered by having a car. In fact, cars are the most flexible vehicles compared to others as people can go anytime and anywhere with their cars. Unlike public transportation which its route has been set, there is no restriction for the track of a car that makes car users freely determine their destinations along with their own travel routes. Cars can also cater more people compared to other private motor vehicles such as motorbike, making it as one of the most desired transportation mode for people, particularly those who have their own families. Even car is the answer for business actors who hanker after punctuality.",
        "However, the negative effects stemming from the increasing number of car ownership are serious, even life-threatening. Car pollutants, in fact, bring on immediate and long-term effect. Cars emit a wide range of hazardous chemical compunds that can lead to the accelerated global warming effects and reduced rate of human health. The carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases significantly contribute the risen worldwide temperature. The warmer global temperatures, in turn, affects to the pattern of farming, diminution of ice berg in nort and south pole, risen sea level, and lowering rate of wildlife. Furthermore, this increase is projected to continue over the coming decades, making it as a common attention for international society to tackle. In addition, various chemical matters generated from car engines jeopardize human health as they directly impair respiratory system disorder, which is fundamental for people\u2019s life. In addition, carbon monoxide, one of the exhaust gas from car, is correlated with the heart disease as it interferes with the blood\u2019s ability to transport oxyen.",
        "All in all, the ease for individual to posses a car is just a drop in the bucket compared to the perilous harms from the excessive number of private cars."
