        "Many believe that parents earlier were not that over-protective about their children than parents nowdays. From my perspective, I completely agree with their opinion, and will now give my reasons below.",
        "First of all, we know that we are living in a dynamic world which is constantly changing, with rapid increase in the crime rates such as- murder, theft, blackmail, rape, kidnapping, etc. It makes sense why the parents nowdays are more concerned and protective about their childs whereabouts. Also, knowing that the law has become more strict and harsh, no parent would like their child to get in any sort of trouble. Whereas, earlier the crime rates were way low and the laws were not that strict, is the main reason why parents earlier were not that protective. Nowdays, social media is really trending and everyone is very internet savy, but we forget that alot of crimes are being commited on the internet from online banking theft to hacking softwares.",
        "From my real life experience, I would share an incident which occured with me. I had recently got my bank account set up and few days later received a fake mail from a similar bank site, but ofcourse I did not know that, so I started filling up the information it asked, and all of a sudden my father called me to check up on me, and I told him what I was doing. He told me to immediately stop filling it and show him the site. After seeing it, he told me that it was a fake site and that I could have become a victim of online banking fraud.",
        "Therefore, by my personal experience I would conclude by saying that it makes complete sense why parents nowdays are more protective about their children."
