        "In recent times, there has been a massive increase in the amount of waste produced by the masses. This essay will give answers to why we are faced with this occurance  and the measure to be taken by the government to reduce the amount of waste produced.",
        "The burgeoning number of eateries and stores affects the amount of rubbish produced in a place. For instance, most people prefer to feed on already made foods and patronize shops on a daily basis. Therefore, incuring more waste ranging from paper wraps from food to plastics, nylon bags, shopping bags and so on which are mostly littered around the environment.",
        "Furthermore, with the increase in population nowadays, people always satisfy their various needs through purchasing what they need which must come with a package that will be disposed.",
        "Inappropriate increase in waste can be checkmated by the government authority by introducing different types of waste bins and labeling them appropriately.  For instance, recycling and non recycling waste bins should be labeled to guide people on which waste bin exactly to dispose certain items.Waste such as used plastic bottles can be traded to get a little coin in turn and then re-used by various companies. Thus,making people see reasons to dispose of it properly. Also, these eatries and shops should be mandated to attend waste management seminars to enable them have a better idea on how best to manage rubbish. Finally perishable goods should be consumed almost immediately when purchased to avoid been discarded.",
        "In conclusion, the government should indulge in the aforementioned measures of reducing the amount of rubbish as this will help create  a better environment."
