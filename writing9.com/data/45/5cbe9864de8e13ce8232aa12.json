        "The world is becoming a global village now, so people prefer to communicate in a language that is known to others and that language has happen to be English. There are many individuals who think that this will destroy other speaking languages and we all will be left with single language known to everyone. There numerous pros and cons for this type of scenario.",
        "On the brighter side, as there are low airfares and internet being source of information, travelers are surging year by year. Consequently, host of another country requires to communicate in a way that he could understand the need and demand of visitor. Hence, both need to know a single common language. Hence forth, when one can communicate in one language across the globe, then he need not to learn multiple. In addition, there will be no hinderance in order to visit new destinations.",
        "On the flip side, there is the danger of extinction of other languages. According to a survey conducted by united nations organisation, there are multiple spoken languages those are not used any more. Hence, the essence of being from different backgrounds and cultures is getting vanished. It will have had an adverse effect on the business of literature, theater or local music. Those who show skill of knowing different languages will not be seen.",
        "To recapitulate, there are numerous merits of having one single language as global status. However, the demerits attached to it also cannot be ignored. There should be global language but others should also not be harmed."
