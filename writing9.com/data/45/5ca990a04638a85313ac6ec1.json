        "Certain people in society have a righteous openion on role of sports ,specially competitive sports in child\u2019s school curriculum,while others oppose to have a view that it could impact child\u2019s development. This essay will discuss both viewpoints and will express that why it is beneficial to expose children to competitive sporting activities and how negative impact of such can be avoided.",
        "Firstly,trends of imparting education and it\u2019s meaning to the child\u2019s understanding is changing dynamically. Other than theory related to science,literature,mathematics it\u2019s more about how a child\u2019s develop his social know-how. Cognitive skills can only be developed when one\u2019s mind is active and fresh. Therefore,competitive sports can truly be a boom in activating brain cells and adding a Learning dimension in child\u2019s education period. For instance,children who are more participative in individual sports like tennis,athletics,swimming or badminton,according to Boston university survey,have shown better results in studies as compared to the one\u2019s who did not participate in any sports. In addition to this,it lends a helping hand in child\u2019s career in a way they can relate practicality or sports in easy and effective learning.",
        "Secondly,on the contrary same people think,the competitive nature of sports can put negative pressure on child\u2019s development. This aspect should also be pondered upon, as every child is unique and may excel in different subjects or can have inclination towards arts .But ,physical activeness is equally essential and child\u2019s energy can be channelised in a right way if there is correct mentoring .Only is one will balance time in sports and studies a child can have a complete education.",
        "To conclude,their can\u2019t be single fit or way of learning for every child,only by competitively engaging life to different sports ,stimulate to grow can be produced."
