        "Recently,people are migrating from one place to another.Some individuals think that urban life is better as comapred to rural life. In this essay both sides will be discussed and in the conclusion part my opinion will be presented.",
        "In the present world,younger generation are migrated more into city life in terms of employment.Employment oppertunity are more which attract youth to settle in the city.Furthermore,One another great advantage of city life is public transport .For example, recent surveys have claimed that for better livelihood people are moving from countryside to downtowns due to various job oppertunities as well as transportation fascility provided by the public goverment.",
        "Eventhough ,Those who care about environment prefer to stay at rural side of the city. As compared to city, country side are not much polluted becaue of inadequate transport fascility. In addition,Due to less population these places are very calm and quiet which in terms of saving from noice pollution.For instance, In Canada 95 percent of the people who are above 60 years of age prefer to live in rural population due to environmental problems which causes  health issues .To stay at better side they prefer countryside.",
        "To sum up ,In my opinion city life will be better for the present generation because of job oppertunity as well as transport fascility.However ,country side is also better to stay but i would not prefer because of low jobs as well as transportation fascility."
