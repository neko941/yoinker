        "Countries in advance always aid developing countries by giving money to them. However, this is not an effective solution for poverty. Some experts suggest that rich countries ought to give other various kinds of help to the poor countries rather than the financial aid. In my opinion, I agree that there should be other types of helping besides the financial one. Reasons that financial aid only does not solve problems efficiently can be studied well to be avoided. Advanced countries usually lend money to developing countries especially which have significant economic crises in order to help them improve fundamental aspects of life. For instance, Egypt burrows money from other countries to improve educational services and eliminate health issues. However, none of that has been achieved in the real life. Existence of thieves in the higher positions who spend portions of the money on their personal services can be a considerable factor. Furthermore, the lent money does not contribute to anything but loans accumulations. Besides, one of the causes is the poor planning. Most of the developed countries do not have economic experts which plan for the utilization of the financial aid, and that is a factor of wasting money on unnecessary projects. Several forms of aiding can be sent to the poor countries to help them. It is obvious that developing countries need experts to decide the priorities in order to avoid wasting money. Because of that, one significant type of helping is by offering special students either partial or fully-funded scholarships to educate them well in various majors to help their country. As the saying goes, do not give me a fish, but help me how to catch them. Also, to avoid stealing money, advanced countries ought to send engineers for example to supervise building the schools or hospitals by themselves, and they must recruit an accountant to spend the money on the right place. In conclusion, it can be seen that if the rich countries helped other ones in various ways, that would be remarkable and more helpful than focusing on one aspect. Furthermore, when developed countries contribute the development of other ones, they guarantee that those fresh advanced countries will aid them in any crises."
