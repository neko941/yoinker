        "On one hand, paerents should take an obligation for teaching them because they are the role models of them since they were born. For example, they are taught the basic behaviours such as standing up, sitting down and eating by spoon by their parents since they were young. And then, parents are the most familiest people for them before attending the school. In addition, they imitate their parents\u2019 behaviours both straightforwardly and rapidly because they believe that there is no one who can understand their feelings except from their parents. Moreover, parents have the ability which can talk to their children till they accept the thing which can be beneficial for them although they are not interested in it.",
        "\u200b",
        "On the other hand, school is the magnificent place to learn this because it is the new aera which can provide a lot of activities and skills. For instance, they will do every activity with their roommates such as cleaning the room, joining the sport clubs and doing the assignments if they attent the school. And then, they communicate with different standards of students and they will improve in their communication skills. After that, they are not supervised by their owners when they go to the school so that they need to be independent and friendly with their friends. Subsequently, they will improve the skills that are not only essential but also important to become a good member of society.",

Others assume that school is one of the best places to learn this. From my point of view, children can learn a lot of new experiences and skills at school rather than home. And then, school is the center of place where can produce the good citizens."
