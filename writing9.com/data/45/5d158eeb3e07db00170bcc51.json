        "Parents are giving more freedom to their children as compared to the older days. In my opinion, this is a positive development as it will lead to a balanced social life, building confidence, and better life experience.",
        "The parents are giving liberty to the children in many ways. They let them interact with their neighbors, friends, and relatives. Parents themselves act as their friend who gives the opportunity to a child to open and talk freely. This helps them to be socially, emotionally and mentally strong. However, in the past, the children were confined to the boundaries.",
        "Secondly, many schools have accepted the modern trend of co-education of both the genders. Parents have also approved this trend with a big heart. By admitting the children in these schools, skills such as confidence and maturity have developed.",
        "Furthermore, parents have understood the importance of the internet. It is the vast ocean of knowledge. The children of any age group can use it to develop the skills which they consider are important for their future. For instance, a Russian child can start learning English from a very young age and can open the gates of better opportunities, such as getting admission to Harvard University. They can explore the other side of the world through the internet. Thus, it is helping the children in building their future and to have different experiences.",
        "To recapitulate, children are developing in a positive way with the freedom given to them by their parents."
