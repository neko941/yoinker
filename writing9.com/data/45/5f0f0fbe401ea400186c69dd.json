        "Nowadays there are very few women in top positions of the most of life scopes, business, politics, administration although today women are prepare and have the same education of men and there are two crucial reasons why this situation continues happening.",
        "Firstly, we live in a macho society where men in top positions choose men to replace them and to occupy similar positions due to men think women are weak and they do not believe in their abilities. For example in Colombia there are approximately five politic party with leading men that choose their men colleagues and just a few women to be in there, as a result the congress have 260 men and 30 women.",
        "On the other hand, managers think women focus on the family wellness like the education and the care of children, cleaning and preparation of food more than in the labor atmosphere, due to the lack of opportunities for women there are some countries like Ecuador, Per\u00fa and Venezuela where 70% of women are housewife.",
        "Lastly, companies are very warned and try to save the more money than they could and in some situations women implies pregnancy money support, wasted time and money in training the person to replace her, for all of this many companies get the best opportunities and the top positions for men.",
        "In conclusion women have the abilities and skills to reach top position, to contribute in the success of any company but nowadays it is very hard because of the macho society and differences in interests and thoughts."
