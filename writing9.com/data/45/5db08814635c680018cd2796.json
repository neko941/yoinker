        "Quite a number of students go on a twelve months pre- university break to either work or travel. Although, taking a break can help expose and broaden the minds of these students,a break also distracts them from their goal of getting an education. In my opinion,the disadvantages far outweighs the advantages.",
        "The idea of travelling and working is a good one in itself because it tends to give exposure to a usually timid mindset.So when students decide to journey round the world,it helps then broaden their minds  because they get to experience the culture of other people and countries. For instance,a survey carried out,concluded that students who travel and experience other people's ways of life tend to be more welcoming in their approach to people from other countries and  cultures. Working also gives them an opportunity to save up for the educational pursuit ahead. To illustrate,80% of students in Africa work after secondary school to pay their way through college",
        "However.students who experience so much exposure as a result of traveling get distracted from their goal to pursue a post secondary educational qualification. For example,A survey conducted by the educational holiday research institute in Melbourne, concluded that most pre university travellers ended up straying away from the initial goal of going to the university. Also, in the course of working and making money,most of these students do not see the use of furthering their education, believing that they are achieving the purpose of education as it already. As an illustration,90% of students living in Africa believe that the main purpose of working is to make money,so when they do prior to getting a university education,they believe they have achieved the main purpose of an education and therefore,do away with further post secondary education.",
        "To conclude,I am of the opinion that the drawbacks of working or traveling pre university by students,far outweighs the benefits, because not working or traveling makes them focus on the goal."
