        "While some adults believe that competition is an important value to be taught to their children, some prefer to emphasize cooperation more than competition. In my personal opinion, I believe that it is much better to instill cooperation rather than competition.",
        "There has always been competition in many aspects of life thus, it is better to have it introduce to children at a young age. For example, during school sportfest the children are divided into different teams and they have to compete against each other in a game in order to win. Through this, they will learn how to compete against one another in a fun and enjoyable way. Another example is in a class, students strive hard to be in the first honor. They will study hard to achieve a higher grade so that they can ranked as the best student in class. This has been the early ways of how competition was introduced to children.",
        "On the other, there are other people who believe that children need to learn how to be cooperative in order to be a better person. A person who knows how to cooperate can a good contributor to a team in order to succeed. For instance, children who were taught to be in a group and work as a group became more considerate of other people. At a young age, they are exposed in team where they learn to respect other people. They become more sensible and appreciative. Children who knows how to cooperate, take part of success and acknowledge that it was not only him but always the team.",
        "In a brief, I do believe that teaching the children to compete has some good and bad effects. However, when a child is taught to cooperative, his sense of achivement is more fulfilling than a child who competes."
