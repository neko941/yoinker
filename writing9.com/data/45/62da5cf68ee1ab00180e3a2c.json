        "The pie chart provides information about the main reasons for the decrease in land productivity on earth while the table graph points out how three continents were affected by factors during the 1990s.",
        "As can be seen from the pie graph, over-grazing has the highest proportion of global land deterioration. The information provided from the table graph reveals Europe has the highest percentage of total land degraded.",
        "In the pie chart, three main factors can lead to the aggravation of worldwide land. The first and most fatal reason was over-grazing with 35% meanwhile the second cause was deforestation which presented 30% compared to the less damaged factor (over-cultivation ) with 28%.",
        "In the table graph, there are three regions: North America, Europe, and Oceania. Europe had the highest proportion of deforestation, which was up to 9.8% while Oceania presented 1.7%, compared to 0.2% in North America. The percentage of over-cultivation in Oceania was lower than in Europe, at 0% and 7.7%, respectively.  Over-grazing in Oceania was higher than in Europe by 5.8%, Oceania was almost triple higher than in North America. Total land degraded in Europe is higher than in Oceania and North America ( 23% compared to 13% and 5%)."
