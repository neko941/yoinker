        "There is no doubt that money management is one of the most important skill. however, while some people feel that it should not be taught to school children, I would agree with those who argue that schools are the perfect stage, where it can be introduced to children.",
        "To begin with, nowadays, school children are overwhelmed with lots of academic subjects. In fact, they require after school tuition to cover left out syllabus. In this scenario, adding new subject on finance may put more burden on them. Moreover, traits of money matter are hard to grasp for school-goer. As a result, due to lack of time and difficulty in learning, they may get depressed. In contrary, if children took this subject beyond it means, they may inclined towards money matter, and there are chances of distraction from their ongoind study.",
        "However, it is vital to consider that matters related to finance are extremely useful in adult life. This skill takes time to learn, whereas child\u2019s mind is like fertile land, whatever taught in that age is get absorb quickly. Additionally,",
        "this learning motivates them to become more responsible by realizing vaule of money and why they should spend it wisely. On the other end, the negative impact of this subject can be diminish by keep pupils under observation",
        "and introducing money management as non-compulsory informative tutorial on which children would not be ranked.",
        "In conclusion, although there are some drawbacks of teaching such a crucial monetary skill in younger age, I feel that by keeping constant eye on children and making subject non-mandatory, just an informative, the pros may outweigh the cons."
