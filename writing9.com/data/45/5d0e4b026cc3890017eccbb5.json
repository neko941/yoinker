        "Employee\u2019s performance has a major effect on the success of an organization. Companies can raise their worker\u2019s outcomes by analyzing their punctuality and involving them in motivational speeches by the top management.",
        "To increase staff productivity, companies have to make sure they have punctual workers. If employees are consistent in certain aspects of their daily working hours in the workforce environment such as office coming time and not going back home before off-time, as well as attending meetings on regular basis, it will eventually enhance their performance and output in their company. For example, a recent survey by the London School of Business concluded a study that employees who are consistent in their daily working duration activities are more beneficial than those who are not.",
        "Another way of boosting the performance level of employees is to motivate them through speeches by the senior management officers in the company at least once a month. Motivation is a key to enhance the will of a worker up to a high level. If an employee who is not encourages to do a certain task at hand, he or she will not perform well, despite his or her capability to do a certain work. For instance, research indicated that Google has achieved 98% success in their employees output and performance, owing to the motivational speeches by its senior management staff to the rest of the employees.",
        "In conclusion, the rise and development of a company highly depends on the performance of their employees. Checking the punctuality of staff by the company and motivating them for certain tasks are two critical ways of rising employee\u2019s better output level."
