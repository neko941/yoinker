        "It is thought by some parents that children ought to concentrate on academic-reading materials rather than squandering time on books for fun. I believe that children must be rendered some liberty to choose what they want to read.",
        "To embark on, indulging in only educational activity impedes the thought process. It is well known that focusing on any one aspect forges a barrier while creating something distinct. Many instances have been elucidated in the past witnessing hindered overall growth in children. Although educational books take children on the right track, abundance of anything is detrimental. It has been exhibited that pupils who are engulfed by merely education-oriented subjects lag behind in extracurricular activities.",
        "To elucidate further, occasionally resorting to non-academic reading is beneficial for a young mind. Educational books are rarely interesting and are considered mundane. So, diverting focus to fun-filled articles is a great idea in order to relax and refresh a mind. It would ultimately result in an energetic person ready to lay emphasis on imperative educational practices. Anand Kumar, well-known mathematician, propagates to nurture the exhausted mind with some entertaining activities so that students can start afresh, and this technique has procured exemplary outcomes.",
        "To recapitulate, while learning educational journals are substantial, it should not be the only medium to prosper. Children are well aware of their needs and should be independent in their approach to prioritize things accordingly."
