        "Parents are the building block of the family and hold a greater responsibility of raising their children to be good members of society. However, some believe that teachers have to develop the societal personality of the students.",
        "First of all, considering the view that parents need to look over the social development of children, it can be said that nowadays, children tend to be more involved in technological advancements and the entertainment available on the internet as well as in day to day activities. In these circumstances, parents must look over the children and educate them about the social norms prevailing and also how to manage hand in hand with the professional as well as personal life. Moreover, parents should keep a check on their children as soon as they reach a teenage because, with the attainment of this age, there are a lot of hormonal changes that may change the thought process of the children towards society. This indeed forms a significant stage to be looked upon while raising children.",
        "On the other hand, taking the second view into account which marks it as a duty of schools for guiding students towards being good members of the society. Some people believe that children spend most of the time in their schools, so it is the responsibility of schools to educate students about the norms of the society so that they deliver more towards society. Also, teachers are an important part of society and they connect with the students more easily then parents do so, it is considered as the most favorable option by many.",
        "Taking both views into account, I am of the opinion that In addition to the personal and professional responsibilities, parents should also consider societal development of their children as a topmost priority and contribute a bit in the development of the nation as it is said \"Load of development of nation lies on good societal members\"."
