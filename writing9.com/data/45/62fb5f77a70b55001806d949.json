        "The two pictures illustrate a park when it opened in 1920 and today. Overall, every feature of the park has been changed except for the entrances and one of the three rose gardens.",
        "Looking first at the far left side of the image, the seats and music stage have been converted into a large amphitheatre with stadium-like seating. In the centre of the park, the two entrances remain the same, but the water fountain has been transformed into a rectangular-shaped rose garden with seating around each side.",
        "Turning to the far-right side of the plans, the pond has become a play area for children and the glasshouse is now a water feature. Below the water feature, an underground parking area has been built and this can be accessed by turning left off Eldon Street. Next to the entrance on Arnold Avenue, the rose garden has been replaced with a caf\u00e9."
