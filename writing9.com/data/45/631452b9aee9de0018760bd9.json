        "The graphs illustrate the world manufacturing expectations by sector between 2010 and 2060. Overall, there's little change in projected production by six different kinds of sectors in the two years, with manufacturing and services being the most dominant.",
        "It is forecast that the services and manufacturing sectors together will account for more than half of global production in 2040 and 2060, 71% (40% and 31%) and 74% (41% and 33%) respectively.",
        "While the proportion of production from agriculture and energy will be forecast to experience a significant decline, although it has the lowest figures in the sector. The proportion of production from energy is expected to decline from 7% in 2040 to 5% in 2060. It is also anticipated that there will be a similarly dramatic drop in agriculture manufacturing from 4% to 1% with manufacture in materials, comprising 4% in 2060 compared to 3% in 2040.",
        "As regards infor-communications and technology, there is expected to be little difference in the proportion of production in this sector's percentage, with a slight rise from 15% to 16% over the period."
