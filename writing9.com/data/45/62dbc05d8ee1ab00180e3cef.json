        "How are you? It's been ages since we last spoke. First of all, congratulations on getting admission in one of the renowned institutes of Melbourne.",
        "I'm just writing to give you some tips on your future accommodation. Actually, I did not stay in college hostel because the facilities there are extremely poor, and the kitchen is very unhygenic. So, I rented a flat in the high-rise apartments which are right across the road once you get out of the university's main gate.",
        "If you don't get a flat there, then you could upload your details and accommodation specifications on the university website, and one of the student council's member will definitely help you hunt a place. Apart from that, I'm also sharing a few contact numbers of some good real estate agents in the area, and you can call them.",
        "The mistakes that students often make while choosing their accommodation is they think the costlier it is the better amenities it would offer, but that is not the case. You should look for something that is in your budget, and don't overspend as you'll need some money for your projects as well. Also, keep in mind to not rent a flat whose owner stays there as they tend to put a lot of restrictions, and I know you'll not like it.",
        "Anyway, you have my new number, so drop a text or call me in case you have issues finding a suitable place.",
