        "Nowadays, the question of whether advertisement\u2019s power drives consumption of goods or not have been receiving a great deal of public attention. Although in many cases, consumerism is reliant on advertising, other factors will justify there.",
        "One the one hand, it is undeniable that the power of advertising in maximizing the profit of companies by manipulating us is apparent. First, since the involvement of celebrities and their own huge potential influence in advertising, certain products are endorsed, contributing to the excessive consumption of customers. In fact, a popular personality has the ability to transfer their image to a specific product that is advertised, which leads to gaining credibility of using products from myriad of fans. Second, on the grounds that manufacturers use adverts as the main drive which evokes the customer\u2019s curiosity. This means that while consumers are imprinted on their mind by glamorous pictures and jingle as well as exaggeration and promise about the benefits of products, the plethora of goods will be consumed on a sudden impulse.",
        "On the other hand, people tend to buy something unnecessary or even unaffordable. First, by updating latest products as smartphone, watches, cars in order to flaunt wealth, addicted buyers could max cut their credit cards. In fact, a throw-away culture can generate plenty of plastic wastes in society which is detrimental to the environment as these refuse takes hundreds of years to decompose. Furthermore, apart from advertising, there are another factors contribute to this trend such as the higher standard of living, mass production as a wide range of goods but reasonable prices, or overpopulation which make consumers buy goods excessively.",
        "In conclusion, while enhancing goods consumption reflect the power of advertisement in many situations, the role of other factors are far more significant."
