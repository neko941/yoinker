        "Providing safety to the nation is one of the most important part for any government. Maintaing law and order situation is always challenging for those who runs the country. In US government, impose curfew on younsters to travel without adults at night to make sure that their youth is safe. In this essay, we are going to discuss about the curfew being imposed in US.",
        "Sometimes governments has to take some measure to make sure that the citizens of their country remain safe. For instance, government provide free health insurance so that the nation as a whole keeps safe and healthy. Furthermore government makes harsh rules to penalize the criminals for the crimes they commit to develop the fear of law in general public. As far as US government concern, they consider their nation\u2019s safety at wrold level due to which US has to invade in other countries to make sure that no potential threat will harm the citizens of US.",
        "However, US have to take such measure in their own country as well. For example, recently US armed forces started the operation against drug dealers, which conduct their activities around the city after sunset. For the success of this operation against drug dealers US start imposing the curfew on teenager so, that SWAT forces can easily maintain active survillance in the cities with arm weapons without creating chaos between the kids and teenagers.",
        "However, in my opinion imposing the curfew on teenagers is not beneficial at all, as this will also create disturbance among the kids. Instead of giving confidence to the nation's children it will give create fear. It is government duty to make their country safe to travel at anytime and anywhere for their citizens. Therefore, government should not impose such curfews."
