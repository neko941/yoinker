        "It has been noticed nowadays, that high school students tend to take a gap year before they join universities. They aim to travel and gain experience before starting another phase of their academic learning process. Personally, I find myself inclined to admit that it is an effective way to help students to decide exactly the field or the programme they want to join in the next academic year.",
        "The first advantage of the gap year is that it offers the diligent students who worked hard some rest to get rid of stress and have enough time to explore the life before starting their studies again. However, a lot of  recent studies have shown that students, who took a one-yearyear break to travel and work before deciding on the college or university they want to join, had graduated fully satisfied with their choice and they had shown enthusiasm to start searching for jobs.",
        "Another merit to highlight, is the work experience or skills they learnt during this year, which can be highlighted in their resume. Certainly, this would facilitate for them finding a part-timetime job to support themselves financially during their study. a good example to illustrate this point is that around the world we can hear about companies specialising to organize and guide young people during this year, a lot of them are keen to find  them opportunities according to their desire to try practically the duties involved in a such a carrier.",
        "At the same ,time many people stress  that the importance of such a long break is overrated and some may lose their enthusiasm to learn. they also believe that the experience they seek  can be gained during their study as a part-timetime job or even after they graduate. They claim that being familiar with the required knowledge is more important before starting any job as professionals in any field would certainly perform much better than those who are not.",
        "To conclude, the aforementioned points clearly showed the potential advantages and disadvantages of this phenomenon , but I find myself inclined to state that the demerits are eclipsed by the merits of such experience as it helps the student to be responsible individuals and one hundred per cent sure about the programme they want to join in universities."
