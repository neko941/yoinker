        "\" Health is wealth\" is a saying which people nowadays have started implementing it in their lives. Some humans believe that performing physical exercises under a physical trainer's guidance provides  good results for maintenance of good health whereas others believe exercising at home can be beneficial too. I believe that joining a health club is more considerate for healthy living.",
        "People believe that  professionals at gym or health clubs would better guide you to have a fit body. They would help with the various exercises which will you to become a healthier individuals. They would also help you to monitor your weight and suggest you a healthy diet. Even the advanced euipments which are costlier and hard at maintenance can provide you quick and satisfactory results. Thus registering yourself at a gym  is a good option if you want faster and better results.",
        "Some have a thinking that going for morning walk or jogging is a better way to start your daily routine, as one can enjoy the nature and feel more refreshed. Even exercising by watching some exercise videos can help to develop a healthy body. For instance climbing stairs does not require any equipments and can be done at any point of time without any guidance or anyone's observation. Individuals who can give plenty of time to get results for fit body often tend to exercise at home as it also gives you freedom for selecting your own way of exercising.",
        "Joining a gym or exercising at home is an individuals choice but staying healthy should be a motive of everyone's life. I completely agree that being a member in gym or health clubs is beneficial as trainers there can help you achieve your goal in a better way and thus you can live a health life."
