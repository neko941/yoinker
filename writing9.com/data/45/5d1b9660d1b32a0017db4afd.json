        "I recently opened a new saving account in your bank. I received a welcome letter from the bank in which my details was mentioned along with the welcome kit. In that letter it was mentioned that there is an atm cum debit  bank card in the welcome kit for the mentioned account number. I am afraid to say that there is no card in the envelop, although card number was mentioned in the letter itself.",
        "It was bit of a concern to me as the card was missing, as it can be misused if it get into wrong hands. So I am writing this letter to know what support I can get from your end to ensure the safety of my bank account. I never been into such situation before, hence I have no idea what I can do on my part. So I request you to kindly update me, under such circumstances what would be the desired course of action, does the bank reissue the same card with the same number but with different cvv and validity or new card with the new card number will be issued. Kindly look into the matter and do the needful as earliest.",
