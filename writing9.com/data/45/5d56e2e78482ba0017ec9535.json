        "People, who are not aware of their neighborhood are drastically increasing. In modern society, humans are busy with their hectic lifestyle and personal interests with no time to spend with the neighbor,  Lack of time due to Increasing work pressure is the major reason behind this.",
        "There are many reasons causing this, firstly, the increasing competition at workplace forces humans to go an extra mile and spend more time in office to complete the targets, which lead them with no time to socialize and know the person lives in the house next to you. Secondly, few people do not want to interfere with other people privacy. They feel if they try to initiate the conversation other people may feel offended hence, they prefer not to open up with the person next door.",
        "In order to overcome this situation, people need to spare some time and participate in public gatherings and cultural events. This is the place where we can actually understand our neighbor get to know their interests. Also, these events should be organized more frequently so that people will get a chance to spend some time with their neighbor.",
        "To conclude this, In my opinion, people should take a little break from their professional commitments and spend some time with the neighbor, cultural events and society meetup will be the primary solution to this problem. People should also consider pooling their car with the neighbor while traveling to work, this will give them additional time to know each other."
