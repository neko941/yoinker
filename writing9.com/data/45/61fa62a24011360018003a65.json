        "The government and the doctors have always tried to educate people the disadvantages of smoking. However, there are still numerous people enjoy smoking despite all the risks on their health conditions.",
        "In my opinion, one of the reason that keeps people smoking is that it relaxes people. In the modern society, everything is fast-paced and stressful. Smoking provides a quick solution for people to release their stress and anxiety. Moreover, it is not costy either difficult to purchase cigaratte. For example, you can find cigaratte with a cheap price in every convenience store in Taiwan. It makes smoking easy for everyone. Furthermore, there are many scenes in movies showing actors smoking. It provides a cool and trendy image of smoking and leads the young people to imitate the behavior.",
        "Nevertheless, smoking is harmful to human beings. For instance, it can bring severe lung problems and lead to a cancer. Therefore, the government needs to take actions to protect their citizens by preventing them smoking. First of all, raising the price of cigaratte and vaper can be one of the solutions. Once it is expensive to purchase, the amout of people smoking will diminish. If it still doesn't work well, banning smoking can probably be the most effective method. For instance, Taiwan has recently passed the law of prohitbitting vaper. It has already reduced a certain amout of vaping behaviors in the young generation. On the other hand, it also makes sellers scared to sell it and thus reduces the resources of purchasing vapers.",
        "To summerize, I believe that the function of releasing stress, cheap price, and the cool image of cigarattes are the reasons why people keep smoking even though it can cause dieases. To reduce the smoking behaviors, the governemnet can raise the price of cigeratte or ban smoking with strict rules.",
