        "Most of the people prefer extremely hard and dangerous sports such as sky diving and skiing jump, because when they experience it, their feeling are dramatically higher than other things. Due to danger issues, some people say that those things should be banned. This essay will discuss that these things should completely exist for relaxation and leisure time.",
        "The dangers of extreme outdoor activities are quietly serious to human body. It can change people's lives and if it is really serious, people can die. For instance, when a person do sky diving, if he did not check his suit and parachute, he can get heart attack and his important body part will break. So, those are hazardous to human.",
        "On the other hand, the breath taking activities give huge pleasure to us and we can reduce our stress from society with it. Because it is one challenge to mankind's limit. So, if we experience it, the amount of pleasure is extremely huge. For example, in skiing, when the jumper is ready to start and succeed to flip it, he can feel pleasant and get back all of his effort. These are the reasons why people do these things, even though these are hazardous and it can kill them.",
        "This essay argued that breath taking activities have to exist in our life for relaxation and spending our leisure time. In my view, there is no reason to ban these things, furthermore, spend your time wisely."
