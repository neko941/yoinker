        "In the society, there is a common belief that the ladies are less competitive then gents.  I disagree with the statement and I believe that they are equally good at competing with each other. There was a time when people used to think that the women are weak and they can never work on par with the men. But now the perception has been debunked, they are thriving in most of the areas.",
        "Men and women are blessed with same level of intellect and there is no reason or proof to think ladies are not good enough. There are only few roles that are still left with no females in it, one of them is army.  Biologically the women are physically weak, because of which many communities and governments argue that they have no role to play in combat jobs. Apart from that exception, they are playing an important part in shaping the society for good.",
        "Females are competing at every level in the social fabric structure, right from doing basic jobs to leading some of the biggest multi-national companies. Let us consider an example, in the Indian political land scape, two of the top 4 positions are being held by the women, Defense and external affairs ministers.",
        "To conclude, I firmly disagree with the individuals who believe that the women are not good at competing with the male counterparts and I believe that both sexes are equally competitive in handling most of the situations.  In fact, ladies are better at multi-tasking who compared to men, this is a \u201cproven\u201d record."
