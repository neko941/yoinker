        "With the rise of internet, buying consumer goods & services has become more and more popular. In my opinion, there is more advantage in this way that outweigh its disadvantage,as I been online shopping for past few years now.",
        "Online shopping makes the life of the consumer a lot easier. With the tap on the smartphone, we can buy the orders and services. It is convenient and does the task at minimal effort. We don't have to spend our entire day buying and purchasing goods from the mall. During last month, I had ordered the smartphone through the online shopping sites, that was not available on my home market. If there was no such things as internet, then it was not possible to get my hand on that smartphone. With online services, I had also ordered & send birthday cake to my newphew, living outside the country.",
        "But with those advantages, there will be obvious disadvantages. Since, we won't know the actual goods, we may get scam for duplicate goods. There won't be any gurantee on the looks and size of the product. Sometime, there is huge difference between the price of goods in the online shopping sites, then in the local market. Last time after a month, I realized that the purchased phone price was a way lower in my home market. It was also partially due to my lack of research on that smartphone price.",
        "So, buying things on the internet has more advanatages, since it has made my life easier & saved my valuable time."
