        "Although It is a great idea to educate people about their healthcare and well being ,however spending a big part of medical fund for this purpose can be challenging for both health care professionals and public. I disagree with the opinion of spending a big part of money reserved for medical emergencies, on health education.",
        "Health Awareness is vital  for a helathy society ,but In my opinion government should allocate a different fund for this,instead of using money from the medical funds. Furthermore public awareness can we posible even in a very small budget, for example social media can be used for this purpose ,also health care professionals can do it face to face during patients visits. Lastly with the help of social care workers this task can be achieved. All of these can be done witout speding alot of medical from treatment funds.",
        "Considering current situation like global pandemic govrnment should be mimdfull about the money allocated for medical usage. Its really important to have enough resources in case of an emergency. And this can only be possible if the money is spent for treatment instesd of, health education. There is no doubt that ,the utmost priority should be health care .And this can only be achieved if, there are enough funds for this purpose. Spending a bigger chunk of money on health education, from medical funds can hamper the utmost goal.",
        "In the end i would like to say that both, health education and health care are important for a healthy and happy society, however medical treatment is a necessity and should be get priority over health awareness."
