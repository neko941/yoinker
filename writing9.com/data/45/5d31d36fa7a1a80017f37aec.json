        "People these days prefer utilising mobile phones over calling. This situation is the result of various applications which allow free message sending. However, the advantages of such a habit far outweigh the disadvantages.",
        "On the one hand, I can understand why people are more used to sending messages over phones. Firstly, many applications have been developed, that allows people to send messages free of cost to any part of the country. For example, applications like WhatsApp and Instagram allow users to send messages to any distance without incurring even a single penny. On the other hand, call to International countries causes so much.Secondly, additional interesting features, for instance, using emojis and graphical interface along with the conversation further add to this trend.",
        "However, this habit has both advantages as well as disadvantages. The major advantage of this is cost-effectiveness. Secondly, this facility can be used in public places where cell phones are not allowed. But it has its own drawbacks too. People, particularly, young people have become addicted to it. They take hours to complete the conversation over messages that they can complete in a few minutes over phone. Hence, they waste their precious time.",
        "To conclude, people have started using their mobile phones more for written communication than verbal communication because of easy accessibility of free platforms and cost efficiency. However, the positives of such habit outweigh the negatives."
