        "Vegeterianism becomes more and more popular at many people in countries, because they thick that meat is harmful to their body. In my opinion, I strongly believe that it is not essential for people to be a vegetarian.",
        "There are some reason why meat plays a role in the life. The first reason is that meat contains a large amount of rich source. As a reasearch, meat supplies  protein which helps to build muscles and bones. While the vegetarians consume supplements and vegetables to get all the necessary vitamins and minerals, eating meat is the fundamental way to help people to charge the power. On the other hand, using meat is the habit originating from our ansectors for thounsands of years. Besides picking the fruits, they hunted the animals and killed them to eat meat, so we could not ignore and abandon the true rule.",
        "It is not to say that meat is a reason causing some people\u2019s health problems. For example, consuming too much meat leading to people would meet the variety of diseases such as diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular and even cancer. However, facing to these predicaments, we can limit the figure for the meat eating everyday and combine with others green foods without having diet completely.",
        "To sum up, I do not agree that everyone should become to the vegetarian diet. Although the overconsumption of meat could risk for the health, eating a well balanced between meat and vegetable would bring the positive result in a health body."
