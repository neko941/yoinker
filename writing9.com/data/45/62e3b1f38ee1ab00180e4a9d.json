        "In this day and age, the surging crime rate has propelled",
        "some individuals to argue in favour of capital punishment as a panacea, whereas a large section of the society suggests that steps other than death penalty need to be imposed. I personally believe that the execution should be reserved for crimes of severe nature only, and for other acts of omission and commission against the law, punishments like jail terms and hefty fines should be inflicted.",
        "The use of death sentence to scare criminals is a view lingering in society for ages. The fear of losing one\u2019s life, it is contended, will make criminals think twice before breaching the bounds of law. For instance, in some middle-east countries, the death penalty is a norm rather than an exception which acts as a deterrent for harbouring and unlawful thoughts and aims to reduce the crime rate. Thus, ending the life of a criminal to instil a sense of fear in the mind of other criminal elements is recommended by a handful of individuals to curb the rising graph of crime.",
        "On the flip side, most people surmise that instead of foisting the judicial execution, the need of the hour is to adopt the measure which can curtail the escalating number of felonies. The rationale behind this thinking is to spare the life of the perpetrator of the crime while meeting the ends of justice. These measures could be anything ranging from mandatory public service for misdemeanours like jumping a red light to life imprisonment for cruel acts such as rape and murder. I agree with this viewpoint with the exception that crimes which shake the conscience of the society like killing and rape deserve to be penalized with the extreme punishment, for justice must not only be done but also seen to be done.",
        "In summation, the rising crime rate has divided the society into two cohorts where one section advocates the death penalty while others want less harsh sentences. I think that sending someone to the gallows is suited for brutal crimes and other infringements of law may be dealt with less punitive measures."
