        "There is a debate concerning nuclear technology and whether its advantages outweigh its disadvantages. Although some people might think that  nuclear power can be dangerous to the human beings, I would argue that it can be useful in the recent world.",
        "On the one hand, Nuclear technology might  damage  the world. For example, there was a big earthquake in Japan several years ago, which caused  nuclear pollution. water and food influenced so that  brought  big damage to all of the people who lived in Japan during that period of time, especially Japanese children.",
        "On the other hand, it is an economical method to develop nuclear power since it is  cheap and clean energy. For example, with technology developed, people can drive their car with nuclear power instead of oil which is quite expensive in recent days. Consequently, the environment will not have  further damage, and it is good for the human beings.",
        "In conclusion, nuclear technology has both benefits and disadvantages sides. If people use this technology appropriately, it is useful to the development of the whole world."
