        "Growth in population effects the natural beauty as it is losing is sole purpose. If we do not focus on the methods of resolving it we mind end up living in a poluted atmosphare.",
        "The main advantage of protecting the natural beauty is that we can have cleaner environment for living. As the population is increasing day by day which is directly effecting the demonishment of green areas as people are utilizing that land for living. If we focus on avoiding distruction of trees we are indirectly helping humans to live healthy life therefore instead of abolishing it we should be more focused on saving it. The tourism is the utmost benefit of saving natural areas as most of the residents of the developing countries prefer spending their holidays in under developed countries or cities  because this give them a feeling of attachment to this world. A person feels relax and calm while watching green colour thats why most of people perfers to travel to the areas with lots of trees and grass. For example Pakistan, become the tourists attraction because of its northern areas. Because of the wide range of natural locations, verity of trees and high mountain peaks.",
        "One of the solution to this  problem is providing awareness to the locals  about the consequences they can face after losing these spots. Tell people about the importance of this avtivity and why this is baneficial. Other solution can be implementing some regulations like if someone tries to abolish these locations a heavy fine with imprisonment can be imposed. Another alternative could be goverment should restrict urban centers to be built nearby a natural location ask them to plan them in rural areas.",
