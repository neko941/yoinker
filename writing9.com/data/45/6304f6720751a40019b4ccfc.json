        "Have you ever wondered what life would be like without a phone, laptop, or other technology for a day? We often see technology as an essential part of our lives and think these changes are due to people. However, there is an opinion: \"People are changing technology every day, but technology is also changing people's lives.\" Is technology increasingly dominating and orienting behavior and habits not only of individuals but also of communities or generations?",
        "The term technology is derived from Greek, meaning people's tools, skills, and tricks in life activities. Today, technology is a system of methods, tools, and capabilities for solving problems or processes that create products (physical and intangible). Humans are increasingly developing technology but simultaneously dependent on it, being dominated by it. Technology development and transformation is an inevitable rule when people actively replace an essential part (basic, core) or the entire technology in use with another, more advanced technology. Technology is present in all areas of our lives and brings undeniable benefits. Our lives are getting better and better, saving labor, etc. However, there are also adverse effects when the dependence on technology increases. That leads to lazy thinking and inactivity; relationships also become cold and dry when most choose to maintain meetings, chatting, and caring only through messages on social networks. Festival. The world of technology also makes people easily fall into a delusion.",
        "In the present era, it is still necessary to develop the technology. However, the use of technology needs to be moderate and appropriate. The authorities need to strengthen the management and use of technology to serve healthy and community purposes. Moreover, each person must also balance using technology and performing responsibilities to the community and family. Let technology become a relevant and effective tool for our lives."
