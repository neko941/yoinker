        "In certain parts of the US, teenagers are not allowed outside at night, past a stipulated time, except they are with an accompanying adult.",
        "I agree with this new regulation because,teenagers are not always security conscious. The presence of an adult with  a teenager at night poses less threat to the teenager and  more threat to any stalker or an intending attacker.",
        "Teenagers are individuals who are between the ages thirteen and Nineteen. This group of people see the world in a different light. They are usually more daring, adventurous and willing to take uncalculated risks. Most times, they do not consider the consequences of their actions before taking decisions, and because this individuals are vital to the economy, it will be important to put strict regulations in place to protect them.",
        "Likewise, because teenagers are prone to making hasty decisions, without necessarily thinking of it, I think the presence of a much older individual will help to curb this. An older person will be able to handle situations intelligently and will know how to caution the ward when going overboard.",
        "The essence of a curfew is to reduce crime rate and protect its citizens, and because teenagers are mostly carefree and less concerned about the details of their environment, it is very important to protect this group of individuals who are still exploring the world and are yet to learn tangible lessons which are key  for survival .",
        "Since most attacks happen at night, it will be important to put in place strict measures that will mitigate these attacks especially on one  of the most vulnerable members of the populace.",
        "In conclusion, teenagers represent the future of our economy, and placing laws to keep them in check further reiterates the premium placed on them by the entire citizenry."
