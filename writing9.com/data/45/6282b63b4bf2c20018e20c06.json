        "Nowadays, there is an opinion which considers that the support from famous people towards international aid organizations is helpful for addressing the problems through gaining more attention from the public. However, there is a lot people do not agree with this opinion. From my perspective, I think the support from famous people can contribute a lot to deal with some problems.",
        "Given the huge influence of famous people, their support will definitely be useful. Firstly, famous people often have considerable number of fans who follow every action of their ideos, which results that once famous people claim to stand with one international aid organization, their fans will take some actions, for example, donate, to respond their ideo\u2019s support, that may enable this international aid organization to gain more donations thereby increasing their investment in concerned problems.Moreover, as the raising of public attention, more mass media will follow the progress of concerned issues, which is beneficial to strengthen the supervision of relevant problems.",
        "However, it is also worth to note that, if too many hits participate into the concerned issues in a unserious way, the nature of their support toward the international aid organization will be prone to distort and public will consider the concerned isses as a entertainment activities or celebrities.",
        "In my opinion, it is a good thing if famous people adopt a supportive attitude to an international aid organization. Since the public attention which is brought by famous people\u2019s participation can generate extra pressure on government or relevant adminstrative institutions. According to the history, this kind of pressure usually can push the public power to pay more attentions to the concerned issues and promote the solution of problem come out."
