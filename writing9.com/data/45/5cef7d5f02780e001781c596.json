        "upbringing of the children is an important part of every society and it is believed by some individuals that letting children take decision for their daily activities like choice of clothes, foods and entertainment lead them to self centered and affect the society as a whole but on the other hand some people are of the opposite view, they think it will be good for them. This essay will discuss both the views, firstly it will focus on the adverse effect of decision making by children and secondaly it will discuss the benifit and essentials of letting children make their own choice for daily matters.",
        "Decision making is an important part fr every individual but along with it comes the consequences, if children are allowed to make choices for their daily matters like clothes, food and entertainment it will has its own repercussion  as children are not mature enough to take wise decision and are tend to make mistakes which will have adverse effect for example in an survay conducted by one of the leading food magzine it was seen that 58% of children who had less parental restriction were indulged in more junk food eating habit and more prone to obesity and other health risk. it is seen that when there is no parental guidance children are inclined toward entertainment programme which have violet and unethical contents and this lead them to have aggressive behaviour and become self centered.",
        "But on the other hand on the broader view it is seen that if children are allowed to take decision for small day to day activities it will help them become confident , independent and responsible in long run, as the onus of every decision taken will be on them so they will learn from there own mistakes which will help them become responsible citizen for example- in recent news paper article it was publised that 62% of children who were allowed to take their own decision since their early childhood are likely to become more confident and have successful  leadership career.",
        "To conclude, children should be allowed to take independent decision for their daily matter, but only after certain age when they become mature to understand right from wrong and are able to take responsibility for their actions, until then parental guidance should be there in decision making and children should have a say in such decision, so that they can also learn how to take decision and the responsiblity which comes along with it."
