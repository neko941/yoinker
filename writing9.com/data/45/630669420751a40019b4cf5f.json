        "In present time unfavourable occupation and lack of budget is getting a common issue. Many people have to tolerate with these factors due to competitive society where it is challenging to find other jobs. On other hand, it is believed that working on the improvement of such situations will be best option. This essay will discuss both opinions. In my opinion, it is better to look for other opportunities such as studying abroad and changing employee.",
        "To commence with , most of public are getting patient with their unloved job and salary because they are worried to lose their existing job. For instance , even I have completed degree abroad I am still working in low paid and boring work place. The reason is that because of the scarcity of job market it is impossible to easily find a job especially a high paid work. To illustrate, some people are trying their best to search for other jobs, changing their major and going through varied trainings and workshops to enhance their professional skill. This would definitely chang their poor condition. So , while one's attitude is stable and calm toward low income and not interesting jobs, others will seek for  other employers and study unnesssry degree and courses .",
        "On other hand, I totally believe that studying abroad and finding other job is essential. For example, one of my aquantaise went to study abroad in Canada and after completion of her new degree she easily found high paid job in Canada. It provided her with exciting job which was fascinating for her and at the same time increased her monthly salary to high demand.So, acquiring degree abroad and looking for new perspective job abroad assisted her in quitting her uninteresting job and finding high- income job.",
        "Most people have to tolerate with their boring workplace and low -paid salary when others are struggling with finding a better way for improvement. However , getting better or another education and looking for other job search will be best opportunity for life imprisonment. If people seek for other chances such as education and new job it will change humankind's live standards to high extent ."
