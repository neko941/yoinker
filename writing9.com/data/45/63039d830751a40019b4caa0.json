        "Nowadays, in modern era  crime are increasing day by day. Teaching are play important role human life. Some children are starting crime in elder age because their parents are not strictly with children. Some individuals believe that parents should be punished if children do any crime. while,other think that children should be punished they commit a crime.I will discuss the both view of points in upcoming paragraphs.",
        "On the one hand, education are playing important role in children life. Children do lot of activities in childhood age. They watch numerous violent movie and try to do these kind of activity. Parents should be aware for children. Youngsters learning life skills with their parents. Moreover,if their child are intersting in crime they make strictly and awar about drawbacks of life. For instance,survey conducted by (BBC) news channel it showed that japan children news there pupils are more interested in criminal movies because their parents are do not teaching of good skill in life.The government started new rules of older generation if their children will be relate any kind of crime the whole family are punished.For example,the nation crime rate are 50%decrease in two decades for these rules.",
        "On the other Han, children are punished for there crime because their parents are dont know about life. Children are do not take seriously for parents what say that. The parents are not responsible for crime because they live in order age. Government should be pusniment only who are responsible for crime. For example, (AJJ TAK) news channel it showed that children are living with criminal for society and parents leave there house.",
        "In my opinion, government should be pusniment for children because parents are dont know for children life. Because they have own life they live life with own stlye and parents are not responsible for that."
