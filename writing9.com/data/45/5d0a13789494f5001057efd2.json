        "According to research, it has been discovered that more people are dying from curable and preventable diseases recently. This has led to various schools of thought on how this trend can be reversed. A school of thought is of the opinion that the wellness of the populace is a duty of the government while others believe that people\u2019s wellbeing depends on the people themselves. Both school of thoughts will be reviewed and a position made.",
        "There are many things that the government need to put in place to help improve the health of her people. One of such is proper remuneration of medical personnel working in hospitals. Proper remuneration will make these staff work optimally, it will also encourage more people to join the medical profession hence reduce patients to staff ratio thereby ensuring availability of quality medical services at all times to people. In Nigeria for example, there are more than 5,000 patients to a doctor due to the fact that most of the doctors have travelled out for greener pasture and this has led to bad medical services being rendered.",
        "People have active roles to play when it comes to taking care of their health, one of such is by doing physical exercises. According to researches, physical exercises have been proven to prevent obesity, diabetics, pulmonary and other diseases. When people work out, they burn off excess food intake, preventing build-up of high blood sugars which will eventually lead to diabetics. For example, it has been reported that more elderly people can be found in Japan, due to the fact that Japanese eat well and exercise properly.",
        "The health of a nation is everybody\u2019s business. I believe that both government and the people have active roles to play to ensure the wellness of its people. Government need to ensure that medical personnel are well paid so that they can be continually motivated while people should ensure they exercise daily."
