        "World is becoming a smaller place and different countries around the world are having similar culture and tradition compared to the past. The main reason reason behind this change is the advancements in technology. This should be considered as a positive development since this would help to bring societies and people closer.",
        "Technological advancements has made it possible for people in different countries to know about each other. Internet plays a key role in this change by making it possible for developing awareness about various places around the world and lifestyle and customs that they follow. This makes people more interested and they are even ready to accept those traditions that they find attractive and beneficial. Another important reason is the improvement in transportation facilities. Now a days, we are able to travel from one place to another within no time. Journeys that took days and months are taking only a few hours thereby promoting tourism industry to a great extend. People are travelling all over the world to know more about other places and are becoming more knowledgeable different culture and adapting and practicing few in the process. For instance, Kashmir is a beautiful place in North India which was unknown to the outside world. Now, this is one of the most popular tourist attraction in India. Hence, development in technology has helped a lot in helping to know outside everyone's boundary.",
        "This ought to be considered as a positive development due to various reasons. People are becoming more and more close since they understand others and this in turn helps in business developments thereby improving countries economy. Another arena where we could see the impact is in the education sector. A large number of students are going abroad for studies without hesitation since they are aware of the lifestyle of people and they wont have difficulty in adjusting in foreign land. Also, people have become more considerate and have started to appreciate all the different traditions around.",
        "To conclude, it is a fact that unlike older times, culture and tradition are becoming similar around the world. Technology had made this possible and this in turn should be seen as a positive change."
