        "As new technologies continue to emerge, more and more organizations are beginning to adopt it and make changes to the way they run. One of these changes is the replacement of humans by robots in jobs that were formally executed by humans. While this may be seen as an advancement of some sort, I seriously stand against it as I believe that the risks and disadvantages associated with it outweighs the benefits.",
        "Firstly, I do not think that robots can completely take the place of a human being, because, in the first place, these robots need a human person to check and maintain them for it to run smoothly. The cost of doing this is very high and not all companies can afford this. Even those who can afford it cannot continue to keep up with such expenditure. Unlike humans who are rational and can adapt to changing situations and also react to them accordingly, robots are programmed to follow a set of instructions and a change in situation and prompts can lead to a technical malfunction which defeats the purpose for which these robots were installed.",
        "Secondly, the replacement of humans by robots will leave a lot of persons jobless and poor. The consequence of this is that many families will be forced to deal with poverty and the rate of crime will in turn go up. If the people are jobless, there will be loss in tax and the government will also be affected, ultimately the economy will suffer.",
        "No doubts, there are a few advantages that comes with the adoption and application of technology, nonetheless, from the arguments in this essay, one can see that the disadvantages associated with this change are way too much. Robots can and should only be applied as a supporting role to make work easier for humans but definitely not as a replacement."
