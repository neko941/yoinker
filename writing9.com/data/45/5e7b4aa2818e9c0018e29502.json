        "These days in many parts of the world children are busy with some kind of paid work. Some people think that this is negative for them, whilst others say it helps them with experience. However, i don\u2019t agree with this and why i will explain below.",
        "On the one hand, many people think that if the children are engaged in some kind of work, they will not be lazy and learn a lot in life. If they have their own work, they cannot create various problems. They will also see difficult moments in life as their parents suffer, with what difficulty they earn money. In addition, they will have experience in the future, developing among the working people.",
        "On the other hand, others thing that this is completely wrong, because every person must be educated at school on time. Work prevents them from learning, doing in time for additional classes, doing homework. This will not give them a chance to learn something new and they vary from others with opinions. When their friends think in a modern way but they don\u2019t understand it.",
        "I think that the best way for children to learn and engage in some kind of sport. If they hardly learn more and more new things, they can do their best in the world. With the help of the plans drawn up, they can start their own business and make a career, share experiences with their knowledge, can also travel around the world and expand their horizons.",
        "To conclude, although working beneficial for younger generation with experience but i really believe that if children study hard they will reach many achievements in their life in the future."
