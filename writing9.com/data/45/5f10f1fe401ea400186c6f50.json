        "It has been often believed by some individuals that  educational institutes should give knowledge about financial management to students while schooling as this an essential learning for their life. I do agree with the given statement. In my opinion, teenagers  can achieve success, stay away from financial problem and can improve their lifestyle with the help of this skill.",
        "To begin with, students escape from the money crises,  if they know how to spend their money wisely. Little saving in childhood time can convert into the big amount later. For example,  a recent study from financial institute of India shows that most of the children who save little, while in their childhood can have bigger amount when they reach adulthood.",
        "Secondly, children can improve their lifestyle with financial management.  They can easily spend on their family when needed. Needless to say, how important to live with an improved lifestyle. If a person does not have money they cannot spend on them. Thus, financial management is necessary.",
        "To conclude, financial management is essential and every student should know how to save money and spend wisely. They can stay away from financial crises, which directly improved their lifestyle."
