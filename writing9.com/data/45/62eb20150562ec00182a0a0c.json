        "\u201cJuvenile crimes\u201d are no longer a rare term to everyone as its quickly spread fear to every citizens worldwide and skyrocket to every nations especially developed countries. This raise issuses whether the lack of social interaction and emotional guidance from people who raise us up and educators are the causes for these problem. In my point of view, I strongly agree with the statement and in this essay I will highlight all the points which support the idea.",
        "A juvenile crimes can include a minor in possession, robbery, rape, murder, and any other crime that can be committed by an adult. Individuals under the age of 18 who commit these crimes can be punished under juvenile law. For short, juvenile crimes are crime commited by youngsters.",
        "Firstly, the teenages or youngster are pople under the age of 18 which is the age when they can easily get influenced by mutiple factors among the surrounded. Moreover, they experience puberty that cause anxiety ,depression and even worst is antisocial as they feel their appearance or their life style are not fit with the society.  Furthermore they can be affected by others people life styles they intend to mimic famous people way of living or anyone they find it interesting without any consideration. This is why they usually get in trouble with drugs, money and as a result the commit crime in order to satisfy the need.",
        "Secondly, sometimes because the parents are overtired from overwork. Some parents never wanted kids and are cruelly trying to show the kids how they feel. Basically, because the parents usually feel that life is passing them by. Additionally, teacher who suppose to help them not only in study but also to lend an ear so they can raise their voice express their feeling and seeking for guidance. Alternatively, they just give them knowledge they just do their job earn paycheck and done. This create an invisible wall seprate the teenage and the teacher make they feel they are alone, hopeless. Therefore, they tend to sabotage and do things that illegal to express their feeling they want to rebel to think that the society are unfair and need to be destroy and sometime their action has caused significant consequences from robbery, shoplifting to even worst which is rape, murder.",
        "Lastly, it is important for parent to set out clear guidelines about what is acceptable. Tell teenager where you're going, who with and when you'll be back - expect them to do the same. Teenagers need clear guidelines just as much as younger children - setting boundaries shows you care. Moreover, your child is maturing and your relationship may be changing. Spend time doing everyday things together. The teenage years are exciting and enjoyable. Have fun - they'll soon be grown up. Let them know you will always be there for them. As teachers, it is essential to listen to students' concerns and demonstrate understanding as well as empathy. Offer your students the opportunity to have a one-to-one conversation with you to reconnect and discuss any concerns that might have arisen when their school was closed. If a child shares anything that is particularly concerning, please follow the protection or child safeguarding systems in place.",
        "In conclusion,  parent and teachers should pay more attention on their teenage so that they feel they are not alone and reduce to juvenile crimes rate. No children or teenage are born to be a criminal and no parent or teacher should give them a cold-hearted care."
