        "There are many producers who make very expensive movies. The first in our mind is probably  Hollywood. On the other hand,  money  is not always  guaranty for success. Milions of dollars can  help for sure, but storyline, creativity and many other factors have much more important impact and cause greater effect on audience.",
        "In my opinion story  and way of story telling  sells  cinema tickets. There are many projects recorded in one room and with just two actors and it had strong influence on public and got award on film festivals. Movies based on true story are interesting because public have in mind that it really happened and it can increase art effect.  For instance, new indian film \u201cPihu\u201d is about little girl, 2 years old,  which stayed alone at home with her dead mother. Public assessed it as the most stressful in modern society and it is recorded in one apartment with two actors. Therefore, large expenditure is not always related  with popularity and high level art.",
        "Also, the child from \u201cPihu\u201d was not famous actor but on the other side it was a big challenge to work with kid and gain sense of real life. It presents a creativity of filmmaker. For example, \u201cThe death of a man in the Balkans\u201d is the shortest role of actor Nikola Kojo but it was more than noticed. These peace of art was very successful and awarded. Same as you can buy a dress but not a stile you can also have a money but not creativity.",
        "At the and, public want to have a good time, to escape from reality and feel somebody s life and they don t care about how many million it costed. So, making movie is consist of talent, originality and creativity."
