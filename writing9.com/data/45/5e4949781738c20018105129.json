        "Gender equality has always been a hotly debating topic in the society. As more and more women work full-time as men, some people argue that housework should be shared by both genders. From my point of view, I utterly advocate the aforementioned perspective.",
        "In today's world, the number of females going out to work is increasing at unprecedented speed. Women appear in every field of life and can do every work that men can. They now are financially independent and they work as long hours as men do. Thus, there is no reason why women have to do all the housework. They have to work hard all day and they also need time to relax as much as men.",
        "There are two major reasons why housework should be shared by male and female. Firstly, it makes a contribution to promote gender equality. There used to be a stereotype that doing housework was the responsibility of women. In the old days, only men could get educated and go out for work. Women had no choices but stayed at home and nourished their children. They financially depent on their husband and nearly had no rights in deciding anything. As a result, men obviously opined that they did not need to do the housework. Sharing the housework will probably be a great step to diminish gaps between two genders. It made women feel respected and equal. It encourages them to recognize their values and develop themselves for a better change, which boosts up the development of the whole society. Secondly, sharing housework is a way for men to show their love and caring for family.  Men spending time doing chores means they are learning to take care of their children and their own houses. Not only does it help their wives have more time to relax but it also creates a strong bond with other family members. Their marriage relationship will also be much improved as they are sympathetic and caring to each other.",
        "In conclusion, it is advisable that men share the housework task with women as it is part of their responsibility and it is a good way to show their love to family. I hope that in the not-so-distant future, the images of men doing housework will  ubiquitously emerge and there will be no gender inequality in the whole world ."
