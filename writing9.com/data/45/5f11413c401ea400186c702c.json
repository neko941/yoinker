        "Nowadays, quite a large number of individuals work more than average working hours and thus having a few hours for entertainment. I strongly believe that this phenomenon has more drawbacks than benefits and this essay will outline the disadvantages using statistics from The Times Newspaper.",
        "On the one hand, there is ample evidence that bonus in addition to salary is beneficial for both the employee and family. By working extra hours, workers can earn more money which eventually upgrades the lifestyle by buying superior things which could not be possible with the savings from the basic salary. Not only upgraded lifestyle but also it is possible to fulfil the wishes of family members with the extra money.",
        "On the other hand, despite the benefits of extra earning, this trend has drawback including reduction in efficiency. A recent study from The Times Newspaper found that the efficiency to do work reduced by 95% if an employee works more than 15hours on daily basis. This is because of boredom of doing same work in a loop and due to fatigue with lack of proper sleep as a result of doing work for long hours. Moreover, family disputes are another down side of long working hours. This is because more work means less time for family and entertainment. Less quality time would bring misunderstanding and lack of care, love for others which will bring tiffs and end with breakage of relationship. According to The Times, 70% of divorces occurred due to quarrels between husband and wife as a result of lack of quality time with each other.",
        "To wrap up, I believe that despite the advantage of more money, the drawbacks of reduction in work efficiency and family disputes are more. So, one have to work to reduce these down sides to save relationship and to increase work efficiency."
