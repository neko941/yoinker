        "In most cases we see that many people think environmental issues must be solved globally, but for others\u2019 opinion, these problems have to be deal with by individual governments as local issues. I consider that environmental problems cover all surface of the World and these problems must be solved in global scale.",
        "Perhaps, the main reason why people are in favor of thought of global solution to environmental problems is because environment surrounds all members of the World and concern all people, so I agree. Many factors which lead to environmental problem are mainly related with pollution that appears from consuming power of people. Due to enlargement of human society, wasteful goods and hazardous matters which make pollution increase. This case occurs all over the World, but somewhere in heavier form. For example, atmosphere of mega cities and industrial cities is wealthy with different dangerous chemical gases.",
        "Despite this argument there is also a case for the idea that environmental issues which appear in the border of country concern government individually. Some people consider environmental problems as local issue and according to their thought government has to be eliminate these problems to protect surroundings. More precisely, countries which has heavy industry, such as oil refinery, have to deal with clearing of polluted areas. Implementation of this process may be organized on the bases of national laws or codes.",
        "Although people varying in their opinions, I believe environmental problems have to be dealt with globally because everyone lives in environment and we are dutiable to protect it."
