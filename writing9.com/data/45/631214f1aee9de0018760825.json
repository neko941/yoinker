Because in this modern age they have a lot food source and new building. Visitors  mostly like to visit  modern apartment is rather than the old living areas. They need more and more facilities.Moreover, each restoration and building has been  time limit after some, period it needs some replacement it shows the basic problem.such as, colour, lighting, and water leakage. Another example, a survey conducted by BBC news channel which showed that the japan nation destroys old buildings because it's dangerous for local people.",
        "Furthermore, the government should  spend money on roads and housing development. Because population are increasing. People face a lot of problems on road. Traffic is a common issue in every city. Authority should  improve roads condition and traffic systems. As well as, most  the people live in the temporary address they need their own address government provide housing opportunity to people. For instance, according to study housing problems and road conditions are dramatically decrease individuals suffering from traffic issues in travelling time",
