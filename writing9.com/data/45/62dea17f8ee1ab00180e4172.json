        "I am Angelica Sumampong, me and my family just recently moved in next to your house a week ago and I'm writing a complaint letter to you regarding to the cats and dogs you have in your house.",
        "First of all, I'm not sure if you are aware, but some of your cats are going inside the house and try to get some of our left-over foods left in the table. it doesn't bother me that much but the thing is, they also leave a mess in our kitchen, their footprints are all over at the top of table and it adds to my workload for the day.",
        "Secondly, your dogs, It's probably a routine for them to roam around in your garden to poop or do a lot of exercise. One thing I realize in this neighborhood is that the fence are small where it's just to my waist level. It greatly bothers me that they can easily jump over the fence and poop on our garden. I want to suggest to you that every night you secure the cats in your house and make sure they can't get out. As for the dogs, I suggest that you put a leash on them everytime you let them out in your garden. I hope you find the time to reconsider my suggestions and I look forward to catching up with you.",
