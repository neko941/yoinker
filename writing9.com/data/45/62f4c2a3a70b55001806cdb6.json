        "During this era, it is quite unnatural for  people who spend less time interacting with their neighbours. Spending time with other people specifically neighbours costs valuable in our personal life. Concerning  this ,topic there are vivid causes and solutions  there, and that will discuss in the following paragraphs.",
        "Firstly, people living in the cities are not getting enough time to spend time with their neighbours. Members of a family are busy with their day-to-day life plans. Secondly, shifting from house to apartment is also an unavoidable matter in this problem. Although people from different cultures and traditions are staying as our neighbours,  it does not seem secure and better for life. So without knowing the neighbour leads to insecurity and trouble in society.",
        "Accordingly, the government authorities should provide awareness for all the people who live in that area regarding the importance of knowing their neighbours. Moreover, arranging social events and gatherings at weekends will be helpful to know them better. Developing infrastructure like parks, and libraries are another good method to meet up with people.",
        "To sum up, developing interaction and weekend meetups in the society can find out and understand their neighbours well, and it will reduce insecure feelings and improve their lifestyle, which will bring up harmony among the people."
