        "Eating sugar has detrimental effect on our health.Although, someone would argue that consuming sugar limitation is the duty of government,while others think and I believe that it is a personal responsibility  to control sugar eating.States could help people to stop sugar eating but people's own duty is far greater than that.",
        "On the one hand, overeating sugar causes a lot of harmful disease. If an individual is cautious about their own eating habit and avoid sweets or some other foods which contain sugar, they can live comfortably.Because, sugary foods convey the symptoms of illness, such as diabetes, cholesterol and high blood pressure.Therefore, we should reduce the amount of sugar consumption and this could be most effective than the role of government.",
        "On the other hand, States could impose tax on sugary goods.Because, authority have to take care of general people and their health concern. Government imposing taxes has been decreased buying and selling sweet and other diary products which has negative impact on people's health issue.For example, last year France increase 20 percent tarrif on sugar and it had reduced sugar consumption among people.Despite, authorities play some important rules to under control this problem but public responsibilities is vital for overcome sugar related helath problems.",
        "In conclusion, although, government is reliable to people health problem which is caused by eating sugar but I believe that people self caring and own concern about themselves help them to control overeating those things."
