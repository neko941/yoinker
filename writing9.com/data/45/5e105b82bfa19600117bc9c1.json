        "Preserving the natural environment has become very crucial as  manufacturing of consumer products on a large scale has lead to environmental disturbance. People needs have changed over the period of time which has caused immense damage to the natural surroundings. There are many ways where this issue can be controlled, we shall continue to discuss  in next paragraphs.",
        "Cutting down the trees is the major cause of natural imbalance. In our live  plants/trees are the major source of fresh air. Trees have been cut down in order to meet the increased demand for . Rubber, Paper, etc.  The Government should impose heavy fine such people or they  should be put behind the bars if they  cause any harm to these natural resources.",
        "Another important cause of the extinction of natural resources is the increased demand for land. Mountains, forests and barred field are being used to construct huge buildings and malls. Such land should be used for growing or planting more trees instead of selling thousand acres of land to MNCs or selfish builders. Educating children at the young age can help to preserve these precious resources from getting extinct.",
        "To conclude, civilians and government should go hand in hand in order to preserve these resources. Instead of using natural resources, alternative  ways  should be found to meet the increased demand of the population."
