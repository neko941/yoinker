        "When it comes to environmental issues, there is an important debate regarding its implementation. While some believe that it should be dealt on a global platform, others support that these problems can be better handled nationally. In my opinion,  global participation is very crucial to deal with  environmental problems",
        "as it gives way to better planning and also provides scope for funding the poorer nations to accomplish the mission as a whole.",
        "On the one hand, the environmental problems when handled by the government of a particular nation understands the root cause of the problem at a micro-level. This understanding gives a clear vision for the application of various strategies. To illustrate,",
        "the national decisions are directed by the local governing bodies, who aptly report out the minute details causing the problems. And hence a more effective resolution can be implemented by the nation.",
        "On the other hand, a collaboration between various nations not only allows for the exchange of various ideas between nations and better planning for resolving the problem, but it also creates a ground for better understanding of each other's problem and hence finds better solutions to tackle them. For example, an underdeveloped country may not have enough resources to eradicate its environmental concerns, so other developed nations may fund them to tackle these issues if they are taken up at a global level. So, as the merits of handling environmental concerns",
        "globally has more impact than handling the issue nationally  I personally support global platform.",
        "In conclusion, environmental issues need national intervention for implementation of various strategies but it can be better dealt with only if various nations come together and find solutions jointly."
