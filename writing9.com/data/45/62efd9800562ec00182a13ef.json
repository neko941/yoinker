        "Professionals especially doctors and engineers play a vital role in country\u2019s progress and they are a huge asset to a nation. There is a controversy going on regarding to their working rights, where some people believe, they are bound to do job only in that country where they did their practice while some oppose to that and say that they can work anywhere as they desire. I will shed light on both views and in the will give my take on this issue.",
        "To begin with, I will discuss the notion of those who argues that professionals must work in practice of their state. By restricting their workplace can bring many advantages with to not only a local population but also to a government sector. It will bring the innovation and modern techniques to a particular country and will help the government to maintain economy. The local natives will also be able to access their services. For instance, if a highly qualified person moves to abroad to get a job there will may leave a blank space in its own country which cannot be fulfill by anyone. In this case the country will have simply wasted its training on a particular person.",
        "Now, I believe those who oppose to conditions of doing job has a valid reason for that. Because firstly, under these terms they may not get an international experience and working environment. Secondly, If there are not simply enough opportunities to get a desired job how will they be able to flourish and survive under that.",
        "By discussing both the views in detail, I personally believe, professionals must have the right to do their job anywhere in world they wish to. As it has more benefits in long term for both the professionals and nation growth."
