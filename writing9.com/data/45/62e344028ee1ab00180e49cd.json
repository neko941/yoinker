        "I definitely think that old age homes offer much better care than a family could offer as their parent turns older and strongly believe that the expenses for such care should be borne by the government. Many developed nations have built special dedicated old age homes for their senior citizens and all their care-related expenses are taken care of by the government.",
        "In today's world, most  adults are having hectic full-time jobs leaving them with very minimal time to dedicate to caring for their old parents. While an old-age home offers quite dedicated and skilled staff to take care of senior citizens they also have special types of equipment required for the daily medical care of old people. In addition, there is the right set of recreational utilities such as games, etc. available in such old age homes to keep them entertained and engaged with each other.",
        "Also, it has got so expensive, that an average adult family is barely able to manage their own expenses leaving aside taking care of the medical expenses of their senior parents. During their work life, an average citizen contributes to the growth of the nation by paying taxes and saving in public provident funds which could be utilized by the government for taking care of their senior citizens.",
        "Not all senior citizens have a lucrative retirement income upon which they can bank  on. It is the duty of our society and hence our government to offer an option to old people to have a stress-free and happy old age life where they are well-taken care of both physically and mentally in such old-age homes without any worry of the monetary expenses."
