        "These days, an increasing number of people are not willing to have children at a young age. There are many possible reasons for this tendency, which could lead to a number of impacts on both family life and the society.",
        "Several reasons can be mentioned why a rising number of individuals prefer to have children late in their life. Firstly, this choice allows them to have more quality time to assign a priority to enjoying life when they are still young. With a child born, many new responsibilities will be created for the couples to shoulder. These parental duties will not permit them to thoroughly enjoy their lifestyle they used to have. Another reason behind this trend is that, with fostering a child being an arduous process, meeting the basic needs of a child is a paramount challenging process for them. To clarify, it is obvious that it would be much easier for a young couple to follow their aspirations and embark on an adventure as well as climb the career ladder when they do not have a child. Secondly, this approach would be money-saving. Being at the early stage of their career, people usually make a lower profit compared to an older age. Adding a child to this equation would lead to significant financial challenges for them so as that only after they are able to accumulate enough money to ensure a better life for their children, they make a decision to have a child.",
        "The effects on this phenomenon can be discussed in terms of the fact that this tendency might bring about a number of negative effects on both family life and society. The first impact is that having children later will cause a noticeable age generation gap. This makes it harder for parents to understand based on standard of upright conduct, communicating with their offspring. The wider this gap becomes; , the less strong family bonds will be in the future. This may create a situation in which the whole society might suffer from lack of young workforce in the future years to come. Not only, does this lead to the lack of young and energetic workers with high level of enthusiasm induce in companies and industries, but also this might adversely affect the economic prosperity of a county as a whole.",
        "In conclusion, many people are inclined to have children late in their life due to their financial circumstances and their preferences to enjoy life more. However,",
        "this tendency can result in some negative impacts on both family bonds and economic state of the entire society."
