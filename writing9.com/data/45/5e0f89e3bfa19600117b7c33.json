        "My point of view is that,Museums are valuable historical and educational places that must be done the essential safeguards for preserving ancient monuments. In order to maintain this cultural heritage, Authorities obligate all visitors to pay an entrance fee. In general, Supplying government revenue to maintain security and establishing order and facilities by the officials are under discussion reasons. Firstly, Visiting museums is one of the procedures to acquire earnings and help the country\u2019s economy. To explain more, By using these fees, The government must require these antiquarian galleries. For example, A reputable museum obtain a large sum of money by selling ticket. In short, Ticket sales are desirable solution to prevent exhibition from collapsing. Secondly, People, in charge, should regularize a timetable in the direction of restoring order. To express it another way, Arrival and departure times for tourists should be in accordance with a pre-programmed schedule to prevent chaos at these situations. For instance, Free access to these places contribute to becoming overcrowded and disturbing discipline. To conclude with, If the centre is not maintained,",
        "It will not be attractive for tourist. Furthermore, Innovative proceedings are being taken by the superiors to pass legislation to charge for entry funds. In this way, they can provide annual expenses for these historic sites. By the same token, installing security cameras and placing a group of people in order to keep watch and introduce some of the artifacts are indispensable. Due to taking levies for admission will ensure that there is enough money, some of which will be set aside for upgrading the facilities.",
        "In conclusion, excluding the destruction of these precious resources and overcrowding in these environments is one of the key tasks of officials and people."
