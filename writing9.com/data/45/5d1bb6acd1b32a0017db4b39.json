        "I hope you\u2019re enjoying your post school vacation at the fullest. I\u2019m writing this letter to put you out of dilemma regarding the selection of  the career path post schooling. Out of the two options you mentioned in the letter (either to opt for higher education in a college or to search for the job), I would advise you to take up the second option.",
        "Your family\u2019s present financial condition post sudden death of your father is the main reason for me to advocate the option to search for the job. Additionally, there are no reputed colleges located around our town and as a result, you may have to live in a hostel which would add financial burden to your family. Hence, you may not be able to focus on your study.",
        "However, if you would get a job, you could provide much needed financial support to your family. Moreover, you have the passion for teaching and you can also play some good guitar. These skills could help you to find a decent job as either a course tutor or a music teacher.",
        "I\u2019m looking forward to your response on my suggestions.",
