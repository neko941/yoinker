        "Many cities experienced over population that requieres to construct more new homes. Some of people claim that new homes should be constructed in existing city while others argues that new homes need to be built to accomodate this  growing population. The main benefits of this are decreasing the price of new homes and increase salary for those who agree to move to new towns; however, the disadvantages for building  new homes on existing cities are decreasing the quality of new homes and expensive houses.",
        "Decreasing the prices of new homes will attract more people to move to a new towns, so this  will avoid overcrowded places. First, one of many people's dream is to buy their own house; however, they are unaffordable to get in the city. By offering low prices and spacious houses and  apartments people will be willing to invest and move to another town. Second, it is importnat to built more cities in which people can growth and have their own space. Futhermore, usually goverment offers to increase people's salary to compensate the willigness to move to another village. Therefore, people do not think too much and accept to emigrate to other places. Believing tha they will have better income make easier to move and start again. For instance, in California houses are more affordable to buy in the suburbs and most people accept to move to be able to buy their own house. Hence, overcrowded places are avoid and families have more spacious houses to live.",
        "Although people dislike to live in crowded places some of them are not willing to move and they decided to stay in a low quality apartments.  In the city, there are modern buildings that offers multi-leves apartments in which overpopulation is one of the main issues. On top of this, there is no parking for everyone. Besides, usually there are more than two families living in each apartment, so space is a huge problem. The streets look always crowded because there are always someone waiting for an spot. For example, if an student  need to move a car from the street because it is time to go to school, one of their parent needs to move another car to save the spot or there will be no space when getting back. Hence, stressful situations like this most of the families live every day.",
        "To conclude, it is necessary to built new towns to accomodate overpopulation because the apartment's quality decrease when a city is crowded. Moreover, prices for renting a place to live goes to the top pf the roof. Therefore, it is vital to avoid overcrowded cities to decrease rental prices and reduce street pollution."
