        "I am a resident of apartment A303 at your community. I recently moved in to the city so it's really wonderfull of you to assign me a fully furnished house. I am, however, facing issues with few furniture items which I would like to bring to your attention.",
        "First of all, the bedroom houses only one Bunk Bed. Being a single guy, it's already wastefull to assing me that. To add to it, the bed is extremely noisy. Whenever I turn while sleeping it makes a rather horrific sound. I have already woken up scared at multiple occassions now. Another item that has been troubling me a lot is the dining table. It seems the height of the table's legs is not properly aligned due to which it keeps wobbling. For now, I am holding the table with one hand while eating with other to keep it stable.",
        "Can I please request you to send your in-house handyman to help fix these issues. Feel free to enter the apartment with your keys since I am out for work pretty much the whole day."
