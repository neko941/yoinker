        "Due to population shifts and changes, many old languages are not being used any more. Some people believe that this is a positive shift as it will make it easier to communicate. This article will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this change and its effect on the our sciaty.",
        "Language diversity is an important aspect in maintaing our colture and heritage. Certain words and phrases which describe past events can only be said in the common language and by loosing it we are loosing a major part of our history. Examples to that can be seen in the different native American dialect where a single word could capture within it a full sentence or a state of mind. Similarly, japanies words can have different meaning depending on its context. These little nuances can not be accuratly captured in other languages such as english or spanish. Our language is an essential part of who we are, and by loosing our spoken language we loos our social identity.",
        "In contrary, Many belive that thete is no room today for so many languages. According to this, as the world is becomming smaller and more accessible people should speak several international languages only, which whould make social communication much easier. As an example, there is no need for Brazil to speak portuguise when the entire continent speak spanish. Similalry, there is no need to speak so many dialect in India and the entire population should speak a single language. In this way,  peope whould be able to communicate freely worldwide.",
        "In my opnion languages should be charished as much as possible. They hold us together and maintain or coltural diversy and history. As an Israeli who speak Hebrew, the oldest language in the world, I can say that there is something magical in maintaining our history and language. I truly believe that when a language die, a part of our colture dies with it.",
        "In Conclusion, an international way of communication in the form of universal languages should be utilized to ease our way of communication. Regardless we should bot forget our formal languages as they hold a major part of our colture and history."
