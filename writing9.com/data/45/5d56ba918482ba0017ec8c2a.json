        "Computers have become important part of our day to day activity, similary it is greatly used in education sector as well.  although there have been improvement due to its use, but there is strong belief that it might not helping student as expected. In this essay we will discuss opinion on both.",
        "There has been noticeable improvment in the field of education due to the use of computers. This is due to the fact, that the information are available from outside the books as well, and also student can study as per their comfortable time and place. For example people can now attend classes from different part of the country through computers. Hence, for this reason among others using computer has proven value add in education.",
        "With increase in the use of computers, challenges to deal with the cons has also increased.",
        "If the computer are not used under supervision students can be using it not the way its intended to. There has been cases where students have used computers just to copy assignments rather then understanding the task given by teacher. Because of which students will get an 'A' in assignment without knowing a word about it.",
        "Development in technology is done to help the human kind , and same is expected from computers for education. In my opinion,  it is upto us that we use it to our benifit or loss, computers can help us if used idealy, else can negatively affect the education system if used without rules and regulations."
