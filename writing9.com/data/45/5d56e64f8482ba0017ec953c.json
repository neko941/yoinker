        "Most of the people select to live a life full of stress that give rise to serious health issues in numerous nations. Consumption of fast food and lack of exercises are quoted as important reasons for such health problems. However, physical activity and proper diet help to overcome this difficulties.",
        "One of the prime reason is that people desires to live a lavish and mordern life. To fulfill this dream they incline more towards fast food eating. In other words, people eat outside food which contains a large amount of cholesterol responsible for causing serious diseases like heartattack. For instance, eating butter, cheese etc contains high amount of fat which is harmful for body. Another reason is lack of exercise. People do not get enough time to do exercise because of increase workload and busy job schedule. Moreover, instead of walking they prefer to commute by car and two wheelers so that they can reach at their work on proper time. This results into absence of physical activity and ultimately people suffer from various difficulties regarding health.",
        "One of the obvious remedy is avoid eating outside meal. In addition, people must eat healthy and nutritious diet. For example, fruits, green leafy vegetables, pulses etc which contains more of vitamins and minerals and less fatty substance. Furthermore, it is advisable for pupils to do regular physical activity in form of exercise, yoga, pranayam, walking etc. Physical exercise not only keep the person active  and fit but also reduces stress of work and hectic life.",
        "In conclusion, though modern lifestyle and luxury may indulge people to live a unhealthy life that creates serious health issues but proper nutritious diet and exercise plays a vital role to nullify this problems."
