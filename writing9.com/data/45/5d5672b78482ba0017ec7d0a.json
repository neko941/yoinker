        "While a school of thought believes that a fulfilling work holds a predominant position rather than job assurance, the other school opines the significance of having a secured job and discards the concept of joy at the workplace. I espouse the former view as it is the factor behind success.",
        "On the one hand, a fair amount of people bolsters the notion that contentment in any occupation is pivotal and cannot be replaced by job security. When a person feels a sense of satisfaction, then that individual aspires to excel in the chosen field of work, whereas if personnel is aware of his fixed position, irrespective of any circumstances, then employee would not feel the urge to prove his mettle and go ahead in life. For instance, the government workers are a live proof of inefficiency and lack of prosperity.",
        "However, there is a section of society that strongly nurtures the opposite view and favours the idea of fixed employment. The defending populace thinks it is beneficial for the workforce as it relieves stress, which is catastrophic for one\u2019s wellbeing. Private job holders, for example, are always under undue pressure to outperform in order to survive. In case of incessantly low outcomes, staff is often served a notice of termination. Medical surveys have revealed detrimental effects on mental condition of employees working under deadlines. Thus, public sector vocations safeguard people from such detrimental results.",
        "Finally, after gauging both the sides, I deduce that one should prioritize a job that renders satisfaction because a person would be proactive and ready to take on the world. Moreover, such employees would have an array of work opportunities to choose from in case of any unfortunate situation because they have trust on their caliber.",
        "To recapitulate, different people have distinct opinions on whether job assurance is vital or a content-ridden profession. I firmly believe that future prospects of content employees are glorious."
