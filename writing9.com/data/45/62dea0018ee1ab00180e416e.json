        "There is no doubt that experts plays a crucial way in the people lead their lives. while some believe that professionals should be necessary to work in the place where they did their education. I would agree with those who argued that they should be exempt to work in different countries if they want. In this essay , I will discuss both sides of the argument.",
        "On the one hand, a certain degree of society suggest from specialist to stay in country where they did their tuition because community who is think like that want to develop their countries with their knowledge and make a solutions for country problems . Furthermore, their country will be a very popular at that field. For instance, Turkish doctors is a very popular in our world because they showcased their talents in country which they did training. In this light of information if the others will be do like that country will be very popular at that place.",
        "On the other hand, other people want to go different countries because in their field their country had a bad conditions. Due to that, salaries and experiences is very significant for them and if they not took what they want they want to work another country. To illustrate, Germany is very popular about engineering and some engineers want to go there because of that popularity. I am on the same page with these people and if they do that they become more knowledgeable and have a better life conditions.",
        "All in all, what can be concluded form afore-mentioned remarks is that although some individuals advocate, I strongly believe that professionals should be free to work in another country if they want."
