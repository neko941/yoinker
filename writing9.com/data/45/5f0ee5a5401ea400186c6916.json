        "I am writing regarding real estate training course that I have noticed in today\u2019s local newspaper.",
        "The real estate training course is only offered by the local council on the coming Friday from 9am to 4pm at the City Hall. As per the course\u2019s description, the authorities will provide the update about the local property management and tenancy regulations in the New Year, being effective from 01st January 2021.",
        "I would like to attend to this training course as I believe the provided knowledge and information will be very beneficial for my new duties at works. Hence, I kindly ask if you can approve for me to take a paid day off to participate in the training day.  In addition, I would like to check if it is possible for the company to cover the registration fee for each attendee, which is $50.0 per person.",
        "With my new roles, I really hope to learn the up-to-date information and guidelines about the legal regulation and important changes. Due to the unprecedented situation with the COVID-19 pandemic, there are some considerations from the local government toward renters who may loose their jobs and would be not able to pay their rent. With the update information, I will have better understanding to update our company\u2019s policy and lease agreement terms and condition. Based on this new knowledge, I will be in a better position to coordinate and provide accurate information to both our property\u2019s owners and tenants.",
        "I would be very grateful if you can approve my request to attend this training course and cover for its expense.",
        "I look forward to your positive response,",
