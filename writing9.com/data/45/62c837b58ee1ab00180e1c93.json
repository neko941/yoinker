        "There is no doubt that recently women has become prefer to make good career rather than have a children, so they will have children later in life. It happen because some of them believe that they must work as a proffesionals after they finish their education, and make good money. Women made their choice due to the bill of the debt they have during studying in collegge.",
        "There are argument that women must have children in young ages, that cause the reproduction system's of women will monopouse in certain time. There are posibilities that women can't have children if they have monopose. According with that monopose, if women have children later in life also it will impact the children too. The long gap of the ages the parents and the children will not good to the growth of the children, such as for milk, children's graduation, children's married or when children have a daughter.",
        "In the other hand, women have their reasons in why they choose to have children later. Comparison with men, women also want to have the same career. There is no differences during women and men take educational degree, so it works to at work as a proffesionals. not only men, but also women want to payback their workhard throughout take their degree, especially for them who want to pay the debt during pay their tuition fees. Lack of women get married in young age, it happen because in modern era bachelor degree has become minimum level to have good career. Most of the bachelors, finish their study at 22th, instead to get married most of them will force themself to make good career. This era is so different with our parents era, a lot of people married before they turn twenties.",
        "As a result, in this era with the growth of educational level and the tuition fee, force people to take the bachelor degree at 22th. So notonly women but also men, they want to have good career after they workhard during study."
