        "Today, an increasing number of indivduals prefer to be self-employed as opposed to working for companies. This is because being self-employed means having greater amount of independence, as well as the oportunity to be your own boss and pursue your passions or hobbies. However, in my opinion, self-employment also means no off days and a seasonal income.",
        "People opt for self-employment today as it offers them the chance to work on their own dreams. For example, over the last few years, there has been a spurt in the number of people who have started their own businesses such baking or designing custom jewellery and clothes. Another reason why people are choosing self-employment is because it offers greater amount of independence and flexibility not only in terms of working hours but also in terms of creativity. To illustrate, most self-employed people have more room to experiment with the projects they take on and are not bound by strict rules they absolutely have to follow.",
        "While there are some undoubted advantages of starting your own business, there are also a few disadvantages. Firstly, when you are your own boss, there are no off days. As you are not expected to follow rigourous work hours, you end up working longer and harder than you would had you been part of a corporate organization. Moreover, working freelance means you have to also be open to the fact that your income is likely to see seasonal shifts. For example, bakers tend to see spikes in their pay during certain festivals such as Christmas or Diwali as people more likely to buy cakes or chocolates during these times of year.",
        "To conclude, while there are many benefits when you work for yourself such as  independence and the chance to take on certain passion projects, there are also some obvious downsides, which include sporadic income and limited or no down time."
