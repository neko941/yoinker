        "No doubt that learning second language broaden one's horizon, a considerable number of scientests think that making children study new language at primary school rather than secondary school is much better for them. In this essay I will discuss why the advantages outweigh the disadvantages.",
        "",
        "First and formost, when children start their primary study, they are faced with many new subjects and even a more strict education system regarding the longer period of each subject and myriod of homework activities that they should accomplish at home. For instance, they begin to study maths, history in addation to their monther tangue, and adding to all of this new language will not be the easy target for children to achieve. Meanwhile, to postpone studying a second language to scondary school will help the child to understand the new language grammer, vocabulary, and mindset.",
        "",
        "On the other hand, learning a second language in the primary level will help the child to think in more than one language, deal with other culture, and communicate with other people. For example, children will broaden their horizon to think in traveling to new countries and learn new experinces when he/she grows. While this will not come on low cost, but this will let them recognize new language early enough to be ready in the scecondry school to use it with the native speaker and exchange new knowledge and culture with them which will make them ready to use more than one language in studying and discover the new researches made in their new language without a translator.",
        "",
        "To conclude, leaning a new language is a not an easy task for the primary school students, and no doubt it will be much easyer for secondry school students but the advantages of starting to study a new one in the primary school rather than in the secondry school outweighs the disadvantages."
