        "Money is very important for the survival of human beings. Without money, one cannot buy food, shelter and clothing which are the basic needs of people. Many people believe money is a very important factor to reach happiness. Others, however believe that money has nothing to do with happiness. This has always been a big debate and I will give my opinion throughout the essay.",
        "Happiness cannot be bought, we tend to associate happiness with money. No one can buy love and happiness, not even the richest man in the world. The richest man in the world can be the most miserable person if he does not know love, does not have emotion and compassion. Someone can be rich but may find himself alone and unhappy, furthermore it can be that his money attracts other people, but it is fake relationship.",
        "On the other hand, I can tell that money can contributes in happiness. For example a new wed couple decides to go for a honeymoon on the Hawaiian beach and hotel. Definitely, money in this case can contribute in making the couple have good souvenirs of their stay. Sometimes people can afford holidays in family and unfortunately they are costly. A holiday with the family brings happiness and some good memories as well. Unfortunately, we observe that poor people often lacks education and sometimes violence become part of their life.",
        "Personally I believe that love cannot be bought but however there are different scenarios where we see that money contributes in the happiness  of people.Money is the fundamental base of someone survival nowadays."
