Others think that the true function of a university should be to give access to knowledge for its own sake, regardless of whether the course is useful to an employer.\n\nWhat, in your opinion, should be the main function of a university?",

        "These days, weather the university's role  should be to prepare graduates for a specific job or simply educate without a particular vocation in mind is a controversial issue.",
        "On the one  hand of the argument, there are people who argue that it is  essential for universities to educate the students with specific knowledge and skills for a particular job because of the following reason. First and foremost, they do not waste their time to study general subjects, they are believe that students enroll at university with a specific purpose and all of them have a job in their mind to follow. Therefor  universities just have to help them to achieve their goal.",
        "For instance, students who want to be a doctor in future do not need to study  history or math  at niversity. It\u2019s vital for him to concentrate on subjects which are directly related to his job.",
        "On the other hand, a group of people are of the opinion that university should just focus on education.They believe that many 18 year old students have no idea about their future job,soit is significant for them to do a non vocational courses and if they are  forced to study practical subjects, it is highly likely that they quit university.In addition, if universities provide area for those who have a specific plan, other students' time and money will be just wasted.",
        "In conclusion, in my point of view,  although educate students with knowledge and  skills which are essential for their future work more beneficial, universities should provide situation that both groups of students take advantage of this."
