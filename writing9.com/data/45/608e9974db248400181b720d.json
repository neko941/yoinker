        "In the modern era, the population is increasing rapidly as well as the demand for animals also rising day by day.Some people argue that animals should be treated like a human being but other believe that we can use them for food or as a practical purpose.",
        "Firstly, every individual knows that animals have their own families and thay have equal feelings as human like anger, happiness or sadness, so they should treated like a person and they should have same rights as mortals.Moreover, In many countries, huge number of organisations come forward for saving a animal life and they show big efforts to aware a non vegitarian people regarding animals.",
        "On the other hand, many people think that if all human will become a vegitarian than a ratio of animals will increases on the erath and this should be a danger sign for human life and then all the animals will start to eat a individuals. Althought, some researches show that animals are the best for practice of new medicine or for research purpose, in this way , doctors knows a positive or negative effects of medicine after testing on animals which also helps to save a human life.",
        "In my point of view, we all should respect of animal's life and their gestures and we should stop eating them for our nutrition purpose because huge number of vegitarian food avaliable in the market which give us a lot of vitamins, carbohydrates and protiens. In addition, researches can use mammals or other creatures for a practical purposes because this way also helps to protect a wild life as well as human life."
