        "The ratio of obese kids in western societies has elevated nearly 20% in a period of ten years. I this essay I will discuss the cause and effect is this change and will provide solution.",
        "The main cause of increase in obesity ratio of kids is the unhealthy food. Number of children\u2019s eating unhealthy food is on arise now a days. Restaurants and fast food chains serve tasty food to attract children, but these foods contain high level of fat and salts which increases weight. Secondly, to top it up youngsters do not do physical activities like exercise or playing. They spent their time watching TV or playing games on computer or on mobiles. Finally food consumed by many children at home is unhealthy. Today in many homes maximum food which is consumed is processed or packed food like chips, ready to eat meals etc. Consumption of these foods on daily basis results in gaining weight.",
        "The consequences of obesity are very serious. Firstly, there are many diseases which occurs due to obesity like high blood pressure, diabetes etc. Having these types of diseases will result in life long dependency on medicines. Secondly, overweight children\u2019s are usually bulled at school and are looked down due to overweight. These types of issues can lead to low performance at school. Finally, obesity can lower self-esteem of a child.",
        "Main solution to the problem of obesity can be a well -controlled diet. Parents should keep in check on diet of their kid and should ensure that he/she takes a balanced and nutritious diet. Secondly, parents and teachers should educate children on importance and benefits of exercise. In every school there should be dedicated time for exercise, so that it becomes a habit.",
        "In conclusion, consumption of fatty food, lack of interest in physical activity are the major cause of increase in weight gain of children. This can result in early onset of many diseases. Parent and teacher can play an important part by keeping in check the intake of food and educating kids about importance of exercise."
