        "Nowadays, whether young people should live in major cities or not has been a heated social issue in debate. Personally, I believe that living in main areas brings a wide range of immense disadvantages as youngsters cope with unemployment and the burden of the cost of living. The following essay will explain these points in detail and suggest some solutions to tackle these issues.",
        "To start with, these is no doubt to say that cities with ground-shaking development create a competitive job environment for employees, especially young people. A wide range of people rush to developed cities to find a job, which makes senior students struggle with rivals in the job market or accept a job with lower payment. Although these cities bring wonderful opportunities for career advancement, youngsters still face grim career prospects unless they have outstanding academic knowledge and good social circles to compete. Age discrimination based on the perception that young people are lack of practical experience is a leading factor causing this situation. Some simple measures should be implemented to deal with these root causes. The youth should register for internship programs or management trainings even when being senior students. Learning best practices from reality must be the top priorities in case all companies call for experience, however, universities only provide them with entirely impractical knowledge.",
        "Secondly, living in cosmopolitan cities will be more financially stressful than suburban areas, especially for youngsters with low income. No one can deny the high living cost of big cities. Young people must endeavour to pay numerous bills on time, which not only postpone theirs savings for future, but also force them to sacrifice theirs wishes to buy a house or travel abroad to see the world firsthand. Furthermore, instead of finding a job with time off to relax or learn master, the youth must work overtime to deal with the expensive living expenses. To solve this problem, the government can lower profit taxes or electricity rates for young people. Companies nationwide may join forces to make an enabling environment for young people by offering discounts to them. Take CGV cinema as a clear example, this business only charges under 23-year-old people 45.000 VND for a ticket, but charges others 100.000 VND. The policy does not only release the financial burden, but also stimulates a huge market of the youth.",
        "To my mind, struggling for a good life in major cities is far from easy and particularly stressful for young people. Given the points given above, I think that youngsters would face a highly competitive job market and financial burden; the government business and continuous effort of the youth can lift the difficulties to some extent."
