        "Many people welcome the opening of shopping areas near their homes. On the other hand, some people strongly opposed to the construction of such facilities. If the opening of large shopping centre in your neighbourhood was announced would you support or oppose the construction.",
        "Shopping is one of the fascinating activity for people. People can travel long distances to do shopping according to do their needs and interest. I would be happier if there would be the opening of large shopping centre in my neighbourhood. I support its construction because of the following reasons that i will explain in the following passage.",
        "First of all, i believe that the construction of shopping centre in my neighbourhood would be beneficial for me and other people of the nearby areas. Now a days it is difficult for people to go out for shopping because of the busy schedule and hectic life. So they usually avoid to go out for shopping. People mostly prefer to do online shopping. My personal experience is a compelling example of this. I mostly prefer to do online shopping because of the shortage of time. But i feel online shopping is not satisfactory always. Sometimes i can get the desired products or sometimes products have issue with the size, quality and many other things. So opening of the shopping centre near my neighbourhood would be a golden opportunity for me. I would be able to go for shopping and buy the products according to my needs and without doing any compromise related to size and other factors of the product.",
        "Secondly, i think that opening of shopping centre would provide various job opportunities to the people living near the construction site. The making of building requires workers for the construction and after the establishment of shopping centre there would be job vacancies like of security guards, cleaner, sweeper, managers , employees and many other. For instance, last year a shopping complex had built near my university and they needed a sales girl for one of the shop in the shopping centre. So i did that job because at that time i was in great need to earn money.",
        "Hence, i am of the opinion that there should be the construction of shopping complex in my neighbourhood area because it will save lots of time to travel for shopping and also provides job oppurtunities to the people living near to that area."
