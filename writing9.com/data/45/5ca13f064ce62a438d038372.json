Secondaly, in a view of global warming, it is very crucial to control it by reducing the pollution from vehicles in major cities. According to reasearch, it is estimated that 80% of the pollution contributted by the vehicles that are used everyfay for comuting to officies. This might be the best option to reduce such pollution by creating and encouraging more opportunities from working home. Lastly, female gender would be more likely to benefited by avaibility of work from home specially working mother, pregnent women or independent women who is not financially strong.",
