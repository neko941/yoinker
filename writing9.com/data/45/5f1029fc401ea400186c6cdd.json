        "It is often thought by some personnels that state should take the responsibilty of jobless and impoverished denizens. This essay agrees with this statement because government is the guardian of the citizens and has authority to allocate a certain budget for such personalities.",
        "Parlaiment is the selected parent of the voters, which must hold the responsibility of their publics. Government can handle jobless and homeless persons by arranging jobs and accomodation for them. State could also establish demanding factories in order to increase the economy and facilitate the poor people by providing employment. For instance, China has alleviated the unemployments by establishing companies which also upserged the financial condition of the country.",
        "Moreover, head of nation can also add certain budgets to help serviceless and homeless people. If country focuses on this matter, this problem will never arise. After allocating certain budgets in the field of employment, government can soon mobilise the finance in the concerned field which will mitigate such difficulties during emergency. For example, the citizens of Nepal never become unemployed and homeless because this nation allocate the budgets in this field in the beginning of financial year and take step as the symptoms are seen, so these problems are easily eliminated before reaching the peak level.",
        "To sum up, being the head and guardian of the country, state should solve the problems of unemployment and habitation by creating different oppurtunities to the personalities via establishing factories and providing job to job seekers and distributing cash in such field in each financial year that help to overcome these difficulties during emergency."
