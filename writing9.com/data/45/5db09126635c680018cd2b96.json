        "Quite a number of students go on a twelve months pre- University break to either work or travel. Although, taking a break can help expose and broaden their minds ,a time off also distracts them from their goal of getting an Education. In my opinion,the disadvantages far outweighs the advantages.",
        "The idea of travelling and working is a good one in itself because it tends to give exposure to a usually timid mindset.So when students decide to journey round the world,it helps them maintainan open mind, since they get to experience the culture of other people and countries. For instance,a survey carried out,concluded that high school graduates who travel and experience other people's ways of life tend to be more welcoming in their approach to citizens from other countries and  cultures. Working also gives them an opportunity to save up for their Educational pursuit ahead. To illustrate,80% of students in Africa work after secondary school to pay their way through college.",
        "However. secondary school graduates who experience so much exposure as a result of travelling get distracted from their initial goal to pursue a post secondary Educational qualification. For example,A survey conducted by the Educational holiday research institute in Melbourne, concluded that most pre University travellers ended up straying away from the main goal of going to higher institutions . Also, in the course of working and making money,most of these students do not see the use of furthering their Education, believing that they have achieved the purpose of Education as it is.. As an illustration,90% of students living in Africa believe that the main purpose of working is to make money,so when they be coming become financially stable prior to getting a superior Education,they believe they have achieved the main purpose and therefore,do away with further post secondary Education.",
        "To conclude,I am of the opinion that the drawbacks of working or travelling pre university by students,far outweighs the benefits, because in the absence of working or travelling before their University Education makes them focus on the goal."
