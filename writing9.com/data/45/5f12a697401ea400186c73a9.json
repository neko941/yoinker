        "Although,Animals are thought to be overused ,and should have an equal rights as humans ,others ,however believe animals should be exploited to cover different peoples need,in my view animals can be used but by a fair way and pritected by some rules and regulations.",
        "on the one hand ,As some people thinks ,Animals are extremely usefull for work and also for food ,it is well known that ,animals meat is the best source for various elements that our body needs such as ,brotains we can find most types of brotains in the animals meat like sheeps and cows  ,morever milk is a very important source of calciaum to build human body specially the bones ,furthermore animals conributions in the work field is undeniable specially in the past as people used to transport and travell using animals like horses and camels and still now animals are used as a way to carry different loads like goods and take them from one place to another .",
        "on the other hand, other people believe animals have been exploited by people and should have more rights ,peope have been overusing animals by inhumane ways like making them work without rest and also not giving them the medical care they need to survive ,and by using animals meat more than what people actually need as of now people consume a tremendeous amount of meat which causes the death of more animals and to make money corporations are ready to kill every single animal in the planet .",
        "In my view , Animals can be used but governments should have a role by making some rules and regulations and also restrict killing animals that are about to extinct that way animals can be exploited by a fair and humane way.",
        "in conclusion ,Although people have a various opinions in animal exploitations  ibelieve authorities should inerfere and regulate animals markets."
