        "Nowadays that social networking is developing, generally speaking, people are getting used to accepting strangers as their friends in social media. Some people say that this act is useful to find new friends but some other claim that it's only purpose is to increase their dignity. In my experience, social network is a place for all purposes but it's mostly used to help people connect with more people rather than helping them feel better about themselves.",
        "First of all, all of the old and new friends were one day a stranger to all of us. As the social network world is growing bigger and bigger people start being less paranoid about choosing who to add to their friends list. Social network can be used to make new friends much easier with different people and opinions.",
        "I believe that, social network doesn't have limit for the location you are using it and you're able to connect with anyone around the whole world without any problem. Adding friends in your social media account is not only for finding friends. Apart from increasing the number of your friends, it helps you learn different cultures and languages, can be used to help you with your work and studies, and so many other stuff. Moreover, it helps you be able to discuss your concerns with somebody else across the world with the same position as you. For example, if you're a person in the UK, you can still easily have a good chat with a great student in California with the same goals and aims as you, and you can share your thoughts and pathways.",
        "However on the other hand, self-esteem is a concept that you can't directly relate it to only the number of friends on the internet. The number of your friends can increase by just accepting strangers follow request, but to actually being able to talk to them and increase the circle of your friends. For instance, you can have more than ten thousand friend on a social media application like Facebook, but when it comes to talking and hanging out you have no one; in this case the number of your friends doesn't help you have more confidence.",
        "On the whole, almost everyone use social network nowadays, the difference is some people use it to find new people, some others may use it to boost their self-esteem, and many others may use it for various other purposes; but mostly, it is used to connect with other people."
