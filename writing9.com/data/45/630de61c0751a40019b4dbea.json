        "them.",
        "Money, on the other hand, can be an efficient tool to encourage some groups of people to",
        "work harder. Firstly, it obvious that every employee is working to earn(ed) as much money as",
        "they can, so there is no doubt as to why they are working there. In some work that have to deal",
        "with sales, money might motivate them well and be understandable to other(s) teams in the",
        "company, so example for the sales team, if salespeople can close(d) the deal with customers,",
        "they can be rewarded with bonuses or commissions.",
