        "The burgeoning extinction of various species, both marine and on-land creatures, has been coming down to the human activities in which individual and business occupy a lion\u2019s share. From my own perspective, there are many effective efficacies to be put into practice to tackle this problematic issue.",
        "When it comes to the rationale reasons, people should consider two main culprits. Firstly, the large-scale expansion for living space is of the utmost importance. The plain truth is that people are in the upward inclination to destroy the natural habitats to construct thousands of residential buildings and other infrastructures, which leads to the adverse damages on wild animals\u2019 shelters. To be more specific, the deforestation in Vietnamese mountainous regions resulted in the burning deaths and the mass disappearance of sustainable home for those animals, whose lives entwined with forest such as snakes or birds. Simultaneously, human beings also contaminate the environment where animals survive by releasing the hazardous trash uncontrollably and directly. Formosa, the best persuasive evidence in this case, drove myriads of marine animals, such as fish and turtles, to the verge of extinction when it had dumped its toxic and unprocessed industrial rubbish to Binh Thuan beach.",
        "Conspicuously, the government is the deciding factor in alleviating this severity. Firstly, the national authorities should introduce and implement laws to control the constructions of residential structures. By doing this way, they would be able to conserve the natural habitat and ecosystem, in which wild animals could have an opportunity to continue their survival and sustainable development. Additionally, the stricter rules and regulations should be also enacted to hinder the environmental pollution. No sooner had people be in jeopardy of these rules than they avoid doing harms to the surrounding. Singapore, for instance, is perceived as one of the healthiest countries because of its prohibitive penalties, which could be financial fine or even sentence to prison.",
        "As aforementioned explanations, these two efficacies would produce the ideal environs for animals to insist on and create their own new generation"
