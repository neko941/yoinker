        "Education is the backbone of the country and the exemplary future is always rely on good learning. Where are some majority of the people believe general subject learning is more important and some believe a single stream study is good. I strongly support, study in particular stream is more worthy. There are two main points, pupil perform better in selected subjects and specialization generate higher career opportunies. In this essay, I will discuss both points in paragraphs.",
        "Todays, high school students are enough mature and they know their strenghth better than anyone. Specific subject learning, particular their knowledge or skills in one direction but it helps them to learn easily. For instance, a student is good in maths and science but he have more five subjects. It is difficult for him to study all the subjects at the same time. Despite, he perform well if he have only three subjects in which he is good. In a nutshell, specific subject learning build the student confidence and skills.",
        "Specialization, means you have all the knowledge and skills related to the particular stream. For the medical stream, students should have to choose biology background as well as a engineering students should have mathematics in their high school. This is to say, a students who completed his Masters in Neurology get more opportunity comparatively a plain bachelors of medical student. It is crsytal clear, learning or multiple subjects gives average result while particular learning filter your competitors.",
        "In conclusion, learning of specific subjects makes students career bright. Selection of subjects, build their confidence and specialization open up career paths for them. For every student it is necessary to explore their interest stream and pursue their career in the same."
