        "Utilizing cutting-edge technology to share one's private life, some people, including me, are concerned about its negative footprints. While others have their own justifications. The main aim of this essay is to set out some demerits in relation to this issue.",
        "Perhaps, the most irritating drawback has to do with privacy. Exhibiting detailed data of personal life, others would commence judgements. However, we do not have the right to judge a book by its cover. To tell the truth, misjudgment could vanish tranquillity and peace of mind.",
        "Another devastating factor behind this matter is disregarding people's skills which could occur according to their personal information. As a result, individuals' ex-marriage, divorce and even religious beliefs could adversely influence others and this would put a curb on their abilities. So, the misconception is really harmful.",
        "To recap the main points from what was mentioned above, it could be claimed that regardless of being familiar with peoples' specifications on social media, distribution of folks' daily routines would not be essential as well as beneficial."
