        "While the primary purpose of a dress is to protect one individual's body, nevertheless it is thought by people that the customs and behaviors of people can be assumed by the preference of dressing style. Though I do not accord with the idea that explaining a lot about the culture and character of one person just by seeing her/his clothes, especially in terms of preferring more common styles and",
        "An argument to put forward in favor of absorbing a common dressing pattern is that choices of most of the people's wearables do not remain unique because they are becoming so urbanized and professional in these days. Consequently, traditional and fashionable outfits are not only comfortable but also costly and one or two clothing styles, which are more available, tend to be selected more. This can be seen by the growing number of men who are selecting shirts and pants first instead of traditional option \"genji\" and \"lungi\".",
        "There is, however, another way of arguing is that due to globalization almost anyone can put on any type of dress anywhere. In addition, if one non-muslim decides to wear the \"punjabi\" and \"pajama\", he/she can not be the same. As an illustration, when the celebration of Chinese year comes, even foreigners buy and try out the dresses from China.",
        "All the things considered, I am inclined to restate that most of the assumptions of one's behavior and culture will go wrong if they have been made out of her/his choice of dressing."
