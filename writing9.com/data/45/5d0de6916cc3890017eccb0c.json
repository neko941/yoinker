        "It is no doubt that the aim of governments is to improve the infrastructure of a nation such as transportation systems. We should focus more on the importance of railways for its greater benefits in terms of environment and safety as compared to the negative impacts of road system.",
        "One of the major concerns of the 21st century is global warming due to the alarming increase of carbon monoxide emissions from fossil fuel driven vehicles. On the contrary, trains are powered by electricity and hence they are more environmental friendly as they do not release harmful air into the atmosphere.By building more railway network coverage, we can improve the connectivity between rural and urban areas and thus we could improve the township development for small towns. As a result, the population distribution will be evenly allocated among the small towns as the enhancement of accessibility for traveling. With the greater railway network, people can choose where they want to live rather than where they work.",
        "Traffic congestion is a nightmare to the motorists among the metropolis and major cities. In addition, the increasing casualties of road accidents that kills thousands of lives due to adverse road conditions from weather and the negligence of drivers. However, riding on trains is traffic free, accident free and time saving.",
        "Railways are the remedy for today\u2019s world as it reduces environmental damage, minimizes the traffic clogging and provides the mobility among the cities and towns. Thus, government should spend more fiscally on railway instead of road."
