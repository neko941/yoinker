        "Over the past few decades,the farmers are shifting to urban areas,leaving their villages and farmland for seeking good jobs.The rural people seem that living in town is cozy as well as earning money is possible effortlessly in any time anywhere.However,in this essay,I intend to explore the sources of this problem along with some possible solutions to it.",
        "Chief among the causes of this problem is the movement of people from village to town not only reduce the farm production but also the food shortage.As a result the regime has to import food from other parts of the world.Moreover,moving to an urban area indiscriminately,the town will become congested today or tomorrow.Furthermore,getting an apartment in an urban area has become solid hence the residents have to count a large amount of money to pay the rent of house.For example,Although my uncle used to live in a village but recently he has shifted to the city, now it has become difficult for him to afford to pay the rent of house monthly.It is noticeable that the price of vegetables in the city is higher than the village due to the huge consumer live in together.",
        "In order to resolve this problem there are many steps that can be taken as solution,the local government can provide modern facilities like town.Moremore,the local councilor can take some realistic steps to upgrade the rural conditions.Furthermore,farmers in the villages are poor in communication and transportation system,so they are not getting the fair value of their farm goods.Hence,the government immediately should ensure those facilities.Consequently, they would prefer to live in their village.For instance, I heard that my grandfather was a successful farmer but he did not get his fair value of the products as a result one day he got angry and came to the city forever.However,if the villagers get good the opportunity of works as well as the salary is reasonable they will not intend to move to the city.",
        "In conclusion,I believe that this is clearly a problem of such complexity that no solution is likely in the short term.However,the government should provide employment for the people of village like people of the city."
