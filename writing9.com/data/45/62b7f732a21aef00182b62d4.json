        "In modern world life of people is busy which requires an modern approch for their day today activities. Therefore assit of artifitial interligence or in some other words, help of computers are essential for day today activities like transport, medicine and communication. As examples proper route management system for transport and a well manged database for medicine and new technologies for communication can be mention.",
        "However If computers stop for an instant what will happen? It is hard to immagine the situation might occure in such situation. If computers stoped working the whole system managed by the computers would stop their functionalities. For an example if computers stop a train tranportation system managed by the computers will  be collapsed. The informations like location of trains, train shedules, information of passenger will not be accesible  and due to that whole system could be collapsed.",
        "Computers are machines and machines can stop any time due to many reasons. Main reason can be a virres attack or attack from a hakker. Virres affect the functions of a computer system and distrupt the normal working methods. Hackers will sneek through security protocols and effect for system procedures. Now a day there are lot of terorist activities and these issues can be due to cyber terrorism. As a example cyber attack to england interligent service which was happend on few yeras back can be identified. Due to the attack some high classified files were taken by the terrorists.",
        "In conclusion even we requires the assistance of technology, we should not 100% relie on the computers. There should always a backup plan."
