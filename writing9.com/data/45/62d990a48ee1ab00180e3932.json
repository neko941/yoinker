        "I have completed my schooling in India and planning to move to australia for my further education and thinking of getting the country's residency. I am living with a big family here in my home country and when I travel to australia. I am going to miss my family a lot especially my younger brothers. Fortunately, if I get this job, then I can spend a good amount of time with a family and most importantly I can be with your kid whom I will consider as my brother.",
        "As I mentioned above, I am used to be with a lot of childrens most of the time, and being an elder child in our family I had to look after my younger brothers since they were born as my parents were working. So, I believe I can take good care of your baby and please note that I am very good at reciting rhymes and singing lullaby for your little one.",
        "During my free time, I am planning to prepare for university entrance exams and I have a bucket list of tourist places that I always wished to visit in australia - mainly the beaches. I will spend some time visiting these attractions.",
