        "Today, it is a common phenomenon to see part of the young generation departing the rural areas to reside in metropolitan cities, leaving only elderly people behind. Such kind of internal immigration creates many problems in suburban areas , such as, lack of social services , closure of many small business with depression of agricultural industry.",
        "On the one hand, the lack of satisfying jobs is the main propeller for the Youth to leave their hometown to big cities, where more fulfilling jobs are there. However it erupts problems to their original places. Infact, Social services are quite dependent on young people to provide care and help for senior citizen likenursery care , home visits and emergency services. For example, many crippled old age men or women need assistance at home with their daily life activities depending either on their grandchildren or younger people in the same community. With such constant leakage of such young helper , senior citizen find it hard to get such services. Moreover , many small business start to close to lack of labor supply. More precisely , the agricultural industry which used to flourish in rural areas, has many difficulties nowadays in keeping its annual production at the same rate, since to more available strong workers.",
        "On the other hand, to tackle such growing alarming issue for rural places, it becomes a necessity to introduce new measures that are attractive to young eager minds to stay their without leaving to busy crowded cities. For example, governmental fund support is recommended for those working in social offices with good monthly salaries that are equal probably higher than their peers at cities. In addition, encouraging young people to invest in farming making it a profitable business.",
        "In conclusion , there is a constant deprivation of rural areas from their labor people towards big citiesthat creates the above mentioned problems , however there are multiple solutions to decrease such increasing worry.",
