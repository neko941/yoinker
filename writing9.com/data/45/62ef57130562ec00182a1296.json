        "Sports pertain to any form of competitive physical activity or game that aims to use, maintain, or improve physical ability and skills. Some people argue that sports are advantageous to the community while others feel that sports are only for leisure. I firmly believe that sports is beneficial to the society and let us consider the differing opinions on the same.",
        "On one side, Sports are useful for the society. For instance, money earned from the IPL matches are donated to the people who are in need. In 2007, funds raised in ipl matches were donated for rehabilitation of Tsunami victims. In this way, profits gained in sports are favourable to the society and it also developes the society. Most people are giving preference to martial arts for self-defence. For example, karate is one of the self-defence sports, people prefer to be martial.",
        "On the other hand, some people feel that sports are leisure time activity. In this competitive world, people feel that career building more important in life. Mostly they will focus on their work and spend leisure time for sports. For instance, an employee in an organization will prefer to do work to build his/her career and spend some time leisure time for the sports.",
        "To conclude, Sports are beneficial to build the healthy society. In my opinion, sports play a crucial role in the development of the society."
