        "In this modern era, the media became third eye of the world. They take many coverages of different type ofcelebrities which are telecasted on thier media channels. Some are good as well as bad. Some people believed that it puts a negative effect on the children. Now i will enunciate effect of media in the upcoming paragraphs.",
        "I accord with the statement . There are ample reasons of behind this problem. First of all, celebrities are legend or ideal for the youngsters and children. But, sometime they have done wrong things with other which proved bad for thier future. Moreover, they speak vulgar language on the shows of media channel. For instance,many actors as well as actresses speak the wrong languagelanguage with other celebrities those are telecasted on the various media channel. Apart from that, the media cannot stop telecast these shows because  they want higher trp.In addition to this, children and youngsters adopted these things in thier daily routine life. They start using vulgar language . Which destroys the level of language of  the nation.",
        "On the contrary , these coverages proved a threat for tv celebrities. Because, a lot of media channel takes eye on the activities. Furthermore, the privacy of famous people is vanished. Besides that,  the media cannot stop their coverage of media channels.",
        "In the sum up, in my point of view, celebrities should give thier speech very seriously. These speeches became a lifeline for thier fans. Media should telecast good news on this channel which proved beneficial for the nation and children."
