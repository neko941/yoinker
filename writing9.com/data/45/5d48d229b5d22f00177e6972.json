        "Parents are the people who, teach their children to be good in this community, but some others keep trust on schools. Mostly people blame parents about their children's behaviours, while others disagree and blame schools. This essay agrees that guardians are responsible to bring up a well mannered child to the society. Also this essay will discuss both points of view.",
        "It is clear that father and mother are best teachers for a child to teach discipline. To be a good members of any society the child must obey the rules of their community. It begins from the home and also a child's first best teacher is mother. Toddlers grasp most of the behaviours and habits quickly from family members because, it is the best time for them. For instant Dr. Maria montessori states that \"a child has a spongeneous mind during the period of their age 2 to 5  years.",
        "However many people disagree this statement and believe that popular school can guide children to be good. When a child enter into a school, child has to face different kinds of pupils such as pupils from different countries, pupils with different mother tongue....... . Whatever a child grasped from home will apply in school, and develop those habits. For example, in most countries children start school in their age of 5 or 6. During  early childhood period the child spent time with family members and absorbed all their behaviors and try to apply in school.",
        "In conclusion, parents are the responsible people to bring up a good member for a country and schools can help parents to achieve this. Not only the school, members of the community also should help younger generation to become valuable members to the community through out their life."
