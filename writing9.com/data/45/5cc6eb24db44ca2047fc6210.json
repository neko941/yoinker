        "Nowadays, many high school graduates have been advised to take a gap year before university. Although some people believe that it is helpful, others as well as myself believe it to be a waste of time.",
        "Many believe that by taking a year off, students can use this time to do various things that can benefit their university lives. During this gap students can go and volunteer in countries that are underprivileged. By doing so they can gain a sense of fulfilment and a better insight on the world around them. Furthermore through their volunteer work, they will be exposed to many different challenges through these challenges they will be able to grow as a human.",
        "However, by taking a sabbatical year students if not used wisely could end up being a complete waste of time. Many graduates believe that they can use their sabbatical to take an internship at large companies or hospitals to prepare them for their university life. However as they are merely a high school graduate, many companies refuse to let them intern as they would prefer a university student. If a graduate does not get an internship or have the money to go abroad and do volunteering they could waste a whole year as they did not find anything useful to do.",
        "In conclusion, although taking a year off before university can help students grow, if the graduate does not use their time properly it can be a total waste of time and money. Therefore, I believe that students should go straight to university."
