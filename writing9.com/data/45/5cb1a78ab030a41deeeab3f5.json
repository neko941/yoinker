        "Considering the importance of work experience along with the course of study, a number of educational institutions, nowadays, have started the provision of arranging work for students in local organisations. This initiative has proved highly advantageous for both the learners and the firm itself in many ways.",
        "Apparently, doing work, void of any payment, while studying enriches students with new knowlege and experience. In this way, certain specific valuable social skills are developed in them which brigthens their personality. For instance, working in groups and teams educates them to co-operate well, communicate and understand others effectively.",
        "In addition to this,  through voluntary services, children receives abundant exposure of society and  and its working mechanism. It eventually accustom them with actual hands-on- experience of work which otherwise is subjected to only academics books and within four walls of classroom. For example, students could interpret company's hierarchy system more vividly by actually working within it and resulting in better clarity of management structure.",
        "On the contrary, the organisation also get benefitted by students work. Obviously, the company gets free labour which brings down its cost to some extent during their work time. Also, the institution spreads its goals and prospects along with product information to public via these students which could assist in elevating its sales graph.",
        "Moreover, the human resource department gets ample opportunities to identify worthy and potential candidates in advance for the future job vaccines which saves the precious time and energy in recruitng them. For instance, several students recieve provisional appointment letters from company heads while rendering services.",
        "To conclude, it is undoubtedly clear that unpaid work done by students in business firms is helpful to students by increasing their horizons and career prospects. It equally fruitful to companies by cutting their costs and enabling to get best employees in long run."
