Especially in metropolitans the pace of life is increasing day by day.Since people have got a quite hectic life, they do not have enough time to be with their relatives by person. Therefore, new methods give them the opportunity yo be in relevance with other. Moreover, many of companies do their meetings online. Nowadays, due to new generation of communication facilitated our lives, corporations would be able to hold meetings through the Internet and employers do not have to commute a long distance to attend sessions.",
        "Developments in technology could result in some major beneficial effects. First, it plays a significant role in the life of individuals who are in long-distance relationship. Because thanks to the technology they have access to each other. In comparison to the past, people used to be in connection by letter, now they can call from all around the world. Second, technology has caused people of different nationality have the chance of being familiar with each other. They could acquire knowledge regarding exotic cultures by social media. As can be seen, the new relationships not only have been not limited just among citizens of a city or fellow-workers of a local office but also have been extended internationally. These sorts of relation lead to removing borders and uniting the nations.",
