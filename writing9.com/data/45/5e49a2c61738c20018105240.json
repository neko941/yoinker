        "The rol of music might be questioned these days since some people argue that it builts bridges among people. Personally, I believe that it is a great way of bringing people together from all ages and all around the globe, and I will explain why in this essay.",
        "Firstly, music is said to be an universal languange that anyone can feel connected to, despite their background or age. For instance, music festivals such as \"Coachella\" gathers thousends of people. Furthermore, music is an awsome way to make people feel identified with something. This can be seen with the anthem of a nation, where from the smallest child to even the eldest women come together to sing a song that represents their country. What is more, anyone can feel connected to a song even though it may not be in their native languange or even with song which has no lyrics at all. Electronic music is a clear example of this. This gender usually has only beats, however, is one of the most listened music worldwide.",
        "That is not to say that music has no critic. Different types of genders can lead to separation between people. What is more, many are against some types of contents or messages that artists put out. Especially now a days where songwriters are much more explicit and tend to write about contrversial topics.",
        "Overall, I feel that music does an excellent job bringing the world together. Although not everyone has the same taste regarding types of music, the positive effects that comes along outweight the downsides."
