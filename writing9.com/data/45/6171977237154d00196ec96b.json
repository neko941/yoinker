        "Family background investigation became a fascinating activity for many people. Finding out about previous generations has both benefits and drawbacks. The reasons why people are interested in this activity and the impacts that it could possibly make will be discussed in the following paragraphs.",
        "People always find a reason to be different from one another as uniqueness makes each person recognized and important in the society. Consequentely, people tend to seek out personal information that tells them about their roots and their own kind of people as these interesting details in history can be added to the story of their life creating more elements and uniqueness.",
        "On one hand, this trend is beneficial as it promotes family appreciation and allows members to have an activity together in which they get to work together and create bonds. Additionally, students might as well learn about historical events while trying to find relevant information which can be advantagous in history-related classes and activities. On the other hand, some people might find the story of their ancestors disturbing, for example, a tragic accident occured or someone committed a suicide. Moreover, in order to learn about family history, some might try talking to an elder in the house who might does not want to bring up the story as it triggers tragic memories.",
        "Finally, history of one's family is a precious piece of imformation. However, it is crucial that the process of finding out about the context involved a lot of consideration and the person investigating the matter should not expect a happy story as there are possibilities of disappointment."
