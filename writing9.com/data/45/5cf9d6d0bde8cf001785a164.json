        "Some of young students now are encouraged to join some work or going to an occasion for a year in between end of their schooling and beginning of university studies. In my opinion this is leads to get lacking in their studies and some of them are loosing interest on farther education.",
        "I think many of the students are continuing the colleges life after completing school that saving their time due to that. Also,",
        "every student wants to do the same since they don't get deviate in other activities. More than that they will complete their desired course at right time and can do work on that easily. And they can reach their goals at perfect time. I want to share one person experience which I have seen, one of younger cousin immediately started his college after school with perfect future plan he was already decided what course want to study and which job he like to do everything with perfect plan by the end his dreams come true.",
        "In other hand some students are having long trip more over, few of them doing job. Well I think doing job gives experience and make person more responsible but, those job are just permitted to that level. Having a graduation degree is very important in everyone's life also give more respect in society. Some teenagers are addicted to travelling these days but it's all waste of time. Having fun in life is not wrong but it have some limits for it, if  extended to peak it goes wrong. More over, they loose concentration on studies. I have seen one of my schoolmate he is very rich in money that made him irresponsible, after completing our schooling we all started college but he didn't, he take a long trip to different places after 1 year his parents asked him to join in University for Higher education but he just said I'm not interested in studies rather than I will do business. But now he is not doing any business or work.",
        "I conclude that taking long break after schooling makes some students lazy and their thoughts go beyond study because in that age we don't know what is life so parents want to guide them. Finally continuing farther studies without long break makes person perfect to reach their desired destination at right time."
