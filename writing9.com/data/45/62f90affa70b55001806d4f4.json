        "Computers these days play a very important role in everyday life specially for working professionals. The use of computers among children would prove positive as it would make them more familiar with the most commonly used machine and simultaneously develop their cognitive skills. Although, there could be negative effects too like being less socially active, not indulging in outdoor activities and may also lead to risk strain injuries. However, I would disagree that using a computer everyday has more negative effects than positive effects on the children.",
        "Early adaption of using computers will enhance computing skills of children. Firstly, typing speed will increase which enables them to write their letters or assignments efficiently. Children will get more familiar to search engines and how to use them effectively. Children are quick learners and adaption in early age to use software like word processors, spreadsheets and slideshow will become their second nature.",
        "Children will also use computer for entertainment purpose. They obviously will be tilted to waste a lot of their time to play computer games. However, parents can provide them with educational games and educational videos. Playing strategy games also improves their logic skill. Online games develops a sense of competitive spirit among children.",
        "Computers can also have some negative effects like addiction to live streaming of videos, risk strain injuries due to excessive use or children can accidentally view adult site. However, these can be controlled through parental lock features or computers to be used under parents\u2019 supervision. Children may get addicted to games and do not spend enough time in studies or the children may avoid doing physical activities altogether. Nonetheless, these can be resolved through schedule usage time and activating parental control features.",
        "My father provided me computer at young age. I used many educational games like car driving simulation games. Such games not only taught me the ABC of driving but also the safety rules for the road. Also, I've got phenomenal typing speed over 100 words per minute. I learned typing at tender age of 10 by using software such as typing tutor and playing typing games. This exceptional typing speed not only helped me to excel in school, college and university life but even at my work place. As I used to finish my assignments and reports efficiently and effectively.",
        "In my opinion there would be both positive and negative effects on the children to use computer in everyday life but in my own personal experience positive effects outweigh the negative effects."
