One of the benefits is that it can give children hope to do anything, even makes their psychologcal and mental stronger. Additionally, if they have stronger psychological, they will have more motivation to accomplish what they want to do next. Furthemore, they will try their best to do.

Then, I believed that do hard can made anything done",

Compare the real world, the taking that they can achieve anything if they try hard enough, this is too wonderful hop. In real lives, we don't have 100% rates to achieve everything. For instance, the children who are frequent to receive this saying, they will have mersy in their brain because they can not distinct what kind of thing is possible or unpossible to work",
