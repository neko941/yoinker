        "Recruiting a skilful employee is a huge challenge for companies that sometimes they choose a person who does not match in a group,some employer opine they have not a suitable feature such as poor communication to adapting in their community ,however ,I believe when a person has losen connection with others may be some reasons not only to the behavioural matching, so I am going to explore this topic in upcoming paragraphs.",
        "In a beginning , teamworking is a complicated process amongst people to handle their tasks,when an individual fails to adapt to others' the first idea that passed from their mentor's mind that  there is not a good relationship between them , deeply ,may be related to a different personality that It will become difficult to keep their connection,for example,introverts would prefer to work in solidarity while extroverts always enjoy doing their duties with by building a strong connection with costumers ,finally , their mentor maybe thinking entroverts have not behavioural strengths to managing  their responsibilities.",
        "Second, competition is not a positive aspect between members in a department because it will be destructed coordination, and the sense of cooperation and increase a struggle in a group,for example,",
        "I have worked as a researcher in a medical clinic and we must present a manuscript as a final outcome of a project ,for becoming a corresponding author, my friends have tried to interrupted in my tasks such as mocking me to weekend my confidence  as a result , the goal of the group has failed and it is completely not depend on my poor interpersonal communication.",
        "In conclusion, a poor adjustment in a company has many reasons such as a negative competition like a jealousy manner , different type of personality is the other cause which it will be so difficult to work all in the same place , so, the board of a company must describe a position as a coordinator to accelerating and giving their tasks and solving the possible interpersonal conflicts between them,in addition , the advisory persons of an institution must have enough experiences to choosing a right person to involve in a situation based on the personality of an employee."
