In these society people cannot generally afford to buy a car. Consequently, many of them would encourage to steal them. moreover, citizens of that society would decrease the level of their willing to having a car. In a consequence, they do not dream big, and try to improve their living condition significantly, since they will never think about achieve high welfare.",
        "However, by taking some actions, authorities may tackle this problem. many cannot afford to purchase vehicles as they are expensive. Nevertheless, by cutting down prices, everyone would own it. in addition, governors would much better off importing cheap cars from other countries, or bring industrial engineering to build less pricy cars. As a result, these items would not turn to something costly to have. In general, raising income can solve this issue immediately, which require a proper country economy.",
