        "There has been a debatable question for long time whether people still have willingness to pay conventional newspaper in the forthcoming era in consideration that almost all the information will be available for free in the internet. In my opinion, conventional newspaper will be replaced by online media. In the next passage, i will provide some arguments support the projection that paper based newspaper will be less need by people and someday it will be extinct.",
        "Massive development of internet and its infrastructure has caused significant evolution for the society lifestyle. Internet booming and  rapid change in telecommunication infrastructure bring new way of life which called IOT (internet of things). In IOT era, most of activity is being held in a network that connected a lot of people around the world. Nowadays more people gather information and news from online media because of not only convenience but also affordability. Moreover, a lot of e-news offer the information free of charge. It caused online news become more and more popular, whereas the conventional one become inferior and almost extinct.",
        "In addition, newspaper readers are dominant from people aged above 50 years old. Younger generation such Gen Y, Z, and millennial prefer to read news in their smartphone or gadget rather than buying newspaper. Consider that the generation of newspaper reader get older and older, someday newspaper will lost their customer and that is the time of end of printed information.  This phenomena caused major news media such New York Times, BBC, Jakarta Post, and Strait Times shifted their focus from  printed newspaper to online one.",
        "Considering the trend in society, in the future online media will play significant role in the news industry while the printed media will significantly limited and one day will be extinct."
