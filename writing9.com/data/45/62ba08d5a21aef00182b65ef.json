But the current era and rise in the competition this proverb are demolished. Nowadays the working class people dont have enough time to look after their own health due to work loads and excessive working hours. To tackle this issue the government has to play a vital role in implementing the fixed weekly working hours and compulsory holiday on Sundays as well as festival days. On that invest in parks with outdoor gym equipment.",

When they come back home their full energy got used in the office and they lost inspiration to go to the park and do some exercise. They eat dinner spend time with family and go to sleep to live for another day. This  brings disease and health get deteriorate. For, instance in Japan its illegal to become fat.",
