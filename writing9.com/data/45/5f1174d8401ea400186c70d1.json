        "It is true that younger leaders bring more creativity and new ideas to the business. However, it is in my opinion that senior leaders possess more knowledge and experience that truly helps push the business forward.",
        "It is conceivable that younger leaders have good potentials for good leadership, but making up for seniors' experiences is quite hard. Younger generation most likely has better education regarding the business they are taking a part in and is more likely to try to gain new knowledge and take risks, such as using new technologies in favor of the business. The older generation of employees however, have better understanding of the business and the market that they have gained through years of experience which are unlikely to be achieved through theoretical methods. Hence, making senior staff a better candidate for leadership.",
        "Another advantage that senior leaders hold over younger ones is the connections they have stablished over years of communication with colleagues. Their understanding of their coworkers is better and they are more likely to receive support from them. The younger ones on the other hand will be more likely to have problems proving themselves to other employees are a true leader figure.",
        "In conclusion, I believe senior leaders have an upper hand in leadership over the younger ones and the authority position is better to be given to them."
