        "It is correctly said that today's  people are just  to follow their traditional  rituals and festivals. Even, they donot know the real meanings of these rituals or festivals. They just entertained thenselves by odserving these. But, at the same time, there are some people whu really celebrate these festivals by knowing their sacred truth. This essay will discuss about both these point and give reasons for supporting these.",
        "now-a-days, people have a tendency to celebrate everything even though they donot know the actual meaning of it. For example, in India, Durga Puja is celebrated every year in some parts of the country. This type of puja lasts for 9 days. Here, we can see that most of the people celebrate puja at home just to make fun or enjoy theselves. Because, they want to show others how much money spend on decorations, pandals etc. Whereas, they even donot have the knowledge to follow the rituals. Whole night in 9 days they enjoyed with drinks, full of disco music etc.",
        "Nevertheless, there are some persons in society still have remember every meaning behind all the tradititonal or religious festivals. These people always celebrate with great love and proper care. For instance, in India, especially in the state of Assam, when the mother gives birth, then after one month form the birth, they celebrate it with some traditinal rituals, inviting elder people and take blessings from them. As, there is a believe that, if these elderly people give their blessings to the baby, then there will be rapid growing  of the baby. In this case, the question arises, why these type of people still follow our traditional rituals? It is only their respect for our traditional respect that they never forget these till the last breath of their lives.",
        "To sum up, it is clearly states that though plethora of individualsspecially yuongsatrs donot memorise our rituals, but still wwe have some people who promptly memorise and folloe these rituals and can give a life to these old beliefs."
