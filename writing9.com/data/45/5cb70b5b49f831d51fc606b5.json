        "Immediately after being released from jail, many sinners break the law again. This essay discusses the causes of this problem such as revenge and leniency by the law-makers and also the solutions for the same.",
        "The number of revenge crimes has been increasing every year, especially among the people who are relieved currently from the jail. The mentallity of hurting someone because he/she was the reason behind going to prison is common against the sinners. A recent study suggests that people who committed a felony are most likely to do it again after they are released from jail is because they want to take revenge. A solution to this problem can be that the public who are facing jail time should consult a pychologist. A pychologist can do wonders by talking to these criminals, understand their state of mind and help them accordingly.",
        "Criminals today do not fear the goverment or the police because they know that the laws are very lenient and they can get away with anything. Many of our goverment laws let convicts walk away by just paying a fine for a big crime like murder. Stricter laws are the only solution for these kind cases, and only then the sinners will have a fear against the goverment.",
        "To conclude, clearly revenge felonies and soft law are some of the reasons why crimes are committed again by the individuals who just came out of prison and consulting a pychologist and forming stricter laws can help in solving these issues."
