        "In recent times the people are more attracted to the things such as, the latest fashion and hairstyles. I think that this new tendency of the people is affecting society adversly. The more supporting ideas are given below. This trend is vastly influenced by the hollywood celebrities and the established sportspersons.",
        "First of all, the latest trends in fashion industry makes people look more appropriate, and showcase the social statement they want to make through their clothes and body styling. in further detail, latest styling helps people to coup-up with the modern world, as the peple tend to notice the latest fashion and hairstyle more rather a simple living.",
        "On the other hand, the latest fashion and hairstyle trends do come with a heavy wastage of time. especially, it takes away the time which could have been utilised for something creative. Here we can say that it can trap the society in an unending loop of wasting time. moreover, latest trends do come with a heavy price. rather it can burn the fortune of a person, which could have been used in the time of need. Now,",
        "looking at the above mentioned points I concluded that this new way of thinking is making people less creative. Also leading society towards wastage of time. I think that it is not too late to get out of the vicious clutches of this new tendency. In addition, this is the high time to get out of this loop. and start focusing on future goals."
