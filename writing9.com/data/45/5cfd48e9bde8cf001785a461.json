        "Good advertising is considered by many as one of the main parameters used to increase sales of a product. Many companies such as Nike, Samsung and and Apple spend millions of dollars on television and internet commercials so their products whould be thought after and admired. Recently however, several major publicity companies has challanged this tradionional approach.",
        "The main reason for the changes in paradigm lies in the basic question \"If a product is sold already, why should we advertise ?\". As an example, why should Cocca Cola spend so much money on commercials when it is already the most common beverage worldwide ? Why should McDonnalds spend mony on highway board posters in New York city when it has countless branches all over the metropolitan area ?",
        "This fundamental change in view has lead to a shift in the traditional approach and many advertisers currently address it as a new form of entertainment. According to this opinion people no longer need to be tought about a certain product because they have many ways to gain the required information through the internet. When a person is seeking a new set of headphones, for example, he does'nt need the television add. He will go online and compare the different types by himself. By using the commercial time as a short non official pause people will learn to have positive feelings and conotations about the brand and this will push them to buy it. As an example, a short and funny advert done by Eddie Murphy while wearing a Sony headphones will make people smile when looking at Sony products and be drawn to by them in comparisson to other brands.",
        "In my opinion, advertising should be considered as a form of entertainment. An interesting short story about the current enviromental situation and how Samsung is helping to clean the world or showing the us how Nike is contributing to sport education will convince me to buy their products much more than showing me pictures of their latest phone or running showes.",
        "In conclusion, companies should look for new and facinating ways make us by their products. We are no longer interested to hear about the latest brand you want us to buy. Try and convince us in a more antertaining way."
