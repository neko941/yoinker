        "One of the widely discussed issues nowadays is the increasing number of youngsters who suffer from obesity over the last decades. (youngsters suffering from obesity). It is undeniable that fast food (processed food) consumption and sedentary lifestyle have become an essential part of our life. In this essay I will look at obstacles to become healthy, examine factors responsible for spreading of obese people.",
        "One of the main causes of overweight children is parents who allow their kids to consume unhealthy food on a regular basis. It is a result of a shortage of parents\u2019 time to prepare meals and habituate their offsprings. The second cause that might be noted, in my view, is advertisement that encourages children to pay for harmful enjoyment and become addicted to it. The explanation lies in the fact that currently advertisements are everywhere, including movies, series and social media.",
        "The first cause mentioned above has led to increase in the quantity of people who struggle with this problem. That all provoked by obtaining money from parents and paying for convenience food and contributed to even more spread of fast food restaurants. Another problem that follows is that advertising of eating disorders stimulates children to eat more. One of the consequences of this is waste of money on things that slowly decreases longevity.",
        "Having weighed everything mentioned up, we can come to a conclusion that guardians should pay more attention to children\u2019s nutrition. So it would not be surprising to see some reduction of fit people in the near future. In other words, aggregate spread of imposed advertisement might happen and we should be ready to bear all the repercussions of that."
