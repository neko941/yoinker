        "Global warming and rise in sea water are the main problems of the countries.Some think that the best solution to the issues is that people living in today's world should sacrifice their comfort for the benefit of young generation  in the future. I clearly admit that life style changes are necessary but this does not mean that current generation has to sacrifice their comforts.The lifestyle changes may be beneficial to present generation as well as future generation.",
        "The lifestyle changes may not be burdensome.current generation should practice or follow the laws made by the local authorities. For example government implement the banning of plastic.Many people today have resorted to use paper bags or cloth bag, when they go to supermarket and even shop owners are doing this practice.This rules has not decrease the quality of lifestyles of current generation in any manner.Another guideline from government is planting trees .Many young generation of today initiated the planting of trees in the roadsides or even in the mountains. Trees help purifying the air, which is beneficial for the environment.It improves air quality and the current generation can breath fresh air.",
        "Local government has also asked people to reduce the use of energy such as practicing to turn-off the lights when not in use and unplug the sockets after use, because some appliances are still consuming electricity even after use.This can save us money as well.Having own car is a symbol of lifestyles but we should restrict it for using, instead we can use public transporation, by doing this we help environment emitting greenhouse gases into atmosphere which causes global warming.",
        "The current generation can practice this rules but it does not cause any discomfort in any manner.",
        "In my opinion, it is true that today's generation has to make lifestyle changes to lessen environmental problem, however i truly disagree that these changes would decrease the comfort level of the current generation. They  are creating a better world for future generation without making any compromise on their comfort."
