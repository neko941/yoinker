        "Nowadays, alot of individuals are at liberty of choosing where to Labour and reside due to advancements in telecommunication and transportation. Although this will cause further segregation amongst people as well as hikes in prices of goods and services, they will also improve people's access to social services and also propel trading and prompt task achievements. In my opinion, many people are better off with improved communication technology and transference than without it.",
        "One of the greatest benefits is that people's lives will be improved significantly with upgraded communication technology and transportation. They will be able to access better medical care, housing and security services irrespective of their location as they are one click of a phone button away. I could vividly recall in one of my pilgrimage to Isreal, a tourist being airlifted to Jerusalem Emergency Hospital from Reed Sea  after her water broke, which wouldn't have been possible without video communications between hospital personnel and medics on ground and helicopter transport. Futhermore, the aim of prompt delivery of this tourist to the hospital on time for proper management was achieved regardless of the distance between the two locations. Also, commerce has been boosted with advents of automated speed trains and commercial aeroplanes that convey large number of people to their destination on time.",
        "However, this comes with its drawbacks. People will be further set apart as only the rich can be able to afford most this high-end services, therefore, further widening the gap between the already rich and poor people as well as the developed and poorly developed locations. Moreso, the costs of maintaining this advanced transportation and communications resources are expensive which result hikes in prices as this fees are incorporated in prices of services rendered. For example, the cost of clearing a single vehicle from the Nigeria  Wharf, skyrocketed from N200,000 (in 2015) to N500,000 (in 2016) as automated frieghtage systems were introduced at the end of 2015. This resulted to drop in revenue for the Nigerian Port Authorities.",
        "In conclusion, many people are spoilt for choice on where to reside or work as a result of advanced technology and haulage. That people are able to trade efficiently and get their tasks achieved on time as well as have access to improved social services surpasses  the disadvantages that comes with advancements in telecommunication and conveyance."
