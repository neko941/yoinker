        "Insomnia is becoming a problem especially for big city residents. The number of people who experience lack of sleep is increasing in many countries all over the world. This essay will explain some reasons of that problem and possible impacts toward people who experience it themselves and to others.",
        "First question, why people, especially workers, sleep less? First, it is because those executives meet the work deadlines every single day. For instance, a manager who has just arrived to London after taking twelve hours of flight from Jakarta has to prepare a presentation to meet his client in the next morning. If it happens almost every week, it will ruin his sleeping schedule. Second, they have to deal with their family by the time they get back home. For example, a working mom has to look after her baby after working so she will not feel as if she is a bad mom. Thus, those obligations make people feel nervous and hardly go directly to sleep even after they have finished their work at the office.",
        "Next, what kind of negative impacts can happen to people who experience it and to society around those people? There are several unpleasant things can happen. First, in an individual scale, in can cause a serious health effect, namely severe insomnia. Uncertain sleeping schedule can ruin our biological clock and it can cause hormonal change in the long run. Second, that person can be so annoying to his or her colleagues because he or her hardly focus on the work. This can cause a really bad relationship amongst beloved family members and co-workers. I am certain that there is nobody who like to see a grumpy person all day long.",
        "To conclude, I believe people experience insomnia mainly because of the work deadlines. Hence, it cause so many drawbacks in a personal level and moreover in a working level."
