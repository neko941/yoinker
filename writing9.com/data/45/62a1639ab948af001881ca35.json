        "The diagram illustrates how electricity is produced using a system called Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion(OTEC)",
        "Overall, the system's purpose is to convert salty water into drinkable liquid. The water enters the system from two tubes, located on different levels. The work of the OTEC is based on the green energy coming from the sun.",
        "In the first step, the water is provided using the top and down tubes. The former is located on the surface level of the ocean, while the latter is located at about 500 meters in depth. The water from the first tube is poured into the container which has  multiple exits, at the top and the bottom. As the water is heated by the sun, it evaporates through the top exit and rotates the turbine which is situated in that pipe. The movement of the turbine creates electricity. Then the vapour continues motion and goes to the lower container where it is condensed and turned into pure water. To force the vapour to condense, there is a tube around the second tank. The liquid in it is supplied by the second exit of the first container and the lower pipe coming from the ocean. Finally, the waste salt water is output."
