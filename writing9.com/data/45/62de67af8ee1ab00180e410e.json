        "A highly controversial of whether people should face with an unpleasant reality, such as a bad occupation and lack of money or manage to improve it. I will examine both point of views and then give my own opinion.",
        "People argued that it is best to accept bad things. This is because they believe that if they try to do nothing but face with hurtful situation, they will pass it and continue existing. As a matter of fact, when someone meets bad situations, they rarely deal with it but hide from it in order to not to have any other problems and maybe to live peacefuly. For instance, many people find that it better to live although having no job or lack of assets.",
        "On the other hand, it is believed that we should try and deal with such problems. There is a reason why people believe this when the problems solved, everyone can spend their quality of lifetime. They witness situations everyday. But when they try to improve them, they are not only stronger at both physical health and mental health but also accquire proper experiences and skills. Nevertheless, after they tackle all of the problems, they will live in peace and happy. A good illustration of this is people who try to rise up are usually happier than those who want to hide from them.",
        "In summarize, i believe both of the statements have merits. On balance, i believe that people should try to make their life worth-living by meeting obstacles and get through them. What is life without challenges?"
