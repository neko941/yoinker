        "Across the ,globe technology is booming at a faster rate and it is always believed that new inventory produces a positive result. A section of society is of the opinion that technology plays a significant role in the food industry by showing  inclement in the rate of food production.However , others oppose this situation and strongly offend technology's role in food productivity , This issue  always remained controversial , but I will going to examine both views and discuss my views in the upcoming paragraphs .",
        "On the one side of the argument  , some people believe that the benefits of technology in food production outweigh its associated disadvantages may be because of the food processing or preservation activities as it  can increase the shelf life or quality of food . It is strongly believed that because of vinegar preservation , onions can be preserved for more than two years . In addition to this , It is possible to say with the advent of machines in agriculture ,  drives down the costs of keeping the food fresh and ensures productivity . Although , Robot machines usually cut down the risk of human injuries . For instance , a European company start using a robotic machine to cut  meat as it prevents serious injuries to their employees."
