Anyone has the plethora of friends in own native place and being able to receive their assistance whenever in troublesome situatio. In my own experience , our neighbours gave their fullest support by giving subsides and all medical aids, once I became corona infected. ,Secondly when someone is used to a particular environment , such as in hometown, feel more comfortable in every aspect of life. For instance, people residing in the tropical zone, find it more difficult to live in either close to the north pole or south pole. Living in the same nature , an individual feels more convenient and is able to reside more efficiently.",
        "On contrarily living in native place, urge a person to think in a narrow-minded way and lead convention d life without individual progress. For ,instance when I was in my own village, I don\u2019t get many job opportunities. After going to the urban areas, I  received diversified jobs with different categories of remuneration .Moreover,it discourages expanding of technologies and new knowledge if all lives in their hometown ,in Sri Lanka, It has become mandatory for government teachers to render their services in rural schools for at least five years as nobody likes to occupy in superb area.",
        "In my point of view depending on the situation involves, one should decide where to live, irrespective of whether it is his hometown or not."
