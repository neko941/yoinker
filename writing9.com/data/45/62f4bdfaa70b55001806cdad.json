        "Nowadays,Some communities believe that virtual classes are better than live practical classes while others argue about this matter. In this essay, I will discuss both scenarios and then I will give my opinion on the given statement.",
        "On the one side, There are some pupils who think that it is admirable and necessary to provide classes in virtual mode due to this pandemic situation. And it will good opportunity for pupils in different age groups to learn from their own place. For instance, In this modern era, most applications are developed to provide online classes like cooking sessions, dance classes, etc. This will help people who are interested in learning new things.",
        "On the other side, Some communities support offline classes rather than online because they think that, they will give practical knowledge on the subject. For example, In virtual classes, some lazy people neglect their classes even if they are present in online classes meanwhile in offline mode, It is important to pay attention to the teacher while teaching.",
        "In my view, I think both sides have their own benefits and drawbacks. But I prefer Online classes because they are more effective and satisfactory, and their befits overweigh the decline."
