        "It is true that these days articles related to various difficulties and emergencies are relatively prevalent. Although in certain contexts this trend can be positive, by and large, I would argue that its efffects are more significant.",
        "On the one hand, the concentration on troubles and urgent issues can bring some enormous benefits for the public. If the resident are exposed to negative reports, they will able to raise their awareness of social problem, and thereby preventing themselves from criminalities. Women, for example, are less likely to walk late at night on badly lit streets to avoid thief or roberry. Second, thanks to its widespreadness, it will draw the goverment's attention to put forward some practical sollutions to pressing concern in order to minimize pity consequences.",
        "On the other hand, overwhelming coverage of bad news on the media do more harm than good. On an individuals level, people are likely to become unnecessarily pessimistic leading to the loss of the sense of security and then lose faith in others. Moreover,  it will encourage journalists to exaggerate information to create sensational contents with a view to graping reader's attention. As a result, we can distinguish between the real and fake news.",
        "In conclusion, it is true that the reports of media and emergencies have received a widespead media coverage. Although this tendency may be considered advantageous in some ways, it also have greater impact on the feeling of anxiety and uncomfort as well as the journalist's conduct."
