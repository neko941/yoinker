        "Scientific developments has improved the life of the people. Some people believe that it created a big gap between wealthy people and poor people While some believe that it reduced the gap. Let us discuss about both the views.",
        "The variety of technolgy available to people has increased tremendously.  Starting with the mobile phones, there exists a huge variety and different brands. Each has its own features and the price of the mobile phone varies on the quality of the technology and the number of features it offers. Though all the mobiles have most of the common features, but the quality of the high end phones cannot be matched with the low cost phones. However, Poor people might not be able to afford this high end phones.",
        "On the other hand, Scientific improvements paved the way for free calls. Earlier, people used to pay for the incoming calls. Nowadays, the cost of the internet pack is minimal, where it comes with free incoming and outgoing calls which brings the large number of poor people to use mobile phones. Additionally, low cost cars have become possible because of the latest technology. This encourages the people with low income to buy cars. Likewise, Companies are coming up with low cost products to increase their market among middle class people.",
        "To conclude, a wide variety in techonolgy has definitely contributed in bridging the gap between the rich and the poor, but the quality of the technology that reaches poor should be improved."
