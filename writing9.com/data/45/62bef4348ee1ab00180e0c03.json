        "In the past few years, many youngsters are inclined towards studying online rather than attending physical class in colleges. There are several reason why youth tend to follow this trend .  In this essay, we will discuss both views and give our opinion.",
        "There are two primary reason why studying online is more convenient rather than attending campus as it saves time and as well as money. Students do not have to travel in order to attend the lecture or tutorial. For example, pupil,can simply log in to their universities website to study.  Secondly students can be record voice or video while studying and they can watch it later at their own pace for better understanding.",
        "On the other hand, however there are many essential benefit  in campus education that cannot get from from e-studies. Unlike self-studies, students can get hands-on experiences on particular  subject such as chemistry  it is important to do lab exercise to gain more knowledge which would help them to understand how chemical used and react in different conditions. Another benefit is, studying on campus allows collaboration with other pupils which would not be possible to do online. It is irrefutable that  a student should not only learn course materials but also learn how to be a team player as well. Since universities education includes project work as should be completed as a team, it helps to improve team player skills. Therefore, studying on campus is more efficient as it provides more benefit to the youth.",
        "To sumup, by considering the aforementioned points, I believe that campus learning is more benefit to the students which cannot obtained when studying alone."
