        "The image provides information about the changes that were made to distribution in a Museum between 1998 and 2008.",
        "Overall, many changes took place, one of them and maybe by far the most important was the addition of a restaurant in the northwest building and the relocation of certain rooms.",
        "In 1998, visitors could find a garden in the structure center. The permanent exhibition rooms were located east and west of it, separated by a cafe in the north of the building. The Entrance/Exit and ticket sales were south of the property. The temporary Exhibition room was on the left, while the shop, WC, and the place for Bags and coats were on the right.",
        "In 2008 many changes could be seen, the east permanent exhibition room was enlarged, and although the west exhibition room disappeared, this space was reused to open a Museum restaurant and relocate the temporary exhibition room. The shop and the Bags and coats were moved from the southeast to the southwest corner. However, the cafe reduced its size, which changed the open space to move the WC next to it. The tickets maintain their location. Regardless, the garden had some modifications, including new fountains and a new Caf\u00e9 sitting \u00e1rea in the northwest corner."
