        "The downtown areas of metropolises around the world have become centers for office buildings and companies. It has been recommended that these offices and industries should be relocated form urban centers to the suburban outskirts. In my opinion, aside from the few shortcomings, this relocation will reap great results in the form of decreased traffic and possibility of building public entertainment facilities.",
        "The one disadvantage that people may face due to the relocation of office buildings and industries is the loss of easy access. The employees and visitors alike, need to visit the companies located in the center of the cities. Moving them to the vacant areas outside of the city would mean more travelling and fuel consumption.",
        "There are a number of advantages that can availed by moving companies outside of the city. Firstly, the presence of industries in the centers of cities becomes a reason for traffic congestion. As there are a number of industries in the city centers, people travel to them every day. This results in increased traffic in the downtown areas which can be reduced by relocating the companies. Secondly, the buildings and lands vacated by the companies can be utilized to build entertainment facilities. If industries are relocated, their lands and buildings can be used to construct malls and parks for people.",
        "In conclusion, I believe that although the commute to offices and companies may increase after relocation, the benefits will far outweigh the shortcomings. People will be able to salvage their time spent in traffic jams and could also have beautiful parks and malls in the center of the cities."
