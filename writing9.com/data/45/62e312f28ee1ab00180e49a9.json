        "In my country, the aesthetic of people are changing. Taiwan has a lot of old buildings, and some people felt that should be knocked down, because was not good at looking. In my way, I hope the old building can keep it well, because the building all about our history of our country. In the paragraphs below, I will tell the reasons why I do not agree with the case.",
        "Firstly, I think the old fashion buildings are represent for the history of people who lived in the pass; in addition, the building also can bring the memories to think about the happy time of our childhood. For instance, my mother is a nostalgic person, moreover she always told me she want to buy an old house as the house she was lived.",
        "Secondly, the buildings also can fascinated the foreign people who were traveling here, because the style is totally different with their buildings. Beside, the modern one is looks more fashion than old one, but if we knocked down the old buildings to make modern buildings, that would be not special to me. For example, if you got a present everyday and nothing change, then you would be feel really uninterested after few days.",
        "In the sum up, personally, I like to stay in really traditional buildings, because that can make me feel myself living in the history live. As I mentioned earlier, I like the feeling the old buildings bring to me, so I disagree with knocked down and give way to modern buildings."
