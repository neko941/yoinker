        "Choosing friends with same opinions is preferred by few people, whereas some believe, friends with different mindsets is better. Some rightly said that it is good to have one real friend than thousands of fair weather friends. Therefore, we should choose our friends wisely. According to me, friends with different thought process is always better.",
        "To begin with, it is said that birds of same feather flock together. Usually people with common points of views have a good understanding and bonding among them. There are hardly any situations where they have any arguments. These relationships usually last long and are very strong.",
        "On the other hand, sometimes having a disagreement among friends is good. Difference of opinions is necessary to showcase a other perspectives of situations. Few best decisions are made only after brainstorming various view points. One should be both sides of coin before reaching to a conclusion. It is always helpful if friends guides you correctly instead of being diplomatic. For example, if a smoker has all his friends who smoke, will not be getting an advice from anyone to get rid of this habit due to harmful consequences of it.",
        "In conclusion, I personally believe that a person should have both kind of friends. Like-minded friends offer an amazing company while those who differ can offer a better perspective. Opposite poles attract each other and if two people with different thought process are good friends, they can mostly help in overcoming flaws of each other."
