        "Nowadays, museums are the only places to know in depth of our heritage and ancestral daily routines. As there is no other better option to know or watching the great creation of our past. In my opinion, I believe it is spending small amount to know our history. As it will reduce burden of maintaining museums on governments. While other museums where there is no charges to visit, it is not that well maintained or a paid guide",
        "Museums are very costly to maintain, as there are many things to keep safe and they are very precious. There are various things in the museums to look after and maintain without losing the originality. One good example is Museum in the state of Hyderabad India, which consist of the Great Nizam\u2019s complete empire clothing\u2019s and the huge military armors with various kinds of weapons which were used on that time, are maintained by the government of Hyderabad state. By charging small amount from the visitors create a seriousness and the importance of the museums into the visitors mind.",
        "On the other hand, Free museums are not well maintained and not are not in a proper standards. As there is a need to look after and proper maintains of our history. By not charging money from the visitors it is very difficult to bear cost to look after the whole museum. Such as, Shiviji museum is free of charge but the museum is not well organized and there is no one to give the in depth information about the special events of that time.",
        "To conclude, for the best experience paid museums are better in many ways. As they are well maintained and organized. While, free museums will not do that much impact on the person\u2019s mind as  they are not that much well look after. Though there are draw backs of charging but advantages are more for paid museums."
