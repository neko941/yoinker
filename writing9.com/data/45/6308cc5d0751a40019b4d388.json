        "Althought many would argue that having dress code is not vital as it will not improve their achademic score and it will kill their indivulality in the schools , some are opposing it because this will have similarity amgust the students.  It will kill the socio dis-similarity in the school. In my opinion Dress code is a vital part of school. This essay will discuss the importance of both the view.",
        "On the one hand, there are some people who dost not want to have dress in the school. As per them it kills one's indivisuality, there choise of carring their own style. It stops them to show there class and choice of outfits. For instance, a student is Mordern Brand concious  dude, bur he is not getting chance to wear all that he or she wants. However i concur school is not the place where you will show your class or ypour standard, this is the place where all the students are equal to the teacher.",
        "On the other hand having dress code is something which will not humiliate those who can not afford Branded attire. Uniform means dressing equally, so that no body feels any diffrence and focus on their study. It breaks the social barriers too. In some families students are allowed to wear short clothes but some families are very strict on their social values. So they wont be allowing to it, but school is the place where each student wear same uniform so that no body can assume or have any opinion about your class.",
        "In my opinion having Dress code is a vital part of the studies, it teaches us to behave equally with others and not being partinal to anyone. It helps students to focus on their studies rather than clothes."
