        "Most people think that teacher should teach children to be a good person, while other people think that it is a responsibility of their parents. This essay agrees with the belief that a role of parents instructs their children beceuse they know their children the most and they have more time together.",
        "Parents can understand what types of teaching that suitable to teaching their children, because they was grown thier children since was born. They know what thing that children like or dislike, some children prefer to copying from role model, it is their parent, whereas some children prefer to learn from the story that thier parent tell. For example, my sister likes Aultraman, it is a character in Japaness anime, so when my parents want to teach her they will tell the story about Aultraman and adding information about good behavior in the story, such as Aultreaman is honest so he is super hero.",
        "Teacher have a lot of time with children in school, they also teach them about manner of society. But, the most time that children are spend over a year is living with their parents more than study with teacher. For instance, in Thailand, children spend about 200 hours per year in school for learning, while they spend time with their parents over 300 hours per year.",
        "In conclusion, parents should teach the children more than teacher because they know about their children and besides they have time to teach them to be a nice person."
