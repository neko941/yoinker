        "In today's society, public opinion about the birthing problem has changed and the modern generation in this volatile social conditions tends to postpone their first childbirth. Personally, I believe that under the circumstance increasing pregnancy age has positive effects over family and society condition and status quo also accept this trend.",
        "The fact that giving birth at later stages of life has been more common stemming from running business and job promotion and regarding the difficult situation to earn livelihood many couple precautions to avoid pregnancy. Driving force of this approach caused by escalating expenditure that impel couple both men and women working full-time. On the whole, this tendency has long been a common thing because people want to be financially stable and strong enough to properly take charge of the new responsibility.",
        "Furthermore, getting married late has positive effect on family commitment as a result of being couples mature. Although, the parents structure the community of aging population their age and experience provide a suitable cultural infrastructure that results in offspring have a good upbringing. Even get married over 30s can due to the fact that adults achieve in their activities including good quality education and comprehensive education and in terms of wisdom can cope with problems more logically and in a nutshell will bring a close-knit family that it never break down at ease.",
        "In conclusion, the consequences of having a settle married life and birthing problem stems from how parents attain a changeless life and this dire need for provoking great upheaval in the intellectual evolution and stable income and these are not possible unless get married in about middle-age. The thing is we need to a settle life and its required is be more mature in all fields."
