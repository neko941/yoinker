        "The given table demonstrates the data on the sources of income of the police and two pie charts depict how the money was spent on different purposes by the police in particular areas of Britain in the years 2017 and 2018.",
        "Overall, it is evident that the total income was increased due to the up wording trend of the income from the sources. However, the major expenditure was salaries for officers and staff in both years.",
        "According to the table, the national government gave the highest amount of money to the police in both given years, which slightly increased from \u00a3 175.5m to \u00a3177.8m from 2017 to 2018. This is followed by the local taxes, which significantly rose their contribution to the police income from \u00a391.2m to \u00a3 102.3m in 2017 and 2018 respectively. In contrast, other sources, such as grants grew slightly from \u00a338m to \u00a338.5m within a given period.",
        "In terms of expenses, salaries for officers and staff made up exactly a quarter of the total expenditure in 2017, which dropped by 6% in 2018 to 69% of the total. Money spent on technology nearly doubled from 8% to 14% from 2017 to 2018, whereas the cost of building and transport remained constant at 17% in both given years."
