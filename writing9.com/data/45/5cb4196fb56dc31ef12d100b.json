        "Due to severe changes in our lifestyle as a result of modernization, we are now facing mixed results of the same.It is often argued by some people that as obesity has now become a issue of concern, hike in prices of food containing high fat content will resolve the problem.I strongly agree with this idealogy since it will help in reducing food consumption of such type of dishes.",
        "Firstly, due to change in eating habits of people especially young ones,liking for cuisines containing cheese content or highly saturated foods has increased now a days.People prefer to have fried foods from store as it provides them contentment in comparison to home made food.These highy saturated foods gradually deteriorates your health as they dont have any nutritional value.Also, it leads to health problems like heart diseases, stomach issues and the most common obesity, which further leads you to become victim of many diseases.",
        "So if government institutions impose heavy taxes on such products, it will definitely help in refraining people from consuming it frequently, as due to increased prices it will hamper their monthly budget.For example, Children will now prefer to eat at their residing places rather than going out at food outlets ,due to financial constraints.",
        "To conclude with, rise in prices of highly saturated food items will lead to healthy society.As it is rightly said, healthy food leads to healthy mind."
