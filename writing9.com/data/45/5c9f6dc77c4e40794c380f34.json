        "Having been through a great number of reforms, education systems all over the world witnessed high advancements. In some countries, people tend to spend more and more time concentrating on practical skills teaching rather than the theory-based one as conventional. To a certain extent, this alteration bears a considerable number of benefits.",
        "One positive aspect of practical knowledge is that it provides students with an ideal environment for bettering their learning process. It is an indisputable fact that the more we practice, the better we remember.With the aid of  practical skills teaching, students seize the chances to expose to a wide range of knowledge in reality rather than to be rigidly approach to abstract one that requires great efforts to remember.",
        "The kind of practical skills may be of great benefit in energizing students during classes. When taking theoretical lessons, a majority of students assert that they have to take in a huge amount of knowledge, which is widely believed to do more harm to their learning ability and hamper their creativity flow. They also easily get distraction from the lessons and in most circumstances, they are susceptible to the sleep. In contrast, while taking practical lessons, all their attentions are paid to teachers\u2019 demonstration. They can truly experience what they once supposed to be only in theory. Therefore, boredom is dragged away and replaced with enthusiasm and fascination during the class.",
        "Such practical trainings  may be beneficial later on their life because students are familiarized with tools, equipments and techniques that they are prone to apply in their future career. A good example to illustrate the advantage of the more-practical education is when attending Chemistry classes. Students in hypothesis-based class will never able to vividly make out the reactions among chemicals. However, those in practical education are provided great opportunities to get in touch with actual devices and also to carry out the experiments to observe the chemical reactions. By the same token, students from practical classes adapt to the working environment quicker than the others.",
        "At the same time, it is undeniable that theoretical knowledge also play an essential role. Theory lays a strong foundation, which is also known as basic knowledge, for the application of practical class could be taken place. Therefore, practical education cannot develop without the aid of theory one.",
        "In conclusion, the advantages of practice-based education outweigh its disadvantages. Honestly speaking, it should be put into application  in more educational systems in the world in association with the theory skills."
