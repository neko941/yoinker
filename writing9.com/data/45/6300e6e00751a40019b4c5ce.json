        "Many criminals continue doing criminal activities just after releasing from jail. Although this phenomenon is attributed to a number of causative factors, effective policies can be adopted to remedy the situation.",
        "There are several reasons for offenders to commit rimes again. Firstly, one of the main reasons is unemployment. As people are not willing to employ or work with individuals with criminal background, those who released from prison have not much job opportunities. Being unemployment or working with low salaries make such people to commit crimes to make leaving. To tackle this problem, governments can not only teach prisoners some skills to help them find a proper job. But also can provide them some employment chances related to skills they have learned in jail.",
        "Secondly, being prisoned can not be deterrent while the main reasons of committing crime such as poverty, unemployment and mental problems remain unchanged. As a result of this constant difficult situation, those released from prison tend to continue doing criminal activities. As a solution, societies should find the conditions that result in committing crimes by a period of consultation done by experts for offenders. Then they are able to solve the main reasons of criminal activities in society.",
        "To conclude, spending a period of time in jail can not prevent prisoners from committing crime because of many reasons such as societies\u2019 situation and unemployment. To tackle this statement, societies and governments should provide a condition in which the main reasons of criminal activities being solve and some job opportunities being created for people with criminal background."
