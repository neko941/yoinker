        "Building's structures and appearences have long been regarded important in the cultural landscape of many cities. In some countries, there are strict rules in regards to the way houses are constracted while in others there are none. Despite the many disadvantages that are often associated with increased building regulation, I believe these regulation are important in maintaining the city's culture and beauty.",
        "Regulating the way office buildings are constructed may have several negetive aspects. First, forcing the architects to a specific building pattern may cause functional problems which can have a direct effect on the property. As an example example, a local rule which states that entering the private parking space can be achieved through a side street rather than the main road may lead to serious traffic jams. Second, several desicions may lead to a substantial increase in the property value. In Jerusalem, for example, all houses should be build using a specific stone leading to a massive increase in the realestate costs. Last, increased regulation may effect the artistic freedome of the designers which can have a negetive offect on the cities beauty and diversity.",
        "In contrast to the above mentioned, I believe the advantages of housing regulations outweigh its disadvantages. Initially, I strongly believe that a municipal should maintain its cultural history. A recent report from the New York University has shown that an architectural consistency is one of the most important aspects in the citie's beauty and have a direct effect on the liveliness of the people who live within it. Also, maintaining a specific landscape of a town by preventing buildings to be above a certain height effects the social interactions of the persons within it. People who live in sky scrapers, for example, tend to socialize less then people who live in two store buildings. Lastly, every city has its own beauty which was kept for many centuries and in my opinion, should be looked after.",
        "In cunclusion, Althugh regulation may have a social and financial consequences, I still believe they should exist as they protect our cities."
