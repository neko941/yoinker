        "Nowadays, there are increasing number of visitors in areas with unfavourable weather for example, the Sahara desert or the Antarctic. I agree with this statement and the reason is not far-fetched.  One major explanation for this is due to the fact that individuals, scientists and explorers have become more curious about the various effects of global warming across the globe. Thus, visiting such places may provide insights into further study that can help to combat this challenge. For example, it becomes quite easy to find archeologists going to such places to understand the unique entities that live there, likewise geologist often visit such places for mining and exploration activities.",
        "For the curious individual who simply wants to take a break from the busy world, going to such places will help to appreciate the differences and uniqueness of our worlds, while also noting the similarities that exist across borders. I also look forward to taking a vacation in the desert someday, because I believe it will help to boost my survival instincts.",
        "However, due to the extreme weather in such areas, it poses a health risk to individuals who are not used to such localities. They may be inadequately prepared or not properly equipped to live in such areas because it is not something they are very used to. In addition, the cost of travelling to these regions are very high and it implies that the local currency is being invested outside the economy.",
        "In conclusion, going to these locations will help to answer many meterological questions which mainly are the effects of the changing athmospheric situations on the different species of animals that exist and ultimately on mankind."
