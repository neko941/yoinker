        "Dependency on food produced by other countries is becoming increasingly popular. It is considered by many that nations should locally cultivate food for the citizens to consume and purchase few food items. From my viewpoint, this idea is acceptable as it generates employment opportunities as well as saves nation\u2019s wealth.",
        "The people who support the view that countries should produce eatable items within the country and object importing argue that there are significant disadvantagesuch as it may not be possible to manufacture everything due to lack of techniques, skilled labour and weather conditions. However ,from my viewpoint, it clearly has merits like, it will create ample job vacancies and save money.",
        "To begin with, producing food in the country will open doors to implement manufacturing units , thereby creating job opportunities for the citizens. This means that country will progress and government can provide world class infrastructure, health care and education to public.  For Instance, the Prime minister of India , Shri Narendra Modi, has urged people to grow items locally such as grains, vegetables and fruits under the Make in India campaign.",
        "Secondly, less  imports will help to save foreign exchange. Due to this, the monetary ranking will increase in the world and the country won\u2019t depend on other developed nations for financial aid in case of crisis. Also , if the food requirement is supported inhouse, it will not only be affordable but also the quality of the product will be maintained such that the common man can consume it.",
        "To recapitulate, despite people having various beliefs the demerits of producing food within the country and fewer imports , in my opinion, I agree , that is more advantageous  as it gives work scope to people and saves currency."
