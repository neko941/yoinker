        "In contemporary times, more and more people change their position of employments frequently as a result of unfavourable working conditions. Consequently, this development has led to destruction of work processes. Fortunately, it can be alleviated by creation of favourable working conditions by employers.",
        "To begin with, persisent resigning from work has brought about delay in task completion. This is due to the fact that, bosses have to constantly pause the job processes to find skilled persons to replace employees that resigned. More often that not, with the employment of new staff member, projects are often started all over as the, old and new workers have different modes of working. For instance, Piggyvest founder stated in an interview that, their application creation process took three years as their Fullstack Engineeer left half way of building, thereby resulting to employing a new developer that started the task all over. Similarly, leaving jobs regularly tend to have a negative effect on an indivduals. As, recruiters are less willingly to employ a person whose curriculum vitae shows they leave employment easily inrespective of reason.",
        "However, to drastically reduce  the amount of time personnels leave a job, there is a need for management to provide a great working conditions for members of their staff. This could include favourable salaries, flexible working hours, and a peaceful office environment. It is no news that nurses in Nigeria are constantly leaving hospitals they work in search for better pay. In the same vein, employers and employer should also sign contracts that favour both parties. This agreements should limit employees from being able to resign without plausible cause.",
        "In conclusion, in recent times, more often than not individuals tend to change job easily. This persistent action as led to negative consequences for jobseekers as recruiters are reluctant in hiring them. Thankfully, I believe creating good employment conditions can exponentially reduce the recurring resignation of members of the labourforce."
