        "Effective communication is said to be complete when all parties have a clear understanding of what is being said. Residing in a nation where the lingual franca differs from one's native language can lead to various issues. I agree with this assertion because this could lead to misunderstandings between people and there would be bias in offering jobs to such individuals.",
        "Firstly, this could put a strain in communication, which would inadvertently lead to misunderstandings among individuals. The foreigner will always have a feeling of being insulted or talked about when in midst of the natives, this would lead seclusion and will impact negatively on socialisation with others. For instance, an immigrant would always feel left out in conversations at all times when in the company of other citizens.",
        "Secondly, employers would make preference to those who are indigenes and can communicate effectively with the local language irrespective of the qualifications and skills. This is seen mostly in jobs that are customer oriented, where there is a need for constant communication with clients. For example, a doctor needs to understand the language of her patient so as to ensure the appropriate treatment is rendered. Such job opportunity would be granted to a native who can communicate effectively with the patient.",
        "In conclusion, I firmly agree that immigrants are poised with various challenges arising from language barrier, ranging from relating with other inhabitants and been considered fairly when applying for a job."
