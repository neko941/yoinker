        "What is the charm of learning in schools, if you can attend exceptional courses outside the school? That is the vexed question of people nowadays. I, on the other hand, put the weight in the favor of studying skills outside the academy. In this essay, I will discuss my opinion to reach a viable conclusion.",
        "First and foremost, it is a concern that if you want to excel in your life with success, then you must train yourself hard, to cope up the challenges. Therefore, presently, numerous institutions are established, which can help a pupil scale up the skill, in their field of interest, apart from the school education. To demonstrate, one can easily distinguish the problem solving skill of a person who is coached outside the school, is far better than the one, who is not.",
        "Furthermore, specialized coaching also brightens up the chances of acquiring a white collar job. For Instance, If you've experience with an in-demand skill, prospects for you to attain a promising job will surge. As a rule of thumb, it has been observed that enterprises always prefer candidates who have acquired hands-on experience in the skill, they have advertised.",
        "In contrast, looking at the other side of the coin, it is evident that teaching of the school is also undeniably essential for the children's brain development, in their formative years. For example, primary education incorporates basic moral values and provides significant growth to a child's character, thus, also helps them in social interactions, in later stages.",
        "To recapitulate, although, primary training in the schools is of utmost importance for a students' mental growth both pragmatically and socially. However, I still believe that studying after the school, will improvise a pupil's skill level."
