        "Recently, school leavers have a dilemma of moving to the next chapter of their lives. Some students prefer to further their studies by attending to university while others prefer to work immediately after graduating from school. Let us look into the pro and cons of these options as it is a crucial life decision for them.",
        "Apparently, most teenagers opt to attend colleges to get professional certificate as it is one of the main requirements for highly professional occupations such as doctor, engineer and nurses. They will learn all the skills, theories and technique they need to acquire in order to obtain the career path of their preferences. Furthermore, they gain maturity to handle a difficult situation in the future. Although, enrolling educational institution may cost a fortune and challenging at the same time, but it is rewarding.",
        "Meanwhile, some young adults venture working lifestyle right away after finishing school to gain working experiences and money. The advantages of working young saves some money and gain skills. Moreover, they could venture further new path in business and potentially land in a multimillionaire job. Despite of that, it may limit the choice of career as they do not have certificates and some employers may trick them by giving a low salary for their immaturity.",
        "In my view, further higher education enables a person for better job prospect and higher living standard globally."
