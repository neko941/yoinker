        "There are lots of advantages of exercising professional. The first advantage is  being famous. When an athlete plays professionally and becomes a professional athlete, he or she will start to play in national champions. She or he will start to play in national champions. thus, she will be shown on tv. As a result, he or she was seen by people and everybody will know him.

        "Although being a professional athlete has lots of benefits, it has some disadvantages too. The first one is that athletes have to hard practice every day for many years. For example, professional football players have to spend 5 hours a day  running and 2 hours on bodybuilding and they have to play football when they are 16 years old. The second disadvantages are hard to diet. Professional athletes have to eat special food because hard practices need food with lots of calories and protein. For example, professional football players have to eat 2 potatoes with 5 eggs every day. So, they cannot eat every food.",
