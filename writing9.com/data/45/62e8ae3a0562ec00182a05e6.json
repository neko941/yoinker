I did press this point with your staff as it was imperative that my party remain in each other\u2019s company, but we were told that it was simply impossible to seat us all together.",
        "In addition to this, several menu items were unavailable on the night, including every vegetarian option, meaning that three members of my party were left to eat only bread throughout the meal. As a result of these incidents, I had intended not to pay, but your staff informed us that they would call the police if we refused, and so to avoid further embarrassment, I complied.",
        "This experience was entirely unacceptable, and I would like to request a full refund of the amount paid. I would also suggest that your staff not promise customers degrees of service that they are unable to provide in order to avoid disappointing experiences such as these.",
