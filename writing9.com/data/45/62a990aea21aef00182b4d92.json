        "Unfortunately, the environment plays a very crucial role in everyone's life owing to this, several individuals reckon that factories and travellers ought to consume the cost of cleaning up environmental pollution rather than the authorities.In this essay, I partially agree with this notion and articulate my valid points in the upcoming paragraphs.",
        "To embark with, There are innumerable factors behind this rubric ,which cannot be averted. The cardinal point considered to be that while industrialisation is the main culprit of contamination of nature atmosphere by through discharge toxic gases and chemicals into the environment .Not only this but , these factors also throw the waste materials into the river , which is not only harmful to humans but also for marine life so,  it would be faired that factories should pay the amount to detoxify the environment To examplify , according to Oxford University state that in india, all industrialisation sector pay the tax amount to government for cleaning the environment As a result, nation atmosphere is eco-friendly and productive.",
        "Nevertheless, despite  factories, government should also pay the financial money to purify the nature because both these industries and tourism are helpful to accelerate economic growth of nation owing to this, government should have utilised the funds to environment protection. For instance, according  to a recent survey by BBC news manifested that in Japan, the regime has made a separate budget to cleaning the environment and surroundings.",
        "In recapitulation, I would tend to reiterate that although, government are not only accountable for cleaning the environment by paying funds, industries and tourism sectors also gave their collaboration to save the environment."
