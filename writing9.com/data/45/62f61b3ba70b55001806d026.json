        "Some people believe that medical doctors should do both jobs at the same time, the physician and the scientist.  As a doctor i understand that the doctor play the most important  role in treating the patient with the tools and the methods developed by the scientist. Both physician and researcher must keep in mind that their work is for serving people and it need them expended their time and effort for it. In some way, it is very difficult for a person can play both roles completely.",
        "Doctor's life is sometime boring. Some time, we do the same routines everyday, seeing patient, prescribing medications, indicating some tests. In contrast, scientist's life is seeing new things day by day. Scientists invent new drugs, find new mechanisms of diseases, new methods for treatment. They help the physicians to do their job with updated knowledge. It would be greater thing that doctors and researchers working together. It would be the greatest if a physician can be a scientist at the same time. There are many benefit of bleding practical medicine with academic research. The physician - scientists are well-equipped to see through flashy advertisment about new drug or new medical device and find out the true value and give true advices to the patient.",
        "In contrast, being a physicina - scientist is a time and effort consuming work. Some people have to let their normal lives aside and live their time in work, in the hospital and in the labs. It is a true sacrifice. It can cause bad effect in their own lives and their relatives' lives. Some children would have less time with their parents, some wives or husbands would have to manage their house works without the help from spouses. Not many people can have enough impatience for this physicsian.",
        "In conclusion, I beleive that a physician that can also work as an academic reseacher deserves much respect from us because their work is for human serving and they have to barter their normal lives for health science. I also think that it is better that we should do one role completely than do many roles with sacrificing time, health and maybe your happiness."
