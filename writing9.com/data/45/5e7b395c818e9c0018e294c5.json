        "The vary of subjects helps to pupils who choose their future jobs.Also,girl tend to choose art subject, and boys opts science subjects such as physics so on.According to me, I will discuss the merits and demerits of both aspects.",
        "Firstly, there are some stereotype about that most girl choose art subjects.It depends on their mood and the girls and boys choose what they want to become because some girls keen on solving mathematic problems like me.Thus, they are enable to become the economist and businesswoman.in contrast, likewise boys are interesting to art subjects, too from the study at school.",
        "Secondly,some parents and grandparents do not get rid of former thoughs.For example:they think that boys have to choose physics and mathematic subject.This demanding is harm to teenagers because pupils follow their parents' spirits.Thus, children study without success and motivation in university.If parents communicate fullheartedly with their children,then the result will be fruitful for family.Furthermore, understanding to eachother effects on pupils' future job and hapiness.",
        "However, in most occurances, the girl opts art subjects and boys choose science subjects.It is relevant to their innate temper because boys plays the car and mechanic tool in childhood, and girls plays the doll and like to read mermaid stories.This childhood activities sustains to pupils to choose the aforesaid subjects.",
        "To sum up, after the analysing these paragraphs, from my point of view, these aspects with own backbone, so i do not agree with about changing tendency."
