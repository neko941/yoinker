        "These days when anyone apply for the job they have been asked to provide their personal data for example they bachelor or married, what are the interest and hobbies and even these days employers inquire about the social media accounts for eomployee to know the candidate applying for the job.",

All employees personal data can be compromise by breaching their privacy. For job applicants it can be for more time investing because many of them must be active job seekers and instead of looking for other opportunities they will waste all their precious time in providing personal data.",

For example if a person  having a habit to update himself/herself in their professional field then employer don't have to worry about the skill of employee.",

One of them mention in the interview that he is married, he got the family visa for the his wife and kids. Other one didn't declare that he is married and now he had to travel alone without his wife and son.",
