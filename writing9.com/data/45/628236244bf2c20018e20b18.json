        "Personally, I agree with the conclusion that it has an adverse effect on the community. It is true that these days, because of work and study pressure, many people do not want to live with their families. Firstly, if you are a worker or an official, you will need more time for your work. So when you have your own family or live with your family, you have to take care of other members, which wastes your time. Second, due to problems of generation gap or convenience for work, more and more people are moving out of their homes to live alone or with their friends. If you live alone you will have more free time to do everything you want and you will have more time to relax or if you go with friends you will be able to talk about private things that only Only your friends understand what you are saying."
