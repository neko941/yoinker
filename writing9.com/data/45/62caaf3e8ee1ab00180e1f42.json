        "The line graph gives information about the average number of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions per person in the United Kingdom, Sweden, Italy, and Portugal from 1967 to 2007.",
        "Overall, the emission averages of Italy and Portugal showed an upward trend over time, while the numbers of CO2 waste in the UK and Sweden experienced a downward trend with some fluctuation modes in Sweden.",
        "At first, the CO2 numbers in Italy and Portugal were nearly 4 and 1 respectively in 1967. Portugal\u2019s number increased significantly over the years, reaching about 5 in 1997 and remaining the same until the end of the stage. In the meantime, the discharge in Italy experienced remarkable growth to around 6 in 1977, then this number gradually rose to almost 8 in 1997, followed by stagnation for the next decade.",
        "In contrast, the discharge rate of the UK in 1967 accounted for approximately 11, outracing these four countries, then it declined moderately to around 9 in 2007. In the same period, there was an escalation of CO2 emissions in Sweden from about 9 in 1967 to around 10 in 1977. However, it showed a dramatic fall to about 7 in 1987 and finished at around 5 in 2017, which was the lowest discharge."
