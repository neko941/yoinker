        "As each day passes by, more and more people are beginning to take up shopping as a free time activity, making it a well-known thing in big cities. Few people have often argued that this act of buying for fun has both its upside and downside. If you are wondering why shopping is getting so much attention and what effects it could possibly have on people and the society at large then keep reading as the next paragraphs reveals a lot about this phenomenon.",
        "First and foremost, we need to understand that we are in the era of social media activity, micro-blogging and picture blogging. Almost everyone want to show that they are doing well and having a good time and one of the easiest ways to achieve this is by going to a shopping mall to take photos whether or not one is actually shopping or window shopping. Before now, these photos remain on our phone till we get tired of seeing them, but with the advent of social media applications, people now upload these photos on their pages where thousands of other uses will see it, hence why shopping is famous.",
        "The effect of this growing attitude is that while leisure buying helps a person to relax and socialize, it also puts pressure on many people who apparently do not have the means to do so. They feel bad and are oftentimes tempted to engage in illegal acts to get money by all means. The consequence of this is an increase in crime rate in the society.",
        "On one hand, while fun shopping helps keep most supermalls running and profitable enough to keep the people employed, it also encourages reckless spending which in turn leads to poverty in the society.",
        "In conclusion, people should always apply self-restraint when using social media applications and be disciplined when spending."
