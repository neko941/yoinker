        "For some people, the preferred school subject is History, whereas some people consider science and technology the most important ones in this modern age.However, I strongly agree with the second opinion as in this age of advancement, scientific and technical subjects must be taught to the students for the survival of our society and to make our life more luxurious.",
        "Scientific and technical knowledge is crucial for the survival of our life. World has now become a global village.Nobody can even think of living without technology. For instance, in business world thousands of projects are technology based. Similarly, in hospitals, patients are getting cured everyday just because of advanced instruments. Without these latest instruments, their treatment would be impossible.",
        "On the other hand, everyday new inventions are being made every other day to make our life more and more luxurious. It is just because of technology and science . For instance, every other day mobiles are being updated with new features that has reduced the gaps between the people sitting at a great distance from each other.",
        "To sum up, it can be said that subjects related to science and technology must be preferred to exist in this world and make my life more and more comfortable."
