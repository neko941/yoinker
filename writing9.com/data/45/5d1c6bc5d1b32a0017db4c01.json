        "Some people content that if children are given weekly pocket money; they will be able to learn financial management skills from a tender age, and are less likely to come under debt as adults. In my opinion, I agree to this contention.",
        "To begin with, financial planning reinforces children to learn about the benefits of careful spending, savings, and money management.

Money, espeially if earned through chores will help them understand its value and worth, therefore, they will be able to differentiate between the needs and wants.",

        "To conclude, I believe that learning financial management from a young age not only enable children to realize the value of hard earned money of their parents, but also we are looking at children making error with pennies, rather than the pounds."
