        "In this modern world, as the development of technology arise, there are inceasing number of people who become dependent to its functions. Universities is one of the leading usage of modern ways of engaging education with the use of tablets and laptop computers for students instead of printed materials. This essay will discussed about the positive and negative drawbacks of this issue.",
        "To begin with, there are numerous reasons in which schools lends their student to use this technological material. First and foremost, they find it easy for the learners to look and do research about their homeworks with the help of Wikipedia as well as Google. In addition, it will be beneficial if they will carry light object as they will go to school instead of bringing heavy books in their bags. For instance, my niece, a 12-year-old student complaining of back pain due to numbers of books he needs to keep in order for him to have lots of reference so that he will not be left to their lessons. So, allowing the students to used this devices will help them to their studies and well-being.",
        "On the other hand, teachers and students also might encounter detrimental effects of this modern education. Firstly, internet websites who is giving false information can acquire by the pupils, as a result their school grades will be affected. Also, they can demonstrate lack of concentration where they can access numbers of web address and find it more interesting than studying the given lessons.",
        "In conclusion, there is no doubt that technology has a good impact in education. However, mentors should monitor their students if they are using the right webinars to prevent information that is not reliable."
