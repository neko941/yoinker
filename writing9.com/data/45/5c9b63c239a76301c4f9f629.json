        "Discuss both views and give your opinion.",
        "Nowadays, education has become a vital role in deciding the aspects of one's career. Few individuals believe that university graduates are ought to study subjects of their choice, whilst rest of people think they should pursue their education, in the field of science and technology will be help them in forthcoming. In my perspective, I certainly believe it is upto the student to decide which area they want to specialize in.",
        "There are numerous of factors why it is good idea for pupils to choose their own path. Firstly, some people are born with a talent and thus they start showcasing their interest in that subject. For example, Srinivasa Ramanujan started his affection towards maths at his young age and later he invented many theorms and the number 0. Finally, students educating in the different fields will have eco-blance in the society. For instance, some students wanted to be a director so they tend to take a course in media, few will have an ambition to be an accountant so undertake accoutancy subject. Thus, it will create a balance society among all the proffesionals.",
        "Having said that, there are several pros why purusing a career in tech and science would be beneficial. For instance, there will be demand of jobs in upcoming decades but technology evloves drastically. Example, Gartner report says: there will be 2million skilled shortage in the area of cyber security. Futhermore, people working in these area expertise earns an ample amount salary and leads a luxury life. A case in point, a recent study says that  proffessionals like scientist, engineers, and doctor earns double the wages of other skilled labours.",
        "To conclude, some individuals urges that students have freedom to choose thier studies, while others thinks they should study only subjects that will help them in upcoming. In my opinion, I think it in the hands of students to think and decide. However, there are other metrics they should consider before choosing."
