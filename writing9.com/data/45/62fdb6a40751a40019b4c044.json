Additionally, there will be a playground set between the river and road on the left, with a new area used for a school at the end and a medical centre on the left corner between the two roads. The straight connection of the previous vertical-direction road will be re-built into a circle which is located at the centre of the road in the south.",

On the left side of the central circular road, shops will appear as well. In the north direction, a new house will be constructed on the farmland side,connected with a new road and a bridge built from the centre."
