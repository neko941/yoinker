        "Some people believe that government should allocate more funds to other sector of the economy rather than wasting money on arts and culture.This essay will first discuss how significantly  other sectors such as agriculture and health contribute immersely to the economy and also explain how life expectancy depends more on other sectors than arts and culture.",
        "Firstly, allocating revenue to arts will only yield a little dividend to the economical growth when  compared to other sectors such as health and agriculture. When more funds are disburse to this other sectors of the economy the impact and benefits are significantly seen and can also be measured in the lifes of the citizens of the country and also in the economy at large. This means that, there will be reduction in famine (food will be readily available), people will be active to go about their normal life activities  and many citizens will be able to access good health care services. For instance, the punch newspaper in the year 2012 recorded that mortality and morbidity rate in Nigeria reduced with about 20% as a result of more funds allocated to the health sector.",
        "Secondly, life expectancy depends more on other  sectors than the arts in that when government spend more on this other sectors more life will be impacted than the arts because k lesser people  have interest in arts, unlike other sectors like education, health agriculture and so on where many people show interest  and  will benefit from.For instance when the country authorities focus more on education  then many life's will be touched positively both the poor and the rich therefore many life expectations will be met thereby securing the nation's future.",
        "",
        "In conclusion, government should spend more on other sectors that will bring more dividend to the economy but in doing this the arts sector should not be neglected."
