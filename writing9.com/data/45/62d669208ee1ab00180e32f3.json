        "The maps show the modification of a university sports court from 1990 to the present.",
        "Overall, the studied area's west and south have undergone the most changes, while the opposite pattern is true to the heart and the north of the court.",
        "Regarding the west of the university sports court, the park vanished and made room for the basketball court. There used to be a car park northwest of the court, which emerged and replaced the tennis court. The previous tennis court has been located in the southeast of the court and doubled in size afterwards.",
        "Turning to the right side of the university sports court, a new building is established, encompassing the sports facilities, including the cafe, reception room, changing room, fitness centre and indoor pool. While the cafe and reception room have stayed unchanged, the changing room has been enlarged and adjacent to the fitness centre, which altered the old tennis court\u2019s position. And finally, the current indoor pool is the area of the previous outdoor pool in 1990."
