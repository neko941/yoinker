        "The provided two pictures compare the layout of the Stockford village as it was in 1930 and 2010.",
        "Overall, a glance at the graph reveals that the main changes that had been between these two years were removing farmlands to make way for a plethora of houses and converting the old building into the retirement home.",
        "To begin with, the main road that passes through the village of Stockford from the bridge to the south remained unchanged as well as River Stoke. The difference was in the construction of roads to access new buildings. They had been built on the original site of the farmlands and located close to the road.",
        "Two main buildings had been renovated, such as a large house and a primary school. The first one initially had gardens, however, in 2010 they were replaced by a retirement home and 4 little houses. The second one just became larger in size. On the contrary, the two shops, which are located above the post office, were demolished. Nevertheless, the post office still existed."
