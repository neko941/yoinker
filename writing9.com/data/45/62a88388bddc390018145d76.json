        "The line graph depicts the changes that had taken place in the number of births in China and the United States from 1920 to 2000.",
        "Overall, although both the countries had experienced a fall in the birth rates, the number of birth had decreased drastically in China in comparison to the USA. Except for the two years, more children have taken birth in the USA than in China.",
        "In 1920, the USA stood 1% higher than China in terms of birth rate (with 11% and 10% respectively). The percentage remained the same at the end of 1930, before rising in the year 1935 when China's birth rate increased by 2% in comparison to the USA . After that, a steep decline was experienced in the birth rate of Chinese children before it plateaued for 5 years, while in the United States the data recorded with least number of births by the end of the year 1945.",
        "In 1950, even though both the countries reached their peaks, the number of children born in China was 6% more than in the USA. Further, despite the fact that both China and the USA had experienced a fall in the percentage of birth rate (at 2% and 6% respectively) , however, China noticed a dramatic decrease in the birth rate."
