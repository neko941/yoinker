        "Subject: Requesting permission to set up cafeteria for staffs.",
        "Dear Sir,",
        "I am writing this letter on behalf of our staffs for requesting permission to set up cafeteria within our office building. I feel that our employees are currently wasting a good amount of time walking in the hot weather outside to go to nearby restaurants and shops. Since, the outdoor conditions in this city is extreme, I too think it is necessary to provide at least a small cafeteria and pantry for our people.",
        "I heard from our old colleagues that having a dining place creates a lot of inconvinience due to the hygiene and smell issues. Moreover, I was told that many of our team members would use the place for chit-chatting purposes. If we do a proper planning in terms of design and construction we can ensure that the smell issues arising can be completely avoided by providing proper ventilation and exhaust systems. Similarly, a full-time cleaning company must be employed to make sure that cleanliness of the eating area is maintained to our office standards. Also, we will have to train our managers to educate all office staffs to use cafeteria for its purpose only.",
        "To conclude, I believe that providing a cafeteria would enhance the image of the company's management within the workers and it has direct impact on their well-being. I hope from this letter the management understands the need to have a dedicated eating and acts on it at the earliest.",
        "Thanking you."
