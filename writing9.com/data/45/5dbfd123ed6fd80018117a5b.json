        "Initialy, human living not only have many consequences for planet who living in there but also they have badly impact on each other. But all the human reaching have own prons and cons. So, let you know more about me and how i think about this subject, I want to suggest 3 of my point of view. First, having more time for enjoing of life. Second, raising crowd in the world and Thrid, raisnid older age in the society.",
        "Frist, I mentioned about having more time for enjoing of life, it may just be an only advantage for raising human life, for example: If I want to live as more as possible, I can watch raising my family like my son or doghter and my grandchild, or at least, I can spend time more and more for traveling and intresting of new place in the world.",
        "Second, I mentioned about raising crowed in the society, it will make a hard situation and this matter need to manaige carfuly, for example: You can emagane in your maind for shopping of market centers and long and long queue of peaple stay at the line or traffic jam that making by increasing cars in the steerts.",
        "Thrid, I mentioned about raising older age in society, I strongly believe that this is an importand factor of raising human life and this is an important disadvantage, for example: Human in the adult age has not both ability and power of body like youth member of society, in this state they need more medical requairment than the past, this matter has a expence on society.",
        "To conclude, I mentioned 3 factors that I think  those are parts of advantage and disadvantage, I believe that it is not important raising human life without having nice life."
