        "In recent times, an enormous number of people have taken to travelling unlike before.",
        "Travelling has become a vocation and some have even built careers centred around it.",
        "There are a number of reasons why this is the case, and in this essay, I will be stating some of the reasons.",
        "Firstly, people travel for academic purpose. There has been an increase in the number of students who would rather want to study abroad, these could be due to the poor state of education in their home country, or it could be just for the experience of studying in a different country. This is mostly seen among low income countries whose students would want quality tertiary education abroad.",
        "Secondly, business success can be achieved when once can garner experience and spread ones tentacles across the globe. Businesses such as Microsoft, Google and Amazon with branches in almoat every continent of the world could achieve the high rate of success they have by having their branches across the world., and this will entail a constant back and forth travels by the employees.",
        "In addition, tourism is another major reason why people travel. Historical sites, different cultures draw a lot of tourist attention all around the world. While the tourist enjoys his visit, he also helps to improve the financial status of country he is visiting by spending his money. Tourist on the other hand forge life long relationships with the locals, he is exposed to different cultures and traditions which broadens his experience about life.",
        "Conclusively, while travelling gives some beautiful experiences, the modes of transportation are not assured safe. Accidents, plane crashes or ship wreckage etc are unavoidable and could sometimes lead to the death of some of the passengers. However, one can not totally ignore the need to travel."
