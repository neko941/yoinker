        "In recent years, e-shopping has expanded itself into the domain of groceries. While most people have shifted to online grocery shopping, others prefer to purchase their goods in supermarkets. This essay will discuss why internet shopping has its benefits but why the traditional method is ultimately better.",
        "Shopping for groceries online is certainly an efficient way to complete what many people consider to be a laborious chore. Instead of traveling to supermarkets, the easy accessibility to e-stores allow products to be ordered and delivered within a short period of time. For instances, a major Malaysian supermarket provides a wide variety of food choices which can be delivered to any local location in just a few hours. Online stores leads to consumers having a hassle free and convenient way to continue grocery shopping.",
        "However, saving time is not a problem for majority of the people, instead the quality and quantity of the product is more important. By visiting physical stores, customers have the ability to examine each vegetable or fruit before making the purchase in order to avoid receiving damaged or spoiled goods. Moreover, grocery stores do not display their full stock for sale on their website and rather have a larger variety in-store as it is quicker to label and display then create a separate product page.",
        "Traditional shopping has been facing competition from the introduction of online shopping. This essay discussed why the online platform proves to be more efficient and convenient but why going to the supermarket allows for customers to have better quality products and a larger selection. In my opinion, the benefits of visiting the grocery store outnumbers online stores."
