        "Nowadays, importance of becoming successful in life has increased more than ever because of the hyper-competitisve world in which we live today.Many individuals believe that success is a result of sheer hard work and determination while others are of the view that money and personal appearance play a more dominant role.This essay will delineate both of these views as well as outline my own opinion in upcoming paragraphs.",
        "Firstly,the side which considers money and personal appearance to be more important is of the view that money,better looks provide an additional advantage to stand out in the crowd.Money has its own influence and provides a way to get better education facilities which results in better career opportunities.As, graduates from highly-ranked universities get better jobs.Also, a better appearance helps to give a positive impression to the person in front and may increase our chances of acceptance by others.But, all these advantages are losing their significance these days.Because,most of companies are focusing more and more on skills rather than wage and looks of their employees.For example, no company will prefer a spoiled individual who studies at a good university over a more skilled and hardworking employee.",
        "Moreover, even the industries which were supposed to be only for good-looking persons are starting to hire persons who have more skills.For Instance, many actors who have worked in many movies were selected on the basis of their acting skills rather than their looks.On the other hand, hard effort and conviction are required in every field. Even cash itself is an outcome of true hard effort and dedication.",
        "Long story short, I am of the view that hard work and willpower play a much more significant role than wealth and looks. As, cash and display may provide a better position in a field, but , they can never guarantee the success of an individual who is not willing to give their best shot."
