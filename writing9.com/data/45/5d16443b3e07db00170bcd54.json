        "Our home and office which is where most of our time is spent in should be kept tidy. While some people think this is not important, I believe that this places ought to be clean and properly arranged.",
        "Firstly, the home and workplace should be kept clean and arranged to avoid home accidents.  It is widely known that most house accidents happen due to the fact that things are carelessly placed thereby leading to harm or loss. Especially, for home with kids, having a disorganised home can cause harm to the children as well as affect their health. If things are well arranged and placed in the right places, the number of home accidents will reduce.",
        "Also, keeping your space well organised and neat will help you to manoeuvre through documents easily. For example, if my work space is well organised and my papers are all arranged and labelled sequentially, I can easily find any books needed thereby saving me time. Another  advantage of this is that it helps to keep domestic animals like rats and cockroaches away  from your home. These pests are commonly found in dirty and untidy environments. However, if your house is kept tody, this will reduce the activities of these destructive  household pests.",
        "In conclusion, the home and workspace",
        "Should be kept clean and well organised to prevent home accidents and diesaees from house hold pests.  while it may be stressful to keep these places clean, cleaning services can be employed to help with this tasks."
