        "Plenty of the languages are disappearing because people prefer to communicate in the international languages. One camp claims that the government ought to spend money and save the future of endangered languages. At the same time critics said it is nothing less than the wastage of public money. In this essay I will discuss both views and give my opinion at the end.",
        "One section of the society holds this perception that the government be supposed to shell out bucks and save local languages, because every language has its own importance and it enrich the global diversity. If mother tongues get obsolete than it would cast adverse effects on the culture and uniqueness of the particular group. So that is why the government has to open up local language schools and inclined the people towards mother tongue.",
        "On the flip side, this ideology is at loggerheads with other group, that all efforts to protect the dead languages are futile. If we have some popular and international languages to communicate than money and energy must spend to promote that languages rather than saving local languages. Moreover, communication is the prime purpose of language and it would be immensely handy if all mankind prefer one language. In this situation language would not be a barrier.",
        "In my opinion in this era of globalisation lets go for global rather than local. Dead languages like Latin Sanskrit have little importance, anyway we have advance technology to convert and understand the dead language literature.",
        "To conclude. Change is a constant, so with time local languages are going to vanish and global languages are getting lime light."
