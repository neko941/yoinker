        "Beyond doubt, living in the same place offers far too many benefits that can not be ignored. Conversely, there is a group of people which opines that living in different places does have more challenges in life but, nonetheless, those challenges represent a cherished experience. To me, I believe in living in different places for many worthwhile reasons , as described in this essay.",
        "Over the centuries, the fabric of society has been such that people believe in living in a close -knit community. There are apparent reasons as they feel a sense of belonging- everyone knows one another and treats them as a member of the family. Another reason that motivates to choose neighborhood is a convenience factor. Truly, people develop a close relationship by living together over the year. This companionships facilitates them to help one another if need be. For example, an old neighbor may graciously volunteer to watch the next-door house for signs of activity in need",
        "In contrast , other believe that living in different places allow them to experience a whole new world of the neighbourhood and the place. Meeting or hanging out with new people unlocks the door of new relationship and a stage for knowing about other values. They become tolerant to the society and learn to coexist with differences. Furthermore, one feels more connected with people who have very different backgrounds. This sets a soild platform for networking which invariably is useful in career making, too.",
        "As has been noted, both phenomena have their own splendid offerings. However, experiencing different places for living leaves more benefits than the other one"
