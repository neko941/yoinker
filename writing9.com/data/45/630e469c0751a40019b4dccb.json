        "Some people believe that rules and regulations set by teachers and parents have a great importance in the life of children and others think differently ,when children have less control, they can deal better in their future adult life. In this essay we will elaborate further of the two mindset of raising children with rules and without rules.",
        "I strongly believe that setting rules with children definitely contributes in disciplinating them, furthermore they know how to behave in society and are aware of dangers. For example, if a child is taught that a knife is dangerous to play, there is less risk that this child is injured. Whereas if a child  has liberty and no pressure, he thinks that he can do anything he wants.",
        "I believe that from the age gap from zero to eleven years old, rules and regulations have an important place in the life of a child.. Gradually, when the child grows up and turn to a teenager, he has already embedded the culture of discipline and he has his own judging about what is good and wrong. So rules and regulations should be taken up with a different aspect as children grows into an adult.",
        "When analysing a society with children who have grown up with rules, they are more discipline in all aspects, waking up early, they know at what time they should watch TV, study and rest. Whereas children who are are left with little control have the tendency to misbehave.",
        "Having grown up with rules and regulations, I strongly believe they are crucial in a child's life and upbringing. I am completely against letting a child with less control as facts have shown that children who are less disciplined  have the tendency to turn in delinquent and misbehave in society."
