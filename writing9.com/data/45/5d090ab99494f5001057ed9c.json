        "Violent content on television and its effect on the population is a matter of debate. Some people are of the view that there is a correlation between violence in society and the increase violent content being broadcasted on tv. This essay will discuss that it is unreasonable to believe that violent acts on television give rise to more violence in real life.",
        "Some people advocate that brutal television content promotes violence in society. Because there has been an increase in the number of reports where a criminal has carried out what he has seen in a movie, this has made some people wary of television influence on an individual.",
        "It should also be noted that with the advent of new technology, news reporting has become faster. Therefore, more crime is being reported than ever before. As a result, people are of the view that more crime is being carried out in society.",
        "However, to negate this, it can be said that crime rate is similar but the act by which it is carried out has changed.",
        "Nevertheless, other reasons for a criminal activity cannot be ignored. For example, a psychological association with a tendency to commit a crime has been researched a lot.",
        "No one in their sound mind will ever commit something without considering the consequences of their actions.",
        "In conclusion, it is absurd to say that television is solely responsible for increase violence in society. If all the factors are considered, the crime rate will decrease."
