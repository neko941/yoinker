        "In a lot of Nations nowadays, major cities have became too big and overcrowded. There are ample of reasons behind it and also, plenty of solutions for reducing this problem which will be discussed in further paragraphs.",
        "The biggest cause behind it that, there are ample of facilities available in cities. In this day and age, more and more individuals go to major cities who live in rural areas because, in rural areas, there are not better amenities for them. Then, they go in big cities where, they study and also, they obtain good job. They earn a lot of fund because, they prefer to live better life and also, they want to fulfill their fundamental necessities. With this, population has risen in major cities. For instance, a notable size of population go to Chandigarh which is major city because, in this place, education system is excellent and also, more more job opportunities which are fruitful for them. Hence, big cities become too big and overcrowded.",
        "The easiest solution is that, authorities should provide amenities in rural areas. As i forementioned that, ample of masses go in big cities because in rural areas, there are no outstanding facilities. If government will provide amenities for groups of population in these areas. Then, they have good education and then, they will obtain well paid job. Then, they can fulfill their basic necessities. With this, they will not go in big cities. For example,  in Punjab, more and more individuals prefer to live in their villages because, administration provide better facilities such as, better education system, well paid jobs and other amenities which are useful for masses. Therefore, regime should provide amenities for groups of population in rural areas.",
        "To recapitulate, in present time, cities become too big and overcrowded because, there are ample of facilities available in cities.however, the panaceas is that, government should provide facilities for individuals in rural areas."
