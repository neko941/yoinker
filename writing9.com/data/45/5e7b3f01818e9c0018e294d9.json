        "In recent years, the total of older people has been rising in many parts of the world. IN my view, this have more positive effects on our society, however this also have some negative effects of the state budget.",
        "On the one hand the increasin total of older people  can bring minuses to the union economy. As the statistic of the senior people increases,  demand for healthg  care services also rises at the same. Therefore, authority has to provide higher budget to medical services. Also the larger amount of money spends to retirement houses.As a result of these facts, the economy of the state  can be poor in the near future. In addition, the government cannot devote money to the development of other services.",
        "On the other hand, the growing sum of older people has also some positive aspects. Firstly, older people much more experienced and can give advices to young people. Every time when we encounter some problems, we still need them, advice and help. Secondly, they are help not only for us, but also our kids when we are busy with some kind of work they always look after our children. And finally, ultimately this, our life experiences will enhance. There is no doubt that elderly people can bring much better effects on our society and we really must respect and care of them.",
        "In conclusion, although older people bring negatives to the state budget, I believe that older people are really needed in our society and the ministry must provide and care for them until the end of their lives."
