        "Secondly,people from different background might bring in appropriate practises which may taint the country name with a substandard behaviors.Inaddition,this will lead to the deportation of people to their countries due to breaking of jurisprudence such that having been a high-tech country,it is pronounced publicily of the inaproppriate act.For example,a research done by the University of Nairobi depicted that 80% of country has a policy to be adapted due to different culture.Therefore,this development of different society and different way of doing thing can be detrimental such that they can bring up unsatisfactory practise.",
