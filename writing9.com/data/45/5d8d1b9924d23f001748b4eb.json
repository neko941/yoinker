        "In recent times a greater percentage of individuals conclude to bear offspring at a later time as against the days of old. Bearing neonate at maturity offers the opportunity to build a career and also save up financially for the well-being of this babe in contrast to a later decision  which can predispose reproductive women to various diseases such as fibroid and infertility. Also, elderly parents are too busy, lacking time and energy to cater for children.",
        "In my opinion, the resolution to bear children should occur at an earlier , the advantage of taking a stand to have a family at a later time  are career-building and financil stability. The individual is not easily distracted by the hassle of raising a kid and can reach the summit of her career speedily. For instance ,a cousin who resulted to having her offspring at a later age built her career to the to it's peak, she had a master degree, PhD and became a professor while serving as a firm where she also rose in position.",
        "An advantage of financial security results in meeting the child's needs and demand  following years of saving.",
        "Parent's who take a stand to reproduce later in life may be at a disadvantaged point as various illnesses tend to crop up in the elderly, one of such include fibroid which may hinder conception.  An ncrease in age is associated with decreased fertility rate of a woman and bearing children later comes with a clause as one may not be able to reproduce at all. Lack of time and energy in raising a child is also associated with a late decision to conceive as children are not well trained and disciplined, for instance a daughter whose parents are both business Tycoons result in to prostitution due to lack of parental care and attention . More often than not,elderly parents are more engrossed in maintaining financial status quo, hence relegate the training of their children to maid. Eventually children and not disciplined.",
        "In conclusion the advantage of taking a stand to bear children at a later stage in life outweighs the disadvantages."
