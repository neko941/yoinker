        "Nowadays when such complicated areas as IT and telecommunication methods are developed using the Internet for communicating has become as a new trend. However, there is the question which should be answered: is it a positive or a negative development? This essay will consider some pros and cons regarding this question.",
        "These days it is hard or closely impossible to imagine our modern life without using the Global Network: people are spending time in front of computer or smartphone screens chatting with others. Obviously, it seems to be easy to give a call or to send a message to somebody who lives far from us. In addition thanks to such softs as WhatsApp or Skype we have a great opportunity to make video calls. Thus, technologies are intended to serve people; nowadays we can connect with others as promptly as never before.",
        "It is believed that the way technologies have affected our lives is a positive development. Obviously, it is needed to give this method its due: it is a chance to communicate with others easy that many people adore and appreciate a lot. On the other hand, in order to interact with relatives and friends some people prefer to use their devices only, forgetting about face-to-face communication. In other words, some softs can be very useful for communication over long distance but we are charged to meet with our relatives as well.",
        "It is well known that new technologies influence our lives as well as methods we interact with others. In conclusion I would like to say that despite of the fact we have a very good opportunity to chat as easily as never before, we should pay attention to so called \u201cface-to-face communication\u201d. As people say, everything is good in moderation."
