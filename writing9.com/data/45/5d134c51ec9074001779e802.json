        "It is argued that countries that are investing big funds in expensive space",
        "discovery projects should have used that money in order to develop the public services. I",
        "completely agree with the view that the governments should not waste money on costly and risky space explorations, rather it should carefully allocate the money to make the public services better.",
        "For the underdeveloped and developing countries investing into space programs is not so beneficial for the mass population who are living below the poverty line. Most of the time pumping money into these extremely expensive space projects does not yield significant prospects on people\u2019s day to day life. For instance, last year the economically backward country, such as Iran had unsuccessfully launched a space program, where the space shuttle crashed and all the money was gone within a fraction of a second. Furthermore, these space missions are not only costly, but also life threatening. Hence, I believe the authority should not undertake such lavish programs, when they have much crucial issues to solve in the first place.",
        "On the other hand, each economy has only a limited amount of resources to use. Economically speaking, it is much wiser for the nations to utilize these available but limited funds into easily achievable projects, which will ultimately enhance the quality of mass people in the vicinity. For instance, people living in the least developed counties are barely surviving in abject poverty, and the basic human needs such as primary education, healthcare, accommodation, and public transportation need to be developed for them with the available budget. Spending the budgeted money on mass people will increase the living standard, bring harmony and order in the country. Therefore, making general people\u2019s lives better should be the first priority of the government than foolishly investing on huge space projects.",
        "In conclusion, my view is that the drawbacks stemming from spending in the space programs",
        "will outweigh the benefits of investing money for the betterment of mass people by developing public services."
