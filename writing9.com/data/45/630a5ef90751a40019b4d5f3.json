        "Several modern schools oblige students to purchase personal computers to use during the learning process. In this essay, I will discuss both sides of the argument and explain my support for the latter view.",
        "On the one hand, nowadays, digitalization and the development of technologies require gadgets in all areas of life, as well as school, which is no  exception. For example, even in order to have access to a large amount of information, we need the Internet, because libraries are no longer able to keep up with the flow of information and it is also financially unprofitable for schools to buy books, whereas having own gadgets for students is very convenient.",
        "On the other hand, students should have knowledge that teachers themselves can offer as it is enough for scholars. Moreover, computers will only interfere with them because it spoils their concentration, due to the fact that children  find it hard to resist games that will distract them from learning. For instance, we all studied online during the pandemic and found out that it was ineffective.",
        "Eventually, I think that the traditional study form is good enough for pupils with any additional personal technologies. Past experiences show that there can be good results without any gadgets."
