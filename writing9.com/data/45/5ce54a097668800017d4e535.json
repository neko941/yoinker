        "There are two paramount aspects of everyone's life namely, personality and development. A person is known by his characteristics and I consider that experiences which may have in our life do more influence on our personality and development than the characteristics we are born with.",
        "To embark, I believe that a person do not born with characteristics, the character of a person is born by his surroundings and experiences. For example, the relationship of the parents of a child is quarrelsome then either the nature of a child can be depressive or angry. Inversely, if the parents have a humourous and lovely nature then there can be a high possibility of a child's normal nature, furthermore, if we take an example of a person who went to abroad, his way of thinking will change with time when he will meet with different people of different character, he absorbs their skills, style and personality. The development of a child takes place more in schools and universities because they spend most of their childhood's time there. A person can improve the personality by working experiences and be independent.",
        "However, it is generally believed that the characteristics we are born with have much more influence on our personality. Some people believe that the character which a person gets by his ancestor stays with him until the end of his life comes. They think characteristics do not change with time but I consider experiences have much more influence on personality because when a child is born, he can not speak and can not assume things so how can he develope the character.",
        "To sum up, no matter you are born in what kind of environment or with what type of character. Be more optimistic and do whatever you are going to do."
