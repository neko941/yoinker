        "Administation is investing a high amount of money in exploring the mortals on other planets. The significant amount of people think that rulers are wasting enough treasure of the nation in spending on discovering life, instead this could be spent on addressing more public issues. I believe governments should continue doing researches as well as they should address the society issues.",
        "Primarily, the predominant factor for researching living beigns in other asteroids is that, if by any chance disaster occur on earth there should be some place in the solar system where human can survive, in addition to this living being's on earth has to be very careful about the foreign invasions which might happen, as the researches states aliens can invade earth at any time for survival, however despite finding no proof of existence of other mankind, we have  learnt many things about other planets and the sattelites we have sent are being useful one or other way.",
        "On the other hand, inspite of poor economy  some governments are unnecessarily wasting amount on failure experiments. No matter how useful or not those experiments are to the nation, one has to think about the economic growth of the society and individuals which solves the problems of them. Investing on visions which are no where related to current situations makes the growth of the country very complicated, despite this amount could be spent on those who are in need.",
        "To conclude, Not only conducting research and development to know the existence of life on others helps up in many ways but also investments on other society problems enables the development."
