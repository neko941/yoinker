        "Some people argue that education is something that every person should be able to get, whether they come from different social environments. It is agreed that having a tuition-free education helps most of the society, while the private alternative eagers to separate it. Firstly, this essay will explain how a system of free education helps children to break down status barriers, and secondly, why this changes have an effect on the reduction of unequallity.",
        "A social environment, where kids from different economical  and social backgrounds can interact with each other will benefit the community as a whole. This is because children at primary or secondary school make bonds with other people mainly if they have the same tastes in a variety of subjects, or if they get along toghether. In other words, having a strong relationship with someone who comes from another social status help them understand that there are no real differences between these social groups.",
        "A free-for-everyone educational policy also affect the future of a community by giving all students the same possibilties to go on to further education. This means that every kid could manage to study a university career without getting into a huge debt, and therefore having better proffesional opportunities in their working life. For instance, a research made by the University of Munich, in Germany, in 2015 revealed that the number of people who reach at least a bachelors degree level have a higher percentage of more than 75% to get a high paid job than the ones who only finished secondary school education.",
        "To conclude, it is believed that despite the costs of developing such a system, having a free education including all people can only have advatages for the society when speaking about long term advances."
