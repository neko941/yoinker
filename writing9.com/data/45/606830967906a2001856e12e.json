        "Pictorial representation in a story along with the text in newspapers or tv media is becoming increasingly common. The main reason behind this is the arguement that pictures are far more effective compared to words. I agree to this argument and will demonstrate the reasons to support this.",
        "A picture speaks a thousand words, if we come across a picture in the newspaper it instantly grabs our attention and an interest to read more about the story develops. A graphic used in putting a story across makes the particular read more gripping. Moreover pictures helps in depicting the story much quickly and effectively as it helps in establishing a connect with the article. If a story is just text based and has no pictures or visuals associated with, it is more likely to be missed by the reader. This could result in missing of very important and useful pieces of news.",
        "Although text in a news story can give you the detail about the events yet the retention power is increased if a video or a image related to those events is shown. Even for kids the chances of remembering a topic can increase manyfold if taught or shown with the help of supporting graphics. As most of teenagers these days are not interested in reading long texts or news articles, visual representation helps in increasing awareness about certain topics like politics, current affairs especially in this age group which is very important.",
        "After listing out all the points, i strongly believe that images or graphics or any form of visual representation can be extremenly useful in putting the point across or helping the person understand and connect with a certain piece of information."
