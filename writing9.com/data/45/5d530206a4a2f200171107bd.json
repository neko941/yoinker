        "Over the last century, the rate at which the population move from one country to the other keeps increasing. Although this can be beneficial for both individuals and society, this in effect has led to overpopulation of the society. This essay will discuss further on the pros and cons of such transition in the society and on the migrants.",
        "One major benefit of migrating to another country is the increase in economic development of the society and its environment. This is due to the fact that, most countries welcoming migration, give such opportunities to highly skilled labour, as a result, this in turn increases the economic standard of such nation. For example, they employ people that are skilled in some professional occupations which will affect the community positively. In addition, for the inhabitants, a large proportion migrate to another city because they are of the believe that there is a higher standard of education which might not have been available from their departed country. Thus, it is seen as a better offer and the opportunity to mix with people of diverse cultures. This will further increase their exposure to many people of diverse nationalities, cultures and their way of life. For instance in a survey carried out in the people's magazine, it was discovered that 70% of the people that migrated to China did so because of better quality of education.",
        "On the one hand, migrating to another country may lead to overpopulation of the destination country. This is because majority wants to move to a developed country due to their high standard of living. They believe there are opportunities to get a job with a high paying wage. Thus, the increase in the numbers of people moving to such nation is unavoidable thereby leading to congestion which might cause increase in pollution. Additionally, movement to newer countries can also lead to loss of skilled people from the departed country, leaving their aged people to fend for themselves. Finally, migration can lead to cultural clashes. People of different culture may want to assert their domination and rights in favour of other cultures. As a result, strifes and fights may linger among the population which could cause the people to take sides with their culture.",
        "In conclusion, although migration can be a significant and positive step in the society and individual life, however it might also have some negative effects on the country. In my opinion, the advantage far outweigh the disadvantages because of the benefits gotten from successful migration."
