        "Nowadays, worldly possessions are preferred over moral values such as dignity, integrity, and kindness. Although this statement holds itself true in some cases, it is proven false in our daily life as people often exercise trust and mercy in their dealings with others.",
        "Materialism is the new god of today. Despite having reckless personalities, people with expensive cars, gigantic houses, and lavish lifestyles are treated as important persons by the general public. An individual, irrespective of his qualification, credentials, and skills, is often given high social status if he is rich or has strong political connections. Thus, these people receive preferential treatment over others who are morally strong. For example, Holly actors are treated as gods in many cases by people.",
        "However, old-fashioned values are still important to people. Most of the businesses conduct their day-to-day activities based on trues. Common people still show mercy and kindness even if it brings now benefit to them. For example, more than 50% of the small business transactions were conducted verbally in Pakistan in 2018 despite the fact that it is a community which is greatly influenced by materialism.",
        "In conclusion, while being rich or politically well-connected supersedes the humanly traits such as trust, honour, and kindness in some cases, in day-to-day life, people still prefer these adjectives over the materialistic items."
