        "A disappointing job or being out of cash is one of a million troubles humans might face during their lifetime. Some people seem to accept living with these difficulties, while others consider that they\u2019ll try working to get through this. With these two ideas, I have several points of view which will be discussed below.",
        "First, it\u2019s understandable that people nowadays are willing to adopt unsatisfactory lives or boring offices. We can see that the world has faced a serious overpopulation and an epidemic regularly. These natural and artificial disasters soon lead to high competitive recruitments, unemployment, and the pressure of additional fees which decrease individuals\u2019 chances to get their jobs. Humans then struggle to have a stable income, and prefer unsuitable appointments with good salary to their favourite work. People, especially unemployed, admit their broken conditions as well since they\u2019re both unable to get a job or pay their debts at the moment due to the same reason above. For example, many youngsters, graduated from high-qualified universities, still jobless, or have to accept being a manual labour, and work temporarily at some jobs such as delivery, waitress, or driver - which are poorly paid and their conditions are terrible.",
        "Beside that, trying to improve such situations is probably possible, since there are lots of professions that arise recently. The development of technology and the width of social networks easily connect people to chances, and the enormous sources on the internet can support you boosting your knowledge everywhere through a display, to get you ready for your work. Moreover, your attempt to improve your life sometimes helps you develop excellent characteristics. Even if you fail, you still learned the lessons of being patient and persevering, which gain your opportunities to succeed afterwards. We have seen many stories of inventors or founders of famous brands struggling to complete their dreams, and without them, many significant inventions wouldn\u2019t be brought to our lives",
        "In my opinion, I\u2019m on the side of the people who are willing to try to better their lives, because even if it is reasonable to accept poverty, I still believe that putting enough effort could bring miracles not only to individuals, but also to the society."
