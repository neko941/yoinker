        "It is believed by certain group of individuals that children ought to be busy at all times, thus, free community services should be in ulcated in the secondary school time tables. In my opinion, voluntary environmental services are quite beneficial but, should only be considered at certain periods.",
        "One good reason to make unpaid services part of the high school curriculum is to keep them busy at all times,as some people believe that most crimes are committed when a child is idle. For example, if a child is busy with clearing of the bushes along the roads with others,  there would not be enough free times for the child to think of any evil or crime to commit  such as, picking of pockets.",
        "On the other hand, other people found the suggestion as detrimental because,they believe that involvement in such activity would prevent most children from studying well,thereby performing  poorly in their academics. For example, some children who are not doing so well in school would require much time to be taught and groomed well but, when included in such extra activities would turn worse.",
        "Finally, in my view, voluntary activities for school pupils is beneficial, as it would help them to acquire some basic skills on how to do some works like, cutting of grasses and sweeping of the environments  but, this should be done only during holidays to avoid  clashing with their academic and class works or becoming so much stress to any child.",
        "In conclusion,  there are merits and demerits of  including voluntary community services in high school programs but, if period of involvement is considered, it would be a plus to many students."
