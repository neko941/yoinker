        "Nowaday, climate changing is one of the largest issues humans face in the 21st century and rising tidals are creeply to rise at a cautious rates. Within the scope of this writing, I will look at some of  the issues of the climate changing and how they can be overcome.",
        "One supreme problem of climate changing worth mentioning is that it causes flooding people's house and business. Needless to say,  the rising sea level can made houses of many people under the water. For intances, Vietnam has many houses along the coast and if sea levels are continuing to rise, the tir houses will be disappear. To combat this problem, the government should build flood barriers such as dams, waterway... to prevent affect of flood. An other solution can be mentioned is that people need to move to higher areas to live.",
        "In addition to this, one futher problem that is of great significance is that losing of agricultural land. People will unemploy if they lose their land. A better example can be best provided that most of the profession in our country is farming so land plays as very important role in their life. Another pratical solution that they will switch to more suitable scrops to maintain their finance.",
        "All in all, climate changing causes many issues to human rate. Realizing this proplems, many country in over the world have had trend to be environmentally friendly, to go green and being sustainable. Vietnam is also have that environmentally conscicous and we hope for a better change in the future."
