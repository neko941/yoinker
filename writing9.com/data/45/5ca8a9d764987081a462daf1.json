        "People in different countries have different view about how marriages should be arranged. While the partners that parents choose for their kids might be the suitable ones, I believe the children have the right to decide who they want to marry.",
        "On the one hand, the only reason parents want to interfere in marriage decisions is because of their children's happiness. With the life experience they have gained through the years, they know exactly which requirements of the partner are needed in a healthy and stable marriage. An adult with ideal family backgrounds or a job with lots of potential promotion would be in any cases more preferable than someone who is unemployed and still rely on their parents. Parents might also introduce their friends' children to their own sons and daughters because they trust that their friends would be kind to their kids as parent-in-laws.",
        "On the other hand, I believe marriages should be built based on love. A person might get married to somebody with excellent material conditions and without any emotional attraction to them, but no one could guarantee that it would be a precise decision. The core value of any marriage is understanding and sacrifice to each other. Both husbands and wives need to tries their best to become a better person not only for themselves but also for their spouses and future children. Therefore, everyone should have the right to meet and fall in love then choose the one who they think is the most suitable to be their future partner.",
        "In conclusion, while I understand the tradition of arranged marriage in some countries, I am certain that the choice of spouses only belongs to the two people who directly involve in the marriage."
