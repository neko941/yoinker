        "In recent years, the decision to give birth on the later stage of many families has become more and more popular. This happens due to a series of reasons and the consequences are both pros and cons. In my opinion, I lay my thought alongside the disadvantages.",
        "There are two main reasons why having children late has been a trend for many modern couples. First, instead of embarking on the parenthood life, their career success is the top- priority. They believe that taking care of their off-springs would deter them from achievements and promotions in the early stage of life. Second, nowadays young couples want to have countless opportunities to enjoy life. For example, they could have more time to travel together, pursue their hobbies and interests or have richer social life with friends.",
        "This tendency could lead to several severe problems. An important concern for family is that raising up children could be a huge challenge for older parents. Even though they have a strong socioeconomic status and finance potential, it might be difficult to communicate with theirs kids due to the generation gap. Moreover, having pregnant after 35 years old is relatively dangerous since both moms and their children would have more possibility health risks. For instance, older mothers would be in danger of miscarriage or stillbirth and the child might suffer from Down\u2019s syndrome. As a result, this could affect adversely the quality of the future workforce.",
        "By way of conclusion, there are a variety of reasons why more and more for a young, new couple not choose to have babies early and I would argue that this definitely leads to many hazardous risks for not only mother and child, but also the society situation."
