        "It is undeniable that the invention of information technology has made enormous contributions to various areas of the human's society and become more and more dominant in such fields as domestic life, entertainment and even our career. While there are still some people who argue that this has brought about much more drawbacks than the advantages, I do believe the opposite opinion.",
        "As long as we can take the control over it, it will facilitate our busy lives a lot.  For example, with the help of modern information technology, housewives are currently having more time to relax and enjoy their pastures as most of the household chores can be done by robots. As a result, they can spend more time exploring new things or taking care of and educating their children better in case they are working mothers. Moreover, latest information technology plays an important role in work aspects. We can save money and time of travelling to the workplaces every day with the assist of a computer or a laptop connected with the Internet. Just sit at home and we can deal with a lot of work in the office via the social medias such as Facebook, Instagram or the traditional means of communication as email and Skype. In fact, it doesn't seem to deteriorate our lives but improving it. We can focus on some cases when people failed to be the information technology's wise master. Apart from being usful at home or at work, information technology is also changing our leisure activities in both negative and positive ways. In other words, we used to play outside for a long period of tume. That is why many of us stay healthy and happy with abundant experiences about the world around us. The presence of the Internet or social medias also causes more and more of us to spend more time playing indoors that can be blamed for the increasing obesity of autism diseases at children and even some adults nowadays. Nevertheless, this can be reduce to the least if we manage our time and control our mind well.",
        "Vietnam has been experiencing the era of 4.0 technology revolution for some years, which offers marvellous successes in many prospects. In the time of globalization, we cannot withdraw ourselves from the current development, so it is quite unacceptable to claim such argument as information technology makes us lazier and lazier. Almost all things include both sides of good and bad points; hence, provided that we can manage ourselves smartly, such great stuff as information technology will be good device.",
        "In conlusion, based on the mentioned points, I strongly think that the benefits of information technology outweigh the disadvantages. Therefore, we should confidently employ them appropriately to have  better and more comfortable lives."
