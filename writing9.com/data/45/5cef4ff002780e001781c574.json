        "Pollution is a phenomenona which have detrimental effects on environment. one of the major cause of soil and water pollution is non-biodegradable bags which not only harms living beings but also disturbs the whole ecosystem. I agree with the view of banning these items and elucidate this certain issue in the ensuring essay.",
        "To begin with, majority of the multinational companies uses plastic bags for pakaging purposes but it turns out to be hazardous for the living world. As these packets when gets accumulated for long time, it releases toxins which puts many lives in danger. For example, marine life is gradually deteriorating due to the non degradation of polythene. Moreover, people are suffering from several diseases as chemicals goes into their body along with the seafood which gets contaminated by plastic sheets.",
        "However, some steps can be taken to eradicate the problem and one of the reasonable way is banning such kind of bags. Instead of using them, alternative things can be used like, usage of jute bags or packets made of organic material which can be easily decomposed by bacterial action. Furthermore, it will mitigate the problem of dumping waste as large proportion of it can be made reusable in the form of fertilizers.",
        "In conclusion, legally prohibiting the utilization of shopping bags made up of inorganic material can play a significant role in reducing pollution and can make survival better."
