        "Pie charts illustrate the number of students that were able to speak each language--only French, only German, only Spanish, another language, no other language and two other languages-- at one university in the UK in 2000 and 2010. The figures are given in percentages.",
        "Overall, in both years Spanish was the wide spoken language for pupils; moreover, German-speaking students remain in the same proportion.",
        "First of all, students who spoke only Spanish, two other languages and another language were all 5 per cent increased in 2010. Students who only speak Spanish were the major language spoken by 35 per cent, therefore. Students tended to speak more other languages than those French, Spanish and German which result in a  5 per cent increase from the year 2000 to 20 per cent which was the second largest group in 2010. Furthermore,in 2010 students were more interested in speaking 2 languages  which the amount increased from 10 per cent in 2000 to 15 per cent.",
        "On the other hand, in 2010, interest in speaking French  decreased from 15 per cent to 10 per cent. Besides, students who can not speak any other language than English  decreased by half from 20 per cent to 10 per cent."
