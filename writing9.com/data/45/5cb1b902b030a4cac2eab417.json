        "Whether or not internet has their benefits but this topic becoming increasingly controversial. It is considerd by some thtat being hvaing technological facilities is the key to decrease the far distance among family and freinds, while there are others who think that it is creat a destruction on tradintional way of meeting to individuals becasue they prefer to stay back at home. In my opinion, I believe that having internet connectivity is essential for those who live away from their hometown while It has negative impact on local society.",
        "On the one hand, many think thta it is easier to make a calls and massages to thier own family while they working abroad. In other words, It is possible to develope easy comminication with anyone who stay away from the each others. For an example, by introducing a mobile application such as \"WhatsApp\" which could allow to make vedio calls at any corner of the world. Therfore, these people tend to hold their view that it connect the diffrent nation of group of people within short time of period.",
        "On the other hand, in contrast of those people who argued that it create a damageing effect on baisc way to communicate with eachothers, they have reason to believe that because having everything is available on their computers by one click, this person doesn not want to come out from appartments. To illustarte that, many university introduce a online educational classes for those students who do not want to go and attend the face to face lectures in institute. Thus, this view has justified that it led to harmful action on socialization meetings.",
        "Finally, in my opinion, people should balacne thier perosnal life style when it comes for internet activity. In some cases it is really helpfull resource to make instant fund transfer. whereas by hacking the website can cause to threat of nationa security.",
        "In conclusion, Data connectivity can establish a long distanat relationship with forigner, and some oppsing the view that could be dangerous to collapes our fundamental way of engaging individuals."
