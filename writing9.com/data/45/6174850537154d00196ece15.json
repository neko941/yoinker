        "Believe it or not, there are really some university students thinking about how they will be paid when they start working. Even before they start university school, they are already thinking about their future, which is natural for everybody to realized before deciding on what to take in college and spend 4 years or more studying.",
        "In my opinion, even in a world where we are right now, it is not important how high you will get paid in your chosen career. I learned that in life, you have to enjoy work-life balance. High-paying jobs is not the answer that will give us a good life in the future.",
        "Yes, it is true that we need to make money for a living. But, how can we make money if we do not like what we are doing? There are lots of people who always think about money even if they don't really like what they are doing as their career. A typical example would be a student taking up a an engineer course but he doesn't like Math. He failed Math several times in highschool. We know that engineering has lots of Math subjects but because he knows that when he finishes  his study, he will have more money being an engineer, he will pursue it. Suddenly along the way in his studies, he failed Math and gave up.",
        "That is just one of the many stories I've heard in the education world. I firmly believe that if you are a hard worker, you will earn more as long as you enjoy what you are doing. For me, happiness is more important than money."
