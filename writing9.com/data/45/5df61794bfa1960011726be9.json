        "Nigeria is a country that suffers the adverse effects of epileptic electricity supply which of course would retard whatever benefits electric cars would bring. Hence, I disagree that All cars that burn fossil fuels should be banned and electric cars should replace them.",
        "I disagree that all cars that burn fossil fuels should be banned and electric cars should replace them bearing in mind the following reason which include: epileptic power supply and cost.",
        "The electric power generated in Nigeria is too epileptic for any electricity powered vehicle to thrive. Nigerians depend solely on generating plants to power their homes, offices and businesses; if this is the case, how would electric powered cars be charged to full capacity for use. The situation is so terrible that even in some places they do not see electricity for months owing to faults which the electricity distribution companies fail to detect and you want these same people go on depending on electric powered vehicle after all they have suffered powering their homes? It is not a feasible alternative to fossil fuel cars as such I maintain my stance that \"all cars that burn fossil fuels should not be banned\".",
        "Conclusively, I wish to reaffirm my stance by arguing against that all cars that burn fossil fuels should be banned and electric cars should replace them. This is because it is not a viable option for all countries. Many developed nations and countries would benefit but the less developed ones would suffer greatly as such, it is not a visible option. Apart from the benefits, the cost of changing all fossil fuel powered vehicles to electric powered vehicles is too high for givernments, who barely generates money to feeds it population and is heavily dependent on foreign aids, loans and support from developed nations."
