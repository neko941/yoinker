        "The maps below illustrate the changes in a university\u2019s sports centre at the moment and after its reconstruction.",
        "Having a glance at the present layout, we could easily recognize that the middle part, which includes the gym, seating, changing room, and 25m pool will not be changed afterward. Instead of the outdoor courts located on the West and East side, the future plans will eliminate them and place totally different types of facilities. After the redevelopment, in the West, this place is going to build a leisure pool, which is linked with the changing room in the South West. Furthermore, the sports shop will be placed near the changing room of the pool. On the other hand, the East side provides the sports hall and two dance studios. As the same in the West, there will be a changing room served for the sports hall and a caf\u00e9 next to it.",
        "Overall, the reconstruction of the university sports centre has obviously undergone some significant changes, hence it brought The most striking changes which are the development of the two outdoor courts and the addition of various sports facilities for any sports lovers or students to experience and enhance their physical health."
