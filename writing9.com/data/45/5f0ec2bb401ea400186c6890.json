        "In this modern world, it is true that science and technology proven to be more beneficial than any other categories like singers ,painters or actors.I completely agree with that and this esay will discuss about the importance of experts of these fields.",
        "To begin with, currently,the world is facing many serious issues, which wer not faced previously by human. To overcome with such problems ,scientists play a vital role rather than any musians or artists.Take an example of issue like Covid-19, almost every nation in the globe are suffering from this pandemic and unfortunately,still no proper vaccine or treatment are available in any countries. However,scientists are continuesly researching and experimenting ,in order to find a right way to fight with this cause. Thus ,they valued more ,as they constantly working on saving human lives.",
        "Another major chalenge faced by human is pollution, which leads to disasteral effect on the environment ,caused by increased number in the usuage of automobiles.",
        "Researches shows that a harmful gascalled gaseoline ,which produced from vechicles has adverse effect on the nature.In order to find some solutions and alternative for such issue, technological experts contributed to a great deal.For instance,they are researching on battery operated machines ,which are proven to be less harmful to environment than other fossil fuels such as petrol and disesl.They believe to change oil engines with battery operated one ,to ensure more safety for environment.",
        "From the above description, it is clear that scientists and experts in technology plays a significant role in the development and saving human lives ,thus become more valuable in modern world than any other area."
