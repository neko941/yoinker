        "Happiness is an element that everyone longs for, but not everyone can achieve this spice of life. Among them are some young adults who feel less jubilant despite their wealth, health and longevity. Several factors may drive this phenemenon, and I feel an intense need for immediate action.",
        "Clearly, some cogent reasons are behind this decreased level of happiness among those young people. The first one is workaholism. Wanting to boost their budget, those individuals are often overwhelmed by working excessively from dawn to dusk, making them exhausted and stressed every single day. Although they utilize this money to improve their well-being and life expectancy, overworking has already stolen the meaning of their life. Also, their wealth can open up countless opportunities in life ranging from fit-for-king houses to \u201980-day\u2019 world travels, which they do not want to miss out on. However, with the elapsing of time, this marvellous chances lose their importance for them, so not everything can attract them easily. Consequently, boredom engulfs their life.",
        "Curbing unhappiness of those people seem to be feasible. To begin with, they should be informed that true happiness does not solely lay in earning money. On the contrary, if they raise funds for charity works that help the orphans or the needy, they can actually find ultimate pleasure. For instance, what is more pleasing than seeing a young poor child who smiles from heart when he gets something new to wear?! Apart from that  they should take some break off their work and devote more time for their family and friends, since such people can bring value to one\u2019s life.",
        "In conclusion, it is unfortunate, but not surprising to observe some young adults who seek happiness irrespective of their money, health and longer life. I believe that they should alter their definition of happiness, as well as spend some of their budget for the needy and work less."
