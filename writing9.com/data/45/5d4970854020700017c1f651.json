        "The earth is surrounded by the environment and because of this the most important source for a living thing is environment and it is human beings responsibility to save environment . Many people believe that environmental protection responsibility is upon government because they have sufficient power to take any actions ,rules and making camps for the protection purpose. However, few people think that society and communities are responsible for making a natural things safer. I strongly support the idea of a governmental responsibility for environment.",
        "Many environmental protectionalists believe government is a capable enough to make a various laws for protection purpose. For example, the government authorities has a created a law on a chemical production factories that they should have a pollution with using machines and need to plant more trees in a chemical production areas as it helps to prevent pollution to protect environment .Even , authorities  also took actions on individuals for damaging and cutting trees because trees are very important part of a environment. As an example ,government organised the camp for environment protecting purpose and motivating people to grow more trees.",
        "On the other hand, human beings are one of the considerable part of environment .So, it is individuals responsibility to protect natural Sources from a hazardous things such as, a blazing fire can get a control by immediate human's actions. Moreover, not only  preventing has hazardous things but,  people also can improve and protect their surrounding areas by taking care of it.For example, making surrounding area clean and improving garbage system by creating more facilities  attracts people to dump  rubbish in a dustbin rather in an environmental places like a gardens.",
        "Overall, both plays an important role for protecting environment but, I strongly believe that government can tackle any environmental things because they have all rights for making environment safe. So ,the major responsibility of environment protection relay on government."
