        "Pay taxes to the government is a responsibility of every citizen of the countries who are earning. I disagree with the statement that individuals should not pay taxes to the state. The government runs from the taxes it collects. Taxes are collected by only those who earn above minimum limit.",
        "First and foremost, Tax money collected by government is used to fund basic amenities, provide various services to citizens and for government administration, projects, army and so on.it is not wrong to say \"country runs on taxes\". It is very important for government to make people pay taxes.",
        "On the other hand, some people do not want to pay taxes because their dissatisfaction with government's services which provide to them.",
        "They blame on government for such things like poverty, unemployment, but they are not wrong as tax revenue is misused in some unwanted things. Moreover, tax system is so complex which make problem to pay tax. Also, some other factors are responsible in this problem like, unequal tax structure and tax rate. So, they do not go forward to pay tax.",
        "Not paying taxes can drastically affect a country's revenue generation, my own country, India, for that matter, but then, it is equally desired that government come with a fair tax structure and also make people aware where the taxes are being diverted. Even decreasing tax rates can help a country to collect a tax. If government make a faster system to collect a tax and make a strict law for tax avoidance, it might be possible to increase number of tax payers.",
        "Summing up, I give my opinion by saying that is the duty of every citizen to pay tax and duty of government to use it appropriately for public."
