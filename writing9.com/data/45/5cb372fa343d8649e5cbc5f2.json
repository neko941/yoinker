        "Investing lots of money on arts and artist has become a trend. In certain demographics, they believe this is a waste of money, others, however, argue that money should be spent on the development of arts and support to artist should be given. This essay will discuss why money should be spent on artist but why it is more important to invest more in other areas, such as science and health.",
        "Nowadays, number of artists out there in the society has enormously increased. They are working on different areas to promote their works. This is considered as a good trend as it helps to promote country's cultural and traditional values to the world. For example, Sri Lankan government has started a film studio a few years back and after that, one of the film directors was able to get nominated for Oscar for his film about ancient Sri Lankan tradition. This gave good sign about the film industry as well as it was able to made a good impact on tourism industry. Due to this, governments should encourage artist by investing more money.",
        "Even though, it has an impact on country's economy and recognition, it seems like squandering money on unwanted stuff. There are number of significant health issues still persist throughout the world. Therefore, governments should focus on resolving those issues rather than spending money on arts and artists. For instance, Cancer has increasingly become a burning issue in every part of the world. In order to solve this, governments should invest more money on researches to find a solution for this. It is more important to spend money on these sectors than investing them on artist.",
        "Money should be spent on more towards finding solutions to current issues. This essay discussed why money should spent on betterment of artist and art but why governments must more focus on spending money in other areas such as science and health. In my opinion, I believe investing money in science and health is the best thing a government can do."
