        "In the opinion of some individuals,  the most effective way to drive employees to perform more diligently in their work is to base their remuneration on what they produce and sell. I am not totally bias about this view.  For instance, if an organisation decides to increase the salary or wages of each staff by 20% if each one of them can work three extra hours daily then the staff will be motivated to work harder for those extra hours.",
        "On the other hand, it is the factors which stir our instrinsic ambitions which truly motivate us, such as increased autonomy, acquiring new skills, access to self development,  being able to express oneself,  field trainings, vacations sponsored by the organisation, sense of belonging, job security, timely payment of remuneration and so on.",
        "Additionally,  working in a conducive  and comfortable environment also go a long way in initiating higher productivity  and performance.  Someone who works to the point of exhaustion every day in a dilapidated office building,  surrounded by people who resent him and reports to a manager that does not show any form of appreciation, will find it difficult to perform exceptionally well.",
        "To conclude, remuneration paid in accordance with the amount a worker produesor sells, is more of a sub-motivator than a prime mover."
