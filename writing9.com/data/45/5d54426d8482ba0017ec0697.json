        "Now a days, it is believed that new houses needs to be constructed but the only place that is left for construction is in Villages. Many people think that countryside shouldnot be used to construct  homes and they should be protected to preserve the countrys assets. In my opinion, new houses has to be built on countryside to a limited extent so that it reduces homeless people and it is also important to preserve the country side as they are primary loaction for Wild Life.",
        "Over the past 2years, there has been an abrnormal increase in the number of homeless people. By making the use of countryside and we can build new houses to accommodate the people that doesn't have shelter. This will decrease the number of homeless people that lack shelter. Austarlian Government has recently taken an initiative to build homes in their country side and the average of homeless people across the nation has fallen by 10% in one year.",
        "One of the reasons construction in countryside has to be limited because wild life may become extinct. It is often believed that  most of the wild life resides in Country side that inludes forests. To build homes, these forest lands need to be cleared which will be big threat to wild life. For example, Texas times published an article where it showed increase in the building construction in India had an adverse effect on their Wild Life making them extinct.",
        "In conclusion, many people believe that more homes must be built in the country side as that is the only place left. This idea is true to some extent as it helps to provide shelter to many homeless people however this could be a threat to the wild animals"
