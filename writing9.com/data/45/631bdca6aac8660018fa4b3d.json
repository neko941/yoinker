        "It goes without saying that the amount of international flights has increased, because modern people have more possibilities to travel as they started to earn more money. People\u2019s opinions differ, as to whether international travel should be restricted due to the negative impact on the environment, while others don\u2019t see any problem in it. Personally, I believe that international travel imposes some risks on the environment, but those effects can be mitigated.",
        "We aware that the ecological situation in the world is getting worse and worse, and, of course, partly it happens because of the fact that the number of flights has skyrocketed if we compare it with those 50 years ago. In addition, mankind is getting more and more capricious they are not satisfied with just ancient architecture, they want something unique some places that are vital ecosystem, especially those fragile areas like Antarctica. That is why many people opt for restricting international flights.",
        "In my opinion, as people are used to travel it will be very difficult to restrict international flights, and it will affect greatly tourist business, people will lose jobs.  I think that we should better try to find other solutions by explaining the impact of the flight to tourism so they can choose traveling by train, and as it has become more comfortable \\ faster and convinient, it will reduce any threats to the environment.",
        "In conclusion, there are risks to the environment from increased international travel, but such travel is important and any risks can be offset by different measures."
