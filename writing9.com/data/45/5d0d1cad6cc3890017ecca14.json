        "With a boom in the population over the last few decades, the number of young adults is considrably higher than older people. This is a drastic change compared to the population trend 50 - 60 years ago. This change has a myriad of advantages and disadvantages which I will list below.",
        "A major drawback of this trend is the indecisionve mentality. The youth usually quit or migrate between jobs is search of their passion. This increases the workload of superiors in companies as new individuals will have to be trained frequently. Additionally, students change their mind mid course in colleges which not only leads to a waste of finances butalso hampers the chances of another well deserving students in prestigious institues. This is evident in the current situation of youth in India where must comediqans and actors are IIT droplots.",
        "On the other hand, youngesters are bringing about a much required changes. Firstly, the quality of the workforce has changed as young people bring with them several new ideas. Moreover, they adapt much faster to new technology in comparison to the older employees. Secondly, the younger generation are open minded and generally more accepting of difference in the socity. The biggest evidence of this is the recent integration of the LGBTQ community, legalization of gay marriage and the large amount of coming out stories.",
        "Overall, it can be said that the advantages of a larger younger population outweigh the disadvantages. The have brought about a change in the world which going foword will increase teh quality if life of citizens."
