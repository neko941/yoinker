        "Traffic is always a pressing problem of the countries in every age. Some governments was lodged a method to solve this problem, which is increase money for tax on car drivers and use this to improve public transport. However, this solution has some advantages and disadvantages.",
        "The first advantages of this solution is an among of cars on the streets would decrease. Because money they have to pay very expensive, when they drive owners car, they have to pay toll, tax, petrol or diesel... So, traffic problem and pollution would be reduce. Next, when people do not drive owners car and public transportation more and more improve, they would go by it everywhere. Because, it is very cheap and enviromentaly friendly. And when public transport achive convinience enough for people go, they would travel by it.",
        "But, this method exists some disadvantages. Such as, at first time, when public transport improve no more and tax heavy surpass ability, they have to try by it to go to work and they could be late or walk very far. And, the number of money, which government earn by tax, toll... would less than before because people do not buy car, then the company do not produce to sell, so money earn less.",
        "In conclusion, to use method to solve traffic problem is possible but we need much time, and in that time, some disadvantages is always parallel with advantages."
