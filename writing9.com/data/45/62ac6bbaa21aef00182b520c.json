        "In our age Historians used the paintings to analyse the culture and lifestyle during ancient times, it won't be surprising if our generation will be evaluated by the cinema that we make in centuries to come.",
        "The idea of cinema as an important art form is to create a strong lasting memory in the audience about a particular topic and to make them think about that topic through the vision of a filmmaker.I do agree with the view that a good chunk of American film-producing companies promotes patriotism and the political interests of the American Government through their films.It's too obvious in many superhero movies and military operation movies that the audience regardless of race, region or culture will feel and enjoy those moments of patriotism. I feel some of these are effects of the deliberate effort by the government working closely with film production companies for decades. I believe this has helped the American govt to attract the young population to serve their armed forces.",
        "No government that wishes to preserve, preach and convey their culture shall not shy back from learning from the example of Hollywood and America. Each Govt should encourage their own regional movie production from acting, production, values, distribution and business.Government should make the initiative to ensure good quality movies are being produced which are appropriate for the age groups  and viewers. They must invest in institutions to brew out the best of actors, makers and other technicians who are competitive with the time and technology throughout the globe.The artists and technicians should be recognized timely for their great pieces of art and thereby encouraging the ideas and culture of a society.Ease of doing business for these movie productions by reducing taxation , better distribution and subtle political promotion can also be done.",
        "Government taking positive stands to support their film production houses and artists to promote , preserve and propagate their culture and values, sustains longer ."
