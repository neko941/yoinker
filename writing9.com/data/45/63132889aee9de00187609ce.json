        "An increasing number of 18-year-olds are moving out to live on their own after finishing high school. In this essay, I will point out the advantages and disavantages of this trend.",
        "On the one hand, the advantages of this trend is unlistable. Firstly, the high-school graduaters will be more independent about their financial statement. As they live alone, they will have to always keep track of their own money. For example, a 18-year-old is moving out. He must go to work to earn money and save every bit in order to pay his rent every month. Secondly, the high-school graduaters will be more responsible. For instance, my cousin just moved out and now she is much more responsible about her time and money than she did when she was still living with her parents constantly urging her to do things.",
        "On the other hand, the disadvantages of this trend should not be underestimated. Without parents' supervision, some people may not stay on the right track. Society temptations are everywhere and if people are not educated enough, they may be lured into bad things. It is true that nowadays there are many cases of young criminals stealing things or doing drugs.",
        "To conclude, a rising number of 18-year-olds are moving out. It is a fact that this trend has both pros and cons, still, parents and their offsprings should consider carefully if they want to move out."
