        "Over the past many years, there have been huge changes in how buildings are designed and built, from the introduction of indoor plumbing to luxurious extravagances like glass windows. There has also been a huge change in the construction industry as a whole, which has affected housing for everyone.",
        "Firstly, one of the main changes in construction is the notion of \u201cgoing green.\u201d Fewer plastics are used during construction and most materials are locally sourced now. Besides, it helps cut down cost, emissions and even extend the life of the home or other building.",
        "Secondly, many new architects look to show movement within the construction of the building itself. Many buildings are no longer traditional rectangles built on top of one another with partitions to include walls and rooms. In addition, many designers look towards more natural, organic items in life and construct the building accordingly.",
        "Thirdly, allowing natural light in helps cut energy costs from relying on light. As building materials have become stronger in recent years, traditional architecture is now allowing the usage of more windows. Also, instead of a single window letting in a small amount of light, a wall can be nearly completely constructed from windows, if someone is looking for this kind of look.",
        "In conclusion, the buildings of today display that modern architecture is on the rise. So, the past many years has seen a lot of change in the housing industry and it\u2019ll be interesting to see what the future holds for construction in the years to come."
