        "LTo live in a foreign country where a  native language is required to speak can create severe problems both in social and daily life, I completely disagree with this view.",
        "When someone is living in a country and speaking a native language can not cause crucial problems. The First reason is, nowadays students who intend to pursue higher study abroad are bound to fulfill the language requirements; otherwise they will not be qualified to apply in international universities. Hence for having language skill, international students can socialise with students as well as capable of following lectures that reduces the prospects of facing any problems in their lives. On the other hand, immigrants who are going to foreign countries get the opportunity of participating language courses provided by the government. For instance, United Kingdom has been providing English language course for the newly arrived foreigners: where in Germany many universities have taken initiatives of mandatory six months long intensive German language course for the foreign pupils.",
        "In foreign countries people can face social and practical problems not only for language but for other factors as well. Firstly, students may pass their language tests but if they are not financially affluent or have not secured fully funded scholarships, to cover their living costs and tution fees, will encounter problems to bear their daily expenses and continue their study.Secondly, apart from the cause of language, religion has already created conflicts and polarisation in different spheres of people's life who are living abroad. As in today's modern world religious extremism and conservative views have reached in an alarming state that people have become susceptible in coping with foreigners' and embracing their customs and cultures. In the long run, because of this the social bond in the communities are lessening.",
        "In conclusion, nowadays people are aware of the necessity of language and also acquire skills in foreign language as they plan to live in abroad. Therefore students and immigrants do not face difficulties in a foreign country for the language but mainly for monetary and religious factors.",
