        "While some people trust their primary feelings about an individual\u2019s personality because they argue these judges are totally accurate, others do not judge a person\u2019s personality rapidly because they believe first impressions are not correct. In the following paragraphs, I shall explain this subject.",
        "On the one hand, primary feelings are referred to previous experiences which everyone had experienced in the span of their life. That is to say, people usually judge new persons at the first sight by their old observations in face of various people from a particular society. For instance, they acquire some information about youth who get a tattoo on all of their body from their life environment which have influenced on their first feelings in encounter with juveniles with tattoo. So, our emotions that emerge by a glance at someone actually are collection of observations and experiences which not only shape our mind about our surroundings, but also, have influence on our judgements.",
        "On the other hand, as our emotions are in a mutual relation with our hormones, it may impact on our judgements. In other words, our judgements can be wrong due to changes in our inner metabolism. For example, if women\u2019s be in monthly period, their suffer will impact on behaviours that can lead to mistakes for judgements at a glance. Moreover, a vast amount of Hyman\u2019s emotions are under influence by unconsciousness. In short, our feelings are not understandable for ourselves that it makes them unreliable. Because they do not have any reasonable reasons.",
        "In conclusion, although, people\u2019s first emotions about others may be correct sometimes, these impressions are not suitable sources to judge someone rapidly."
