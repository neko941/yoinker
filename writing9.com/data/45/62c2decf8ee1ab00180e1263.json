        "Education has been increasing in importance. Education might be expensive in certain countries. I believe it. Every single person needs to be educated.but some of them can't\u00a0 All benefit from education.If the government spent money on their education, it would benefit. such as saving money and encouraging the children.",
        "Firstly, people must save money for their future if the government gives sufficient scholarships. It affects people's lives. People can easily reach every school, even if they are poor. It improves the education system. This improvement increases the percentage of people who have got a certificate.My father hadn't finished school if they were expensive.",
        "Secondly, the government should pay some of the cost. It is necessary because it improves people's morals.People can afford it if the government does not foot the bill.In addition, it's necessary for the improvement of the country. People can be educated and even attend school without free education.Children are the future of this country. They represent their country. Their education is essential. My nephew is 10 years old. His family hasn't got enough money, but the government pays her school costs so she can go to school and get an education.",
        "Thirdly, this is an advantage due to encouraging children to be educated and increasing concertation. Furthermore, they like their jobs so much. They have been closely connected to the school.Their curiosity is increasing because of free education.For example, children have no fee problem because their school is free. They focus on their education and job improvement.",
        "consequently education expenses\u00a0 might be\u00a0 expensive.goverment\u00a0 must do something\u00a0 to\u00a0 \u00a0preserve\u00a0 \u00a0that.it has to be ensure\u00a0 every single\u00a0 can\u00a0 afford to go to school\u00a0 without paying\u00a0 fee. in my opinion this is big advantage for every single\u00a0 children. it will affect\u00a0 positively\u00a0 their\u00a0 life. for example\u00a0 recently every s\u0131ngle person need\u00a0 to be literated. if\u00a0 school fee is inaffordable\u00a0 \u00a0children cant\u00a0 attend\u00a0 school and it\u00a0 afffect\u00a0 negatively\u00a0 their lifestyle."
