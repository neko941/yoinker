        "With the advancement of technology,the trend of following online ways in order to get education has been increasing since last few decades. Some masses are in the favour of this new mode of learning whereas other do not want to change the traditional ways of enhancing their knowledge. This essay will not only discuss both the views but my opinion also will be highlighted while concluding this.",
        "In the inception, there are myriad benefits of talking online classes. One of them is saying time as well as travelling expenses. While opting for online classes, students do not need to commute from one place to another. They can take classes just either by sitting at home or by staying at any comfortable place they like. Consequently, pupils can save huge time along with money which they can use in other important task. Apart from this learner can get plethora of option to choose from, while commencing any course. Through online ways , despite being in countryside, people can reach out the tutors not only of other states but also from overseas. For instance, people who want to learn any foreign language may find it difficult to hire highly skilled teacher and learn from their own place unless they use online modes where native speakers of that language can give tutions to them in their preferred time",
        "On the flip side,traditional way of attending classes have unpteen advantages as well as masses prefer to attend class in person because it makes clear doubts of subject. As,in class, other students with different intellectual abilities study together, in case, other students enquire about anything on the basis of their confusion, rest of the classmates also get benefits from it by hearing others perspective. In addition to this ,by studying knowledge than studying alone",
        "To recapitulate, although both modes have their own advantages to the students, I advocate that new ways of getting education should be adopted by everyone due to its flexibility and worldwide eminent mentors who are there to guide the learners"
