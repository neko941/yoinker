        "Children are the future of tomorrow, learning in a different environment from where they would regularly study would allow them to explore and assimilate differently. I would state that I strongly affirm  that it is valuable. My essay would aim to expatiate more on my stance.",
        "Studies outside of the same location will  be more engaging for children. The common distractors a child would encounter while at school, would be eliminated  . This would in turn allow the child to have maximum focus on learning while sidelining detractors. For example, in classrooms seating is the same all the time, the pupils also go over repeated routines daily, that can become boring. It gets harder to keep children engaged . A different learning experience might be what is needed to restart their batteries again.",
        "Also, due to the disparity and differences in social economic status of some families. Social trips are not a priority. It is then left for the school management to organise and plan such learning experiences for the children as it would provide the opportunity for children who would otherwise not have had a chance to visit Community businesses, Local monuments , and Historic buildings with their own parents to do so.",
        "Based on these, I would reiterate my stand stating I strongly agree that pupils learning away from their regular learning spaces at school is imperative and would contribute positively ."
