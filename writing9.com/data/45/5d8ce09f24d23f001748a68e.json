        "Today society is a modernized society where each and everyone is busy in their phones, well y not? Cause internet is providing so many things right from shopping to booking tickets, you name it and internet has it. But despite all these it even has some disadvantages. Both will be discussed by the end of this essay.",
        "Internet a word which was not known until the  19th century, from the 20th century onwards this word became an addiction amongst the world. Many different companies such as amazon, flip kart and other multinational firms have established their business over the internet for the convenience of people. They provide a large range of of goods that consumers require on their day to day basis. They even facilitate the consumers by providing door to door service so that the consumers are satisfied .",
        "But apart from online shopping consumers can now also order groceries medicines, shoes and even can make payment and book tickets online using e-payment. Internet has been providing so many things that a consumer names it and gets it at a cheap price.",
        "But apart from all these advantages internet also has some disadvantages such as it has become easier for the hackers to get the information of consumers card details by scamming them and by creating fake messages.",
        "Hence, one should use the internet wisely and should be aware of the facts that hackers use. Banks and other firms trading online always spread awareness regarding the scams so that people stay aware."
