        "In this new age, the demand for the energy resources, especially for the gas and oil has been gradually increasing since population of the world has an accelerated rhythm thus new virgin areas for the purpose of exploring new sources has become an inevitable consequence. This new trend apparently gives rise to some sort of advantages however I strongly argue that the handicaps it harbours has more to mention.",
        "It is strongly believed that the more demand increases the more capital market prices. In this aspect, governments claim that new research in the field of untouched horizons is a crucial necessity in order to both meet the energy demand and decrease the prices. For instance, before the exploration of the America continent, gold and silver used to be much more valuable in the Europe however after the world expansion and the transfer of valuable mines from the America towards rest of the World the market price fairly declined since the gap between the demand and production had narrowed down. In a similar way, the new energy fountains would affect the budget of consumers in a positive manner with fairly margin of drops would stand at the expenses.",
        "On the other hand, the new searches among the seas and forests contain a bunch of downsides as well. To start with, it is arguably the last thing for individuals to wish that more catastrophic actions on the natural life for the new fossil energy sources while the world has already had trouble with global warming. The intervention of the human beings through the habitats especially the oceans in this topic, might be roof for more serious damages stem from devastation of animals and plants and their natural living areas. Apart from that, a competition over the potential energy mines may be the leading factor for upcoming rivals and even the wars which would end up with more economical and environmental destruction. For instance, the contemporary the Sea Sovereignty Agreement acted between Turkey and Libya had shuffled the cards regarded with Mediterranean Sea and conflicts have risen about which country holds the authority to make investigations which targets the new oil beds. Moreover, the world has witnessed a number of wars or military interventions throughout Pakistan, Iraq, Suria and Egypt in which potential petrol sources take place. Thus each country, even the ones not shared same continent with the mentioned Asian and Middle East countries, found right to join this brand-wagon.",
        "On balance, initiating the new possible researches among the untouched areas have both the advantages and drawbacks. However, I definitely possess the idea of that downsides of this tendency overweighs the positive aspects and hopefully the world learn how to handle energy consumption and does not need to look for the new springs in the intemerate lands."
