        "Nowadays, museums are the only places to know in depth of our heritage and ancestral daily routines. As there is no other better option to know about our history. In my opinion, I believe it is worth spending small amount to know our heritage. As it will reduce burden of maintaining museums on government. While other museums where there is no charges to visit, it is not that well maintained neither guide to give more or in depth information.",
        "Museums are very costly to maintain, as there are many things to keep safe and they are very precious. There are various things in the museums to look after and maintain without losing the originality. One good example is Museum in the state of Hyderabad India, which consist of the Great Nizam\u2019s complete empire clothing\u2019s and the huge military armors with various kinds of weapons, which were used on that time are maintained by the government of Hyderabad state. By charging small amount from the visitors. Creates seriousness in the visitors mind.",
        "On the other hand, free museums are not well maintained and not are not in proper standards.  Those they follow the principle of equality by not charging money from poor or rich. By not charging money from the visitors it is very difficult to bear cost to look after the whole museum. Such as, Shivaji museum in India, is free but the museum is not well organized and there is no one to give the in depth information about the special events of that time.",
        "To conclude, for the best experience paid museums are better in many ways. As they are well maintained and organized. While, free museums will not do that much impact on the person\u2019s mind as they are not that much well look after. Though there are draw backs of charging but advantages are more for paid museums."
