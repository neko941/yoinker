        "In the entire world we have symbols of our ancient which have been protecting from them on museums. Some people believe they have a priority target only on their profession product which is produced in their own society in spite focus on foreign country's art. I believe we have to defence  both of them and I want to explain why in the next two principle.",
        "Firstly, Some of them are handsel that other nations gave to us. For instance, in Iran we have lots of gifts from other countries which they donated to our king as preciate and thankful or because of a ceremony. In ,fact they are gifts and demonstrate to us how important we were to another country and showcase the tradition of their people.",
        "Secondly, In my view, Inside all art includes  its artist's passion and intellectual, unique mind, and also worth which we have responsibility to conserve all the arts even if they aren't for ours. For example, yesterday I visited a royal place in Niavaran Tehran and in the art gallery I saw a beautiful work of the reputiutial artist (Picasso) which was really astonishing paint and donate to Reza shah in 1962.",
        "On the contrary, Somebody thinks focusing and protecting  foreign land need spending a lot of human power and money.",
        "in cunclusion, I want to restate on my opinion that all arts have worth inner and if they were gift from other country show us historical value, So not only do we have assist on them but also we should preciate that because of their importance to us."
