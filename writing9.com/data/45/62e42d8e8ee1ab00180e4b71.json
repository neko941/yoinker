        "Most often hosting an occasion in the society tends to bring families and loved ones together.  A few numbers of people is of the ideology that most ceremonies such as weddings, birthday parties and other ocassions that seems fit to be celebrated is a waste of resources whereas others thinks otherwise. In this , essay I will elaborate on both views.",
        "Hosting people on various ocassions is of great value to the society because it gives individuals great opportunities to change environment for example , an invite to the United States for a wedding ceremony it will glamour the invitee having such a priviledge to explore into another country. It powers one on one communication with families and friends who would honor the invitation as well. Furthermore, it creates revenue for the government in raising funds used in the reconstruction and development of the country. Also, it strengthens the family bond amongst one another , consequently , one can be able to bring back new ideas back to their country. It enhanced ones knowledge into knowing different cultures and settings of other community or country . Also, It exploits ones knowledge about new cuisine and hence , brings back memories.",
        "Nothwithstanding , funds are been lost and sometimes unforseen incident could occur . For example, in a situation where by invitees are been terrorized on there way by criminals it will demoralized people's emotion. Again due to the current economy some people thinks that saving such amount of money will affect one's financial status.",
        "In summary, regardless of the expenses that will surface and the negative beliefs of some people I am of the opinion that coming together and supporting one another when necessary is paramount."
