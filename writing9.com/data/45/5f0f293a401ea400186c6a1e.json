        "Countries has started to be seen almost same , as people can reach same products no matter where they are . I completely evaluate this situation as negative , since I think that although \u0131t may affect positively both economy and people ,it damage the culture of nations'.",
        "On the one hand , \u0130t is true that with the help of internet countless items become visibly achievable . Because the number of online shopping website which allows people over the world to attain all the products such as books, games , clothes or electronic devices has rised nowadays. As a result, countries starts to look like each other as people follow often same trends. For example,  identical fashion flows can be seen in everywhere in the world such as wearing jeans or t-shirts. This case may increase the consumption and therefore affect the economies of countries. Furthermore, accesibilty of different product  gives people more options while purchasing something and therefore people can get the things that they need cheaper and better quality.",
        "On the other hand,some people claim that using the same products may destroy the culture . I completely  agree with those people due to the fact that following the same trends may cause people to lose their consciousness. For example , after the globalization of Zara , a clothes brand in Australia which produce racy dress,  women from muslim countries have been found to change their apperance thogh those type of clothes were not appropriate according to their ethnicity and belief .",
        "In conlusion , even if being able to buy same products is useful in terms of economy and people ,drawbacks of this situation  overweigh the benefits , because it may lead to extinction of cultures as long as people act without thinking while they are purchasing something they need."
