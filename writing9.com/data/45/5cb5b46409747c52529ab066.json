        "It is believed by a few individuals that secondary school programs should include volunteer services as a mandatory part. I profoundly agree with this notion because it inspires children to comprehend social responsibility; character development whereas it may affect adversely. The key points need to be discussed.",
        "To embark with, inculcating the habit of unpaid community service is one of the key elements to make students responsible towards the society. It expresses pupils would indulge themselves to make the societies better which directly contribute to improve a nation\u2019s wellness. The national service scheme of India; for example, is a program run by government in many schools to promote the prosperous future of country; it encourages pupils to acknowledge their responsibility not only for society but for country as well.",
        "Scrutinizing further, volunteer work motivate students to upgrade their character. What it supports children can get exposure to society which triggered myriads skills into them like communication, behavioral and feeling of empathy; needed to develop an acceptable character. In this manner, voluntary activities teach students to value what they posses and in turn contribute to their personality development.",
        "On the other side, irrefutable fact is that many children may misuse the time allocated for these activities by considering it; an excursion to enjoy with friends rather than learning an experience. As a result, they might lack behind in holistic development.",
        "In conclusion, although compulsory unrewarded social services have a few drawbacks, it is still offers enormous benefits in shaping a child as a socially responsible citizen and inseparable personality development. Therefore, I firmly agree children ought to participate in such services."
