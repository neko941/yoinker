        "Dangerous sports need to be banned as thought by few people whereas other people think negative to this idea. Extreme sports offer many advantages including adrenaline rush, sense of achievement, boost confidence and release stress. However, there are many risks associated with it. I moderately disagree for banning the risky games as far as the participants know the risks associated with them.",
        "There are many people who like adventurous sports because of many benefits which come with it. Individuals like such games as the benefits are adrenaline rush, increase confidence of participants and help in releasing negative energy repressed in the body. In US only, there are teen rehabilitation centres which guide and prepare teens for thrilling games so that they can quit drugs. Which in turn, boosts their confidence and the participants get a chance to socialise too. Therefore, a dangerous sport is helpful when done in calculated way.",
        "Everything comes with pros and cons and so is extreme sports like bull racing, sky diving, scuba diving, wrestling and mountain climbing naming a few. Along with many benefits, the aforementioned games are life threatening and there are chances of serious injuries which can lead to paralysis or even death. For example, according to United States parachuting association, about 25 people die every year of skydiving in US. Moreover, wrestling or bull racing may lead to severe injuries which can end up in physical disability. Hence, some people argue to ban these sports.",
        "This essay discussed the merits and demerits of extreme sports. I moderately disagree in prohibitting these games. The participants should be fully aware of the risks involved and they should be properly trained before playing any dangerous game."
