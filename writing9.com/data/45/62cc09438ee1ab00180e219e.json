        "In recent days, most of the citizen thinks that the government must allow their people to gain access to our updated technology to have a quality of living. Although some think that studies should be no charge for the people. In the forthcoming paragraph i will discuss the two ideas with the relevant examples that I think it is better for me and for other as well.",
        "To begin, the constitution who are controlling for the innovation of technology and should give indirect access to our latest technology. Hence, about the technology of the phone how to build a quality phone so that people who are trying hard to build their own modern life will gain extra income for their everyday life to achieve their goal and be successful in time. one more example is about the technology in the website government should allow the people to upload relevant information to the site. So that, people who have knowledge in doing that thing can also survive in our growing technology. Although, government give access to people whom abuse should have penalties.",
        "To continue, the goverment should give free education for our updated technology so that not only rich community will learn because sometimes we forgot the poor people not to mention those who are in a remote areas who do not have enough money for their studies. To support them for their financial and knowledge government should consider giving free education to innovativ technology. Although, it was free people should push hard to achieve what they are longing for so that in the future no regrets  because the government gives what is necessary.",
        "In my opinion, giving privilege to both parties is better not only for the people but also for the nation because they are the people of the country. If those people succeed the government will earn also in terms of tax, government permits in their business perhaps many people now are just looking for a start so that they can contribute to our nation even though in small things."
