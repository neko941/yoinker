        "Playing sports can  bring plethora benefit to an person despite of the fact that whether it is  team sports or an individual game. Some people think that team sports can have more advantages than individual sports.This essay will discuss why team sport is more beneficial than the other but why single player is less when compared.",
        "Team sports like football, basketball etc can help each individual to understand the importance of each player and unity. Without unity and strength, the team cannot achieve its goal. This helps the person to build his moral values in game as well as in his life. For instance, In football all players play for the benefit of the team. Inorder to do that, the players have to be united and be selfless to pass on the ball to score the winning point. Qualities like these makes the person in helping his mind to be selfless and teaches him the importance of unity.",
        "On the other hand, individual sports has it own pros and cons. Sports like tennis and swimming helps the player to think of his own victory. This eventually makes him to loof after his own family, his jon and his happiness which is the result of the way he was bought up because of his sports. The mentality to care for others is reduced in them. For example, if a tennis player loses his game, the player's emotion can be clearly seen in form of aggression or sad, he cannot share his loss to anyone. This could lead him to face his problem alone in life as well. So they tend not to depend on another person when they are in trouble, they have the courage to face it alone.",
        "In my opinion, every sports has it own positive and negative side. When compared team sports can help in shaping a person for better socitey while individual lacks in it."
