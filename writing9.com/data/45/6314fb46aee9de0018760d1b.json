        "Some may think that purchasing should be done when it's required, but in ,contrast some may think that it should be done based on advertisements. I concise at the given statement, and will be discussing  it.",
        "in today, workaholic busy schedule people don't have much time to research about the product which they need, also searching for any product or item on google we get n number of option, then as search for the ,product the advertisement of the brand starts coming to our emails or while browsing youtube. this takes our attention towards that product and we end up buying that product without  its need.for instance",
        "I think if there is no need of purchasing, one should ignore the ads that pop up on our screens or television. by ignoring we can save a lot and also if there is a need of buying that product we should always look for  other options in the market. for ,example my brother always buys unrequired things by watching advertises and this leads to extra money expenditure and no savings.",
        "nowadays companies or big brands keep more funds for marketing because they know everything depends on the marketing level. we should not buy anything on the bases of ads and promotions, because it's a trap  that we can end up buying.that's why I would like to suggest that before taking anything everyone should do their own research."
