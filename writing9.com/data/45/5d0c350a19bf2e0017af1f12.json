        "In recent years, the discriminations that existed between men and women have decreased significantly. Now both genders perform similar roles in every field. However, there are still certain groups of individuals who argue that men are inherently more competitive than their women counterparts. This essay will argue why the aforementioned ideology is absolutely inaccurate as men and women are co-existing in harmony in most workplaces irrespective of their physical and mental differences.",
        "To begin with, it cannot be disputed that men are physically superior to women, therefore, the tasks that require physical strength is often dominated by males. For instance, various competitive sports like football, boxing, wrestling etc. are most often played by men. Such sports are not chosen by males only because they are competitive, but also because they have high physical endurance level. However, in recent decade women are also observed to participate in a variety of competitive sports and they display the same level of competitiveness towards their opponents just like males do. This proves that when placed in an identical situation both the genders will behave in a similar manner.",
        "On the other hand, fields that do not require a great deal of physical strength consists of both men and women working alongside each other. In current years, large multinational companies usually appoint women in the high administrative positions as women pay more attention to details and are quick to overcome any of their shortcomings and earn a promotion. Males on the other hand are quick to make decisions. All these qualities are essential in a work place and makes both the genders highly competent",
        "In conclusion, although due to the aggressive nature of men and the unequal physical strength  they may seem more competitive but substantial evidences exist which states otherwise. Therefore, it is reasonable to say that both genders are highly flexible to changing their behavior based upon the situations they are placed in and the roles they are supposed to fulfill."
