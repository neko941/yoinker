        "Some people do not have problem in spending their free time with their officemates whereas some like to maintain their personal life isolated from their professional life. Both the sides of the life are important, however, personal life should not mingle with work life.",
        "In this highly competitive era, professionals go extra mile in building relationship with their colleagues by investing their leisure time with them. Moreover, this is particularly true with managers who wants to inculcate team spirit in their subordinates. Eventually, increasing productivity of entire team, since everyone participate positively and support each other on any project for their team. Additionally, as per studies presented in UK, employees remain loyal to their bosses if they share strong bond with them. Therefore, there is well known quote which says, \u201cPeople do not leave companies, but they leave their bosses\u201d.",
        "On the other side, some strongly vouch for work life balance and wants both the parts of life independent of each other. The reason behind such behavior is sparing dedicated time for the family and give complete attention to loved ones. Hence, individuals\u2019 can provide time to multiple events in his family for example, attending his kids\u2019 school events, taking wife for picnic and many more. On top of that a person can be more productive at work front, if personal life is stress free.",
        "In my opinion, utilization of weekends with family members can hugely benefit a person on both work as well as personal front, as this helps person to rejuvenate and allow him to concentrate well where ever he is allocating his time."
