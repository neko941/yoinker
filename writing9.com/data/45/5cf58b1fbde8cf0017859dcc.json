However, these developments in IT are likely to have more negative effects than positive in the future.\nTo what extent do you agree with this view?",

        "Despite the obvious growth in areas of information technology such as world wide web and communication by email that we have experienced in the last two decades, there are still few concerns expressed recently about its downsides which might exceed the benefits. I absolutely agree with this notion, and will, therefore, examine some of these potential issues in this essay",
        "To begin with, the internet is the major cause of lack of human interaction in the society. Surfing the internet is addictive because there are numerous interesting activities that can be performed which would definitely catch the attention of individuals. For instance, people exchange pleasantries on Facebook and learn vocational training on Youtube for a long period of time. By doing this, we tend to distance ourselves from humans and glue our face to the computer. As a result, physical human interaction will reduce and lack of empathy will increase.",
        "In addition, technology is the root cause of increased unemployment rate in some sections. Although there are visible jobs created in the telecommunication unit, the growth of email has caused the downfall of post office and mail box. Not only did we sent letters through emails, we also attached and exchanged files through the internet. To illustrate, on the 5th of May 2014, Cussons Nigeria Limited sent my appointment letter for the position of cashier through their official email address. Whereas, this would have been carried out by an officer of the Nigerian Post Office. This means that technology has replaced human.",
        "In conclusion, even though information technology is beneficial to individuals",
        "by enhancing prompt service delivery, the negative effects such loss of job and lack human feeling are unacceptable. Therefore, as we delve deeper in the usage of information technology, the negative effects have more impact on us"
