        "It seems unusual but true that unemployment raye is an inevitable factor in present scenario. There has been a ranging debate on this concern, while some people believe that primary education is only necessary for children to get a job hence they are unable ti accomplish better job opportunities while centralized to their higher education. However, i believe that secondary education is not a hindrance to get an occupation.",
        "The fitst mitigating factor is that higher education needs a considerable time period to prepare a juvenile to a professional individual, but it contributes cooperate and professional to a juvenile. As a result of these practices, it is beneficial to deal with the cooperate world and professionals. And also higher education either inculcate the discipline and how to elaborate the logical thinking in a profession. This can not master from primary education still it will neither teach how to behave with professionals nor build analytical ability which is pivotal in the work place. On the other hand, secondary education create broad of opportunities in job market not only for theoretical application but also it instills important skils; self-discipline, organization and being able to finalize a task from start to end. Namely, it assists turn into a more professional individual with many work-related skills.",
        "Consequently, the role of primary education is to determine broad-based enlargement of disciples. Yet, ensuring that all students are able to develop their cognitive, social, emotional, cultural and physical skills to the best way of their abilities, preparing them for their further academic carrier. Therefore, a disciple should engage with higher education.",
        "It strikes me that myriads of countries confront with their higher unemployment rate due to the lack of resources. It is necessary to engage with secondary education hence it assits to create a considerable demand than primary education. However, with a bit of knowledge juveniles would not be able to achieve their target.",
        "To sum up, it is true that secondary education is not a cause for higher unemployment rate of a country. However, individuals who wish to engage with a profession should ascertain with higher education. Otherwise primary education is not enough to deal with the cooperate community."
