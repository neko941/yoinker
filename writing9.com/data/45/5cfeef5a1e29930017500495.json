        "The country I am living in comprises nuclear power and had undergone several nuclear tests in history. They are one of the most expensive technology experiments that countries conduct and exhibit their power in the world. In my viewpoint, my country and other countries in the world should continue using nuclear power for innovation and experiments.",
        "First of all, countries use these technologies to protect their people from external threats and war zones. Nuclear helps in building new weapons and atoms for wars and to compete their opposition countries. For example, in Pakistan, nuclear is used to construct new weapons which help its army in fighting against the enemies.",
        "In addition to this, country grows when they conduct research and then experiment with such technologies like nuclear and thermal powers. For instance, in USA  separate institution like NASA works on innovation and experiments to create new technological solutions to fight with the enemies.",
        "On the contrary, some people believe that the use of nuclear power will cause extreme damages to the infrastructure of the country, severe health diseases and environmental hazards. Such as many years ago, in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, a nuclear explosion has caused breath taking diseases which not only affected the people living in that area but also the four generations coming after them.",
        "To conclude, despite of health issues due to these nuclear powers, countries should use them in innovative and beneficial experiments for the growth of the country."
