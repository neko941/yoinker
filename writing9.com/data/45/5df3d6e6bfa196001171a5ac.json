        "In today's world, technology improved a lotmore , from driving on horses to fly in the air. Now a days, people are effecting from the environmental problems like cyclones, wild fires and deforestration. These can be reduced using modern techniques by depicting them in advance. I strongly agree with the statement and I would express my view in the fallowing paragraph.",
        "The temparatures are raising from the decades and this causes cyclones and tsunamis espicailly because world is covered with 75 percent of water. The improved technological equipement helps to predict the effect before certain period of time it actually happens. For example, the weather forecast department in India predicted the cyclone at perticular area and evacuated the people from that location to different place. As a result, the goverenment of India saved lakhs of people from the situation.",
        "Wild fires are common issue we are facing at present environment and this can be controlled using modren flywater jets and fire engines. By this air transportation of water can save lot of time and could save massive forest from fire. The wild fires occured in the Amazon forest is controlled using the helicopters and waterjets. So that endangered species and animals are saved since the fires did not spread to far.",
        "The techonolgy in the current world is playing a vital role by pridicting the wheather and wildfires. Not only this two issues, each and every human problems related to natural environmental need technology to prevent from accidents. So, i stongly agree with the topic as stated above."
