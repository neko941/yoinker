        "In the modern era, stars gain an excessive amount of money rather than politicians. This essay will outline why such a trend occurs and suggests the positive effects on the trend.",
        "To begin with, there are certain reasons why celebrities are richer than politicians. While people tend to think that politicians are boring, people believe that stars such as musicians, singers, and athletes are interesting. As the majority of public is interested in VIPs, people want to be like them. As a result, enormous attention to celebrities brings about an advertising effect. For example, recent media in Korea reports that a positing that is written by Hae gyo Song, who is famous actor, is valued almost 500,000 dollars. As the example clearly illustrates, celebrities\u2019 popularity plays a key factor in earning a lot of money,",
        "Regarding this, successful stars\u2019 popularity have advantages. Firstly, if a person becomes a world-wide-famous star he would have a lot of fans over the world. Therefore, not only can he earn money from local population, but he may also gain money from other countries. Since he have to pay taxes to the government, more state-funds can be collected by him, thereby leading to using funds to other urgent issues such as public service in the country. In addition, if a celebrity is sympathetic or wants to have a good reputation, he may donate money to charities. Since people want to mimic celebrities\u2019 behaviors, such a kind trend would be spread among the public. For instance, a survey conducted by Korea University has revealed that celebrities\u2019 behavior has more power to change public\u2019s awareness than politician\u2019s words. Hence, famous stars\u2019 high-financial standards influence the public positively.",
        "In conclusion, since the population is more interested in celebrities than politicians, the reputation of the celebrities is a key factor in earning a lot of money. Not only can their money contribute to support the government, but it may also trigger the public to donate for charities."
