        "The provided image illustrates the silkworm\u2019s life cycle and silk cloth\u2019s steps in production.",
        "From an overall perspective, there are four significant steps in silkworm\u2019s wheel-of-life which are egg, larva, cocoon and adult moth, and there are six in silkworm\u2019s cloth production, namely, selecting, boiling, unwinding, twisting, weaving, and dyeing.",
        "According to the first diagram, the life cycle commences when the silk moth lays its eggs on the mulberry leaves. Then, it takes ten days to become a silkworm larva. After four to six weeks, they turn into silk thread. Three to eight days later, the larva changes into a cocoon. After sixteen days, the larva finally transforms into the adult moth.",
        "To make the silk cloth in the second diagram, the selected cocoons are first boiled in boiling water in a container. Second, in order to be threaded in 300 to 900 meters, the cocoons must be unwound. Fourth, the silk moth's thread must be twisted before it can be dyed. Finally, the silk cloth is weaved after it has been dyed."
