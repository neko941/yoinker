        "Sports play an crucial role in our life.Some school of thought believes that taking part in game is vital, however, another school of thought refutes it by arguing that it is only for relaxation and rejuvenation.This essay will elaborate on both these viewpoints, and explain why the former choice is the ideal one.",
        "There are several reasons why performing in athletic is essential. To begin with,they offer better health. The participating in games can make physically fit and turn to be more health conscious which results into superior healthy lifestyle.

It is the plateform to showcase  talent and earn the reputation through representing the nation. For instance, badmintan player P.V Sindhu participated in Common Wealth Games and won the gold medal that moments makes the Indian country proudful. These factors admire the youth of the nation.",
        "However, there are myraid arguments in the favour of considering the sports as refreshment task. Firstly, in these fast paced of life due to hustle and bustle people needs break inorder to make them de-stress and loosen-up. Generally, at that time masses spread sometime after fun games with their near one and loved one that consequently lead them to be in chillout mood and construct strong relationship. Secondly, due to sedentary lifestyle pupils require some strength building activites, for these the preference  goes for distinct sports, which sequentially compel themselves from boring heptic routine. Despite of all these factors, physical recreation is more fulfulling for spending spare time than making it more viable.",
        "In a nutshell, this essay has described the benefits of foremost games as well as for refreshen. Although they have the equal benefits, the latter choice is ideal as it provides strength core to the body and mental recreate which uplift their confidence."
