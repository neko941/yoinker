        "The things people do and learn during their early years are one of the factors that shapes their characters.That's why teenagers free time must be planned carefully in order to be used effeciently for their benefit and the benefit of the society.",
        "In my opinion, teenagers should be required to participate in community services for a specific number of hours during their summer or winter holidays and the application of this concept took place in some countries as they demand a specific hours of service from teenagers for them to graduate from highschool and that showed a remarkable results in teenagers overall behaviour.",
        "There are several community services through which teenagers can participate for example, they can help in geriatric homes as that will present a good chance for teenagers to learn from their elders and in return they can keep them company and spend some time with them.",
        "Moreover, teenagers can be asked to help in cleaning their towns and that should teach them to be humble and organised and will leave a clean streets for the society. Furthermore, they can help younger orphan and less fourtinate children by helping them in their studies, paying them visits and playing with them which helps them to appreciate their plessings and be more compassionate, giving and caring towards others.",
        "In conclusion, having teenagers doing community service is very important for the teenagers and for the society as it help them to grow in to more humble, generous, compassionat and productive individuals."
