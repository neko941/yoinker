        "Nowadays it is well known that the violence in films and television has become increasingly when it comes to violent crimes between teenagers categories.  This matter rise the question whether it is only on the government to be blame for the violence and what can be done about this issue.  Personally I strongly agree with this idea that the government have a major responsibility in controlling and reducing the level of violence permitted by movies and televisions.",
        "Indeed the children and teenagers are swayed by the actors and VIP celebrities to play and imitate their favourite personality which lead to violence and aggressive  behaviour . On the other hand, the parents play an equal role as the government regarding the limited access of their children, so they should control and interdict their children to watch programs with high content of violence.",
        "Moreover, in the last years  the statistics shows a huge amount of violence between teenagers, for example some of the school boys has taken the role of Jackie Chan personally and committed act of violence between their peers. On the other hand the children should be encouraged to be more involved in sport activities and educational clubs , thus they won\u2019t have too much time to waste on movies or televisions.",
        "From my point of view,  I don\u2019t agree with the people who think that it is only the government responsibility to banned the movie or the televisions and I believe it is parents duty to control and teach their children to watch educational programs . Therefore the violence and crime among youth will be reduced."
