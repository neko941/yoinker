        "In this contemporary era, tourism is the leading factor to develop economic  status of one\u2019s nation. However, many people think that tourism is an essential need in a number of world parts. Hence, I do think  that it has more merits than demerits, which will be discussed in the following paragraphs.",
        "First and foremost benefit of allowing the foreign people in one nation, would build  the strong  economic development. By this I mean to say that many tourists  are charged to enter into one\u2019s territory for exploring the beauty of particular  kingdom. For example, in a research  study of 2015, it has been stated that the United kingdoms economic upliftment was the highest as compared to other regions of universe.",
        "Secondly, it helps to learn the local languages of country . Many outsiders have some ability to learn native vocalization. As a result of this, it helps  to prevent our local linguistics skills from vanishing. For example, Israel\u2019s mother language is Hebrew and  it was in the stage of extinction. However, it was saved through letting the outside people in Israel to expose their language and  today it has many expert\u2019s  on teaching Hebrew  language on YouTube and on internet .",
        "On the other hand, it has also  some downsides such as discrimination of one\u2019s cultural belief. Foreign individuals are unknown about the cultural respect towards the God.  A good example to share  with you is that many foreigners do not remove their sandals or shoes while entering the temple. This results into  negative behavior against them. But, it can be reduced by giving proper knowledge in giving respect to other religion.",
        "In conclusion, I believe that tourism has many positive sides as compared to negative ones. Hence, I would say that it is helping hand for each and every  country in economic development and survival of local  language."
