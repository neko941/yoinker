        "There are more than approximately 5000 languages in the world, to assume. So not all languages are commonly used or spoken according to researches. And the most commonly used language is English. For which, other languages are not being practiced or spoken which is leading to extinction of some of the languages. And according to major part of the population variety of languages out there are better. I would totally agree with the major part of the population. There are the reasons:",
        "Despite the fact that there are so many languages all around the world but learning or knowing all would be a challenge and not supported by all as it is not important. Unless someone wants to participate in Guinness world record. Although English is the most commonly used or practiced language but not all country prefer it. For example in China if a foreign student wants to enroll in a Chinese University then he/she are force to learn Chinese language. Which is I think to some extend unfair to the students as the student might not do well in his academy due to handling new language and his syllabus.",
        "Furthermore, whenever a person is travelling to different countries often they have to face difficulties in communication. As of what the native languages and many more.",
        "To some up I believe the few the languages the better. When all of us communicate in a common language it will be easier to understand each other better. So I think English language should be made mandatory in all schools besides they are mother language."
