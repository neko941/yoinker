        "Zoo is the popular place for people to visit for entertainment and to learn about wild animals. Although some people think it is inhuman and should be closed while other argues they are helpful in saving endangered species. So, it should be kept open. This is an issue which is greatly debated and controversial. In this essay, I will discuss both the viewpoints in the upcoming paragraph with relevant examples.",
        "To commence with, animals in zoo are devoid of their natural habitat and lifestyle. For instance, in most of the zoos, area is very limited. Being caged in a zoo they have to live a life of misery where they cannot enjoy a liberal life. Thus they lose their independence which they were previously enjoying while living in a jungle or forest. It is quiet cruel for animals.",
        "However, it is necessary to keep some animals in the zoo since living in the wild does not suit them. For example, pandas were facing serious issues such as deforestation, poaching and lack of food and have been endangered species for many years. But they are well fed and well cared in the national zoo and have been protected.",
        "On the other hand, a zoo has numerous benefits for our society. First and foremost, zoo provides people especially children, an opportunity to learn about animals and nature. To exemplify, children who visit a zoo get the chance to know about different animals and can broaden their perspective. Thus zoos are educational for young ones and adults as well. Secondly, zoo can be source of funds for the research on protecting rare animals.",
        "In the nutshell, I would like to pen down by saying that zoos have great advantages for both, the endangered species as well as society but the animal\u2019s dignity should be maintained and they should not be exploited."
