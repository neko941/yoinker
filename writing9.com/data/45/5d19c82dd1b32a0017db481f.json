        "Bicycles are regarded as the most environmentally-friendly means of transport but it still fails to be the people's prefered options. There are various reasons for this unpopularity and some feasible sollutions are put forward to promote the usage of bikes.",
        "Cycling is inferior to motorized means of transport such as motorbiks and cars in a number of aspects. First, bike riding requires cyclist with more physical demand and time loss than other vehicles while people in today's society have inclination to get a sedentary lifestyles and the fast-paced life which makes them much more occupied. They, therefore, prefer vehicles powered by gas or electricity even on the shortest journey. The ignorance to the impact of car fumes is an another issues leading to inflict on their surroudings. Expecting the increasing number of pedalings then is impractical in metropolis or even in rural areas.",
        "Goverment should plays a leading role in encouraging to prioritize bikes especially when having short-distance travel. Conducting monthly green days by laws, for examples, is more likely to form a habit of riding a bike for every single person in a long run. Besides, if program runs propaganda compaigns via television, it will have a greater impact on heightening social awareness of this matter, and thereby gainning popularity for bike riding.",
        "In conclusion, cycling, regardless of having positive impact on environment, has become a rare picture in the modern world for some reasons. Goverment,therefore, should take some steps to reverse this situation."
