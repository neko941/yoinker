        "There are two main reasons why people might believe that this is a positive",
        "development. Firstly, the relationships between employees might be better. This",
        "is because working in an open-space area brings employees closer together",
        "physically, breaking down the invisible wall between people. As a result,",
        "employees can interact with their colleagues more easily, making it more",
        "approachable. Lastly, it might have positive effects on the collaboration between",
        "colleagues. As employees are bring closer together, they have better",
        "communication and interaction with each other. This benefits employees with a",
        "better flow of information, resulting in better management for managers.",
        "Despite the above arguments, I still believe that the disadvantages outweigh the",
        "advantages. Firstly, working together in an open-space area might lead to the",
        "lack of privacy. Since workers sit closely to each other, every of their actions",
        "might be observed by their colleagues. Sometimes, work is sensitive, and being",
        "able to see everyone\u2019s screen might be disruptive. Secondly, working in an open-",
        "plan area might lead to greater distractions. Working close to each other without",
        "walls to separate people can be noisy and chaotic, especially in call centers. This",
        "results in the fact that employees can\u2019t focus on their work, decreasing their",
        "efficiency. Lastly, it might end up in a higher risk of diseases spreading. This is",
        "because employees work fairly close to each other, so the chance of an infectious",
        "disease spreading might be very high.",
        "In conclusion, while there are benefits of open-plan design, I still believe that this",
        "is a negative development, and the disadvantages outweigh the advantages."
