        "For a really long time, for what it feels like an eternity at this point, Newspapers and TV has ruled as a primary source of news. People relied on these mediums to stay abreast of latest happenings in and around the world. Initially it was newspaper only and then came along the TV. Even after the invention of TV, newspaper still had a lot of patronage. I still recall my father waiting by the gate to collect his morning dose of news. Reading newspaper with the morning tea was quite an affair in my household.",
        "Fast forward, everything changed with the invention of internet. Internet, rightly so, took the traditionally straightforward equation of newspaper and tv by storm. People of my generation see less of a point to read newspaper which only gets updated once in 24 hours as opposed to online sources which get updated once in every few minutes if not seconds.",
        "And as for TV, many young people don\u2019t follow news on TV because its reporting system is traditionally flawed. TV reports news as it is happening without much context and background information to follow. The trajectory that TV news follows is almost always forward, never backwards. Unlike TV, internet gives you the opportunity to search and backtrack news. Also, with the internet you can pursue multiple news at one time, while all TV channels almost always focus one news.",
        "There is still a decent amount of population who is patronising traditional sources of news, but these sources are out of interest of a great vast majority. Young people prefer to get news on the go and internet can give them that. That is the reason, others opinion may vary, very few young people read newspaper and follow the news on TV."
