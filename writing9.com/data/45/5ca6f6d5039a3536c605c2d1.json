        "Anything that cannot make any use of it, can be identified as rubbish. If we look at decades of years back, people did not dump rubbish like now. Now the companies are more engaged with producing rubbish than producing something useful.",
        "Nowadays the life style of the human being has changed, and everyone is running after money and profits only. At that case they have forgot their duties and responsiilities towards the society. The main reason for producing rubbish is that everyone wants to be successful by doing anything at any cost. Even if we look at the food we eat, most of them have been produced by adding various chemicals for preservation, tasty and for  a greater look. And this food is wraped from a plastic cover which can be identified as the main source of rubbish to the world.",
        "Since this problem is getting worse day by day, the government has to interfere for this issue and should provide a solution in order to stop the damage that this would to to the world. The authorities must impose taxes on such products and also should introduce new rules and regulations for the producers.",
        "Not only that, the rulers must charge an enormous penalties, fines and charges from the people who break these formalities. This will make organizations to think further before producing rubbish because no one like to pay fines or to be in a jail for the blame of producing not quality standard food.",
        "In conclusion, not only the manufacturers, but also general public like all of us must pay attention on this disaster, and should support to save our world for future generations."
