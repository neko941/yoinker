        "Climate change has now become a growing concern, and has made some think seriously about adopting efforts to tackle it effectively. However, others feel that people should acclimatize with it. I do favour the first view, but a critical assessment is necessary before framing a rational conclusion.",
        "On the one hand, the reason why some claim that people should live with the changes in climate is because of the fact that these changes cannot be reversed in a short span of time. To be clearer, climate change has occurred very gradually over time since the era of industrialization, and is now accelerating at an alarming pace. It is quite rational that no one can arrest these changes in a day or two. At this challenging situation in which it takes a longer span of time to slow down its pace, they feel that it is better to adapt with the changes and live with it.",
        "On the other hand, there exists an argument which strongly suggests serious efforts to alter the situation to a positive way. This is because of the unprecedented consequences of climate change.  To be precise, many countries are seen hapless in managing the disasters caused by this. For instance, thousands of hectares of forests have become ashes in the USA and Australia due to wildfires. Likewise, torrential rains and flash floods have become common in arid areas. At this point, immediate measures have to be taken by respective governments to mitigate the intensity of climate change.",
        "After analysing both views in detail, it clear that man has to adjust with the existing situation which the climate change has created. However, I feel if practical measures are not adopted on an emergency basis, human life on the earth will be questioned."
