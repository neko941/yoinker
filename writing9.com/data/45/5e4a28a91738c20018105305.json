        "Every year, a million people around the globe travel  to visit tourist places,but these days, the regions with extreme weather conditions are drawing everybody\u2019s attention. Hence,the number of people visiting places such as the Sahara desert and the Antarctic is significantly increasing,because challenges help people to regain their lost confidence and also help them to be more focused on their work. Whereas,these expensive trips may bring a financial crisis for many families with a poor economy.",
        "Today,life has become so tedious people are either busy with their work or carrying their daily routine activities. Humans tend to get bored with their same routine everyday and in order to boost themselves up they need to carry out different activities, which provide them a motivational experience and helps them to focus on their work. Nowadays, technology has made everything easily available and there is not much left in our daily life style which challenges our body and minds. Therefore, travelers are increasingly visiting places in remote areas such as the Antarctic and the Sahara desert, where resources to survive are limited and the temperatures are extremely cold and hot respectively. This type of survival experience provides another level of adventure by stimulating their mind and distracting themselves from their stressful lifestyle. Furthermore, when workers return to work after such trips they feel relaxed, refreshed and also become confident and eventually, it leads to a delightful life.",
        "On the other hand, surviving a special weather condition requires special kinds of gears and clothing, which could be very expensive and people with  limited amounts of cash may not be able to afford them. However, if they manage to buy the required clothing and travel. Consequently,after returning they may come under debt and become unable to pay it off ,hence it could turn out to be a miserable  journey for them and may also make their life stressful.",
        "In conclusion, I firmly believe that traveling is the way to explore and learn the world. Although everything has pros and cons,it is the individual who is responsible for the consequences and needs to consider all the facts before making any decision or choosing any destination to travel."
