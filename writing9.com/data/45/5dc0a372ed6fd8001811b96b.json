        "After the industrial revolution, it has been a contentious topic whether or not everyone should play a role in the protection and recovery of the environment. Some people are of the opinion that this situation should be handled by the government, while others truly believe that this is a problem which should be addressed not only by the government but also by all the members from the society.",
        "Nowadays, there is the popular belief that the way companies and humankind are remediating the destruction of the environment is by paying taxes. This mindset comes from thinking that this money can be invested by politicians to reduce the consequences of environmental deterioration. From my standpoint, these individuals are not conscious that the earth is the home of all humans and without it, life is not viable.",
        "On the other hand, there is a group of people that is fully committed to the preservation of the environment and its sustainable development. They acknowledge the earth as all living beings home and think it is everyone\u00b4s responsibility to protect it. In the last years an exhaustive research carried out by the University of Michigan showed that the people that are more connected to nature and are environmentally forward thinking are happier and have a stronger feeling of live fulfillment.",
        "So overall, there are several points of view regarding who should be accountable for the preservation and caring of nature, but I fully believe that enterprises and individuals should actively participate in finding solutions and taking care of the earth because if not, many species including humankind will disappear in the next 500 years."
