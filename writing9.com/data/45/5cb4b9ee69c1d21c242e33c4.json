        "Games are one of the most effective way to feel refreshed and energetic. Some students follows physical games, while other prefers playing by means of computer. In this essay, I will express my view to explain the reason behind this and what could be done to overcome this problem.",
        "To embark on, Students in past few years are found be much more unhealthier comparative to the students in last decades. This is because, in the ancient time, candidates used to spend a lot in extra curricular activities or physical games which involves full body movements, whereas, these days a plethora of students give priority to computers games. It impacts them adversely by being seated in a fixed posture in addition to starring at a screen continuously. It leads to health issues such as: Back pain and eyesight problems. To avoid this problem, parents should spend some time with their children to get involve in some activities like swimming, bicycling and other outdoor games, so that it would distract them from the bounded arena of computers.",
        "Moreover, students now a days are quite sensitive to pretend their rapport in the society. The usage of advanced computer games has now become a stardom or a status symbol for students. One starts feeling inferior, if observes other playing game using computer, this is what we call 'peer effect'. The question here is , who promotes the strategy of playing computer games? The answer is the elders, parents and teachers who don't restrict students to play computer games. Hence by penalising or applying fines would suffice the purpose of reduction of students playing computer games.",
        "To conclude, people who encourage students to play computer games should take an appropriate stand and parents must come up with some alternative options to improve their children's' health."
