        "According to the proposal, the backside exit of the food room and the main entrance gate will remain from the original plan site. while the most significant development will be the extension of the living room in the westerly direction, where it will overtake the hall by removing the eastern wall as well as the two back hall doors  will be diminished. Furthermore, the stairs design will change, and move to the north. otherwise the storage under it will be removed completely.",
        "The kitchen will be renovated by adding new kitchen furniture and changing the north single door which opened in the hallway  to  be a double door on the south side of the same wall and directly after the main entrance gate."
