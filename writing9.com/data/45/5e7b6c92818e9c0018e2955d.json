        "According to 2000 \u2018s report, Japan has became one of the most country which has the highest proportion of population aging and owing to this reason, Japan\u2018s GDP has dropped 10%-16% compared to the previous years. This has drawn awareness of the increasing in average life expectancy in many country include Japan itself and turn into very difficult hassel. We are living in 4.0 century when industry also medical treatment have greatly improved, with these favourable conditions, people can expect to live longer than before. However, it also causes negative consequences and governments should hit upon the solution in order to deal with.",
        "Irreparable damage had been brought about by aging population owing to the fact that a big set of people are retirees which are eligible to receive pension. More precisely, young people in the working age are the main resource contribute to country development, but due to the increasing number of retirees has led to the decreasing of people in working age. Obviously, we can anticipate the result that the tax burden for working individual will get bigger.",
        "Tracing the roots of this aging\u2019s population directs us to the inefficient regulation of government. For instance, some country such as Japan, Korea, Thailand have decreased their working age \u2019s threshold, thus this force people early to retire their current job while somebody still has passion and health to contribute. Such regulation led to the imbalance between retirement and young workforce, as a result young people have to work more harder to fulfill the performance which retirees have left.",
        "A practical and plausible solution lies mostly in action of governments who should seek for adjustable measure to increase the retirement age for working adults, perhaps from 65 to 75. Another idea which can tackle this hassel is immigration, such increase the number of working adults.",
        "In sum, many hassel have caused to individual both society due to impact of ageing population and smart measures are necessary and crucial which could reduce its impact."
