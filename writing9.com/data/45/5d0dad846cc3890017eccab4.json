        "Tourism has improved so much these days and there has been an increase in the number of people travelling around the world. This has both advantages and disadvantages and this essay will discuss both the view points and why I beleive in the former argument.",
        "On the one hand, many people argue that tourism is causing detrimental effect on the country. As the number of visitors increase, the culture and lifestyle of people are affected since they are forced to welcome tourists.",
        "Many poor nations use this as a means of living and they are even ready to change their food habits inorder to accomodate foreigners. Another aspect is the change in environment. Many forests and natural reserves are destroyed to make resorts and beaches thereby affecting the natural ecosystem.",
        "On the other hand, I believe that development in tourism is a positive move. As the number of people visiting a country grows, the economy will naturally improve. Moreover, inorder to entertain visitors, governments make better transportation and housing facilities and this improves the country's standard of living. For instance, Kerala is a small state in India which was unknown to outsiders. Now, a huge number of people are able to visit this place and due to the scenic beauty, this place is called God's Own Country. Another advantage is that tourism has helped to make the people more aware of other countries which help them to appreciate other culture and tradition",
        "To conclude, every change has both positives and negatives and tourism industry is no different from this. Even though there are disadvantages, I beleive that the positive aspects outweigh this."
