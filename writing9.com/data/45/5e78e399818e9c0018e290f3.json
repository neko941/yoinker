        "It is widely accepted that we are at the time when international relations are most. People make contact with other cultures, both during travel and as a part of their work.",
        "One of the most important advantages of this is that it enhances international understanding of people. For instance, the communication with local people is a good chace to explore some similarities in their culture.This issue will resolve some culturel differences among nations that have been main reason of distances for many years.",
        "There are also some advantages for business people. In this short visit, if business people can understand culture of that country, they will be more successfull in the products they produce for that place. A good illutration of this is McDonald\u2019s  that has many branches all over the world . They produce different products according to each country\u2019s traditional foods.This is one of the reasons they are prefered by people.",
        "On the other hand, the main drowbacks is that  this experience with  other cultures might be superficial and it gives to people some mistaken ideas .For example, they can do generalizations about what they have experienced that are not true. Unlike this ,  to get the right ideas about other cultures requires long time experiences and good communications with local people.",
        "To conclude, relations with other countries have some benefits about our personal improvement  and for working development. However , we should have conscious to having the right knowladge about another culture is not based on one or two limited contact . Long-term experiences is necessery to building up a good awarness."
