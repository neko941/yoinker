        "The Bar chart illustrates the mean daily hours spent in 2009, in the participation of recreational activities by tourists of different nationalities, Chinese, American, Turkish & Brazillian, while vacationing in Greece.",
        "Overall, this chart shows that the top 2 leisure time activities, irrespective of nationality were spending time on the beach and reading books. However, the least amount of time by all was spent exploring new sites.",
        "It is interesting that the highest peak of this graph is by Chinese tourists spending an average of 8 hours a day reading books while they have the least amount of time spent at the beach in comparison to the rest of the nationalities. They also have the sharpest difference in spending equal time between activities. In ,contrast all other nationalities, have approximately a 2 to 3-hour difference between time spent on each activity.",
        "The split of the most popular activity can be divided into 2 groups. American and Chinese tourists in group 1 with reading as their favourite activity and Turkish and Brazillian tourists in group 2, with relaxing by the beach as theirs."
