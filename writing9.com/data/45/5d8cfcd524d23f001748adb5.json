        "Computers are everywhere and very popular nowadays. It is widely used in almost every aspect of or life. Thus, it should be thought and included in academia. However, there are certain disadvantages that can be seen if teaching will be solely dependent on computers. Given this scenario, how would one use computers carefully so as not to impose such dangers related to dependency? This essay will discuss both sides and opinion as to using the computers in moderately manner will be elaborated.",
        "Introducing computers and their designed programs can help a student a lot in all aspect of his life. Nowadays, we are surrounded by technology and we don\u2019t want to be left with curiosity. Teaching with the help of computers can make the life of a professor easier. It has programs that is very beneficial like power point, Microsoft excel and many more, that they can use as a tool for their presentations. Even in research, students can easily use the computers in researching a certain topic. They can use the computer to access the web in almost everything they want to know in relation to their subject",
        "On the other hand, too much dependence on computer in teaching poses risk to students. They will be accustomed to technology and will start to disregard reading books. Books are essential and should not be removed as part of education. Library will not be visited anymore, therefore making students lax. We should still use manual teaching in schools so that if there will come a time that computer will fail us, we always have a backup.",
        "In conclusion, Computer should be integrated in teaching in the academia but since there is a risk attached to students with dependency to it, it should be use in moderation."
