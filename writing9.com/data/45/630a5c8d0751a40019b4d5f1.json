        "When it comes to the designing a new town, government should focus on public parks and sports facilities as well , as it gives lot of benefits and one can ejoy there and they can spend their valuable time with there family. In this era of urbanization green spaces have more benefits than others. Personally , I agree with the writers notion and reasons for my inclination are enunciated in ensuing paragraph.",
        "First and foremost reason to support my ideology is that , having shopping centres in town has its own benefits. If a city does not have a good shopping centres and outlets then , people will have to travel a lot to purchase daily items and will affect the cost also. In addition to that, shopping centres are not onlt stand as trade market but most of people also enjoy there when they do shopping in mall  . To cite and example , many people enjoy food over there children also play numerous games in game zone . Nowadays, mostly youngsters also spend their time with the friends.",
        "On the other hand , public spaces and sports play vital role in this time for their betterment of health.  Moreover, when people spend time in parks they have chance to breath air with full of oxygen and and it increase lifespan . Furtheremore, many people walk in the garden in morning and remain healthy consequently, this city would see fast progress also.",
        "On the close scrutiny, I conclude that green spaces affect the citizens lifestyle but shopping centres are equally important . The government should pass holistic approch to develpo these kind of parks and sports facilities for people of nation ."
