        "World is shrinking into a dinky family through network. Plethora of mercantile meeting and training is conducted through internet nowadays. This essay will discuss about the unmitigated participation of members and more economic strongly as a merit than dearth of privacy as demerits, which has less evidence.",
        "The main reason to take place online training and meeting is that, this increase complete participation of members concern to it. Huge number of members is included in meeting and training. In this hustle and bustle life, it is hard to manage time for it and less chance of enrolment of total members, which ultimately affect the formation of law, plan and polices of company. To eradicate such problem inter play a game changer role in traditional practice. For instance: five board members of a company residence in different five places can make a group video or voice chit-chat through internet at instance.",
        "At the same time, online congress is more economic than face to face interaction. One significant criteria is that, all members should be gathered in one place, lodging and flooding are also essential, which directly rise expenditure of meeting and training, in contrast all these expenses are saved with the help of online. For example different computers based training and course is offered by various Universities with certificates.",
        "One possible drawback is that, using the web to conduct meeting is dearth of privacy. Assembly operate through net is available globally. All the people are not satisfied with our company and with us: ergo they hacked. Ultimately, our goal plan polices were not be secured almost impossible to take U- turn in business. But it is generally least chance of happen such incidents have no evidence till now.",
        "To recapitulate, most grooming sector of today\u2019s world is web network which have lots of pros",
        "than cons, online meeting and training are also part of it, less expensive and overall enrolment of members are catbird seat, overweigh privacy as a demerit of it."
