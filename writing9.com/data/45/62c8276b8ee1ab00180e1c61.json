        "The trend graph and pie chart show the rates at which both plants and animals are becoming extinct as well as detailing the sources of threats to plant life.",
        "Overall, we can see that extinction rates are increasing. It is also clear that human impact is responsible for far more harm to plant life than natural events are.",
        "There are only two natural factors listed as threatening plant life, natural disasters, and other natural events. Both of these account for roughly 10% of the total threat. On the other hand, 81.3% of the harmful activities are human ones. The worst of these are harvesting and agriculture, which together comprise just over 33% of the total impact.",
        "Plant and animal extinction rates are, as mentioned earlier, increasing, and are projected to continue doing so long into the future. It is thought that this sharp increase will have declined significantly by the end of this century (to under 30,000 extinctions per millions of species), having reached its peak around 2060, at 50,000 extinctions per million species"
