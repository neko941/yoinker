        "Nowadays, non-environmental problems are raising prominently irrespective of awareness about the dangers, they can cause globally. Although, the issues are different, all these are inter-connected in one or another way. This essay will discuss the topic in detail in the following paragraphs.",
        "To begin with, there are uncountable issues like global warming, pollution, deforestation, overpopulationpopulation and many. But, among all these overpopulationpopulation is the most dangerous one because, all other issues are directly or indirectly linked with this. To elaborate, when the number of humans increases, they need space to accommodate themselves. So, people may cut down the trees to construct houses. Due to ,this the climate may change drastically and it results in global warming. In addition, apart from this, it is necessary to raise  production in all other fields also, to satisfy the demands of humans. The enormous needs are expected from agriculture, textile and automobile industries. Because, shelter, clothes and transports are the basic needs of humans. To summarise, when the population levels up, it automatically affects the environment.",
        "On the other hand, there are few measures to control the above-mentioned problem. The first and foremost one is to control the population. This can be implemented by the government by giving awareness to the public about the demerits of a high population. Along with this, motivating people to utilize  public transport for commuting and educating  society about the merits of plantations are also necessary. In addition, making a strict rule for rainwater harvest action and supporting the people by offering funds to own  waste management set up at home are also needed from the government side. To summarize, the government should take more initiation to address this issue.",
        "To sum up, the public should learn to lead an eco-friendly life to sort off the existing problem. Moreover, the government also should offer a shoulder to the public to come out of this."
