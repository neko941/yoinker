        "There are several number of problems in a country and one out of that is poverty. Nowadays, people below the poverty line is getting increased. This essay explains about various several reasons for world poverty and how poor people can be helped to come above the poverty line.",
        "Many of us could see that, the main reason behind the increase in people below poverty line is unemployment and no proper education. In many rural areas there are no proper schools for education and this lead to increase in illiterate people. As a result, unemployment increases. This makes people to go below poverty line and makes them incapable to meet their daily basic needs. Poor people should be financially helped by the government or by any business man.",
        "The government should step forward to develop the rural areas with proper schools and many employment opportunities for all the degree holders.",
        "In recent time, there was a news speculated around that, Sachin Tendulkar who is a famous crickter, adopted a village and started developing it. He took responsibility to build schools and colleges for the students present in the village.  He also offered education at very low cost so that, everyone in the village can afford to study in the school and college. As a result, number of illiterate people reduced in the village and many was employed. This turns the people in the respective village to go above the poverty line and meet their basic needs on their own.",
        "In conclusion, not only the government, Also, every rich individual should be responsible to make sure that the poor people get support to go above the poverty line and meet their basic needs on their own. Only when every rich people in the country join hands with the government to help the poor people, the word poverty can be erased."
