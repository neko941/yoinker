        "In Modern era, use of automobile increase day by day. Many nations payout so much money to construct bicycle use easy with full stop. In this eassy, we will discuss about the reasons of making bicycles and solution to tackle with traffic jam.",
        "There are multifarious reasons, why government promote the use of bicycles. Firstly, automobiles emit a lot of harmful gases, which is the main reasons of rising in temperature called global warming. Secondly, automobiles runs with petrol and diesel. Which will be cause of loss of our fossil fuels forever. For example a study have recently conducted in 2016 and reported that we should lost our natural resources permanently in future. Moreover, bicycles is eco-friendly maintain cost very low than automobiles everyone who is financially weaker can also afford the bicycle. Furthermore, it is good for Physical health for example, the men and women who are very very busy in their work and don't get time for workout can get advantage of bicycle.",
        "In other hand, Government have very good strategy to control the pollution. By using bicycle the traffic jams problems can also tackle for example in Montreal, government promote the use of bicycle and provide supported bicycle stands by charging very low price for their bicycle take very less space on the roads as compared to cars trucks and other automobiles.",
        "In conclusion , government provided good way to control pollution by using bicycle. It should adopt by all the countries as it also help in solving the traffic congestion."
