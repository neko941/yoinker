        "Studying is the most important thing for all of us. Some individuals say teaching children at home is better for their children\u2019s development, while others think that it is important for children to go to school. This essay will discuss the advantages of both methods and which one is better than the other.",
        "After being born, the children will be raised by their parents at home, they are the first teachers in every child\u2019s life. They teach their children to eat, talk, and learn interesting things in daily life. They also teach their children about morality. Children, for instance, will learn from their parents about how to deal with people around them. But also that most parents can\u2019t teach their children about book knowledge. So children need to go to school.",
        "It seems more advantageous for children to go to school. They can learn about things their parents can\u2019t teach them. For example, if parents don\u2019t have an in-depth knowledge of Mathematics, they couldn\u2019t teach their children about Mathematics. Besides, they can make friends with many other children. It seems to be a good environment for the development of children because it helps children to be happy and healthy with their peers.",
        "While it is undeniable that teaching children at home is best for a child\u2019s development, children going to school is also important. Parents must know how to parallel educate their children, maintain homeschooling, and work with teachers to teach them in school."
