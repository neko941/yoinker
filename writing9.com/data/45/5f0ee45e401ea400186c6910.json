        "At school, students work out their tasks in many different ways of planning. Some students perform theirs by working on it bit by bit, on the other hand the rest of students work on their assignments intensively just before the deadline of handing it by about three to four days. In my opinion working bit by bit to execute assignments is the best way due to many reasons.",
        "Personally I like or prefer to complete my assignments bit by bit where this usually raises up the efficiency of my work,as it gives enough time to revise for blunders or silly mistakes and give me a chance to ask my teachers about it and enhancing it more also working on the assignment comfortably, without any rush helps you focus on what you are doing and makes you build a strong built task without any stress or fear. Mooreover you can make a plan for making a little bit of the assignement each day that you can complete other tasks ot other subjects without affecting them or giving something more than its rights of attention.",
        "\u2018\u2019While playing one minute chess it is impossible for you to see the full picture of analysis or positioning of pieces so don\u2019t be bothered by mistakes\u2019\u2019(Hikaru Nakamura) this is an example or a strong evidence that shows the huge diffrence between working bit by bit and intensively where working intensively on tasks is not good at all you can\u2019t see the full picture of analysis nor the building of the task despite working bit by bit which helps you to analyze and discover mistakes and correcting them for me it is nothing to argue about working bit by bit is the best to execute any task.",
        "In brief, there is a big diffrence between working intensively before the deadline by a few days and working a little bit each day where working slowly helps you in strenghting your task or your work in many different ways."
