        "Nowadays each and every person tend to do sports activities to obtain a healthy lifestyle as well as in a commercial purposes. Around the world people attending various types of sports and some have become more and more famous. This essay will discuss the incomes of the other employments rather than sport professions and wheather it is fair to recieve a higher pay than others.",
        "As all we know, some people have special abilities to do something. Likewise sports is an ability that everyone cannot do. If one is more talented to do some sport, he or she might not having ability to go far from education. As an example world famous sports persons Ussain Bolt, Roger Federal and Lionel Messi has no any good educational background, but they are are having specific talent in their relevent field. Moreover they have a really superior fan base throughout the world. As a result they are getting oppertunity to go for commercials and various campaigns. Likewise it is fair to earn a great amount of money.",
        "Although when doing sporting they spend so much effort on the playground and it is queit difficult comparing to other jobs. In addition they can have serious injuries while playing.",
        "Furthermore, other professions like doctors, nurses, engineers and even cleaning workers can aslo earn money up to a cetain extent, but not as the sportsmen because, they are not famous characters in the social media and on newspapers. However there are some proffesions in epert levels who earn more than sprorting profession but they are not famous. So people unaware about them.",
        "Overall, in my opinion sucess is one's faith and with our strength we can climb up the ladder. No one should be jelouse about the others success. So i think it is fully reasonable to earn high amount of vage by the sports profession rather than the other employment categories."
