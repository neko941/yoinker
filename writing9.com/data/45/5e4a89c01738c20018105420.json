        "I disagree with this claim because working for a multinational organization does make it easier to understand other cultures, but I don't think that's the best way.",
        "Obviously, a multinational organization contains various of employers of different nationalities. Through collabrating with different countries colleagues in a multinational organization could understand other cultures effectively.  Good cooperation is based on a certain understanding of each other, such as learn about their festivals, their customs, and how they celebrate. People of different nationalities who adopt different solutions to conflicts can also reflect their cultural background. When people's emotions are out of control, they will more clearly show cultural characteristics in language and accent.",
        "However, it's significant for us to distinguish working office and study. In most cases, we rarely have the opportunity to communicate directly on cultures with each other in work situations.",
        "We tend to treat work in a more professional manner to maintain the normal operation of the organization. Therefore, Therefore, the vocabulary, clothing and festivals we use often cannot express the uniqueness of culture. Actually, people are often reluctant to talk about their cultural background with others, and even think that using this as a topic of discussion is a violation of personal privacy."
