        "There are many activities people now undertake all over over the world and this ranges from hang-gliding to mountain climbing.even though they are risky to live. This essay will discuss the reason why people risk their lives in climbing mountains and hang-gliding.",
        "A lot of people find themselves in different competitions and one of this is mountain climbing. People take part in the competition for money and other rewards attached to it, in order to meet their needs and take care of their families even though they know that it is a dangerous activities, but some do not have a choice than to participate and also make an effort to win.",
        "Adventure is another reason why people venture into extreme activities. Many people just want to hang out with friends, meet new friends and connect to people, others want to ease their stress, it could be stress from work, from marriage, families or a means of getting away, some people also embark on this kind of adventure in other to get inspiration for a particular project at work or in their personal business.",
        "I think undertaking this extreme activities in a way is a good trend as it is a source of income to the people involved in competition. It is another means of easing stress from work and family, it is a source of inspiration to other people . An example was when I went for mountain climbing last year October in Jalingo, Taraba state at Yorro mountain, I went because I love adventure, it was an holiday and everyone in my lodge needed somewhere to visit, to ease boredom and stress, though climbing up the mountain and climbing down were stress but at the end of the adventure we had fun.",
        "In conclusion, I will say people benefit from those extreme activities and that is the reason they still undertake them even though they know it is risky and dangerous to live."
