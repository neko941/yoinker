        "The production of paper books have been reduced with the growing number of e-books. Some believe this as a positive development and others do not. This essay will first suggests that the environment would be benefited by the decreased deforestation for paper production, while the detrimental effect on the eyes of individuals by the bright light that is coming from electronic devices while reading e-books is its major drawback.",
        "A reduction on the number of paper books helps the surrounding because less trees are cut down in order to produce paper for books. This is to say that paper is made from trees and they need to be cut in order to turn them into paper, so the decrease in its demand directly minimises the requirement of cutting down of paper plants. For example, a recent study conducted by the BBC News revealed that every year more than 4 million trees are saved by the modern trend of electronic books from 2015.",
        "Despite the merit of environmental friendly approach of e-book trend, the problem on the eyes of individuals\u2019 by using e-book is its major disadvantage. This means electronic books are read on electronic gadgets\u2019s screen which produces bright light that affects human eyes detrimentally. For instance, recent research suggested that the blue light coming from the screen of smartphones and laptops are responsible for making humans\u2019s eyes weak and even blind if used for a longer period.",
        "In conclusion, the primary advantage of the rise in e-book trend is the minimised deforestation for paper production, but the adverse effect on people\u2019s eyes from the shiny light while reading on electronic devices is the main demerit of e-books."
