        "Many economists suggest that the government acts as an invisible hand in market driven economies and have a crucial role to play for betterment of a country. However, few free market economists are of opinion that government has no business to be in business.",
        "A government gets large pool of fund via various direct and indirect taxes levied on its citizens. Hence any projects which require very large initial capital can be delivered by government without any external support. For example, building national highways to connect major cities of the country, developing ports or airports to handle large volume of passenger traffic as well as cargo or building dams will require huge initial capital investment that private players may not be able to provide on their individual capacity. Additionally, projects which carries national security interests cannot be completely handed over to private companies. On the other side, private players may bring high level of efficiency and transparency for the projects they may take over. Hence, services like setting up the education institutes, building and running hospitals, providing banking services, etc. can be built and operated by private organisations with much better end user experience.",
        "However, private organisations run their businesses for profit motive. Hence, if private players would get free hand to run the services, it could lead to exploitation of users availing those services. Moreover, it is moral duty of the government to provide essential services to all the citizens irrespective of their financial capabilities or social status. To achieve this goal, if the government run the services, it could subsidise them for economically backward class of the society. For example, government could provide free education, subsidised healthcare and housing for people having income less than average per capita income of the country. However, private companies might be least interested in subsidising any of the services provided by them.",
        "To summarize, it is always better for the government to focus on projects which are capital intensive and aimed towards building social infrastructure and providing national security. At the same time, private players should focus on delivery of services which demands better efficiency and transparency. Despite of saying that, government should always have the right to oversight and evaluate the projects having larger social implications; even if they might be run by private organizations."
