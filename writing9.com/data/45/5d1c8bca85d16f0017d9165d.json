        "Many people believe that the violence we see everyday wether on TVs or video games has a negative affects on the society, while others believe that it do not affect on people's behaviour. In my essay I will discuss how these actions would harm our society.",
        "Firstly, kids in a particular age copy whatever actions they see, and in nowadays most video games, such as PUBG, depends on violence, wether using equipments or hands fighting. If we allowed our kids to play these type of games it will affect on them when they grow up and become teenagers, everything they copied when they were kids they will do it as they get more stronger.",
        "As well as, some people who are not educated and their thinking is limited and they follow traditions , when they see violence on TV series or shows they will find it as a normal thing. They will start hitting anyone whenever he/she gets angry without thinking of the results that may happen. Especially men in this case whenever they get angry they do not feel nor think wisely which lead up to many divorce cases, mostly in Arab countries.",
        "Even though violence should be forbidden in all countries, some people think that it will not affect on our community and that goes back to the parents if they do not practice violence in front of their kids, as well as, teaching them that it would hurt others and end up with bad result as injuring your friends or breaking one of his/her body parts. Most kids that we hear about or see on the street practice violence with there friends as a result of their careless parents.",
        "Finally, I wish if the government put laws that punish people who practice violence wether inside their homes or outside. Some countries punish the parents if they hit their kids, but in Arab countries hitting kids is something normal they believe this way is better to build a good generation for the future."
