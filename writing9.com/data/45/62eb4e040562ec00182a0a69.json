        "Some specialists consider that it is more effective for a child to study a foreign language at a foundation level than in middle school education.The essay will suggest that the benefits overweigh the drawback.The descriptions about this essay will be that the children who learn an additional language before secondary level have more opportunities to become a master at both languages and a kid\u2019s cognitive system develop well compared to other kids, as benefits.The primary disadvantage, the confusion with the native tongue , is not valid.",
        "It is obvious that there is a big difference between studying different kinds of languages in the foundation year and secondary school year.The reason is that a kid can fluently speak like a native speaker if he only learn a language before the age of 10.According to the raw RT different scores,starting the first step of learning from an early age can show the strongest learning effect.Moreover,the child who has already learnt in the early years may be more convenient in the future as he studied early.",
        "Then, the improvement of the cognitive system; oriented toward human skills and capabilities, can be seen.Learning from the early ages can provide  the positive effective on brains.Many researches prove that the development of cognitive system occurring in the age  between 4-7 years have a huge influence on a child\u2019s life.It also show that learning languages and new vocabularies are the necessities to improve that system.",
        "The main drawback, complication with the native tongue becomes one of the considerations in this topic.But it must be declared due to many reasons.Although many people may think that  a pupil who is trying to become bilingual or polyglot at the young age can confuse between languages,there is no clear and distinct evidence to prove.Furthermore, my nephew who is a bilingual of English and Burmese can speak both of them clearly and fluently.Actually, he started studying them at the age of  and he is now 13 years old.I have never seen that his conversations are blend.So, in accordance with the above reasons,the uncertainty with mother language cannot be happened and must be strongly refused that downside.",
