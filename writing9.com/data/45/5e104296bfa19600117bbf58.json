        "As a result of industry revolution and increasing technology, the machines and robots became real and those have been dominating many part of our life. This change has several benefits but also, there are some serious disadvantages.",
        "The first of disadvantage is that mankind's jobs are losing by robots. Most of companies and factories use more machines than hire people; those can work whole day and more cheaper than person. In my view, after 50 years most of career will be destroyed by them Second, due to increasing the rate of losing jobs, also average earning money per each person will decrease. Everyone's lives will be harder than high-tech century. Lastly, the rate of birth is going to decrease; people do not need to earn money and go outside. So, after 5 decades, maybe the number of mankind will be half than now.",
        "On the other hand, the first benefit is that companies/factories can reduce their money because using them is more cheaper, so they will concentrate to make a more high quality and low price things from factory. Secondly, in agriculture, the farmers can use them; they can cultivate a lot of crops than before, as a result of it, the cost of crops will decrease. Than, we can buy crops more cheap prise. Lastly, our activities during leisure time will improve such as games, movies, dramas... . We can enjoy our break time more relaxable even babies, elder citizens and famales.",
        "The industry revolution is making our life better, however there are also dangers.",
        "Please be careful to use them and develope the level of life."
