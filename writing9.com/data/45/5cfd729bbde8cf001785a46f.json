        "It is considered by some that developed countries are more responsible to combat climate change than developing countries.While, there are others who believe that all countries are equally responsible for that.I will discuss both sides of the argument and I will summaries my personal opinion.",
        "On the one hand.Some think that developed countries have a majore roles in maintain the environment safe. They have the high tecnhology to ensuer that.Morover, these  countries use more west due to the large number of factories which have a negtive effect on the climate.For example, the area that theis factories in have the highest rate of the ari pollustion which is a main cuase of the  climate change.Theis is a reason why these countries need to take more responsibility to to combat climate change.",
        "On the other hand. Others believe that both developed and developing countries have the seme amount of responsibilities towards the environment.One side cannot solve the problem.If all countries worked together we can protect the environment.The climate change is a global issue can only solved if the whole world helped.For intance, All countries nee ti start to use environmentally friendly materials as a start to helpe to combat climate change. And this can be done if the all countries took the same responsibilities towards protecting the environment.",
        "In conclusion,In my opinion,I bileve that a problem as the climate change it is important for every countries.Therefore, all countriers have a significant roles to find a soluston for this problem wthere it is a developed or developing countries."
