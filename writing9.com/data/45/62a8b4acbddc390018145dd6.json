        "Hey, Jane! It's been long time since have spoken last, I hope you guys are doing well and everybody in the family healthy. Due to pandemic there has been so much time, thanks God its all better now. I have wonderfull news, me and Alex with our son are moving to Hamilton in a month.",
        "I hope that it is not too much if I ask for some help from you. We have found several places online for a rent, but it would be really great if you or Josh could help us to actually take a look at them in person and see if everything is as good with appartments as it says in advertisments. You could go there and call us on video so we get to talk to landlords as well and see if we like the place, and make an agreement on prepay. That way we could move to the place right away when we come to Hamilton.",
        "Maybe you could also ask if anyone you know is givin a place for a rent, or maybe see some more ads online. We are looking for a place on the mountain, close to schools, playgrounds, cause Fedor is starting preschool this year, and obviously public transport matters as well, because we don't have a car yet. Two bedroom appartment, and not the basement in good condition, if possible furnished and if there is a parking spot - that would be good for the future.",
        "We are coming to Canada on the 18th of July at 4pm, to Toronto Pearson Airport, we will take the cab and probably will get to Hamilton by 7pm. By that time we should already have an appartment rented, so we can move in.",
        "I am so greatfull to you in advance for helping in our complicated situation, I hope one day I can pay you back with as great help as you are giving to us.",
        "Can't wait to hearing from you and see you soon,",
