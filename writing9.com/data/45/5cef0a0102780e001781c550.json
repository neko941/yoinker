        "Recently, family structures have been reshaped. In Japan, women have became more indepentant compare to its 90s, they now think working in an office and having a career at corperations is better for their future versas being a house wife. That choice of shit changes the culture and the structure of what we known as traditional families.",
        "The upside of having more women joining the labor markets in an nation, obviously has its enhancement to the productions of the nation. On the contrast, by not having women joining the workplaces, the nation\u2019s productions halves, since we can count women pupolation is about half in a given nation. Therefore, Japan is certain getting its benefits from the change. But we shall take a look at the other side of the spectrum.",
        "The downside of the family structure changes due to the increasing female workers is the attentions that were supposed paying to children, but now being sucked by companies. In fact, by developing a corperate carrer, women will have to encounter more responsiblities that their firms delegated to them, in results, those women will have difficulties to have the proper amount of time to invest in their children as mothers. I think, the notion of this change is more ideal than practical, especially when it comes the future of children, early education matters the most over children\u2019s life time, and that notion will enlarge the problems that have been discussed here.",
        "In conclusion, recently, the roles in families have been facing a structural change. As in Japan, women are liberal for office work rather household works. However, an nation can expect a boost of productivities from that famliy role change, as well as a downfall to the motherhold education for the next generations."
