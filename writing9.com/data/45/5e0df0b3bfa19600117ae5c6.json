        "It is a commonly held belief that the health of the people reflects how government manages its country. This poses a question; What is the most effective way for the government to ensure its constituents' health? In many countries around the world, government allocates a huge portion of their annual budget on vaccinations and public hospital services and medication. Critics, on the other hand, believe that the government should not solely focus on treating illnesses but rather, they should educate the citizens on its causes and prevention methods.",
        "Governments, in most countries, are encouraged to create free health services for the public who can't afford the high prices from private hospitals. Although this would provide a more accessible facilities and lower priced medications to the citizens, this is not a long-term solution to the problem as their is a great possibility that the people, without sufficient knowledge on what the disease is, might contract the same again. In addition, public health services has only a limited capacity and resources and thus, when an outbreak occurs, offered services might be inadequate. As they say, knowledge is power. If people know what causes the disease, their is greater chance for them to avoid it and thus, place less reliance on public health services. And what is more, educating people cost less in comparison to hospital infrastructure and professional fees.",
        "Overall, although it is easy to see that vaccinations and public hospital services is necessary to save lives, evidences point out that people will rely on government services and in consequence, the disease will possibly recur. To put it simply, the best way to lessen and possibly, avoid the disease in long-term is to educate people. Indeed, the best cure is prevention."
