        "As the technology is developing, it is leading to problems regarding the environment. While some argue that the solution for this is for people to adjust to a more simpler life and hence reducing the effects on the environment, others take the view that these can be solved by using the current technology itself.  In this essay, both the above stated views will be discussed.",
        "To solve the environmental issues caused by the technology that is being developed, it is reasonable to get rid of the the things that are causing these in the first place. But, in doing so a lot of effort needs to be put in, as us human beings, are extremely used to using this tech. For example, air conditioners release gases that is harmful for all the living things on our planet, as, they play a role in depleting the ozone layer, but they were invented to provide comfort to humans and most of us, at this point, are used to using them, as in some regions the temperatures are extremely high and due to global warming, they are becoming unbearable.",
        "Now-a-days, modern technology is everywhere, as people have found many ways in which we can can develop further and making the lives of humans much more  comfortable and easy. I belive that, technology can be developed to solve these issues regarding our environment. Moreover, we can't just get rid of everything that has been developed by now, because if we do, we can no longer evolve, which is obviously a bad thing. For instance, various types of computers are being put out by some companies and they are getting better and better over time, which definatly makes the work of employees working in IT sector much easier and faster and hence, the productivity of their companies is inclining at an astonishing rate.",
        "In conclusion, the technology which is still developing , is causing issues regarding our environment and to combat them, though we can adjust to a simpler life, it is a much better option to create products using our current technology to figure them out."
