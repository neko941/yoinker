        "Computers are widespread used in many fields all over the world, especially in education. While computers play an essential role in educating, we can reject the teacher\u2019s parts in class.",
        "On the one hand, learners approach knowledge more effectively by using computers. Videos, pictures and sounds are added which helps the lessons more vivid and interesting. This also makes student\u2019s interest in going to school and motives students to study better. Furthermore, people easily discover new knowledge, inventions and culture all over the world with a computer connected with internet. For instance, the Vietnamese high-school student can search for the information about places, citizens and culture of England or America without travelling a long way there. This not only broadens his horizons but also provides him opportunities to go abroad which specially helpful for the future job.",
        "On the other hand,  by understanding students level and characteristic, teachers have a huge success in both giving them knowledge and educating their behavior. When people attend any lessons, they learn both how to interact with friends and respect their teachers, resulting in their attitude to the life and other people. Moreover, instead of only showing the correct answers and information as a computer, teachers have deeply understanding in each student potential and provide them suitable teaching methods to gain the best results in educating them. There are also some subjects requiring the attendance of teachers such as physical education, art and music. Based on these reasons, teachers still have an important part in education.",
        "In conclusion, the widely using of computers brings many benefits in education, but it is declinable that teachers make an substantial contribution to educating as well."
