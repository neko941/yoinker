        "Since the advent of information communication technology (ICT), bridges have been broken, families now closer, and communication becoming easier. Against this background, it is pertinent to stress that information and communication technology have enhanced communication between families, friends and across borders. Digital communication technology comprises of different elements, such as the social media, which includes facebook and twitter; instant messaging, which includes facebook messenger, facetime and whatsapp; and email, which includes gmail and yahoo.",
        "Flowing from the above, it is a known fact that digital communication technology has enhaced the communication and link between people. For instance, ICT has made it easier for countries to trade with one another. Similarly, ICT has promoted cultural relations between tribes and ethnic groups. Importantly, peoples and countries around the know are now educated about other people and cultures. Likewise, digital communication technology has contributed to the fast dissemination of information, which is utilized during emergency situations, and for prompt and efficient evacuation processes. Additionally, the use of social media has promoted friendly relations between people. At this point, it is necessary to state that social media has played a prominent role in the 21st century political environment. For example, opinions are forged online, which inflences electoral choices and decisions.",
        "At this point, permit me to state that despite the positive impact of digital communication in the world today, it is expedient to enumerate the negative impacts, which cannot be overlooked. Research shows that the increasing impact of information and communication technology in daily lives has negatively affected communal living. People spend most of their time online and do not visit one another, which negatively affects the bond they share. Concomittantly, the dissemination of fake news, if not curbed or controlled, can lead to the outbreak of communal crisis or worse.",
        "While concluding, I wish to state that digital communication technology in today's world have both negative and positive effect. In this case, the positive effect of digital communication technology generally outweighs the negative effects."
