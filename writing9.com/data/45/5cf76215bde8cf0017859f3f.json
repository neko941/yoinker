        "Nowadays, print as well as digital media uses photos to illustrate a story. So the question arises\u201d Are these pictures more effective than words?. Some people are of opinion that they are more effective then words. This essay will discuss the benefits of using photos  instead of words.",
        "Beautiful coloured printed photographs either on a daily newspaper or appearing on a high definition television has a significant impact on the brains of children and this remains in their memory for long time They are able to understand the story in easy way without any guidance.As an instance old tales are been remade into animated moview to make them appealing to kids and they are able to remember the tales of our heroes like Hanuman. This gives immense pleasure to children, additionaly it helps them to memorise the old fables. So it is a win-win situation for both parents and children",
        "Paintings are being used to add humour to the stories which othersie would be dull. At times adults are bored by reading the news stories daily so some element of humour is needed to make them fun to read. Even sarcastic messages can be easily passed via photographs. A recent publication showed cartoons of Primeminister selling teas to common public. So serious messages which have underlying meaning can be easliy send across masses. So in this way, it becomes interesting to read or see the new stories.",
        "To conclude, pictures displayed on different modes of media make the content more humouros  plus it helps the children to remember the old stories."
