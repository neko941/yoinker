        "It is a fact that in some countries a growing number of offspring are suffering from corpulence and various health issue, which is believed to be the authorities' liability. Personally , I partly agree with this point of view.",
        "On the one hand  , governments are to blame for the increasing rate of obesity childhood. Firstly, the authorities seem not to pay considerable attention to build open space for children\u2019s outdoor activities. As a result , Instead of actively taking part in sports kids have a tendency to live a sedentary lifestyle . Besides that, the country\u2019 leadership have take the responsibility for the widespread appearance of unhealthy food advertisements on TV and other social media channels.  They should require these ads with eye \u2013 catching images to be restricted or pay more extra in order to reduce the amount of overweightness in children and other diseases.",
        "On the other hand , parents are also  responsible  for this phenomenon. As parents are often busy with their work , they have little time to take control of  their children \u2018 s diet. Meanwhile , a healthy nutritional balanced diet is of necessary for every kid to ensure the well \u2013 being of people . Additionally, offspring\u2019s today are living under a lot of pressure which dramatically affect  their physical and mental development as well as cause heart diseases and other issue. Therefore , parents have the duty to take m\u1ecfe notice of their kids as well as spend more time with them",
        "In conclusion , I believe that not only governments but also parents have to lend a hand to curb  the obesity epidemic."
