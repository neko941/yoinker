        "Increasing population and disease explosion are two phenomenon that go hand in hand. Health related challenges is becoming more paramount for many nations. On the one hand, there is the belief that individuals are responsible to keep themselves in good shape. On the contrary, it is thought by some that the State is solely responsible for the health of their subjects.",
        "Recently, many will argue that how well we are is largely, if not entirely dependent on our personal actions and decisions. It is an undeniable fact that many of us live in a society where the individual does have a considerable degree of control over their lifestyle but choose to act negligently because they are comfortable living in a sedentary and nonchalant lifestyle. In China, for instances where citizens\u2019 have access to the vast majority of product and services including GYM facilities, Nutritional food, such as farm produce to mention a few.  All of these encourage healthy wellbeing, although some illness is unavoidable. In such an opportune state people should tend to take their health more seriously.",
        "The concept of personal responsibility, will not be attainable to all individual due to lack financial capacity and exposure on health-related matters. In many developing countries the basic essentials of life food, clothing and shelter are still outside the reach of many. Hence, health services provided by the government is a most definite essential in this scenario. It should be the point of duty of the state to provide access to free medical checkups, affordable drugs and necessary vaccines .This is of great importance for the a productive and disease-free nation.",
        "To conclude, without accessible health care through government funding many people will not be able to take adequate care of themselves due to financial constraint and lack of knowledge. Likewise, each person should be able to priorities their own wellbeing, which can be done by accessing the different health products and services which can be done by proper diet and regular exercise and frequent check-ups."
