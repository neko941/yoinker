        "A group of people opine that, it is public's liability to handle their personal well being and nutrition. Whereas, others are of the mind that the higher authority should provide a potent ration to their  civilians. Therefore, before offering my viewpoint, both these aspects must be analysed.",
        "On one hand, it is believed that people earn money to have a healthier",
        "lifestyle. Moreover, it is undeniable truth that, the person is only one who is incharge of his mental and physical Wellness according with proper dietary supply for himself. As  a human being knows best about his habits as well as their body's needs; also, it could be alter according to different situations. For instance, as per survey by the Hindustan Times, most of the Indians changes their sleeping and dietary patterns as season changes from monsoon to summer.",
        "On the other hand, proponents believe that it is the duty of the ministry to provide food supply to their public. The government collects funds from taxes paid by citizens. Hence, it is expected to have basic food items at a minor cost; also, healthy food should be served free of costs in government hospitals and schools. For example, developed countries like New Zealand and australia take no tax on basic dietary items like milk, eggs, and so on.",
        "To conclude, it can be said that, maintaining a good well being is the duty of both, person himself as well as the government  to have a healthiest",
        "Nation. Last but not the least, according to me, it is like a two wheels of cycle; both aspects, the government's aid and personal attention, are  necessary to build a healthy future."
