        "A noticeable trend  in the world now is that the\u00a0 family unit is not as closely knitted as\u00a0 it was before. Causes of this include spending much time on social media and work pressure. This essay will talk more on the causes of this and profer a solution.",
        "One reason for the lack of closeness\u00a0 is too much time spent on\u00a0 social media space. Most people spend a lot of\u00a0 time on their phones chatting with their imaginary friends and getting preoccupied with the happenings in the world without caring about their famiily members\u00a0 which are physically around them. Parents have even fuelled this by giving their kids gadgets that keep them busy in another\u00a0 world. For example, in a typical modern home, the parent comes back from work, pick their phones and tablets and start chatting or checking latest information on social media like Facebook, instagram and Twitter. Also, the children go straight\u00a0 to their room and do the same with their phones. Thus, reducing communication in the home and the closeness amongst the family members.",
        "Furthermore, work pressure is another reason why families are not close. For the working class parents they sometimes come home with work and they dont have time for their kids as they are preoccupied with meeting deadlines. For instance, the regular routine for most parents that close late at night , is to get\u00a0 home,work a bit, sleep and wake up the next morning to begin the hustle for the day without having any form of conversation with the children as they are still in bed when they set out. This will definently affect closeness of the parents with his children.",
        "It can be advised that parents should try to create time for their family. They should have regular outings with the kids and communicate with them often. Also, for the working class, they should ensure that no work related calls is addressed to when spending time with the family except in the case of emergencies.\u00a0 Furthermore, each member of the family should try to limit time spent online and rather use that time with their relations.",
        "In conclusion, the family is an important unit that should not be broken. All hands should be on deck towards maintaing the closeness of the family as everyone is equally important. More time should be created for the family."
