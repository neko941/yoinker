        "There is a study which shows that the original characteristics inside people\u2019 selfs are having far more impact on our personality and development than experiences that may occur in life. In my point of view, I believe that the experiences would have a more crucial effect.",
        "To begin with, the characteristics which people have had since they were born are usually difficult to change until they begin to hit puberty when their mental as well as physical health have noticeable changes. In some first years of one\u2019s life, they can still retain the original characteristics, such as talkative or active and these can be changed by the time when people started to lose their born characteristics.  For example, children when they are born can be naughty, active or sweet dispositions, but after growing up, their characteristics have a tendency to change into both negative or positive personalities.",
        "What is more, experiences which individuals may have when they get older can have an impact on one\u2019s personality and developments later. These experiences which can come from living environment or social relationships may cause a person to be changed throughout their life. A different version of people\u2019s selfs is formed after dealing with issues or special events that have a great influence. For instance, a grumpy and rude individual can become a more positive person after they got some mental issues.",
        "All in all, our characteristics are created when we were born, however they can be changed through a series of experiences which we have. For this reason, I believe that experiences would have a more major influence on one\u2019s character and  developments than the characteristics we are born with."
