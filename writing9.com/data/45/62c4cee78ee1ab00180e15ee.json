        "Nowadays, the increasing trend of working longer hours in youngsters is at his peak. Due to cut-throat competition, some are forced to work more than normal hours due to fear of loosing the job. However working extra hours has its merits, I will further discuss in my upcoming paragaraphs.",
        "Firstly, youth of current era has lots of challenges and some times to take out the solultion, the time they spent is more, which by unwillingly they have to work longer hours. We are in entrepenuership era, more people are starting up there business with less employees. So to grow their business widely they have to work more than normal hours. It saves lots of money by recurting less employess which at last is a benefit.",
        "Secondly, the extra hours brings more money to the Budget, which helps to pay the debts faster and the chances of saving for upcoming Project will be pre-poned. Working extra for Project and for benefit of the company increases chances of promotion. There are lots of people who start working part time from the age of 20 , when they come to full time they are more experienced and have more capacity to work faster and smarter. Due to experience chances of increment and promotion is high. For instance, My cousine who worked in Godrej compnay, he was always punctual and work longer hours and he got assigned for the project which he handled very wisely and in 1 year he got promotion and increment.",
        "To, culminate, Working long and hard gives us the result sooner or later. So we never have to hesitate for working more that required because the benefit of that will comes in multiplied."
