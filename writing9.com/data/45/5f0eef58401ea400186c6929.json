        "In a different stages of human life, each stage has something to offer. For few group of people adolescent part was more fun and joyful while for others it\u2019s adulthood even though they have duties on their shoulders. In my opinion, to me being young was most memoriable andjolly time of my life. In this essay we will discuss both sides of the argument and conclude my opinion.",
        "For a start, happiness differ from one to other individual and in case of adult stage they don\u2019t have to rely on their parents for financial suport, they are entirely free from taking own decision, mature and are target oriented people. In this time of life they are socially more conciouss, egoism and pride takes over. Despite having freedom , during mid 20s and above people become more responsible towards their goals. For instance, when asked same question to the  elders of my family members most of them recalled  about their strugles during their adulthood and funny memories from their childhood.",
        "In addtion, for some juvenile period is the golden time. Most part of the teenagers life is under the guidance of parents, free of financial burgens they enjoy the most. Careless attitide, full of energy and enthusiastic to learn new things are always fun. Young children don\u2019t have much social awareness. To illustrate, as no social responsibilities they don\u2019t have to look for job or rent a place. Most of the time they enjoy, play and study  with the  same age group.",
        "To conclude, as we grow old our priority changes . In pursuit of happiness, at the age of adulthood people get involve with corruption and tend to become money minded. No limit to the satisfaction on the other side teenage are na\u00efve and innocent. Undoubtedly, teeange year are most fun and memoriable."
