        "The Worldwide web has changed the methods of giving and absorbing the details from the net, although it also resulted in complications that were not earlier.",
        "This essay will tell us, how the internet plays a vital role in sharing and absorbing information instantly, and how it has given a negative impact and their solutions to it.",
        "Nowadays, the Internet has become the fastest and easiest way of getting information, but it also depends on how and what kind of information is consumed in which way. It\u2019s very easy for children to get access to potentially dangerous sites because of which they become more mature and aware of things that affect their thoughts and development. Secondly, people around the globe are now connected socially on media networks and share their personnel information as well as photographs which could prove to be risky and they may never know, where their personnel details are used.",
        "For Example:  Young children register themselves as adult on sites and view pornography sites.",
        "It is very important to take control measures to avoid risk. Parents should closely monitor the activities of their children and should set parental control by using the advanced version of control programs on computers. The Government needs to take some serious steps or come up with strict law which restricts the easy access to sensitive sites and also ensure that adequate legislation and controls are in place that will prevent youngsters from accessing pornography sites. In the same way there should be absolute security of personnel information shared on social networks. For Example : Recently, Central Government has taken steps to spread awareness about cyber crimes through sending alert SMS to people.",
        "To conclude, the internet plays a very important role in people\u2019s lives, but it has a negative impact. Though the usage of it is important but with the right measures of people and government, it can be a safe place for everyone."
