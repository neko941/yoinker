        "Recently, due to the advancement of technology, the majority of children prefer to spend more time watching television programs which in return might affect their quality of education. In my own opinion, I strongly agree with this and my explanation can be seen as follows.",
        "Despite one of the advantages of watching television programs as a learning tool to children, the disadvantages create more risks which can eventually ruin the children\u2019s career.",
        "On the one hand, television programs such as mathematics quiz completions, debate competition between primary and secondary schools, discovery channel programs about animals and natures can be of great benefits to the children.",
        "For example, when I was still in secondary school, I gained how to solve some of the mathematics questions through a debate program on the TV. I also learnt some of the new things about nature and animal discovery in the world.",
        "On the other hand, due to lack of proper supervision from the parents and guidance to the children, a lot of children are being carried away by watching some unnecessary programs on the television. Spending the majority of time to watch cartoons, and all kind of movies will eventually affect the quality of their education. This will affect their readings and also can lead to laziness and at the same time, isolation from their neighbor.",
        "In conclusion, with proper supervision from the parent and guidance, watching television can be part of a learning tool for children which will eventually improve their quality of education. The parents should ensure that they develop and implement a television schedule for their children. Control such as locking of some channels and television itself should be implemented."
