        "A few individuals opine that watching sports does not add any value, but instead is a complete waste of ample time. I partially agree with this idea as watching sports can come out to be both beneficial or disadvantageous for anyone depending on the amount of time spent on watching.",
        "I support this notion because there is a saying \"Excess of everything is bad\". So, if one spends all of their free time watching sports on television, that might have a bad effect on their eyesight. In addition to this, this makes a person more lethargic too, if they always tend to only watch rather than playing. Which as a result, can deteriorate their health as well.",
        "On the other hand, I feel watching sports is good because one might get inspired and can start indulging in that particular game. Which would be a win-win situation as along with gaining knowledge of rules and regulations of the game, one is implementing the same in their real life too. Which is a healthier option and the person will feel more active. Apart from this if one is not always choosing to watch but spend their leisure time doing other activities then that will add more value to their personality.",
        "To summarize, watch sports in leisure time is a waste of time or not, that depends on individuals time which they are spending. If they always prefer to give more time to it then it's waste otherwise it might result in fruitful time as it's good for their cognizance as well as well-being."
