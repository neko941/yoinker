        "Immigration means moving from one country to the other either temporarily or permanently upon various reasons. \"Necessity is the mother of invention\", said by the ancient Greek pholosopher Plato. As the proverb speaks, migration is required for a human existance.",
        "This happens on varied necessities like eduction like basic education, higher education, reasearch, and many more. The quality of education is very countable for acquiring high level jobs in any organization. Universities provide infinite opportunities in absorbing maximum qualifications, though the fee is costly, depending on the ranges of examination scores, grades and International standards people have ample choices to make with and which they feel are suitable for them. Also, part-time jobs are allowed to the International students for filling their gaps in school fees which, additionally, is considered as their work experience for getting a job too. In view of the demand and validation of foreign education, more or less, many societies, charities and Universities are providing scholarships depending upon their eligibilities and requirements inorder to fulfill the completion of their studies.",
        "On the other hand, Foreign National movement is for earning either through improving a business or work with any organization. Nevertheless, companies sponsor the efficient people from their respective organizations for new projects to be performed on behalf of themselves, making a markable profit. While, this is most prevalent now-a-days for career-centric people; moreover, has become a basic platform for financial savings and needs. Out of passion, this is widely accepted as the vital source of immigration.",
        "Although, this may be true, but conclusively, this also brings a Universal Unity ending up with global economic balanced growth, supporting each other in engraving path. Conclusively, immigration is necessary, keeping in view of all the aforesaid notes."
