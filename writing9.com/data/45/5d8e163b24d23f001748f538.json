        "In recent decades, the question of whether an international languages should be applied all around the world or not has been receiving the great deal of public attention. Although this trend is not without positive aspects, the downside will justify these.",
        "On the one hand, the emergence of a global language brings people many benefits. First, in term of education, since the global language helps process of approaches with new knowledge become easier for people rather than with language barriers, people find it easy to absorb knowledge. For example, one person can have grasp of fields, such as science, literature, technology, when all informative texts are translated into the same language, which helps him or her broaden his or her horizons.  Second, by using the international language, many countries can promote their economic growth. This means that in industrialization process, multinational companies emerge quickly, be coupled with foreigner experts work around the world, thus using the same language when working can help people exchange information easily and increase their productivity.",
        "On the other hand, applying a global language also has negative aspects. First, the adoption of a universal language can lead to the extinction of other minority languages. In fact  A country finds it difficult to abandon its own language , because there are historical and cultural values which connects with this language by the time, entailing the disappearance of cultural identities. Second, in order to create an international language, it demands a great deal of efforts and time to get it done. This means that this process requires the collaboration of majority of linguists all around the world to create a language that is easy to say, easy to learn but the probability of success is very low because it will take thousands of years to complete this process.",
        "In conclusion, the disadvantages of this trend will be far more significant the benefits."
