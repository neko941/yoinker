        "In some Us area it is illegal for teenagers to stay outside during night if they are not accompanied by and adult. Teenagers' age normally is ranged between 11 to 18 or 19 or even 24 years old in different categories. I believe that for some particular age in teenager's category, this law can be logic but it shouldn't include all of the teenagers.",
        "In my opinion very young teenagers who are below 16 years old may have not been enough matured to decide what is good and what is bad. They need to be accompanied by some adult for their own safety as well as others. For example when they are offered by their friends to smoke cigarette, they can really decide to accept or reject which can harm them if they accept it. also if their friends ask them to commit some crime which sometimes even can be dangerous for public,they are not enough wised to accept or reject as even they may not know what they are going to do is considered as a crime.",
        "Although scientists believe that human brain can grow and developed up to age 24 years old, They also believe that in most of the cases, the human brain is already enough grown to help them make decision and differentiate between good and bad in age of 16. in the other word, even they are still considered as teenagers but they should have the rights to have their own life and plan every aspects of it by themselves.",
        "Just mentioning the teenagers can make it complicated and the law makers should set the age limits instead of just mentioning the teenagers."
