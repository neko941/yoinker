        "Education is the most fundamental stone on the path of success. A solid educational foundation is bound to bolster one's future while a weak foundation can eventually sink one's into the abyss.",
        "With the ease of access to high speed internet, online education and e-learning have become increasingly popular. While it is convenient to look up a topic and stream its video, there are several reasons that might hamper the e-learning process. Since there is a lot of content available in this day and age, quality of the content and the study material become paramount when it comes to a well-crafted learning experience, of which there is little to no guarantee on an online teaching forum. Moreover, the ease of creating content and teaching these lessons without any verification of credentials of the tutors further reduces credibility of the quality of material and in turn dampens the overall educational experience.",
        "On the other hand, since there is a lot more content available, it widens horizons for students to adopt different methods and concepts towards the same ideas that would have been limited to the one imparted by the tutor in the traditional education system.",
        "In my opinion, both traditional and online education are here to stay and as long as we don't completely rely on either and find a way to apply their learnings as and when we see fit, the educational experience can be enhanced by leaps and bounds."
