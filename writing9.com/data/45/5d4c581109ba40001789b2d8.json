        "Technology has greatly affect our educational awareness nowadays.Many students strongly depend on these new technologies in everyday  study,especially the academic study would require high and updated information which can be acquired through the internet.I adopt the stance that technology has effectively changed the educational system into a smart way for students who receive.this topic will explain why technology is important in our educational systems .",
        "To begin with,artificial intelligence has become essential in daily live using.In other words,these modern gadgets saved our times without any tiring at searching in order to get the information we need.Furthermore, all post graduate students who have to collect many resources for their maters or PHD",
        "would become more easier than last decades.this shows that these cutting edge tools facilitate and enable  new prospects for our study.",
        "Furthermore,many countries tend to imitate other nations in their ways of educational and extracurricular systems,especially these new ways that based on virtual learning.Moreover,this e-learning system enables many of disabled and international student to take part in these courses and get a certificate as wel.For example,many of universities such as Cambridge make courses for the international students unless their attendance is a must.Hence,these programs can not be done one day if we do not have modern technology.",
        "Having manifested the aforementioned reasons and examples, it can be concluded that technology is our major breakthrough which we can rely on for better eduaction .many people and I think that if we apply technology in our educational systems properly,it will become such a great evolution in our systems and mindsets"
