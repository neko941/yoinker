        "Some people believe that professional workers such as doctors and nurses have paid more than  sport athletes ans tv stars. I believe that there should be reasonable  wage among the professions depending how hard their job is. In an other word, if the employee works long ours with a great compremise , they can be the one who earn more.",
        "There are lots of different occoputons. Everyone deserves to live good and also have to right to feed their families. The professions such as doctors and nurses have a great contribution to society. However, there are some people who do not have chance to go further in their education. There is a long education path for some of professions such as attorneys or physicist and these education may cost too much. Beside that, education system can not be fair enough for some of us. Having a skilled teacher or additional courses are part of these education to become a doctor or nurses. If we believe that they deserve more, we would loose the balance between poor and rich. We all keep this in our mind that we are all part of this society and as long as we know that we are all for one, we wouldn't loose the social balance between people who had  been supported on their education and who hadn't had. Every indivitual deserves the best and none of us would not be happy if we surronded by sad people who hadn't had enough money to live happly.",
        "There are some people who believe the opposite. Eventtualy, here would be differences between salaries. if we consider that being entertained or watching a good match are also very important. These occoputions also make great deal of conturibution to society's mental healt. Feeling united or cheering altogather would be enjoyable and  unforgetable moments in our life which boost our sanity.",
        "In conculusion, who has great contrubiton to society  as a profession would be anyone such as enternatiners or nurses. Whatever we do for a living, we all deserve to be well paid equally."
