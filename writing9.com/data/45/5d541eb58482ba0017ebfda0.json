        "The way people handle things for its life-cycle has changed over time. Now-a-days many people are increasingly throwing away damaged items. In the past, people had skills to repair and reuse broken items, but the current generation is only used to replace rather than repair. This essay will discuss why this change has happened and what will be the effects of this change in attitude.",
        "Busy schedules of people and change in manufacturing methods tend to be the main reasons for this attitude. People are becoming increasingly occupied with their work these days, which gives them less time to repair damaged items. For example, I recently visited my neighbors house and observed that she is replacing a broken tap which otherwise by our older generation will be fixed for reuse. In addition to this, manufacturers in cost of the industries are building the products for a short span of time unlike the old days. For example, cars are now built to last for a maximum of 10 years. Overall, since repairing things could take considerable amount of time away in this fast paced world and the narrowed down lifecycle of products has changed the attitude of people to replace rather than repair.",
        "Curbing natural resources and increasing wastefulness are the alarming effects of this practice. The amount of steel used in manufacturing automobiles is increasing in tandem with production. For example, a statistic by a popular autotech survey recently said that there simply is not enough steel to cater the vehicle needs of all adults in India and China. Also, the discarding methods and facilities of these damaged products are not fully established. This means the pile of wastage is going high everywhere around us. If this phenomenon continues our net generation will see an unaffordable costs in owning a vehicle living in a polluted environment.",
        "In conclusion, today we tend to buy new items rather than repairing older possessions. The hectic life of people and manufacturers motive towards product development are seen to be the reasons for change and the environmental degradation and reducing natural resources are discussed as the main effects. Hence, it is recommended that the manufacturers rather than bolstering the sale numbers be a little sensitive towards environmental damage created and concentrate on producing biodegradable and a better lasting product by usage."
