        "University degree is very important among the students. In many years ago, students study in their own country to acquire a University degree but  recently, there are lot of opportunities among students to study overseas. There are lot of benefit and disadvantages of this development. I will discuss it in the upcoming paragraphs.",
        "To begin with that when the student did a University degree in their own country they get better support from their parents and having fully concentration on their study however, if they go abroad for higher study then they live independently and take care of themselves and they can not give fully concentration on their study. Moreover, the tution fees in the overseas University are very high and the parents can not afford.So students take admission in their own country. Also if student go abroad for higher education then they meet their parents or family at once a month or year.",
        "On the other hand, there are many benefits to go abroad for higher study. Firstly, in overseas student live independently and take care of themselves then it helps to learn new skills.In the new country they make friends and communicate with others it helps to build communication skills.In addition,in overseas it provides better condition of living and it also provides high salary to the students for their jobs.So students prefers to go abroad because of high standard of living and after study they start job and foreign companies pays higher salary to the students.For instance, nowadays students go abroad for higher study because in overseas they provided many facilities for the students to live comfortably.",
        "In conclusion,after analysing the advantages outweigh disadvantages.Students prefer to go overseas for their University degree because another countries provide high standard of living and also all the facilities to the students."
