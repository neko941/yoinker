Yet the technology has been put to positive use as an energy source and in certain areas of medicine.\nTo what extent is nuclear technology a danger to life on Earth? What are the benefits and risks associated with its use?",

        "In these days, nuclear power has been popular particularly in many of developed countries. While it has helped people for half century, it has still had negative aspects in use of this technology. This essay will discuss how danger the nuclear technology is and advantages and disadvantages of it.",
        "Whether the nuclear technology is dangerous or not depend on how people use. It might be used for evil way however there might be many ways to utilize it safely. One example of safe way of nuclear use in the real world is that using it for energy source. It could supply electricity for a tremendous number of houses and emit less carbon dioxide than other energy sources. Meanwhile, in fact, it could be weapons such as atomic bombs that absolutely terminate lives in specific area where bomb is dropped. In short, nuclear technology could be safe for every life on Earth if it is managed and used properly.",
        "The main benefit of nuclear technology is its efficiency. It can generate a large amount of energy with few sources. Especially in France, for example, 95% of electricity is covered by nuclear energy.",
        "However, it might be a threat to the life on Earth. Nuclear could be bomb and missile. For example, in WW2 in 1945, it had been used for evil way in Japan. At that time, more than hundred thousand of people had been dead due to atomic bombs.",
        "Overall, nuclear technology could be both beneficial and threat to the people in the world. The people need to restrict it and use only for advantageous way to save life on Earth."
