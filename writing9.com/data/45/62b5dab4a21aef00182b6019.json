        "It is irrefutable fact that a vast majority of pupils ponder that government should bear all the expenditure for providing tertiary education to students. While, government should assist in study expenses but I firmly believe that it is responsibility of students to manage all the expenses own selves instead of depending on state.",
        "To commence  with views of disagreements, state ought to bear expenses to alleviate illiteracy from the root level. To elaborate it, it is often seen that low income families  can not bear the cost of university education in such cases, they deprive from the education and may lead to illiteracy society. Therefore, government should take stern steps to reduce illiteracy by providing free education to low level classes.",
        "Moving towards with the agreements views that  if pupils pay higher fee to achieve holistic education from",
        "education institutions and then they would have greater interest regarding their career outcomes. To explain it, if they are provided education without paying anything and in such cases they are not worried about money that is provided by government. Moreover, they will not pay attention towards seeking job opportunities because they feel that there is no need return money whether establishing own business or doing job. For instance, a survey conducted by the indian government in 2015 revealed that in which countries government pay all the expenditure of study and the unemployment rate is on the high level in these countries. Thus, scholars bear own selves their study expenses so that the burden from the government's shoulders.",
        "Futhermore, this practice leads to bad habits. In other words, students will not have burden return of money  to their parents. In such situations, they can follow the astray path  by indulging in bad habits. for example, if students pay themselves for achieving higher education and therefore they sometimes start part-job with along study. They can support financially to their parents and also help to contribute  in the growth of economy. Hence, by acquiring paid education they can become responsible citizens at the adolescence age.",
        "In conclusion, while the free education  has paramount  role for those who are living under poverty line. However, paid education not only generate job opportunities but also become students well disciplined citizens."
