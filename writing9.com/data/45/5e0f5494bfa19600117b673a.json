        "It has been commonly debated that a number of country purpose to develop living standard by economic improvement, however several essential social values are lost as a result. As far as I am concerned, economic development has certainly got more benefits than drawbacks.",
        "On the negative side, when countries improve living standart by economic development, individuals spend amount of time in work as a result of which, they have not enough time for themselves do social activities. A great number of population of developing country spend only 3 or 4 hors with thier family. For example, population of America never attent any intelectual compatition or other events becuase their works. To be honest, their profits more than other employer of other country, while they never take part in social values.",
        "Despite the evident drawbacks, economic developments has more benefits for citizens.",
        "The major advantages of the mentioned issue is that population of developing country have high life standards. They have 2 or 3  own homes  at the same time as their children go to special schools and they go to schools by car. That is to say their education level more than other children so It is easy to ge tertiory education these countryes. For istance, in Japan childrens are more inteligent  than others so they enter the university easily. Moreover, this individuals has more profits tahn others.Their carrier life more than 10 years as a result this countries has great economic developments, namely they get high income from job so they have high life standarts.",
        "To sum up, although economic development has certain evident downsides the benefit of it clearly oughtweigh them."
