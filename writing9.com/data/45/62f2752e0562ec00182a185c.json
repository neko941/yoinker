        "The children are a relevant part of our society as they will contribute to the country as well as society. When it comes to the upbringing of the youngsters every parent sees their child  be successful and achieve extraordinary in  life. As a result, they tend to complete wishes and desires which in return are expected of good results.",
        "Some people believe that sense of competition should be there in life to acquire new heights and goals . For ,example desire to score more marks than a friend or neighbour's child provides a high spirit while preparing for exams and competitions.However some parents put pressure by comparing to the toppers and in return, it demotivates the child.",
        "On the other ,hand students who develop a sense of cooperation and understand the need of the hour become more useful adults to our surroundings. Furthermore, it will help them in future to choose wisely and patiently while going for the big decisions of life. Apart from that they treat their superiors and juniors equally, and support and encourage them in every aspect.",
        "In my opinion, healthy competition is always beneficial to the environment as long as it does not hurt anyone's emotions and encourages the students toward positive results. On the other ,hand this will create intelligent and  healthy minds which will be helpful to the economies and the World."
