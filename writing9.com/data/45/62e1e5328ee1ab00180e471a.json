        "Children are the backbone of every nation. Some people believe that free social work must be included in the school syllabus as it results in a flourished society and individualistic growth of youngsters themselves . I too believe  that this addition has more benefits than its drawbacks.",
        "To begin with , social work by children can be associated with personality development because of this drive children tend to communicate with a variety of people leads to polishing verbal skills . For example , if they start convincing rural areas people to send their children to school they have to be a convincing attitude along with developed verbal skills to deal with a diverse variety of people .Apart from this ,the other traits of life such as trust, honesty, patience ,tolerance , cooperation and team spirit can be learnt . Besides  that , young minds serving the community with full enthusiasm  gives them a feeling of fulfilment and self-satisfaction . The worthiness for themselves brim with  self-confidence and patriotic feelings ."
