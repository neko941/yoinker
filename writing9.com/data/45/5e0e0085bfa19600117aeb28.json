Young children are very curious the things around him or her surroundings  and providing safe and friendly atmosphere to learn by them without teaching or distracting their imagination and creativity helps to make a independent human later on their life . For example, providing free playing activities such as painting , drawing, dancing as well as playing with groups helps to develop childs social , physical , emotional as well as intellectual skills wish helps to be a intelligent citizen.",
        "Secondly, giving priority for personal preference rather than forcing children to have what parent wish is also beneficial . Every child is unique and has a variety of talents and desires which can be used to development of the country . Encouraging their inner souls to polish their talents without make them down is important to have a happy ,successful citizen .For instanse, if a child likes to become a sport person and has a lot talents parents should give support to be a athleties rather than forcing him to be a doctor or engineer . In my opinion, I think, even though,",
