        "There is no denying that transport has become increasingly important in modern life, and due to it\u2019s necessity, public authorities have taken more interest in it. Some people believe that they should invest more in trains rather than ameliorating streets. This essay agrees with that opinion as railways are preferable for two main reasons.",
        "One of the major reasons for train preference over other transportation means is the minimal environmental impact. While other types of vehicles work on oil, trains run on mechanically produced electrical energy instead, making it more environmentally friendly. Moreover, a recent study claimed that cars are solely responsible for more than seventy percent of fuel use worldwide. Thus, replacing them with trains would reduce the overall oil consumption remarkably, and consequently, lessens the environmental print.",
        "Being a faster way to travel, is another considerable factor for encouraging train support. that is due to it having an exclusive infrastructure, providing a path that is free of trafic congestion as well as other circulation restrictions, such as speed limitations and repetitive stops. For instance, people who shuttle frequently between two cities, for work purposes, opt for taking the train more than buses and personal automobiles in order to save time, according to a recent survey conducted by the Moroccan ministry of equipment and public transport.",
        "To recapitulate, this essay strongly agrees with orientating public expenses more towards promoting and enhancing train transportation than roads. Because it is more beneficial to the environment as well as it being  faster compared with other means."
