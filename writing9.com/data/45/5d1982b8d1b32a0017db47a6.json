        "Wealthier nations often offer financial support to undeveloped countries, however this does nothing to help solving poverty. That is why it is argued that richer countries should provide other kind of support to poorer countries. This essay agrees with this statement because in most of developing countries government are corrupted so the money is not invested and also because money is not useful if richer countries exploited natural resources of developing countries.",
        "Although richer countries have more money than poorer ones, giving financial support have been proved not been efficient as a way of helping solve poverty. The main reason for this is that in the majority of developing countries government are corrupted. So, any money that developed countries invest in undeveloped ones, ends up in a black hole. For example, according to a study carried by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) on 30 developing countries from Asia, Latin America and Africa, half of this nations have had corrupted governments over the last 20 years.",
        "On the other hand, most richer and industrialized countries that usually donate money to poor ones, are the same that devastate their natural resources. This is the motive why the money that richer countries donate is done as a manner of compensation for the natural destruction of the ecosystems in undeveloped countries. The destruction of this ecosystems causes more poverty, thus not helping in solving this issue; and money can do little to help once the ecosystem has been destroyed, in addition to the fact that most money is not invested in the country. For instance, a recent study of the Harvard University has found that 30% of the Amazonia Forest has been cut-down, over the last 50 years and mostly by foreigner companies, and that this has caused at least 50,000 of poor people in Brazil.",
        "In conclusion, this essay agrees with the statement that richer countries should provide other type of support to developing nations rather than money because money has been proved not to be invested in the development of people in those countries and because other kinds of help such as commitment to not destroy the natural resources of developing countries could result of a better path towards reducing poverty."
