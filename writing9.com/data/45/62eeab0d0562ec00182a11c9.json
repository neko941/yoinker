        "Nowadays the use of media is much more significant than face to face  communicati\u0131on amony many people  in society. This essay will discuss both the  benefits and drawbacks of this phenomenon and provide a logical  conclusion.",
        "On the first  hand, the use of media   to communicate with people has got  an advantage  such as faster access to every location.  People  can  communicate  with anybody  if  they use   the media.  According to  BBC  90% people use media  for   communicating  with distant  friends. Such as if you live in usa    you would communicate  with your friends  who live in Germany.",
        "We would  access every  friend or relative.The second advantage is speed using media is faster than face to face communication. Research conducted  recently indicated that media  is the fastest way of communication. \u0130f people use media  to communicate  they would save energy and time.",
        "On the other hand, using  media to communicate with people  has    drawbacks  such as  harmful for our body and addiction. Firstly, every technological device  might affect body.",
        "An extensive  survey conducted by CNN revealed that Using media  increases 60%  cancer risk. If we use  too much we could get  cancer.Second advantage is addiction. Addiction is one of the biggest problems in the world. A study carried out by  Harvard University showed that using media    leads to  addiction.  \u0130f people  made  an addiction they would  waste time. They cannot improve themselves   because of   media addiction. Addiction is the obstacle to improvement. t",
        "\u0130n conclusion there are many pros and cons of  using media  for communication.However It has been suggested that people shouldnt  spend much time  on the  media. Crowds should use media for just necessary things."
