        "Global warming is the major issue that the world is facing right now. Governments and large company's contribution to a sustainable environment can make a large difference rather than individual citizen.This is agreed to a major extend because the government has the power to enforce laws that can make the world a better place to live where individuals can do this only to a smaller extend like their household and neighboourhood.",
        "Global warming is increasing at an alarming rate.So it is every citizen's duty to create a sustainable environment. This should start from their living. People should start doing things that can have impact in their environment. For example, In a country like India where there is extreme drought during summer, people are encouraged to plant trees near their houses. These trees helps them in maintaining their ground water level which inturn saves water for summer. So changes like these can create an impact in environment athough it is less but it is appreciated and valued.",
        "On the other hand, Government and large companies plays a major role in keeping the environment available for the future. Governement should come up with policies that encourages the use of bio degradable products, less use of green house gases etc. Secondly, large companies that are mainly involved in oil and gas sector should convert their toxic wastes into something that is less dangerous for the environment.They should stop disposing their waste into river and lakes which can affect the aquatic life. For instance, the government of Tamil nadu banned the usage of plastic from 2019, its been almost 4 months and recent studies showed that the consumption of plastics have reduced by 30%.This cannot be achieved without the involvement of government.",
        "To conclude, individuals also contribute to a smaller extent in creating a sustainable enviornment whereas the major percentage lies in the hands of government and large companies."
