        "Nowadays there is a variety of music exist in the world. It is used to refresh humankind and in my opinion traditional music more beneficial than international music which is played all over the world. These essays first discuss the importance of music and then why traditional music is more crucial.",
        "In the different parts of world music is used to create a good mood. When people expose themself for musical bits their body and mind start to rejuvenate, which creates a good feeling and then they try to catch tuna. For example, when I listen to some spiritual Christian music include Hossana, those with such a wonderful blessing I often felt really happy.",
        "Traditional music is more vital than the international music that heard all over the world. There are lots of good points to listen to local music because it is a better way to discover the local culture and customs, for instance, when the artist plays the traditional music such as dubo, konoc, whose sounds are accompanied with instruments, he uses different body movement to produce good vocal. All these arts are important to reveal once culture.",
        "In conclusion, currently, variety of music already exists in the world, which is really refreshing and entertaining. Traditional music has a great role in revealing once culture and customs unlike international music, which is heard across the globe."
