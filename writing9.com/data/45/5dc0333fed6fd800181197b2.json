        "People think that it has become difficult to get into university for rich people as well as poor people. I do not agree with the statement as in my opinion, wealthy people are more privileged to get admission in the universities as compared to needy ones. I will discuss in the further paragraphs of the essay about it.",
        "First of all, universities has a certain criteria for the admissions such as entrance tests, no backlogs, special co-curricular activities etc. and those who are able to fulfil the criterions get entry. For instance, if a rich man' kid have not obtained desired score in the entrance exam, then he/she would not be able to be in the institute. Furthermore, money is an issue for the kids belonging to economically weak families as if their children would pass the test and they do not have money to pay the fees, they would not get the admission. Sometimes, institutes provide scholarships for the poor kids and they got admission, still there remain many hurdles in their way like hostel fees, transport expenses, etc. which makes them to drop their plans of further studies.",
        "Second of all, money is the privilege for the children of families with higher incomes because of the seats of management quotas and by giving huge bribes to the staff, they are able to get into the higher education institutes. The final thing is corruption which takes away the opportunities from the hands of underprivileged ones.",
        "In the end, I say that everyone has the right of getting equal opportunities in the education and government should support the economically weaker individuals to get it. Corruption should also be prevented to stop these types of practices."
