        "Artists should be able to have the liberty to express their opinions without too many restrictions on them, otherwise the country can no longer develop as there wouldn't be anyone else to question the thoughts and motives of others. But then again, some restrictions are needed to be placed on them to avoid unnecessary conflict and protect the ones on whom harm could be intended.",
        "Firstly, artists should have freedom to be able to express themselves, and only then is the country is going to move forward. Artists are needed in the society to question and provide alternative thoughts on a situation, which is very much in need, so that people in general wouldn't just follow a trend or agree with an opinion solely because it's popular, instead they would start to think on their own too. For example, Charles Dickens and Victor Hugo in 1880's have questioned and opposed against the England and France government respectively which helped the nations to move forward.",
        "On contrary, some restrictions are needed to avoid conflict. For artists, while expressing what they think is right, sometimes their ideas and opinions might be harmful to the society. Moreover, the opinions of the public can be very much be influenced by what the artists, whom they look up to"
