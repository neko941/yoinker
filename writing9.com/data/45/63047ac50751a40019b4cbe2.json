        "Recently a growing number of crimes are seen in the media committed by former prisoners. To protect innocent people from these harmful crimes, there must be actions to stop these criminals and help them not to make another mistake. Let us delve deeper into this issue in the upcoming paragraphs.",
        "The first reason why criminals commit crimes after they are released is the lack of surveillance by authorities. Nowadays there are fewer people who apply for the government task, so the lack of labor resulted in the insufficient observation of released criminals. Several studies show that a large proportion of re-commited crimes is usually occured in less than 3 months, and then the figure gradually decreased as time goes by. So the first 3 months is a very important period to control these criminals effectively. In short, sufficient surveillance by authorities is essential for prohibiting criminals from other crimes.",
        "On the other hand, criminals usually commit crimes because there are no options for them. They have no choice but to commit crimes repeatedly to maintain their living. Due to their former criminal records and lack of job experience, they fail to get proper job opportunities. To stop this vicious circle, there are several educational programs for the prisoners provided by authorities. These education programs are originally purposed for prisoners' later employment after they liberate from prison. This recovery program is an important policy to give another chance to former criminals to become ordinary citizens.",
        "I think there are so many ways to take back these former criminals as hard-working ordinary citizens. To make it real, governments' proper actions are required to help them not to make another mistake and appropriate programs should be provided to these willing citizens to give them another chance."
