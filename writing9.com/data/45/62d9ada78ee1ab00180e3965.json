        "The diagram illustrates the change in families spending weekly salary in a country in 1968 and 2018.",
        "As is shown clearly in the graph, it is apparent that food accounts for the largest consumption of families in 1968, whereas leisure became the most predominant place of families\u2019 expenditure in 2018.",
        "In 1968, food spending made up 35% of the total income usage; the figures for housing and clothing and footwear were relatively lower, both at 10%; By contrast, the rest of the categories were lower than 20% and the fuel and power were the lowest, with only around 7%.",
        "In 2018, the consumption proportion of food had witnessed a dramatic decrease from 35% to 17%, a contrary trend could be noticed when we examined the types like housing, transport and leisure, the surge of leisure was more than twice that it was in 1968. Moreover, clothing and footwear, fuel and power and personal goods showed a similar trend to  food. Finally, the household goods remained unchanged over these 50 years."
