        "In the contemporary era, travelling to different places and area is one of the most welcomed approaches for recreation during holidays. Travelling is not restricted by domesticated area, but also is extended to foreign countries. Some people suggests that fewer people will choose to spend holidays at home country instead of travelling aboard. From my perspetive, there are few reasons which convince me to agree with the statement.",
        "Several compelling reasons can be listed to argue the strong motivations of visiting foreign countries from visitors. Initially, those well-known attractions or landscapes aboard have no alternatives in the domestic area. Many people dream about the famous architectures, cities, and natural scenary from other countries and thus they would choose to visit the place without hesitation if there's a chance. In addition to that, people love travelling as they experience the culture shock and different living habits from exotic regions. Travelling aboard enables the chances to be emerged in different foods, arts and culture, and life style. By contrast, visiting somewhere in the same country would be restricted by the similar things with less novelity. Lastly, advanced technologies been applied to tranportation may lead to the reduced costs for international flights, trains, and ships. The lower price could enabled people to expand their choices of destinations. Since visiting the world outside of the home country is a valuable opportunity to enrich their life experiences.",
        "On the countrary, someone proposes that the trend of international travelling will reduce due to the Covid-19 situation. Admittedly, the global pandemic brings the undeniable negative impact to tourisms and international transportation. For instance, the reduced flight numbers and delayed travelling schedules. However, the governmental restriction of travelling gradually alleviates among many countries and areas. As a result, we will be free to spend time on vacations somewhere outside of the coutry in the neat future.",
        "In all, it is true that the global pandemic is one of the major impacts to delay chances of international travelling. Neverthless, the trend of globalization is not going to be ended and strong desires to explore new world from people could lead them to pursue travellings aboard during vacations."
