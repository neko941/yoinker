        "Nowadays due to technology on finger tips the increasing trend of online shopping is on his peak. But the importance of offline shopping is always debatable has now become more controversial with many people climing that it is beneficial while other reject this notion. The substancial influence of this trend has sparked the controversy over the potential impact in recent years. In my opini\u00f3n the latter propositon appears to be more rational. This essay will further elabroate my disagreement of this trend and thus will lead to logical conclusion.",
        "Analysing the statement and explaining further the first and the foremost reason behind this is that the trend of online shoping will not lead to closing of shops and mall in towns. There are lots of different variety and choices of peoples are in the socity. Another striking benefits is you can choose the exact color of the shirt and choose material you like by feel of touch and also try out.",
        "This is a lacking point in the online shopping.The offiline shops cr\u00e9ate various job oppurtunities.",
        "There are lots of business which will never turn to online because it requires personal presance for the service For example, Beauty parlours, Barber shops, Massage parlour , restaurants where you prefer to celebrate your occassion, Pharmacy where you have to my certain medication with the prescription of the doctor, garrages , petrol station, and Icecream parlour. So it is rather next to imposible that online shopping will repace the offline shopping.",
        "To culminate the trend of offiline shopping will be continues in a long run, and I totally disagree that online shoping will shut off the shopes and malls in towns."
