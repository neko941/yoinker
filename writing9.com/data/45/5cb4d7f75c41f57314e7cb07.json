        "Some individuals believe that the authorities should spend more money on education rather wasting it on the arts. I strongly disagree with the statement, spending has to be balanced on both education and arts. In any country, arts play a crucial role in preserving its heritage and the culture, ignoring it is not the way forward.",
        "Over the thousands of years, each and every ancient civilization preserved their roots in the form arts, without which we will not be able to understand the depth and true history of the mankind.  If the government is going to spend all its resources on education, the system churns out the human machines with no sense of imagination and connection with the society. Admiration and promotion of the arts is equally important as promoting education. In fact, I believe arts should be introduced as a subject in the academia right from the primary school.",
        "Arts define the identity of the society and it keeps the people united. India is one of the oldest and most diverse countries on earth, no other country on the planet has such an admiration towards arts then India and that is evident in the architecture of the temples and its sacred texts. If the government do not promote it, in the near future practically there would no paintings and the sculptures for the ordinary people to enjoy.",
        "To conclude, I firmly disagree with the statement that government should ignore arts and spend more time and money in education. It is a proven fact that arts can act as a stress buster."
