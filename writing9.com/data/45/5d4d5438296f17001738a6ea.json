        "In today\u2019s fast pacing world it has become very difficult for a person to help others, but some people who tend to deliver the purpose of humanity. However, others say that if you are rich enough only then you can serve humanity. I completely disagree with the thought that a middle-class person cannot avail of the opportunity of helping others.",
        "There are different merits and demerits for being rich. One of the significant features of being rich is that you can help others, but it doesn\u2019t mean that people with a middle-class background are not eligible or could not serve the needy people and contribute towards humanity. People with different financial backgrounds have nothing to do with serving the people. It entirely depends on the intent of the service you are offering.",
        "Moreover, many times in my life came across instances in which a middle-class person has helped a poor and a needy person. It was during my school days when a beggar came to my house asking for some food and money. My mother immediately went inside the kitchen to get some food and money for the poor. I must tell you we are from a middle-class background but still we intended to help the poor as he was in need and moreover, it is considered a generous deed and a divine service."
