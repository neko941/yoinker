        "In recent times, crime has been a global issue and is inscreasing at an alarming rate. While behind a scene there are numerous factors, which are ranging from illiteracy and unemployment, corrective measurs can be taken to tackle such an issue.",
        "There are several reasons for the increase in crime level. Firstly, unemployment is the paramount cause for comitting crimes. For instance, a study conducted in South Africa concluded that high rates of unemployment at a certain province leads to the development of destitute communities, therefore, generating a feeling of despair and inequality among community members. Such desires are the culprit the drive people into criminal organizations. Furthermore, illiteracy results in juvenile deliquencies, as uneducated youngsters are more prone to drug addition , than their contrary educated similars. Drug addicts aggressively crave abusive chemicals and this has a profound significance in enhancing violence levels.",
        "Turning to solutions, a number of actions can be taken in order to reduce crime. Governments should establish and develop employment offices in order to allocate individulas to a relevant employer. Additionally, governments should encourage entrepreneurs and ease establishment of start ups, as this will consequently expand businesses and employment opportunities. Furthermore, formation of subsidised educational systems can abolish illiteracy, giving rise to educated professionals into the society. This will definitely halt drug abuse and juvinile crimes. Last but not least, rehabilitation programs and vocational trainings in prisons can minimize reoffending.",
        "In conclusion, while poor education systems and unemployment are key drivers for the rise in criminal activity, subsidized robust education systems and recruitment offices can mitigate crime."
