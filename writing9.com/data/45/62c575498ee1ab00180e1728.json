        "The given diagrams illustrate the life cycle of salmons, a large species of fish.",
        "Overall, it is noticeable there are a total of three stages in this life cycle, commencing with the egg stage and ending with the adult stage.",
        "In the first stage, the salmon's life cycle begins with the hatching of eggs. These salmon eggs are laid amongst the reeds and small stones in the upper river. It is notable that this part of the river is slow-moving. In this stage , after a period of about five to six months, the baby fish that are born are called fry and are about three to eight long. The fry swims from the lower river to fast flowing.",
        "In the second stage, after Living in this lower river for a period of about four years, the fry gradually grows into a smolt when it measures about 12 to 15 cm in length. Following this stage, it is ready to migrate into the open sea which the smolt for roughly about 5 years. After this stage has been completed, the adult stage is approximately 70 to 76 cm long. Finally, the adult fish swim back to the same location where they were born."
