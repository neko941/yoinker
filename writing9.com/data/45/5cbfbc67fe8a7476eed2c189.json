        "Nowadays even there are numerous technological properties on autos, car crashes continue to occur. On one hand there are reasons of accidents such as people's passion on speed and misconfigured traffic circumstances. On the other hand, there are simple solutions to figure them out, like tight monitoring of the traffic to be able to detect the ones who break rules, and improving traffic environment by following correct procedures.",
        "Firstly, there are different causes of crashes. One reason for accidents is people's passion on speed even though there is speed limiting technology on vehicles. Adrenalin hormone addiction pushes some people to make speed beyond traffic rules and they not only put themselsves at great risk but also increase the possibility of road accidents including other individuals. This addiction also causes people to bypass the technologies which developed for safety. For example they deactivate the speed tracker chips or include another chip to fuzz the former. Another reason for car crashes is traffic infrastructure such as misconfigured traffic lights, signs and deprecated roads. In such environment people are prone to cause crushes.",
        "Coming to solutions for road accidents, monitoring the roads may be very advantageous, because people who break traffic laws can be detected with a high rate. These people can be discouraged by proper fines. Another way to address road crash problem could be improving the traffic infrastructure. An accurate configuration of the infrastructure on critical points on driveways would reduce the accidents efficiently. Besides, roads should be kept as qualified as vehicles can accommodate safely.",
        "In conclusion, road accidents are caused by people's passion on speed and misconfigured road conditions, and can be reduced by taking solutions such as proper monitoring of the traffic and improving traffic infrastructure."
