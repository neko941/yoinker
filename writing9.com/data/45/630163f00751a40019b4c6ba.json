        "Education has become a leading training in the world today based on the advance use of the technology.it is believed that any nation that educates its young one has made a great investment for the future.many country's benefit from the university sector because of the increase in the rate of youthful students while some territory believe is a total waste of time that can lead to scarcity of job for students when they are through with school.In this essay I will elabora In this issue and also give an outstanding opinion about it.",
        "Firstly,The rate of young people who are willing to go to the higher level of education increases day by day that is why if education is provided for them,the government earns from it in the future because without education a country will not generate much in this modern world where techno has taken the lead.Futhermore,fees made from the higher rank of education will be a great income to the country,so the higher the no of scholars the higher the income",
        "in the other hand,due to high rate of graduates seeking for jobs in the labour market some other set of people believe that creating room for junior university students are waste of time probably because of lack of job opportunities in such country.These set of prefer to send their offspring to learn a trade in other to be successful in business in the future.although you find out that at the end they still need the educated citizens to run a successful business for them which still makes education the first amongs all.",
        "Nevertheless,my humble view to this believes is that leaders of countries should make sure thatas the rate of youthful graduates increases there should be provision of suit able jobs in every sector."
