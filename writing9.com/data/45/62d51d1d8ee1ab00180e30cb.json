        "The modern world is totally based on technology.It is changing from day to time according to the needs of people.Every day new invention is developed.So we can imagine a life without the automation industry.The biggest invention of technology is computers.It is used everywhere like schools,offices,banks,big and small organisations etc.Children are also becoming so dependent on computers that even their teachers need to avoid using them in the classroom and want to start basic study skills because they are thinking that it should affect their reading and writing skills.",
        "Even it sparks heated debate.But I am totally against it.",
        "In my opinion,definitely computers affect their writing as well as reading skills.But with one or two disadvantages we can not ignore its benefits.Computers make their study very simple.",
        "Whatever material they want they students easily get through the internet.",
        "In  Covid ,pandemic it's not possible for them to attend classes.It should become possible only through the computer.Students attained their classes online.",
        "Thirdly it is very for children to learn with the help of computers because they saw everything virtually.Then their memory power becomes stronger.They can learn and remind everything fast and quickly.",
        "In the conclusion,we can not ignore its merits and should encourage our children to follow basic study skills also."
