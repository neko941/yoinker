        "Nurture Vs nature is a highly controversial subject. Although it is sometimes believed that everyone has some inherited talents, other people think that it can be developed by training and coaching. In my opinion, I consider whether a child talented or self made, they require a good amount of practice to excel in their field.",
        "On the one hand, supporters of inherited talents argue that gifted child are born with it; therefore, there is no need  of having any kind of skill training to achieve any   success in their life. In other words, some children possess excellency  in, such as, sports, music, or dance and  no training is required for them. Indian playback singer, for example, Kishore Kumar was a legend and  he did not have any formal training in music. Therefore, those who backs  the inborn talents can make an obvious connection with this.",
        "However, on the other hand, many people wonder that with training and the  practice,  any  kind of skill can be learnt. Moreover, anyone can become master any skill since the  practice makes perfection. Take Sachin as an example, with his hardwork , which means  strick training schedules and practice sessions,  made him reach top of the cricket.",
        "Thus,the argument of training make talented people also clear.",
        "Finally,in my  viewpoint, I believe, without proper training and hard work nobody can succeed with their talents. Even though some are highly gifted, they even undergo vigorous training sessions to bring about the best from them. Similarly, self made  artists or cricketers also do the same thing to make their career stable.",
        "In summary, some think that  inherited skills don't require training to achieve success, whereas opponents consider",
        "trained people also perform as like the gifted one. It is advised that without proper guidance and training it would be difficult for anyone to bring the best in their life."
