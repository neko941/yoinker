        "Firstly, using digital cameras and speed control helps in preventing crime. when a criminal inter place or pass through it and find a camera this will let him think twice before doing any unnormal movement , and if he has done anything this  will assist the police in finding him. moreover, using speed control on roads helps in decreasing the pace, to the allowed one, and lead to fewer accidents, because cars driver have the knowledge that they are observed. It is clear that technology has helped in preventing crimes.",
        "On the other hand,  fingerprint detectors are used in discovering criminals. In other words, when  a rubbery happed in a bank or a house, the first thing that the detective asked for, is looking for any fingerprint that could be found. For example, last month our neighbour went for a holiday and left their home empty, the next day after their departure a thief had come and stool every precious thing left in the home. after the investigations and matching fingerprints the police catch the thief and return the loot. solving this issue needed one of artificial intelligent which wasn't available in the past.",
