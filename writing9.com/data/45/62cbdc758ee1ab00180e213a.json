        "Learning a foreign language is always a struggle, however during young age we have all come to naturally grasp the language of our mother tongue. Therefore, recent notion by experts suggest students to start their journey of learning foreign language from primary school, instead of wating until secondary school. The main advantage in doing so would be students being able to more easily master the language, and obtaining better pronounciation skills. However, there are disadvantages to this idea, considering the significant challenges that are posed on primary students, and further accerelating the issue of underemployment of primary school teachers.",
        "Examining from the benefits, it is no boubt that children brains are much flexible in obtaining new knowledges the younger they are. For that reason, getting in touch with such foreign language whilst there brain are young, can take much shorter time for the children to master the language. Furthermore, since children are faced with the new language before they form a solid accent on their mother tongue, they would have better pronounciation which directly affects individual ability to have conversation with others. For example, in Japan many people understands English grammer, however, due to the lack of confidence in their pronouciation, often times Japanese people would shy away from having English conversations.",
        "On the other hand, there are also challenges to teaching very young children a foreign language. At the age below 7, in many cases the children may still find difficulties in fluently speaking with their first language. Asking such young ones to learn another language is a significant burden. Moreoever, if foreign language lessons are to be designed into the curriculum, qualification to become a teacher would rise, resulting in decrease in number of teachers. In Japan, there is already lack of teachers in such facilities, rising standards would further increase the underlying issue.",
        "In conclusion, learning second language from primary age comes with a significant drawback, such as increased difficulties for students and teachers to apply. However, it can not outweigh the rewards of making language learning much easier, with fine pronounciation for the students."
