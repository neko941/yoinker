        "In recent years, there are an increasing number of people tending to live in major cities. In my opinion, living in such big cities has both benefits and drawbacks.",
        "There are several advantages of urban lifestyle. Firstly, citizens have access to better education. There are a huge number of prestigious universities which offer a wide range of academic and vocational course. Students can choose the courses that fulfill their potential and future career. Secondly, inhabitants have better job opportunities. People in my hometown usually work in restaurants, resorts and coffee shops. City dwellers, on the other hand, can work as engineers or architects at industrial centers. In addition, people can work at international companies and corporations to get a higher salary and faster promotion. Lastly, residents can enjoy endless entertainment activities. Just getting outside, they immediately encounter various street festivals, cinemas, and shopping malls. Living in the city, you will never get bored.",
        "Residing in big cities also has some disadvantages. To begin with, people tend to be under tremendous pressure and stress. They are always up to their ears with workload and have less time to relax. Also, a higher cost of living drives them crazy when balancing the budgets. Another issue is pollution, especially air pollution and noise pollution. Not only high pollution density but also high volumes of traffic are significant contributors to increasing emission and noisiness. This seriously affects people's health and harms the environment. Last but not least, big-city life often lacks safety. In other words, big cities tend to have higher rates of crime due to poverty can density. Thus, it is really hard to control crimes and social evils in such a complex society.",
        "In a word, living in big cities has great benefits but also some significant shortcomings. As far as I am concerned, it is crucial to learn how to adapt to our living environment, make use of the pros and avoid the cons of big-city life."
