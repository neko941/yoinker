        "Art is Known as better formal to explain fellings, thoughts and emotions on a small portion with big message , nowadays some minded individals thought that it is a waste of time whereas other think it as a great apportunity, but in my prospective everyone's not Capable to afford basic tools required for art , whereas these type of activities needs more efforts. On the contrary it  helps to make mind creative",
        "To comence with, why art activities are not essential , because it demands more efforts.  In detail working as a artist requires continues efforts on Small Scale and one have to work in brief. for instance around  60% of children from primary schoola love drawing as they grew up they get to know about details of each and every thing , so working in detail requires more hard work and consume more time.  Children get easily distracted if they donot have any mentor to motivate them",
        "Secondly , not every can afford most of the tools and they are not easily available to everyone for instance  working as a sketch artist one have to   purchase various  type of Pencils and special pepers for making sketch and these Products are only available in  big cities  so those who live in rural area may not afford it , whereas some families live in weak finacial conditions if they try to afford these products for their offspring there basic needs would not be fulfilled",
        "on the contrary , Such art activities helps children to Sharpen their mind and made them creative. furthermore art does not have an end point, one can draw any thing from its own thought to express any felling for instance, the leonardo davinchi thw well known artist who had drawn a famous Painting the monalisa, most  of the resarchers trying to figure it out the main aim  of the art. at last children can learn how to  express their fellings",
        "In nutshell, Such type of activities  would not help in future because  it requires big motive. where as everyone is  not capable to persue this, on the other hand it helps childrer to develop creativenes  and they can express their fellings."
