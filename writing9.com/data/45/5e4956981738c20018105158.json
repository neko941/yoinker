        "There has been a tremendous increase in the number of cars over the last few decades and this development has significantly affected the lifestyle of people. The biggest advantage of having a car is that people can go wherever they want whenever they are ready. However, some argue that the huge number of cars has critically impacted the human beings in a negative way. I do not quite agree with this view. In my opinion, cars have an equal number of merits and demerits.",
        "People who are objected to having a car assert that the cars can deteriorate air quality. Too many cars also cause traffic congestion in cities. Most cars are driven by fossil fuels which emit harmful gases like carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide. Even though scientists are trying to develop eco-friendly fuels, those technologies are still in the nascent stage and they may take many more decades to be available. Nowadays in Seoul, Korea, the quality of air is so bad that wearing a mask is mandatory to maintain one\u2019s health.",
        "On the flip side, cars also offer various benefits. They have made commuting easier. Cars are particularly helpful in emergencies where getting to the destination in the least possible time is of utmost importance. In addition, the car industry generates many jobs and boosts the national economy.",
        "To sum up, there are merits and demerits to owning a car. In my opinion, cars have become an indispensable part of our lives. However, we should bear in mind that overuse of cars will harm our environment.",
        "But we should bear in mind that our nature will be destroyed if we overuse the car. We should control the usage of the car for protecting our environment for the next generation"
