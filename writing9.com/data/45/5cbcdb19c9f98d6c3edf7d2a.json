        "It is true that large cities have been suffering from traffic jam. There are a few methods to make less traffic in these cities.",
        "Firstly, governments should provide a qualified service of pub;ic transportation, namely, buses and trains. Thaking the train or bus should be comfortable and effective. For instance, clean buses and subways make people think it is safe to use these vehicles, as well as keeping fast. If people can save time by using public transportation the y willkeep using it because time is precious in today's world.",
        "As another point, prices should be kept cheap to maintain the service for most of people. A quick and cheap means of transportation would be attractive for the society.",
        "Secondly, people should be discouraged to use their own vehicles. Governments should implement policies to regulate taxes for individual vehicles, resulting in reduction of private cars. A different solution would be configuration of prices of parking places in central zones of the city. When the prices are kept just above a psychological limit, individuals will look for different ways to reach their final destinations by driving people to save money. Hence, the usage of cars will be reduced inprominent locations, leading to cut off the awhole traffic.",
        "In conclusion, traffic jam is a growing issue for big cities, however there are methods to reduce the traffic in them. The more qualified public transportation, the more people use it, especially prices are kept suitable. Also, governments should regulate taxes on private vehicles and keep park charges high to discourage people to use their own cars.All these methods would help to solve traffic issues in metropolitans."
