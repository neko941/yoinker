        "Some media platforms are exclusively for letting people know what is happening in the world and also in specific locations. Some individuals think that getting news through TV and newspapers is just time-wasting because of the lack of connection between the news and people\u2019s lives. I believe that receiving news through these media is important because people can be safer and more conscious if knowing what is happening.",
        "The news programmes on TV and newspapers are important ways of creating awareness about real problems. If the population does not receive any information about the weather forecast, for instance, they can face unexpected rain or even worse, a strong storm. This could put their life at risk or at least make their daily life more difficult. The lack of basic information like the weekly forecast can cause damage to individuals\u2019 lives as well as damage to their houses in case of a tornado/hurricane. Thus, there is a real connection between what we see through the media and what happens in real life.",
