        "The effects of long term sugar consumption and its potential consequences are well known and studied. Among the most common illnessess associated with increased sugar intake are obesity, diabetes, high blood pressue and congestive heart failure. Besides the devistating effects these conditions have on the individul, the yearly expenditure the health system spend treating these conditions is enormous. As a consequences there is a growing debate on whether or not sugar consumption should be limited and who's responsibility is it to do so.",
        "On one hand, many people believe that the government can and should be responsible for preventing increased sugar intake. This is because thay have the ability to create drastic and instant changes in the food industry. For example, through legislation the government can prohibit the marketing of products with high suger content such as candies, morning cerials and cakes. Also, the government can effect the type and quality of food given in scools. By changing the lunch time snack from a candy to an apple, daily sugar consumption can decrease substantially.",
        "In contrast, other people believe that diminshing sugar intake is the individual's responsibility and the government should not interfere with the food industry. According to this beliefe, every person is entitled of its own body and if he want to have a snack it is he's personal decision. Also, some people truely believe that preventing us from having a certain types of foods violate our basic human rights of freedome.",
        "In my opinion, sugar should be limited mostly through state legislation. Sugar, as been shown in many publications, is highly addictive and as a result the government should address it as such. Just like it prevent's the consumption of cocaine and hallucinogens, it should limit the use of sugar. More so, the government should educate children from a very young age on the importance of a balanced diet and daily activities.",
        "In conlusion, I believe sugar should be addressed as an addictive substance and its consumption should be highly regulated. It is the only way we will be able to fight it."
