        "Nowadays, some parent also wants to give their son or a daughter studies at a high-quality school as enough confidence to send a child to the prestigious education system. Others supposes that the boarding school is the best choice for student. In the other hand, some people deny that suggestion for different prejudices. This statement will discuss to be clearly known.",
        "A boarding educational system is a special type of school. Apart from students study in there, they can enjoy meals and live within 5-7 days at school. Such a quality system achieves the supporters as a parent who wants to take their child to school with a blossom can improve child's behaviours, also have a better studying environment through an amount of time because they study at night on a class instead go home in the afternoon. For example, when pupils live at the boarding school, they are applied by many methods that can equip them good knowledge and general skills such as waking up  a punctual or having a much time to talk with friends and create a better community to be protected from the influence of negative society outside the school.",
        "However, some parents are not approved of this way and argue that a child will be endured by many tremendous problems inside the boarding system. For example, many situations such as violence at school or the pressure of studying  can potentially predispose to any suicides, all of which have happened annually that the government has published to confine the negative problems can contact the pupil. Therefore, students are inevitable on the bad side when they live at the institution for 5-7 consecutive days and do not go home. Probably this way makes parents have to against about give them to the boarding school.",
        "In the nutshell, the boarding schools exist a pros and cons. In my opinion, it may a better way if children at home and enjoy their time under the supervisor after school. From that, parents can comfortable and not worry about their child can not be disturbed by negative problems"
