        "There's no doubt that rising living standards have benefited our social life, however, it also fuels several severe environment matters typical of which is climate change. Although climate change has long been known as heated topic, who is going to tackle that serious problem is still remained controversial. Some individuals hold the idea that developed countries should take the lead in facing climate change whereas the other state responsibility should be equal to all countries. Before presenting writer's idea, the following essay will analyze both viewpoints.",
        "More specifically, that developed nations should take higher responsibility when it comes to protecting the environment is reasonable, in terms of various resources and less pressing concerns. It is apparent that the strength of developed country in protecting the environment mostly come from the Scientific Technology Resouces, particularly recycling factories, electric cars which served as fruitful infrastructure for comating climate change. Due to the fact that the general living standards in developed nations are quite more stable compared to developing countries, government will put more emphasis and effort on solving environment issues especially climate changed without distractors",
        "On the other hand, it is understandable that climate change needs to be solves globally. As we know, the change in global climate is one universal problems suffered from citizens all over the world, that is why all nations should contribute to solve it. Only when both developed and developing countries are willing to join hands, shared massive duties related to mother earth, they can win over the climate change battle",
        "From my perspective, I strongly advocate with the viewpoint that responsibility in climate change should be taken equally due to its global scale. The consequences of climate change are always in front of our eyes no matter where we live and study so why don't we take responsibility and solve it together but passing the buck for the others. Because it is a universal matter,  solution from numerous forces will be more efficient",
        "In a nutshell, developed countries should set examples in protect Mother Nature regarding is resouces and pressing concerns, responsibilities on Earth should be shared equally because of its global nature"
