        "Money and Time, the two most imperative things in today's world. Shopping and spending on luxurious things have become mainstream these days. Where the majority of the teenagers, are quite inclined towards branded things, whether to flaunt to their friends or maybe the case of peer-pressure. Things have changed with time, and I completely agree, that teenagers love to spend their leisure time in shopping centres rather than doing something productive in life.",
        "Talking about the younger population, spending on unnecessary things like branded shoes, Lv bags, Apple cell phones, Zara's apparel, and restaurants etc. It's not limited to this, many teenagers spend their valuable time, in many of the plush spa and salons. Besides this, when they start visiting shopping centres, usually teenagers tend to explore many brands, and visiting restaurants which are out of their budget, which they end up buying & spending, even if it is not useful. For e.g, It has reported in the yearly report, of state consumer of Mumbai, that almost 80% of the consumer market is depended on the people under the age groups of 14- 21.",
        "Such an attitude, which is not appreciable behaviour of teenagers, particularly when it comes to paying on exorbitant products, and wasting their time, instead of utilising it in something more fruitful, however, they are not solely responsible for this, their parents play a major role in developing, such attitude of an attitude and habits. Parents who have given liberty, and having a lack of discipline since childhood, and agreed on everything such as no budget concept, not thinking before buying and is it really useful to them? if ignoring all these things, the influence on the future, young generations will be bad for e.g, spending money and time on shopping can lead to a few possible things like declination of interest in academics, development of an attitude by being superior in front of their friends, inclination towards social media, to showcase their standard of living which is not beneficial to them in long run. By observing all these things, many young children try to imitate similar things, and gradually start lying, and stealing money from their parents.",
        "In a nutshell, according to me, using your leisure time for shopping, with proper limitation is good, people can go, and enjoy their weekend with their friends or family. However, time management is very crucial in today's life, money cannot be wasted by buying unnecessary things.",
