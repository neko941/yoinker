        "Advertising is one of the most important tools of marketing, used to drive demand for a particular brand or product. While some people believe that it only encourages us to buy products which are mere wants rather than needs, others perceive it as a piece of information, helping them to improve their lives.",
        "I personally think that it incites an individual to make a purchase without having him/her consider the utility of the item being bought. This phenomenon is also known as the \u201cfear of missing out\u201d experience for individuals where they at times just want to match the on-going trends. Whether it be fashion or technology, everybody wants to stay up to date.",
        "While the companies may be targeting a specific set of audience, the reach of the intended advertisement may go beyond and create a sense of disparity amongst those pertaining to the under-privileged class. This further has a domino affect where people might try to resort to ill-legal means to get that product.",
        "A very recent incident that I came across in a news article was of a 13-year-old kid who was caught stealing a smart watch. Because his parents could not afford to buy him one, he resorted to unlawful means to get that watch. When questioned by authorities, he informed that the advertisement was so enticing, that he needed to get one for himself.",
        "It can be concluded that since the intent of the advertisement does not translate well between the different socio-economic classes, it will continue pushing people to attain the products which they do not need or do not have the affordability for."
