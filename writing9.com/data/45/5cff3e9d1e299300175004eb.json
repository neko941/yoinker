        "The issue of willingness to encounter with risky challenges has come to the forefront of adolescents awareness in moderation.",
        "Some feel that risk taking could be hazardous in some circumstances; however, I agree with those who say that never squandering the opportunities could lead to ultimate success.",
        "In the following paragraphs, I will explore the rationale for both beliefs as well as proffer justification for my own viewpoint.",
        "Regarding those who hold the notion that risk taking could lead to detrimental consequences, there are many reasons. One supportive claim is that those individuals may be diagnosed as possessing massive fear of failure, as they stress out, what if they remained unsuccessful to accomplish their objectives. More specifically, critics point out that those people assume, if they failed, that would be a massive wastage of their valuable resources, such as their precious time, a shocking amount of money, and immense dedication. In fact, Stanford published a study in 2018 that found in Herat, Afghanistan, which is considered to be the most impecunious city in Asia, where some merchandisers are reluctant to invest in business, because they believe, if there business diminished, it would be like throwing money down the drain.",
        "Nevertheless, I firmly believe that opinion is ludicrous. The obvious reason is that the willingness to take the road less travelled is a vital key to bring spectacular innovations. A prodigious inventor Mark Zuckerberg is a quintessential example of a mind-blowing risk taker, who has not only created a note worthy influence on digital world by his gigantic contribution in a colossal centralised enterprize, known as Facebook, but he also connected people of the entire world together as a global village, where people are intertwining beyond barriers, across numerous geographical regions. What is more, he has enormously impacted the international entrepreneurs, working in digital arenas, by persuading them to take risks, and be willing to discover what is not there.",
        "To recapitulate, I maintain that the willingness to take risks is, indeed, a favourable behaviour in every aspect of life.",
        "In the foreseeable future, I sincerely wish that teenagers should engage in challenging situations, which would incredibly boost their creativity."
