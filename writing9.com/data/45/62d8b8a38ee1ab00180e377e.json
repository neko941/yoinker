        "The diagrams below illustrate how the Islip centre will change from now to the future.",
        "As is shown clearly in the graphs, it can be seen that there are 8 significant changes made to the town, and the most significant one relates to the construction of a dual carriageway.",
        "When we look at the maps in detail, the main road will be replaced by a pedestrian path in the future. In the south of the main road in the current map, the park will decrease in size and a new housing area will be built next to it. It is worth noting that the shops across the main road and the school in the south-western corner will remain unchanged in the planned development.",
        "In the north side of the town centre, currently, there is a strip of shops along the main road, however, these will be demolished in the plan and instead there will be new housing, a car park, a shopping centre and bus station from east to west respectively. Finally, a round dual carriageway will be paved and encompasses the centre of Islip, connecting to the main road on both the east side and the west side of the centre, as a result, the countryside will no longer exist."
