        "It is perhaps the long-disturbing traffic issue that drives governments all over the globe to make great efforts in establishing or improving their traffic system. Nevertheless, I still cannot be enrolled in the camp that claims it is wise to construct railway rather than roads.",
        "Undoubtedly, the railway construction, in a way, can be deemed as a win-win program for both the country and its citizens. After all, compared with other types of transportation, the transporting load of railage in a unit time is the largest and it is also the fastest approach on land. Simultaneously, due to its strikingly strong operating system in running, it can scarcely entail any congestion. Evidently, it is advantageous to implement the plan referred to railway establishment.",
        "Rather, whether it is the rail or the road, the erection is in requirement of many other comprehensive elements, for example the scale of city development, the extent of population mobility, the condition of geographical surroundings and so forth. For those world-famous metropolitan, like New York or Shanghai, both railroad and traffic-way are key in the city function. For one thing, major cities need to receive populations nationwide and even worldwide; thereby, sufficient convenience must be provided by perfect train system. Meanwhile, residents living in such a big city are supposed to be ensure with a relatively pleasant road-travel condition. However, for those middle-sized cities or towns\uff0csituations should differ according to different complex consideration. With the help of proper geography and adequate budgets, building railway should not be a malfeasance.",
        "Additionally, do forget that along with the above sweeteners, rail service signifies a higher financial investment, a larger amount of resources as well as a much more complicated running system, all of which require a considerable number of time and budget. Besides, during the construction process, more severe traffic congestion is inevitable, unless the authorities can avoid these visible or potential issues and otherwise a blind construction of railway cannot be a wise choice."
