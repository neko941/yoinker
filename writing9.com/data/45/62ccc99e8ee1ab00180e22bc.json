        "In the recent era, replacing the sea creature from their habitats with an aquarium is easily doable with the great enhancement in transportation and technology. However, the question still remains open whether this relocation is beneficial for community's recreation or not. In this essay, we will discuss both points, and I think it's disadvantageous to move the animals from their natural habitats.",
        "There are several benefits to relocating the ocean creatures to the amusement park. First, It will help to attract more tourism and local business can be benefitted from this tourism. Secondly, it provides a great source of information educating the public and especially the students about the various sea species, their life and survival, and most importantly how we can save this animal from extinction. For e.g, Dubai host one of the largest aquaria in the world, bring different lake animal from around the globe to attract tourist and as well as they provide lecture on each different breed they carry for folk to understand what particular sea mammal eats to survive. However, this advantage also comes with the drawback to nature.",
        "The main disadvantage of relocating the ocean creature is that it will impact their breeding process because most of fish need a certain and stable temperature to breed. Furthermost, the space provided in the amusement park is quite small that too shared with other creatures and noises from the tourist that can create an uncomfortable environment for them. For e.g, emperor penguin for breeding requires a very low temperature and a stable ice platform for breeding. They cannot survive long in the man-made created snow house, so in the past 2 years, Hong Kong has seen a decline in the number of penguins in their WorldOcean park. With this, government has decided not to move the penguin from their north pole habitat to an artificial snow room.",
        "We are not denying that having creatures in the amusement park is beneficial for the community to learn and promote tourism. However, with the aforementioned points, one will agree that it's disadvantageous to relocate any ocean species from its natural habitat as they cannot survive long with changes in the surrounding atmosphere and noise."
