        "The pie chart gives information about anthropology graduates\u2019 decisions after Bachelor's degree graduation, while the table illustrates the income for 3 types of anthropology careers with 5 years of experience.",
        "Overall, the data in the chart and table suggest that most of the graduates are employed in full-time jobs, whereas the minority is studied in higher education and working part-time at the same time. Moreover, anthropologists who work for 5 years are likely to receive payments of more than 100,000 dollars.",
        "The pie chart provides a breakdown of what undergraduates did after getting a degree. More than a half were working full-time, followed by got recruited for part-time work and unemployed which stood at 15% and 8% respectively. It can be seen that part-time work and postgrad study sector is the smallest proportion, with only 5% from the whole.",
        "The table indicates the majority of anthropologists who work in the government sector got paid more than 100,000 dollars, while 40% of freelance consultants received earnings equally around 75,000 to 99,999 and 100,000 dollars. On the contrary, workers in private companies mostly got half of a million to three-quarters of a million after 5 years of employment."
