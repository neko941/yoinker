        "Because of globalization, most people prefer to live at the city center nowadays. It leads to overcrowded areas in the center. Besides, this madding crowd brings some tremendous problems. In this essay, I will explain two main issues related to overpopulation, namely daily life problems and psychological problems. Then, I will give some suggestions for governments and people to handle these issues.",
        "When the living areas are getting crowded, it causes a lot of daily problems. Firstly, people cannot find a house easily and even if they find it, renting prices can be high. In addition to that, they have difficulty in traffic. Because of the intensive population, especially in the rush hour, traffic jams can be a nightmare for the people. These are just a couple of examples of how daily life is getting harder in overcrowded cities.",
        "Another negative aspect of overpopulation is related to the psychological effects. The increased population can lead to crooked urbanization. Because of that, green areas like parks, walking or cycling roads can decrease. Therefore, People cannot find a place to relax. Moreover, these negatively affect social life. They cannot linger in the street easily, and they have to deal with people in everywhere.",
        "There are some solutions to handle with these problems. Firstly, the structure of urban areas should be planned before they are built by the government. They must build some recreational areas. Furthermore, they can arrange work hours to deal with traffic jams. In this way, People can commute at different hours. Besides, public transportation can be made more common. Governments should give discounts on public transport as well. In this way, people will prefer to use it more, compared to personal transport.",
        "Overall, overpopulation brings with it many problems. There are some precautions to tackle with these problems. Most of them can be solved by better organization in the urban areas. Governments should pay attention to how they will plan center areas. In addition, people living in there have some responsibilities like using public transportation to prevent daily traffic problems. These are just a couple of suggestions on how we can solve these problems."
