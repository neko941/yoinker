        "Today\u2019s advancement is one of the main factor in our society. Many individuals mentality has been changed due to lots of modern developments. Many mankind accept it in a positive manner that it have made them more communicating while others not find it beneficial. I would like to share viewpoint on both thoughts and also suggest opinion.",
        "All human beings are different from each other, their priorities and personal lives are always separate. Some of them like to socialize, on the other hand few of them prefer to remain isolate. By the social media, it helps people to stay connected with their relatives and friends. They can do video chats that is very cheap and very convenient, if there is internet connection.",
        "Moreover the social media like, face book, link den and others through which job seekers also get opportunities by updating their profiles. For example, I used to update my profile on link den, and because of this I got lots of calls from different organizations and recruiters. So it is one of the easiest way for someone to introduce oneself.",
        "Those who are not in favor of this is due to their narrow mindedness or possessiveness. In our daily lives we can see that everybody have a mobile phone and people like to get involved in it deeply. For example, children like to download games, adults are used to working on it or using other applications. So it seems like they does not have time for those who are near to them. Other example, parents usually don\u2019t like to see if there kids are using mobile phones or laptops in front of them because they think that children are not giving importance to them.",
        "In my opinion, social media have both pros and cons but advantages are more as compare to disadvantages. Peoples are no doubt correct according to their views but one can become more explorative by getting involved in new technologies."
