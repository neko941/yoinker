        "Over the years, technology has surely impacted the way men interact. Earlier, time was spent in direct communication . However, now men spend more than eight hours a day interacting with the computer screen. This has further worsened with the rapid spread of computer games in comparison to a decade earlier. This change in behaviour pattern is causing a lot of modern lifestyle, health impact and permanent damage to the social system.",
        "Firstly, the health impacts caused by continued exposure to the screen leads to diseases such as lower vision, obesity and other health impacts. Of these, the highest attribute in terms of risk is obesity. For instance, in a study conducted in UK , prolonged sitting and an inactive lifestyle has lead to a severe rise in the average weight of men and in turn lead to a reduction in their lifespan.",
        "Additionally , the damage to the social system is also a development which can't be overlooked. Couples no longer interact and connect as they used to do in the previous generation and this has damaged the relationships over time. Moreover, kids develop attention syndromes and other personality issues due to less interaction with their peers.",
        "These issues are serious and deserve our attention and we are to spend more time outdoors interacting with nature and man; the very fabric of human nature. However, computer games can and should be used as a recreational tool and with caution. Personally, i feel any habit has to be controlled and tamed in such a way that we control them . Ironically, today man is being controlled by his habits."
