        "There is a controversial perspective heating up a debate over the importance of the regulations to the community. Some people hold a strong view that if people are allowed to do whatever they want, society could not work. From my perspective, I consider myself an advocate of this statement.",
        "Without a shadow of a doubt, discipline plays a paramount significant role in regulating individuals\u2019 behavior. Enforcing laws means that place restrictions on people's actions, thereby helping society develop in a more constructive and peaceful way. For example, the use and trade of narcotics are prohibited under Vietnamese law because they are addictive and can lead to unpredictable behavior, including harm to others. So laws are made so that everyone can obey and behave properly",
        "However if there is no rule, society will suffer from the detrimental impact. When there are no laws in the world, that means when people are free to do whatever they desire, society is being disorderly, unable to function and develop according to the will of the government. If there is no regulation prohibiting the use of firearms in Vietnam, criminals may consider utilizing firearms to carry out their crimes, such as shooting at police and civilians, which would have a significant negative impact on the community. Therefore, there should be laws everywhere in order to avoid unfavorable outcomes.",
        "In conclusion, the law brings great benefits to a society."
