        "Recently, there has been a difference in interpersonal relationships owing to the advent of technology and a surge in global economic growth amongst others are results of this change.",
        "On one hand, technology has lead to a global economic surge. From the introduction of online markets to generation of various cryptocurrency to enhance trade internationally, technology has been able to improve the worlds\u2019 financial status. Evidence of this is seen in the statement released by the president of the world bank who pronounced cryptocurrency as the global currency two years ago. This announcement ameliorated international trading by limiting the amount of money spent from currency conversion to a few clicks from the phone. Additionally, technology aided in the chances of love and getting married. This is possible due to numerous dating apps that have been launched and this has increased chances of getting someone online than meeting physically and even helped people with disabilities find true love. A popular singer called joe Jonas is a typical example of this. He found his wife on tinder and after series of chats between them, they met up at a bar picked for them by the app and this was the genesis of their marriage.",
        "On the other hand, the introduction of the internet and modern phones have influenced positively in our society. This is because these devices have tracking information embedded in them and the police have used these to decrease crime rates in our society. A good illustration is seen in the arrest of an kingpin internet fraudster called Huspuppi by the UAE police department. A press statement released claimed that they were able to monitor and track him down through his social media account and tracking devices in his phones. Furthermore, technology has helped reduce errors in all sectors especially the health sector greatly. Introduction of new hospital equipments have helped narrow human error margin to over 80% and diagnosis has been made easier for health workers.",
        "In conclusion, while other opinions may vary, I believe technology has done more good than harm in the society seeing how it has improve accuracy in the health sector."
