        "Recently, there has been a significant change in both family structure and roles.This essay considers such transformation as a retrogressive type and also examines the different changes occurring.",
        "There are various types of reorganization that are common to various families these days.First to consider is a recent practice whereby the wive is recognized as the head of the family. In such settings, it the wife who pays the brideprice of the husband and contribute more financially to the marital rites.The Idoma tribe  of Edo  state is a good example in this case as the wife is the one who goes to work while the husband stays at home to take care of household chores.",
        "Another common instance, is to have women playing the roles of the man nowadays. The female gender is usually considered limited in roles in many settings but this is no longer the case. In this present dispensation, wives do not only do the same type of jobs like their husband, but also work same number of hours like them. This pattern of organization has been rated predominant in many big cities around the world from demographic information on the United nations website.",
        "In my own view, I consider this changes in both structure and told in an unpleasant light. As a matter of fact, the consequences are both disgusting and unappealing.",
        "When wives are culturally empowered to be recognized as the head of the family, it depresses the ego of the man and makes him feel unhappy. This situation can increase the risk of such a man for health problems such as depression. A good number of men are not able to tolerate been directed by their wives at home, this makes them an object of ridicule among their mates who sees them as weak and friable. According to a recent  publication on family health available online , the rate  of depression among such men is almost triple that of families where there is no change in structure.Another point to consider, is the neglect suffered by the children when the mother is the one working to provide money for the family. Such children are not properly catered for and are prone to various degrees of abuses. Children from these type of homes are more likely to be influenced by their peers. They submit to peer pressures and participate in  various vices due to poor supervision and parentage.",
        "In conclusion, the recent changes in role and structure in families have brought about disheartening consequences such as psychological trauma and poor parentage and this has been explored in this piece. It is imperative therefore for families to maintain the old practice of having the husband as the head of the home and the one who provides for the need of the family."
