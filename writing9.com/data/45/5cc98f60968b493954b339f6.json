        "Life is something that should be valuable to every people. Unfortunately, as it may be expected, humankind confronts with transformation in their life. This can cause two problems, namely emaciated outlook on life and even loneliness. However, there are many helpful advices to rely on, such as discovering new hobbies and broaden the surroundings.",
        "Resisting any changes in life is the straightway to have a very narrow view on life. As we know, changes make people happier and influence on the one\u2019s perception. When there are stable principles in life for a long time, man become stressed and ignorant person. Misunderstanding other people beliefs or ideas can lead a man to feel of desolation from society. In other words, the more people resist making changes in their lives, the more they become aggressive introvert, who can not feel empathy to other people\u2019s troubles.",
        "There are two solutions I can suggest in order to prevent the consequences of loneliness and ignorance. The life is more enjoyable, when people try new things to do they never did before. Whenever one feels comfort, but inside understands there is something wrong with this comfort life, I would advise to force themselves start doing sport, start learn new literature, anything that could broaden the outlook on everything around. This can also lead to new meetings, with people from different situations and countries. Once the change is started, life will never be like before.",
        "It is extremely important to take responsibility on your own life, as only you the one who can make a difference. To avoid problems with socializing and deep destructive feeling people better start to color their live until they have time."
