        "Advancements in technology have made a significanf differences to the way in which people are able to learn,and though this is mostly beneficial,there are also some negative aspects that will also considered.",
        "Beginning with the positive points,the ability to work on assessments and coursework on a conputer means that work can be saved safely and transported from place to place. Before the arrival of computers,students traditionally had files and folders with their course notes,and this took up a considerable amount of room and was difficult to keep track of;now,complete lecture notes and much more can be stored on a flasg drive that can be easily put in a pocket or bag.",
        "In addition,lectures and learning material can be made available online, allowing for a multimedia educational environmeng. This is likely to engage a wider range of students as it has the ability to cater for a wider range of learning styles. For examples,some students study best by repeatedly listening to a teacher, and this can now be achieved more conveniently by having videos available.",
        "On the downside,there are occasions where information stored digitally can be deleted, overwritten or corrupted, all situations that do not occur on traditional paper based work. There is also the concern that material can be garnered from the Internet and passed off as the students own work,making plagiarism a potential issue. However,the concept of plagiarism has long been a problem, and there are computer programs available today that will pinpoint the source of non orginal work.",
        "In conclusion, although there are potential disadvantages, they are outweighed by the positives."
