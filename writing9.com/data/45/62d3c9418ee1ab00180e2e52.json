        "In some nations, increasing numbers of folks gradually have interest in searching about the property history where they dwell in. As far as I am concerned, there are many reasons about this trend.",
        "In this essay, I will explain that reasons and how public can find this information which is associated with property past history.",
        "Firstly, I think that most important reason is a health issue which leads to critical problem. For example,if the property is over the trash-storage in the past, soil and water was polluted by the trash. So quality of life will be diminished significantly. In this conditions, public can not drink water because it contains harmful materials and elements which lead to severe health problem.",
        "Secondly, Another reason is that public can know their property in historical aspects, For instance,",
        "there are apartments locating near the Gyeongbok palace , it was the old houses with muds and grasses in 1400s. Throughout the seraching history of their architecture, folks can know about their origin and history which lead them to preserve their culture. Also it leads them to think importantly about the architectures.",
        "Nowaday, public can find easily the information about their architetures in the internet, For exmaple,",
        "throughout a Google searching, public can find any information about thier architetures. The information contain not only an ownership but also additional property details. Even more, professional property resaerching sites like Propertyshark, public can obtain more detailed information.",
        "In my opinion, I guess this trend become strenghtened gradually in the future.Therefore, goverments in many nations might should invest the industry associated with property history searching by future."
