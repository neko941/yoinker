        "People from different parts of the world believe that youths who just graduated from high school should take a break and travel awag from their parents as a new starting in order to learn how to depend on themselves. Actually, travelling abroad at this part of teenager's life is not a bad idea, but that does not mean there are no disadvantages.",
        "Starting with the positive side of travelling, teenagers who graduated are going through very harsh time in which they will have to take an important desicion for their future. So they need to get rid from the pressure on them, in order to relax and calm down, at least for a week so they can think wisely and decide. As well as, to know how life is away from their parents and family.",
        "Comparsely, even though travelling abroad will be a good idea for newly graduated students, it has a bad affects for sure. For example, teenagers who depend mostly on their parents cannot change in a short period of time so he/she will get lost more and more if they travelled away from their family, which will end up with taking the wrong decision. Plus, some will prefer not to complete their education, they will think that life is much easier when they will work and depend on themselves without the need of education, especially if their trip took more than 2 months they will start getting away from the academic environment.",
        "For me as a student who just graduated, I am with the idea of taking a small break in a calm place away from the crowd and people's opinions about what to study, but that does not mean that studying is not a must, especially with the world's development, academic qualifications are the main factor to live a happy life and have a good job."
