        "Every parents help their child to grow their career in every field of life. Guardians spent more and more time with their children helping then to with their homework task. Some people thing this is very important for children parents should spend time with their children, other have a contrary school of though. Account to them spending more time with children don not let them grow property. In this essay I will discuss in favour of spend of this topic",
        "Firstly, parents are more curious about their children now a day, they are trying to pay more attention on their children. For that purpose they spend more time with their children to help then with their homework. This is the great thing, because children are very innocent they don\u2019t know exactly what is wrong and right. Without parents attention they may do some mistakes in their educational career field, moreover without parent\u2019s attention they cannot play good role in education.   If parents did not help them, they will continuously repeating their mistakes, finally this will cause more dangerous for their career.",
        "For instance one of my friend son, he has very bad hand writing, now he is very young but still he is not able to write correctly, this is because my friend has not enough time to spend with their child, resultingly now their child cannot improve their bad habit.",
        "Secondly, if parents did not pay attention on their children, children cannot play vital role in class room, this lead to the children lack of confidence feelings. This is the most dangerous thing especially at that time when children are preparing them self for future career. Home work is the practice for child, to utilize their knowledge what he learn in class and implement this again. If child will not be able to do this correctly, this will cause children embarrassment in class that is very negative affect for child. To overcome this issue guardians are the responsible to play their role at home and spend more time special for education counselling.",
        "For instance my neighbourhood friend\u2019s child always get first position in class. Because their parents pay more attention on this homework and studies.",
        "To summarise, children getting more attention of their parents special in homework task. To improve children performance this is very necessary, definitely with the improvement of performance children confidence and personality will also increase."
