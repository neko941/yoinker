        "Greetings of the day! I am Harshali Mohite, I had an international  flight today in the morning from India to USA which I missed due to an unfortunate event at the airport.",
        "I was traveling with a friend and suddenly at the airport he got sick. I had to take him to the emergency room and from there the medical team at the airport and I had to shift him to the hospital due to his health condition.",
        "This unfortunate incident made me miss my flight which was not due to anyone's fault. I am a student in USA pursuing my masters and It is very important for me to arrive to USA as my college has begun and missing classes will reflect badly on my grades.",
        "In this situation, I would appreciate if you could help me get on another flight on 06/12/22. Please can you get me on a flight that has the same price as the previous flight that I missed as I do not have finances to spend on another flight ticket.",
