        "Delayed childbirth is a trend that is becoming increasingly popular. A lot of people are beginning to have children later in life than what was previously obtainable. Yhr major reason behind this is the fact that people have become more career driven and would like to excel outside of parental duties. There are many drawbacks to this recent development, however, there is one huge benefit (fufillment), that makes the decision very tenable. Hence, the advantages are far greater than the negatives.",
        "Nowadays, people are raised with the ideology that there is more to life than being a parent, therefore a lot of individuals put off giving birth to later in life as opposed to the habit of the previous generation. Women in particular, are more ambitious than ever and strive to have accomplishments outside the home. In addition, men are also not left in the backseat, as they also aspire to generate enough wealth to cater from themselves and their families. For instance, a survey carried out by the fertility clinic in Harvard, in July 2016, revealed that about 80% of people have decided to start bearing children in their late thirties, so that they can focus on their careers and dreams.",
        "The majority of people that give birth later in life have the advantage of career advancements, as well as being emotionally, psychologically, financially amd physically stabel enough to raise children. Although, there are studies that show that fertility decreases with age and people should not put it off till later, so as to avoid medical problems. However, it is safe to say that the preparedness to cater for children outweighs any other disadvantage that can be thought of. Furthermore, the long wait allows for development in all ramifications and fufilment in all aspects of their lives. For example, from personal experience, my mother used to say that the fact that she had us later in life, after all her accomplishments made her more relaxed and fufilled when she started raising us. She never felt inferior or had any cause to regret. Looking back, she always thought it was the best decision of her life as she did not have to wait on any man.",
        "In conclusion, more and more males and females of this present generation are deciding to have children in their later age. This recent development can be attributed to the increasing interest in career accomplishments. The joys of a fufilled life outside parental activities remains a huge benefit despite the various disadvantages of giving birth late, so therefore, the advantages outweigh the disadvantages"
