        "In the salad days of milliennium, the society is polarized into two groups almost equally regarding the notion that whether few people taught it is indispensable to utilize huge amount of money on innovative railway lines for fast track train or others trust that the penny could used on developing existing public transportation. Different people have their distinct mindset. The following paragraphs would shed light on both the approaches before making a final note.",
        "To commence with the first notion, there are myraid things to be shared in it's favor. First and foremost, the reduction in traffic jams.As a result, due to alot of public transport the traffic has been climed in this contemporary era. So, if we are using only new railway lines they will be deduction in traffic as well as time and energy. Secondly, the decline of pollution may occur. Consequently, because of transports like cars,buses they lead emits of fossil fuels which are harmful to environment. Whereas, the railway lines emittes less pollution.",
        "Shifting towards the second school of thought, the personal vehicle are much essential. Hence, during the emergency we need our own vehicle to travel from one place to another. Moreover, group traveling save money and also time. Therefore, for the long distance individual journey is waste of money, rather than we can use public transport which mainly save money, petrol and also pollution  fall.",
        "Having discussed argument and counter argument I would like to infer that it is vital to spend higher amount on building new railway lines for very fast trains because it reduce the pollution which almost save our effected mother land. To justify my  state of mind, there is an instance of example, where in India over 70 percent places is affected with fossil fuels due to large number of vehicle usage.",
        "Hammering the last nail, I personally feel that new railway lines are necessary for happy and safe journey."
