        "There is no doubt that education play a crucial role in the way people lead their lives. However, while some urge is that money for tuition should primarily be used up on better computers , I would agree with those who argued that it would be preferable spent on instructors.",
        "Firstly, it is vital that computers is useful in education. Conversely, there is no demand for computers in learning section because those are not teaching students the subjects, they are just a step for learning. Moreover, it is an obvious fact that universities which is using high-tech computers can not attempt the best 50 universities in the world. In the light of this information , if that money spent on computers there will be no changes in education level.",
        "Secondly, teachers do much more than teaching because during the class students are learning subjects and how to acquire their personality. Experienced teachers who is almost can teach everything in your majority are very valuable. It goes without saying that teachers are making the best universities list in the world . To illustrate, Harvard is the most valuable university in the world and that is not for having better computers that is for good quality instructors . Without doubt ,I can say that if we spent money on teachers tuitions would be better.",
        "All in all, what can be concluded from afore mentioned remarks is that although some individuals advocates , I strongly believe that money for education should be mostly spent on teachers."
