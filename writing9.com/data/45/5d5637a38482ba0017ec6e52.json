        "There was a time when we used to say \"Teaching is the best profession\" but the latest trends across many countries show that very few people are showing interest in the field of teaching, especially in secondary school. In this essay, I would like to discuss the possible reasons for this trend.",
        "The curriculum over the last few decades had changed drastically. The subjects to be taught used to be same more or less every year, but this has changed recently. In modern schools, primary and post primary syllabus had undergone a tectonic shift. It is more curated to serve pupil's interest in a particular subject rather than a \"one solution for all\" approach. Due to this, there is lack of expertise in a particular field. Teachers are forced to update themselves constantly to support this ever-changing syllabi, which some would have found it difficult to do.",
        "Secondly, norms now a days are more stringent in any profession. Job seekers are forced to take additional trainings or certifications for compliance, which will delay the process of their induction. This is forcing them to take up other professions. In a way these norms are for benefit of the students but not many teachers to be, feel they are hinderance.",
        "The first problem might be solved by giving appropriate training, provide proper resourses for their research, so that tutors can update themselves and teach. Coming to the second problem, the governments should increase awareness on why there are such rules and clearly explain the benefits of these additional trainings."
