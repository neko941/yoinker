        "In this era of globalization, boundaries \u2013political, geographical, cultural\u2013are being removed as peoples blend and persons share, with each other, the very values that once segregated them. Cultural  mixing  has begun tearing down  all the  ethnical and racial pigeonholes and move us closer, by the day, towards one universal race of humans. Like all else, even this has its occasional downsides, which, when put in comparison with the upsides, are negligible.",
        "Firstly, we have to consider that cultural mixing is perhaps the only non-coercive way to  move  global  humanity  towards  ideal  equality,  a  belief  sought  for  by  all  the  great persons, and political and religious ideologies. While  many have struggled throughout human history to uproot tyranny, oppression, bigotry and segregation, their paths have been tainted by the blood of the bold and tears of the beautiful. True that we, through our ravaging revolutions, have progressed, but at a cost that undoubtedly has been dear. Cultural mixing, on the other hand, is the benedictory prophet, who ushers the great communion of all men in empathy, leaving behind all ethos, and he comes only in peace.",
        "Yet,  some  conservatives  argue  that  free-mixing  of  cultural  values  degrade  people\u2019s sense of morality. They must be conveniently forgetful of all the immoralities, in the name  of  conservation,  that  evidently  have  tarnished  human  history.  Although,  it  is undeniable that cultural mixing, like any other  progressive enterprise, has coincided with social unpleasantries, for example declining stability among families in the third world countries, the blame has not yet been rationally put. And, of course, there are many other socio-economic controllers such as wage-earning, and individualism that may very well be responsible for today\u2019s social ills.",
        "In sum, we must not be closed-minded to the global brethren cultures, because, only by doing this we may, one day, realize the ever-cherished dreamland of universal humanity, where  \u201c\u2026  all  the  people,  sharing  the  world  in  peace\u201d  will  not  be  only  a  thing  of imagination."
