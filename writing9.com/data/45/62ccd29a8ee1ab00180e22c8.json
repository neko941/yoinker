        "It is frequently believed that, the production of green energy such as, solar power wind power and wave power is unaffordable and complex. While the traditional energy sources like oil, gas and coal is cheaper for city and transportaion purpose. I disagree with this belief. In this essay, I will explain the green energy is more productive and harmless for earth.",
        "Climate change is a huge problem, which is not limited for a group of region or countries. It affects each and every part of the globe. Reasercher had proved that excessive usage of natural energy sources namely oil, gas, coal results in global warming. This picture can be change by replacing them with green energy.",
        "The production cost of alternative energy is an issue. To protect mother nature is more important than the economics of the country. As the technology is getting advanced every day the expenses of alternate energy can be reduced. For example, 20 years ago to buy a phone or television set was not budget friendly for every one, but now it is common to have smart phone and flat screen television in each home.",
        "Rather than funding the unnecessary space program, if government will spend money on safer energy production, it will help the reduction of pollution. Instaed of saving money we all should concentrate on saving natural wealth, so that our next generations can experience the real beauty of nature.",
        "In conclusion, by developing a better equipment for green energy production we can rplace the traditional energy sources for vehicals and cities in better cost."
