        "In today's world people must proctect there children from the wrong things. But in recent times parents are getting more and more overprotective than the parents in the past.",
        "There are lot of things that are happeningin the world.These things could negatively effect the mind of children.Thus it is the job of the parents to protect their kids for all those harms while letting them make mistakes and learn from those mistakes. But kids can do some really dumb stuff when they have too much freedom, these things could lead too serious problems and consequences for the future.",
        "As parents have to be protective in order to provide a healthy place for their chlidren to learn and develop, they can actually step over the boundary and be overprotective and not know about it. Seeing that most parents are figuring out how to handle their kids at different ages, thus they are getting into the overprotective category more often than not. This could be because they are not able to give more space to their kids at the same rate as the kids are growing or they (parents) think that it is better to overprotect their kids than to underprotect them. for example, not letting their kids talk to children of other gender before a specific age, not letting their kids experience failure in life by making them avoid competitions at a small age, etc. These small things help a child to learn and adapt to as near to world senario as possible which would in turn help them to live and strive in the real world.",
        "Hence, I would agree that parents are becoming more overprotective than the past."
