        "Nowadays, governments are investing more money in the medical fields for conducting researches and developing new medicines. Some people alleged that authorities should concentrate to implement precaution procedures rather than other areas. However, I partially agree with the viewpoint, and I believed that both medical areas are equally important.",
        "On the one hand, with the help of modern science, most of the nations are aware of the common health issues and accordingly, authority can spend their money on taking precaution measures, which would help the nations to avoid huge money contributions for researching fields. For example, with the help of advanced prevention methods nations are successfully defend and vanish the disease like Polio from the entire world, which means precautions against diseases would one of the beneficial measure to control the money loss.",
        "On the other hand, due to the changing lifestyle of human beings, some times the precaution measures are miserably failure because, in this contemporary world, everyday people suffering new diseases, in other words, the genetic nature of bacteria or disease rapidly changing after-effects that old prevention methods may not withstand to longer. So the only solution for this issue is to develop new medicine or change conventional treating methods, which shows that financial investment in researches is a mandatory one, and it is not a waste form of money.",
        "To conclude, it is clear that both medical fields such as researches and prevention methods are equally important, whereas giving priority in one area would inversely affect the existence of human beings"
