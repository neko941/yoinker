        "Information is knowledge , crimes and other atrocities that should listed on the television and newspaper shouldn't be hidden from public. I honestly disagree with this statement.",
        "Passing of information is really a great help in other to safe more lives and properties. Firstly , for example,in Nigeria, due to the insecurity problems, with the information shared by the jornalist and news broadcaster over the television and social media platform people will be mindful of their movement especially in people that travel by road. consenqently,  a lot of people have being kidnapped, murdered , rapped and abused physically, mentally and emotionally.",
        "Furthermore, without the spread of informations a lot more would be happening and this could make people to lose their trust on the government. Also, circulating an idea give people in the community clue and also a warning that everyone should be cautions of their movement and environment . Most of these criminals comes in disguise in other to deceive people and carryout their wicked plan. For example around the axis of Douglas road owerri a begger was asking for help from a woman and the lady in question decided to assist her with some cash only for lady to disappear after giving the begger money this created lots of confusion and a message was passed as well in other for people to be careful.",
        "On the other hand , the idea of sharing criminal and other vital information will help to alert one's self and moreso, community can engage in forming a vigilante group that will help the government and enforcement agencies in getting the culprits involved in such criminal act . Reporting of crimes gives the community a sense of humor that governor has their interest at heart. It also creates awareness on the kind of routes not to be taken at a particular hour or day to avoid being armbushed or being a victim also people can also assist by suggesting to government and security agencies opinions that could be vital.",
        "Notwithstanding, that the spread could affect individuals psychologically and mentally , families will be scared of allowing their loved ones to travel to distant places , individual's health might be affect due to the information shared such as high blood pressure and fear of the unknown. People will choose to migrate to better and safe cities therefore population will reduce drastically and economy will be affected.",
        "In conclusion, spread of information is of a good way of creating awareness and alerting the community members on how to protect their lives and properties, but restriction of crime and other information will endanger the lives of people thereby making the people not to trust the government and security agencies."
