        "Majority of our day is spent in the work environment performing our various tasks. However, It is said by some populace that maintaining a good relationship in the work is not necessary as our major aim should be on the getting job done. I strongly disagree with this statement as I believe that connection should be made in the work place for future purposes as well as to promote togertherness.",
        "Firstly, I believe one should establish long standing friendships\u00a0 in the office as this can be useful in the future or incase of unforeseen contingencies. As the saying goes, \"No man is an island\" thus when in need, we can turn to friends made in the office. For instance, in the newspaper recently, a Father needed assistance for his sons surgery, it turned out that one of his colleague's Father in law, a renowned surgeon, owned a hospital.The man did the surgery at a subsidised amount as a result of the recommendation by his son in law who was a colleague and friend to the father of the sick person. All this happened due to the fact that the father in the first place maintained a solid relationship with his colleague.",
        "Also, having a good relationship in the work place is paramount as this help to foster one spirit and togetherness. Most companies see this as essential which is why they organise team bonding, picnics and end of year party. I believe that for goals to be achieved, everyone has to be on the same page and this can only happen if cordial friendship is built in the office.To exemplify, study has found that companies which their employees have good relationship culture tend to achieve their set objectives and have more productive staff.Thus, Companies are taking advantage of this and they encourage their staff to also do.",
        "Generally, while some believe that an office should be just a place to carry out your primary assignment. I disagree with this view and i suggest that our heart should be opened to opportunities and relationships that can be formed in the work environment as this will go a long way in our future."
