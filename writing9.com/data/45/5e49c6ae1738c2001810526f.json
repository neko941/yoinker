        "There are pros and cons of giving smartphones to children. Smartphones are great assert if used in a right way like navigation, phone calls, access information through internet and online courses/classes. If used correctly smartphone is a more like a teacher/friend. You can set reminders, take notes, set alarm, booksreservations, make appointments easily usinga smartphone.",
        "Cell phones have become an extremely popular gadget used for daily living and, in most cases, have replaced landlines when it comes to communication. Becoming more technologically advanced, these devices can take and send pictures and videos instantly, as well as connect to the web for surfing. Manypeople, even children, now have their own cell phones, with the potential to do an endless number of tasks, such as looking for answers to certain questions. However, they can also expose us to unfavorable situations.",
        "As we might notice, everywhere we go, you can see a lot of people with their eyes glued to the small screens, which gives some people a unsightly view on our future. Some of us are even obsessed with checking our Facebook accounts, uploading images on Instagram and tweeting about what a good time we are having, instead of actually having a good time.",
        "Similarly, I would suggest a book or news papers to the children apart from smartphone. The advantages of reading books or news papers helps children to concentrate, focus and gain knowledge. Books has lesseffect on child health compared to smartphones. Example: Children using smartphone for extended hours and have more stress to eyes, sleeplessness, etc. Smartphones usage by children should be supervised by parents. Children easily can get addicted to games, tv shows, etc very quickly."
