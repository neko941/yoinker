        "Fashion is tend to be one of the most trending aspects of life these days. During the last century, the way we dress rapidly changed. In the past, no one had imagined that people will dress the way we are dressing currently. Taking a closer look into different regions from all over the world, for instence, in Europe; people used to dress in a certain way, on the other hand, currently we can see a wide range of fashion taste.",
        "Some people argued that fashion has a negative effect on our live. There are many reasons behing this claim. Such as, setting the bar of affording clothes very high. Also, spending much money to keep up with the new fashion lines. Lastly, the bad taste of fashion, due to the flashy colors and the unusal styles.",
        "Other team has a totally different point of view, they support the idea that fashion has an added value in a postive way to our daily live. This party has his own evediances, such as, raising the importance of using art in fashion. Adding to that, the ability of having an alternative to the out-dated cutomes. Last but not least, giving the fashion makers a better way of making a living.",
        "From my point of view, I support the idea that; Fashion has a great positive impact on our lives. Firstly, fashion is an important element in raising our taste of clothing. Secondly, It gives us a varity of options for clothes we might ware. lastly, boldness of ideas that artists use in fashion nowadyas, is a great way of experssing our inner thoughts.",
        "Fashion is a sensitive subject, it used to have criticies and supporters. Yet, we still have such different point of views about it. An artist prespective is different form and amture, eventually, everyone will embrace this field of art in his own way."
