In addition, since it includes not only biomedical and microbiology courses but also gross anatomy in the curriculum, it'll be inevitable for you to do some invasive procedures.",
        "Of course, the best part of the university is that it has been cooperating with a few medical centres so that every student is able to participate in the internship, which could be very beneficial to your future career. Moreover, all the professors are experienced and will be willing to support you throughout your study progress,",
        "To apply for the program, I would suggest that you visit the official website right away. If you run into any problems, don't hesitate to make a phone call to the admission officers. They will help you check the documents you need for the application.",
