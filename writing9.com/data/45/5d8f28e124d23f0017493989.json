        "There are more and more opposing arguments on animals exploitation whether it should be prevented to give animals the same rights as humans or it is automatically to take benefits for the various need. In my point of view, both opinions have its right's and wrong's which will be included in this writing.",
        "It is true that animals should not be explited too serious by people. Firstly, although they do not have the ability to speak clear language, think logically or develop the society, they have emotions and feelings, and should be given various rights as human. Secondly, animals have great responsibility with their family, their fellow-creature and their inhabiting environment which is the Earth that we are living in. Hence, these natural missions that they were given since birth should not be taken away. We should let animals protect their family, raise their child, maintain their ancestry and have necessary effects on the living environment. Thirdly, there should be equalization for all living creature. We are living in a society which teaches us to love, protect and develop on each others. This should not be putted into practice not only. For this reason, they should be avoided to experience lost, pain and other physical or mental agony that are created by human for human to human but also human to animals. We should propagandize the speech of loving and treating nice to animals to everyone, especially children.",
        "On the other hand, we can not avoid employing animals to full-fill our society's basic needs. the first reason to explain for this is because of the importatnce of animals' contribution to the motivation of social. Their impacts play an important role to help invent or study new discoveries in science and many other areas. Secondly, although the existence of animal is very important, we must maintain our ancestry too. The human body needs to be provided with nutrients that comes from animals' meat or other parts of their body to live balanced and healthily. Animals' exploitation is a huge source of supplying protein, fatty substance, vitamins or medical treatment to human. These uses also have greater and more useful effects on the human body than artificial products. Last but not least, the use of animals' skin, fur or skeletons creates higher quality and long-lasting expiration the supplies for furnitures, clothes and other important items in human life.",
        "In conclusion, according to my experiences, I think that the exploitation of human on animals should happen at a safety level to prevent animals from extinctions, diseases and causing contrast harm to people.",
        "Animal employment is a gifted facility to human right. We should have kind of treatment on animals while taking what we need."
