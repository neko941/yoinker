        "Nowadays people prefer to throw damaged things away, while in the past people used to repair them and keep them for a long period. People are changing with time, also their expectations and demands are increasing.",
        "People do not care anymore about the value of things or items, as soon as the item is damaged, that's it, it is ready to be thrown in the bin.",
        "In the past things had more value in comparison to this century. People used to appreciate more and the things had also more value and importance. People in the past knew how much they struggled to get something they liked, they knew how much effort was needed to purchase things, that is the reason why the object had more value.",
        "Nowadays, people throw away things as soon as they get damaged, because they think that the money that will be used for the reparation of the item, instead it is better to directly purchase the new item. For this reason the values of the objects is decreasing. People's salaries are increased and most of the people are living luxury lives, this is the reason why for many is not a matter to throw away things that had cost a fortune, instead of repairing them they throw them away.",
        "Levish luxury lives are making people be careless about their damaged things; things are loosing their values. For me it is hard to throw away a damaged thing, because with that damaged thing i have spent time and i have memories with it. I would instead repair it."
