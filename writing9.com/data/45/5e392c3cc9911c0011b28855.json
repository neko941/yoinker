        "Today, the growth of juvenile delinquency has been receiving a great deal of public attention. Although this problem can be attributed to a whole host of reasons, some feasible solutions can be taken to tackle that.",
        "There are some reasons to explain for why more and more today\u2019s young people are often involved in crimes. First, since today\u2019s young generation have an excessive exposure to questionable contents, they tend to imitate violent or offensive scenes. It fact, watching too much violent movies or playing brutal games can trigger aggressiveness among young people, which makes them be inclined to solve all their conflicts by violence. Second, by targeting young adults, drug dealers are blame for the increase of juvenile crimes. Plenty of evidence suggests that human\u2019s brain is susceptible to the negative influences of drugs, which shows that buyers, especially adolescents, often have desire to commit crimes after getting high.",
        "Nevertheless, there are not without workable solutions for that. First, all of contents should be carefully censored before being broadcasted on TV or posted onto social medias. Obviously, this would mitigate the exposure of questionable contents in young generation, especially teenagers, thus reducing the rate of crime down the road. Second, if governments impose strict and severe sanctions to drug trafficking, the amount of juvenile delinquency will considerably decrease. For example, drug dealers and buyers would be sent to jail and socially isolated, which acts as a deterrent for the whole of civilization.",
        "In conclusion, although there are a number of reasons for this problem, there are not without feasible solutions. By enforcing laws, policies could minimize the problem to a manageable level."
