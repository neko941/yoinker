        "Many individuals thought that it would be better for huge companies and industries to relocate to regional areas outside the big city center. In my opinion, I consider that relocation can bring about more benefits compared to any problems it might bring.",
        "Despite the drawbacks given below, I believe that moving industries and companies to regional areas is beneficial for the health of people, as it reduces the pollution in the Central city, which has many deadly effects, and by reducing it helps the people to live a healthy life. Moreover, shifting the industries and large companies outside the city helps the traffic to run smoothly in downtown, which is a main problem in most of the major cities, as most of the vehicles are running outside the downtown and less traffic is running within the city.",
        "Admittedly, there are some issues involved with changing the location. One problem is that it might cause difficulties for the people who do not have their mean of transportation, a person can find it difficult to reach to the workplace on time, as there is a lot of traveling required if the person is living in the urban area and has to go to work outside the city. Another possible issue is that the employment turnover ratio might be high due to the sifting of the workplace, which can be detrimental for the companies and industries as they might find a large number of vacant positions in the shorter time frame.",
        "In conclusion, I believe that the benefits of living a healthy life and a better flow of traffic due to the relocation of industries and large companies outside city centers, far outweighing any disadvantages it might bring."
