        "Alot of people fear that they will be robbed on the streets so, they decide to restrict their movement. Despite this, theives still go around visiting people's houses. With this condition, it is important to consider factors that can help improve one's security.",
        "Firstly, the government should empower the security officials, release more of them to the high risk areas and every home should ensure that police emergency numbers are on speed dail. This will ensure prompt response from security officials hence, culprits can be caught in time.",
        "Secondly, neighbours should watch each others back by reporting any strange movements or persons that they notice to the appropriate authorities. By so doing, suspects can be nabbed and their plans destroyed. The British Broadcasting Corporation reported that a small community in south eastern Nigeria employed this method. Consequently, they were able to drive away armed intruders who stole their farm produce and improve the security in their immediate environment.",
        "Thirdly, if the situation of an area does not improve with all these measures, then the people affected should relocate to another area where their safety can be assured. It has been reported severally that areas with recurrence have places like bars and clubs where these hardended criminals visit. Therefore, avoiding living in places like this can improve safety by more than sixty percent.",
        "Given these points, I believe that the best thing anyone can do in order to ensure personal security is to totally avoid all the areas known for this notorious act. Also, government can by imposing restriction of movement at certain times of the day while the security agents parade these areas."
