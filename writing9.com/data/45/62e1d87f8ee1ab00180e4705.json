        "A voice came out with the argument that it is more significant to learn art and literature rather than math and science. From my point of view, art and literature is essential for people to learn the history and life which could be helpful for their psycological questions, however, I still consent with the idea that math and science comes first compared with art and literature.",
        "First, math and science are the fundamental subjects for all students whose scores are included for future higher education, no matter you will be a science student or study literature. Math is the subject that students need to learn from elementary school until college, and it will not be changed in a  short time. Education background plays a key role in your future life. If students emphasis too much on art and literature instead of math and science, they will be highly left behind by others and miss the opportunity to take a higher education.",
        "Second, learning math and science is helpful to form a logical thinking mindset which is essential for many practical skills in life. The research has discovered that learning math and science is the way to train our left hemisphere of our brain, which is related to our logic.  For example, communication skill and critical thinking, they are both the basic skills that you can not miss them to integrate in the sophisticated society nowadays. With so much news and information online, you have to hold a clear mind and be critical to the information you absorb ethier from books or people. With a logical thinking, it is easy for people to be treated and stuck in some philanogical questions so that may arouse psychological problems. Another example like computer skill, the society now turns to a digital world, almost all the professionals today acquire solidate computer skill in the workplace. Math and science are definitely essential to it. Learning math and science is a must for future life and professionals of the students.",
        "Overall, even though art and literature are important for students to learn more about life through others, math and science should come first in their study period."
