        "The indictment of women in to the security forces, such as police or in the army, into the roles and the numbers same as men, has received divided opinions. While some welcome the idea others object the object it citing a wrong notion, that women are incapable of such jobs. This essay will describe the reasons to support the gender equality in the forces of internal and external security forces.",
        "Firstly, the perception of gender bias needs to be removed from the society. Most of the developing countries already have policies for it, but there is a paucity in implementation at the grass root level. Moreover, rural demographics of certain areas are insular to such reforms. For example, the practice of minor girls getting married is practiced by their parents in tribal areas of the Indian state, Chhattisgarh. This is often done to prevent women to get into mainstream jobs other than household chores. Necessary public awareness and strict implementation of laws against child marriages can result in bright future for woman.",
        "Secondly, the caliber of women is often underestimated, even in well developed and most educated societies. This is a serious concern which can only be addressed by supporting women to get into different roles and create an environment to grow. Even 1% of success of such initiatives can result in removal of wrong notions about women. There are many famous female achievers around the globe, for example, light weight female boxer, Mary Kom has risen from a rural background and went on to win Olympic gold, being a mother. Many such role models exist in Indian Navy, Air force and the famous personality Kiran Bedi, a fearless police officer, which have disproven the inability of woman to do jibs in security forces.",
        "Finally, the social perception of gender bias needs to be curbed by conducting awareness camps in rural areas and many more work opportunities should be declared gender neutral, to increase the intake of the female officers in the police and military forces such as Army."
