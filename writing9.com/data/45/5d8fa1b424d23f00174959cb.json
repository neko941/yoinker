        "It is true that men are increasingly likely to take up role of househusband, and while more women than ever are breadwinners for the families. There are several reasons for this, and I believe it to be a positive development.",
        "In recent years, parents must have to adapt to various changed in society. Equality right movement has had make great progress, and it\u2019s normal for female to pursue her higher education and find a high paying job. It has been accepted by society that men can stay at home and take care of household. As a result of higher cost of living in urban, couples need to work and save money before starting their families.  Therefore, when couples have children, Its couples who decide who will take care of home and who will work based on their preference or based on their earning capabilities.",
        "In my view, changes that are described above are seen as progress, and we should be happy to live in a society where both men and women have equal rights, and in which women are not put under pressure to quit their job and take care of children. Equally, it seems only fair that men are should be free to leave their job and assume children\u2019s responsibilities if this is what they wish to do so. Couples should be left to make their own decisions about which role there are keen on taking it up according to their circumstances and needs.",
        "In conclusion, the changing roles with men and women are a result of wider changes in society, and I believe that these developments are desirable."
