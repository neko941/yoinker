        "Human\u2019s life expectancy has been on the rise in recent decades. Personally, I believe that despite the good intentions behind increasing the time people exist, it will be disadvantageous in the long run.",
        "On the other hand, there is still no denying that high longevity has its own merits. Firstly, when humans have the ability to live longer, their knowledge and experiences will increase in such an incredible way. Meanwhile, our world can reach a new peak point of technology and expand our awareness about the universe. Secondly, these days, many parents don\u2019t have enough time to look after their children carefully. When these children\u2019s grandparents can raise their longevity, children can be nurtured by them.",
        "Nevertheless, critics are quick to point out that a longer lifetime will threaten our world with its drawbacks. Take Japan for example, having the highest percentage of old citizens and expected to go up rapidly in the future, Japan is facing a serious issue - labor problem. This trouble can easily affect the national economy and social life. Countries with an aging population usually have a high proportion of foreign workers, which costs those regions a lot. Elderly inhabitants, who spend their last time in nursing homes, often don\u2019t get full services due to the lack of nurses. Moreover, we can\u2019t forget the great burden placed on public services, especially countries with free civil services. Hospitals, transports, equipment will not be able to tackle such a giant number of dwellers. Last but not least, the lack of natural resources is also a problem that can\u2019t be neglected. There is a common belief that our fossil fuel and nonrenewable resources will hit the bottom soon if the death rate in the world is lower than the birth rate.",
        "As has been discussed above, the negative points associated with high longevity outweigh its merits."
