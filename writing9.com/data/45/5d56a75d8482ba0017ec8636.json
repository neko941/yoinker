        "Owing to the increase in violent activities that is quite rampant in some place in America, Time limits has been placed to ensure that youngsters are not allowed outdoors at night without being escorted by an adult. In my opinion, this can be very helpful to protect them.",
        "Firstly, given the rise of gun violence in some states in America, an adult needs to be with children at night in order to protect them. This is because, adults can easily sense danger and know to remove these teens from dangerous situations.",
        "Another point to consider is the adult's quick response to crisis. Nowadays, we have seen an increase in adults taking First Aid classes should the need arise. For example, in a shopping mall shooting in Texas recently, an adult was honored as an hero after administering CPR procedures to a child victim and thereafter calling emergency services to take the child to the hospital, thereby saving the child's life. This act might not have been possible if an adult was not present.",
        "In conclusion, due to the increase in crime rates and shootings affecting young children, it is pertinent to have an adult accomplice at night times in order to safeguard them from unexpected dangers looming the cities of America."
