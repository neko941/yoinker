        "Nowadays an increasing number of people are preferring fast food over conventional food as part of their regular diet due to their hectic lifestyle. While choosing fast food saves time and it tastes amazing, it is extremely unhealthy and dangerously ingrained as a staple diet in their daily needs.",
        "Fast food has two primary advantages. Firstly, it allows time for people to carry out other activities in their life. This is because fast food, as the name suggests, is generally prepared under 5 minutes, sparing time for people to do more productive work. Ready to cook meals such as burgers with already prepared patties, for example, would save at least an hour for a customer. Secondly, delicious taste of such cusines provide eaters with a great time. To illustrate, having delicious food such as shawarma would be worth remembering once there is no other way than having only healthy food. So, Two of the most alluring factors for fast food eaters are time savings and taste.",
        "On the contrary, modern fast food is overly relied upon and it is hazardous for general wellbeing. Because of the above mentioned factors, people are abusing rather than using fast food for their needs. Even though healthier options are available, outgoers increasingly have fast food. For example, one study showed that if given chance to have an avocado or a burger, more than 50% population will choose a burger. Moreover, it is detrimental to have such food even in minute quantities. To illustrate, a recent scientific study by John Hopkins University concluded that having even one fatty substance, like cheese, as a part of diet would increase chances of cardiac arrest significantly.",
        "To Sum up, due to significant time crunch in people's lives and an increased indulgence in sensory-pleasures, individuals who eat fast food in their main meal are soaring. However, it is crucial to consider how unhealthy it is to have it in small quantities or rely overly on these meals."
