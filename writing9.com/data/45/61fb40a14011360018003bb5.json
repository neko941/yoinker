        "I am so proud of you that you finally make your decision to learn driving after a disaster accident you were involved. Your life will become much easier after starting to drive because you wouldn\u2019t have to wait hours on the bus stations or pay arm and legs for a taxi, which means that you can save money for your education. If I were you, I would take a driving class which offer by the government. As far as I know, these class are free of charge and help you to hit a road in a month.",
        "Please keep in mind that you should always fasten your seatbelt to avoid all the undesirable consequences. There is no need to mention that how highways are dangerous for new drivers so I highly advise you to take an experience driver while you are driving on highways.",
