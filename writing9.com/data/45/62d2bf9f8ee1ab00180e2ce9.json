        "A number of individuals think that permitting children to make their own choices on daily basis (for example food, attire, and entertainment) is likely to result in a society of people who only think about their own wishes. However, some have different opinion because it is crucial for children to make decisions about matters that affect them. This essay will discuss both of the contradicting views regarding the freedom of youngster and how it will boost them in management skill.",
        "It is commonly true that if parents easily allowing youngsters to have freedom to follow their desire without control and checking can lead them in becoming selfish grownups. They will believe that the have the authority in every single things because there are no one can stop their wishes. For example, the spoiled children will have a tantrum if their friends do not agree with them. This happen because the parents always spoil them and the lack of understanding that the world does not evolve around them only.",
        "On contradict, due to this style, if the parents guide them right, the children will understand that they can also have their control over something but it will affect not only theirself but their surrounding. This will encourage them in trying to be more responsible in every single day, because the actions taken from themself will force them to select which one is the best and which one is the worst so they know what to choose. It will uplift their critical thinking skills too.",
        "In conclusion, allowing your children to pick what they want to do, what clothes they decide to wear, what food they want to eat, and other decisions is a great style of teaching. This will teach them acout every action they choose will have consequences and they are the one who have responsibility over it it. Of course parents should give their guidance first for them not completely hands-off  in giving the freedom for the youngster."
