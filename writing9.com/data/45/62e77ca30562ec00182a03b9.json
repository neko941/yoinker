        "The given graphic image illustrates the production and manufacturing of ready-to-eat noodles. Overall, the process starts with moving flour to the mixer, where it is processed into a dough, which then passes through six steps, resulting in the final product - cup noodles.",
        "It all starts with flour being trucked to the factory where it is stored in silos. The flour has to first be transported to the mixer. Here they are mixed with water and oil to form a dough, which then passes through rollers to form dough sheets. These are then cut into strips which are in turn made into noodle discs. The discs are cooked in oil and dried before being packed into cups.",
        "After being placed in the cups the discs are seasoned with vegetables and spices. Then the last stage of labelling and sealing takes place before they are rolled out of the assembly line, ready to be shipped. Bon appetit!"
