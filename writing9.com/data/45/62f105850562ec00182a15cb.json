        "The maps illustrate some proposed changes to the developed area in Norbiton",
        "Overall, a comparison of the two maps reveals a complete transformation from  largely industrial surroundings to a mainly urban city.",
        "Looking at the map of Norbiton as it is now,  the farmland is isolated in the north of the town by the long river flowing from west to east of the area, but the town will build a bridge in the future to connect the farm and the urban facilities.",
        "The most noticeable is that all the factories at the moment will be demolished to make way for some of the modern construction sites. It is not the only house that will be built massively along the main roads, but also there are shops, a medical centre, a playground, and schools which are going to be constructed. The principal roundabout in the middle of the town will remain, but it seems that they will design an additional roundabout and it is below the main one directly to the south."
