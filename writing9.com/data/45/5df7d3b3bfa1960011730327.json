        "A increasing number of individuals believe that animals should not be used by common people and they should have the equal rights as human beings; however, counters claim that mankind must utilise animals to enhance their different demands, including utilisation for food and scientific research. the argument consists of dual opinion and pros cons respectively. Prior to my opinion, both the views are analysed.",
        "Discussing the former viewpoint, the most crucial one is that men do not have any right to kill the animals. As, animal is wonderful creatures of God and only  almighty has the power to take the life of any living things. In addition to this, killing the animals for food is inadequate. Because it has proven that human beings can get all the nutrients and vitamins from green vegetables and fruits. Moreover, substantial amount of animal research is done for cosmetics, not to find cures for diseases, so this is unnecessary.",
        "Analysing the latter perspective, the foremost one is that, animals can be used for the medical research. For example, the medicine for the dangerous cure like cancer was founded after the successfully experimented on the animals. Additionally, scientists try to find the difficulty the animals experienced. To justify, some animal species are in endangered because the climate changes. So scientists try to done various experiments to save the animals. Last but not the least, some individuals consider that animal are below the humans in food chain so, mankind have all the rights to use them for their benefits.",
        "To cap it all and offer my position, I agree with the foremore viewpoint. a growing number of people experience that animals should not be used by humans; where as , specific people claim that mankind must use the animal for their purpose. Although animals can be used for the medical research; however, humans do not have any rights to take their life's."
