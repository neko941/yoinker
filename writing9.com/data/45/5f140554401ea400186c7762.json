        "Although, it is thought by some people  that health care should be run by the private sector, others, however, believe that government ought to take control and also make it free for all people.In my view a government run health system will help both individual and society.",
        "Free care act is going to make everyone covered  regerdless of thier background and their financial state,for example the majority of poor and middle class workers in sudan are uninsured or underinsured because it is rare that the emplyers there will agree to pay for a private insurance for their employee in sudan.",
        "Another point to consider,if the official authorities take charge of the health system this way the greed and selflessness of the private insurane corporations will come to an end because i is a major issue around the world that due to personal greed a lot of people might lose their lives or at least get bankrubt because the are unable to pay the high and cruel private insurance fees.",
        "Finally,covering everyone health fees is going to automatically push the society forward, in other words assisting most individuals to get healthy which means increasing the workforce and help people to focus in work instead of focusing in their health care issues, In additon taking out the burden of hospitals charges will decrease the crimes rate as some people try to get money illegally to cover their hospitals costs.",
        "In conclusion, in order to improve the society and make all the population focus in building better future we have to make healt care free and run by the government."
