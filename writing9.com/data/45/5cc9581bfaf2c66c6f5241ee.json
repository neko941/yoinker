        "In most countries, museums and art theaters are the major entertainment centers popularly visited. Some of these places may demand financial commitment before people are allowed entry, while some others allow for free access. This essay will discuss both the merits and the demerits of offering these services voluntarily to people.",
        "To being, there many advantages to collecting entry fee from individuals that wish to see art or historical displays. One of them is that they generate revenue to run the establishment. In order words, they will be able to sustain the establishment without need to source fund from external individuals. A further reason is benefit that they can also purchase a more quality historical or artistic works available in the global market. For instance, the renowned International museum built in Abuja has grown in popularity as a result of the recent paintings they have purchased with the revenue generated over the years. In short, when visitors pay to see works of art and historical displays it provides funding to run the establishment better.",
        "On the other hand, monetizing entertainment centers like the art galleries and museums will discourage patriotism and also make the center prone to theft. That is to say, that many people who choose to entertain themselves with works of are because they have free access to them, but then if they are to be paid for only a few might want to visit those centers. In addition, such commercialization may signal criminals on the value of the products and the money generated. Thus, making people pay for this services will be discouraging and also draw in the attention of criminals.",
        "In summary, both museums and art display houses as entertainment services may be established for financial gain or to make sufficient money to procure more artistic works, but then such act may discourage people from visiting the places and also may attract criminals."
