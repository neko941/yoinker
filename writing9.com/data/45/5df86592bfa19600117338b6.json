        "The primary reason for taking banned drugs, players want to play extraordinary and want to be famous quickly. Typically, to perform well, players have to maintain their fitness to an optimal level and endurance as per game requirements. To keep such a level of fitness, the player has to perform extreme routine work out in a gym daily and regularly. The property of steroids or other illegal substances enhances their endurance level with lesser work out and in a shorter time, and they can perform well. As a result, they became a necessary commodity for the team; therefore, they can play for a longer duration. For example, many football players were caught taking steroids before the start of the game, and noticed that they all performed exceptionally well in their previous games.",
        "The possible solution is a medical check-up before every game. As with medical advancement, there are handy gadgets available to check the amount of exogenous chemicals in the blood or by the breath very quickly; that's the most potent way to detect players who involve in this illegal act. Upon a positive test, that players should be banned from the game. As a result, all sports professionals will think many time before committing this criminal activity.Therefore,I believe the mentioned initiative will curb this crime many folds. For instance, in recent years, there were many cricket players found guilty of indulging in this unethical behaviour by medical tests before the game. Therefore, the international cricket board took action and suspended them for a few years and enrolled them for the board rehabilitation program.",
        "In conclusion, I believe athletic taking prohibited performance-enhancing drugs to achieve quick fame. To curb this problem, the medical test of all players before every game must be mandatory."
