        "Over the years, it has been observed that a large proportion of people preferred to live in urban areas, which has caused them to experience day to day difficulties,as a result of over population and congestion. This essay will discuss the various problem encountered by city dwellers and what the government can do.",
        "Primarily, the populace living in this bif cities encounter a lot of hardship which include transportation and traffic congestion. As a result of this, the urban-dwellers have difficulty in commuting when going about their daily activities since the available means of transportation is fewer. In addition to this, the people living in cornubation also experience traffic congestion due to the growing number of vehicles on the road.",
        "Furthermore, individuals  who reside in this big cities also experience environmental pollution as a result of waste generated in factories, exhaust from cars and power plants and so on. As long as people continue to migrate to this large cities in search of greener pastures, there is high tendency that pollution will be on the increase. This will also cause harm to their health, thereby leading to short life expectancy.",
        "However, this difficulties can be solved if the government provides more feasible options that can be of benefit to the populace. It has been observed that people move to urban areas because of various job opportunities,  good roads and transportation, access to basic medical care and so on. The authorities should make this amenities available in rural areas and there will be reduced population in large cities.  In addition, the government should inspire individuals to relocate to countryside by introducing tax incentives, provide high capacity public transport, create more innovations and subsidise health care cost.",
        "In conclusion, I am of the opinion that people would live a more decent life, if the government reduce overpopulation in the cities by creating more investment, provide basic amenities,  create more employment opportunities in the suburbs. Also the issues in the cities can be managed by introducing a more working transport and economic stability."
