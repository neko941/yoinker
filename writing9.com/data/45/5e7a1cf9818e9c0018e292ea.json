        "The table illustrates the global market share of notebook computer manufacturers in two separate years.",
        "Overall, it is clear that HP was the most commonly - used while Fujitsu - Siemens\u2019s consumption is the lowest from 2006 to 2007. In addition, HP, Dell and Toshiba witnessed an increase in their proportions while other producers fell in 2007.",
        "In 2006, HP accounted for the largest slice of the market share, at 13,4%, compared to the figures for its competitors, namely Dell and Toshiba, at 16,6% and 6,2% respectively. A year later, there was a rise of approximately 3% to 34% in the market share of HP. A considerable growth in the percentage of the two closest competitors was also seen from 2006 to 2007, with the figure for Dell climbing to 20,2% and that for Toshiba rising to 7,3%.",
        "In contrast, other computer manufacturers saw a significant decline between 2 years. In 2006, the market share of others companies occupied 22,8%, compared to about 11,6% of Acer and 6,6% of Lenovo. By 2007, the percentage of Acer and Lenovo was 10,7% and 6,2%, a fall of 9% and 0,4% since the previous year. Finally, we can see that Fujitsu - Siemens\u2019s, the lowest proportion in both two years, rose from 4,8% to 2,3% in over a year."
