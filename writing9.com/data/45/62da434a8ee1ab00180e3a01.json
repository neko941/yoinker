Additionally, the residence most probably remains the same and, as a result, the commute may be easier. Furthermore, it is always smooth to deliver the task in a familiar environment. However, sticking to the same kind of job do have many drawbacks.",
        "With regard to change in work place, people have opportunities to explore new ideas. For instance, a surgery resident after learning surgical skills from one consultant might improve his skills further if he works under another institute consultant. Moreover, employee can develop new ideas if he allowed to work in unfamiliar kind of office, as he thinks differently. Finally, if a person gain abilities in different sections  of his field, it will improve his CV, which again help to attain better positions in company.",
