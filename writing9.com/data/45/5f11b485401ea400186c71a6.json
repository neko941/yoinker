        "It is true that having children later is a trend which many modern women pursue nowadays.There are many reasons for this, and the advantage of tendency overwhelms the drawbacks .",
        "That women decide to have children originates from the change in their conception. firstly,  women join more and more social activities to contribute to different important  fields.  this makes women to want to achieve high status or having a career in stable finance before getting married and giving birth. Secondly, pressure at work makes women to get trouble in balancing between job and personal life. therefore, if they have babies soon, they have to face lots of difficulties in looking after their children. finally,  because the medical system becomes more modern, they think that late pregnancy is absolutely possible.",
        "It seems to me that it is better for women to have children later in their life.",
        "I believe that it is time when they achieve success in the modern business world,  so they are skillful and  spend quality time for their children as well as family. Besides, because accomplishing women don\u2019t experience regular cash flow problems, so they have enough finance to raise their offspring.  Their children will have the best condition to develop. for example, these children are educated in foreign environments, take part in talent classes like playing instruments, painting, dancing,...",
        "In conclusion, the reasons that make women to decide to have children later comes from different factors. however,  this situation is better for both women and children."
