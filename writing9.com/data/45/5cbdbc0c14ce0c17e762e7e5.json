        "It is well known that newer generations of young people are not as polished as past generations were. While kids in the past were polite, respectful and kind to their superiors, now children are permitted to behave wrongly and allowed to show bad manners to those around them. The current line of thought about this issue is that parents are not as strict as before, and do not take corrective actions towars their offspring's behaviour.",
        "I totally agree with this statement. One of the reasons for modern mothers and fathers to raise their kids  by this tendency, is that psychology researchers have found that punishments are not the best way to correct misconducts. Psychologists suggest that people have to explain their children why their actions were wrong, and advise them in a kind way how they should act, in order to prevent psychological or self-steem damage.",
        "Another reason for parents to be permissive nowadays is that they might have experienced themselves a very strict childhood. For example, if a young man was raised in a military-like way, and that circumstance banned him from enjoying that part of his life, perhaps he will try to avoid raising his children under that line of thought, thinking that by doung this, his offspring would have better childhood memories than he had.",
        "In conclusion, I think that parents' lack of discipline nowadays towards their kids is a very established tendency in the way younger generations are currently raised; and in my perspective, this is due to recent findings in human's psychological development and how parents experienced their childhood."
