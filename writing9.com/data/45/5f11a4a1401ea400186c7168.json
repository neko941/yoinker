        "It is been argued that the administration should look after the unemployed and homeless individuals. I agree to this to some extent .",
        "On the one hand, it is the government's responsibility to take care of all the people living in the country, even if they are unemployed and homeless and not contributing in the country's economy. The reason for that is, if they are not having a job or a house, it means the government is lacking in providing them employment opportunities which contributes to the factor that they can't afford to buy or rent the accommodations. That's why the government should provide funds so that they can have money for their expenses and should try to provide them employment opportunities according to their qualifications and skills. Moreover, these people also voted in the elections and contributed in making the government so, because of that, they should get assistance from the government in their bad times.",
        "On the other hand, the government should",
        "not provide care for all the unemployed and homeless people because some of them disregarded the job options and chose to be unemployed and homeless, as that is an easier way to live a life without doing any hard work. Addition to that some people willingly leave their job and become unemployed. Due to their inability of paying rents and mortgages they become homeless. In such cases, the government",
        "should not take care of such people, as they are responsible for their own situation.",
        "In conclusion, if it is the government's disability to provide jobs for people , then it should take care of such people, however, if",
        "people chose to be unemployed and homeless, then they don't deserve any assistance from the government."
