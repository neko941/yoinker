Especially for interacting with each other. As we know that today's world is controlled by the most modern technologies. So, people use different social media to maintain the relationship with their  dear ones. It is true to say that, technology affected the types of relationships people make. According to me, it is a negative development . In this essay i would like to express how this becomes a negative development and adequate measures to tackle the problem.",
        "",
        "The first and foremost  thing is that, technologies created a wall in front of their relatives. It is very true to say that , the relationship between the father, mother, their siblings, etc. are reduced. This is a negative development because of  the addiction towards the service provided by the technology. A case study conducted by some research students found that, over usage of mobile phone reduced the relationship between family members. As a part of the study the choose a family and anayse a full day . As a result they declared that , most of the family member's time was consumed in front of mobile phone. So, they have no awareness about the problem which their parents face in their life. In this way, we can found that youngsters are the main group who trapped under this technology.",
