        "It is believed that the majority of the people nowadays prefer to eat unhealthy food. In this essay, will be analyzed and further suggestions will be discussed.",
        "One of the significant factors is the low cost of the junk food. Most of the fast food restaurants minimize the price of junk food, this is a smart idea to attract customers to buy more food. For instance, while I was studied in United States of America, there were vast advertising and discount that junk food restaurants created. Thus, student was chasing the promotion to manage their limited budgets.",
        "Another major factor is the high number of the fast food restaurants in one single city. For example, in flagstaff in Arizona state there are several fast foods compare to its area and population. Moreover, companies offer many branches on campus because they want to expand and cover all the buildings.",
        "It is true that is the responsibility of the government to follow these companies. My suggest is that the government should increase the taxes for the fast food. Also, the government needs to limit and decline the number of fast food restaurant.",
        "To conclude, people admire to eat fast food due to the time taken to prepare a male. Therefore, they can save more time, Also, there are huge number of fast food restaurants; thus, people can see it and reach it easily. The modern countries should be prohibited some of the fast food restaurants in their cities because they need to save their citizens from any medical and health issues."
