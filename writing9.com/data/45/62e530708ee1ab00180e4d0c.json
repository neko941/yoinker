        "Some languages are at risk of being forgotten, for a reason, that plenty of people is using it. Few individuals think that government should invest in order to save these languages, but, others believe it's just a waste of money. In this essay, both opinions will be discussed before giving a conclusion.",
        "In general, having the government  in using their resources to preseve languages is a way of giving respect to it, that no matter, new dialects have surface, ancient languages should still be held importance for it is one of the things that still connects us to our roots. Firstly, in public schools, making a mandatory for student to speak their native tongue will hold a firm foundation while they are still young. Secondly, funds to make books about languages or any educational material, it should be emphasize how important older languages are, even in modern era.",
        "On the other hand, we're already living in 21st century, instead of investing funds on our languages, it is more reasonable to allocate it to improve technologies and education that will help the economy to grow further. Different cultures have already mingled in our lives, they have various language and sometimes it is more convenient to use in communicating others. Nowadays, modern languages are easier to use and understand and populace will not try to learn those ancient languages, if it will only complicate in communicating. No matter how knowledgable and fluent a person can speak their mother tongue, if the receiving end won't be able to understand it, it's still useless.",
        "In my opinion, although having to invest in languages in order to preseve it, but if it is too hard to understand, or to speak even, it will be pointless, instead, using the resources to finance technologies, and to improve our health and education system"
