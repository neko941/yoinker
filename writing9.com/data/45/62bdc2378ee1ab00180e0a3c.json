        "I  have checked the three complaints to our reception desk about Susan's work. All the guests' disappointments point to her unprofessional attitude and performances. To be percific, we are a tourist agency, but she could not answer the questions of the programs we have, and even the exact working time of the office.",
        "To be honestly, the reception hall is so crusial to a tourism comany that it's the first sight of a new guest, and the competition of this realm is dramestic. Unfortunately, our formal staff Alice is in maternery leave, and Susan is in her internship work for one month. After that, Aliya, another formal young staff will take turn to handle the daily job of Alice.",

And if she still could not quality the request of the position, we must dismiss her immediately. I have checked the schedule that Sam is available to help Susan on every Monday and Saturday.",
