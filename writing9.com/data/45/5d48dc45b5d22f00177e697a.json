        "The world population is increasing day by day, but this increasing the number of people is not evenly distributed. Some countries gripped by overpopulation and some counties on the other hand suffer from negative population growth rate. Of course this negative rate is a significant issue that should be viewed and analyzed from multiple perspectives.",
        "It is crystal clear, the elderly people have valuable working experience and they can share their hands-on experiences with young generation. This mix of generations can have a positive effects and impact on economy growth. In addition the making decision process will be easier and the outcomes will be more reliable.",
        "As time goes on, the old people lose their working abilities and need more care and attention and government should provide them with free social and recreational facilities and they should have given generous retirement pension that they can comfortably live in their pensions. So the government must allocate more budget to old people who devote their whole life for country.",
        "As it is known to all, the country with negative rate of population will face a wide range of problems because the workforce will be on decline while the budget that government should spend for elderly age will be on increase. So, one of the solution can be encourage the general public to have large extended family instead of nuclear family like Nethelands. Or some countries can develop their own immigration policies and adopt young workforce from other countries like Canada.",
        "In conclusion, I believe that elderly people are capital of country and we should hold them in a great respect, but  the countries that suffer from high proportion of old population need a great attention to overcome this problem and government plays a vital role in this occasion along with awareness among the citizens."
