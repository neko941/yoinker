        "The given line graph illustrates the average amount of Carbon Dioxide emitted by each person in four countries, namely United Kingdom, Sweden, Italy and Portugal over a 40-year period starting from 1967.",
        "In general, it can be clearly seen that the CO2 amount which was emitted by an English and a Swede decrease significantly throughout the given period while Italy and Portugal saw a rapid rise in their average CO2 emissions. Moreover, United Kingdom always placed first in the amount of CO2 emitted per person during the given time.",
        "Firstly, between 1967 and 1977, we saw a steep increase in the CO2 emission amount of Italy and Portugal, to just above 6 metric tonnes and over 2 metric tonnes, respectively. The next 20 years still saw a significant upward trend in the CO2 emissions of Portugal, rising to more than 5 metric tonnes. In contrast, Italy's amount of CO2 emitted by each person started to slow down. It only increases by more than one metric tonnes compared to the 3-metric-tonne increase in Portugal. During the last 10 years, both countries's level of CO2 emissions seemed to level off at roughly 5.5 metric tonnes in Portugal and over 7.5 metric tonnes in Italy",
        "On the other hand, the average amount of CO2 emitted into the air of United Kingdom remained the highest over the given period with a gradual decrease from around 11 to about 7 metric tonnes. The CO2 emissions per person in Sweden reached the peak at approximately 10 metric tonnes in 1977 and then rapidly went down to 7 metric tonnes in 1987. The last 20 years observed a gradual drop in the CO2 amount emitted by each person in Sweden."
