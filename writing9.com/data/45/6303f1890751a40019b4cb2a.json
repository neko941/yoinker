        "There is an ongoing debates between quality of work and professional appearance. Some organisation think that dress appropriately is a necessity to maintain smart working appearance. While, the others think that it does not matter as long as the employee produces high quality work.",
        "Let's start with dress smartly. In my opinion, there are some specific jobs where your appearance is critical. For example, appearance matters in client-facing job such as lawyers and consultants. Lawyer and consultant typically represent high-network individuals and multinational corporations, in which the environment requires them to dress appropriately. It is also common for lawyers and consultants to attend meetings, conferences or formal dinners where formal dress code is usually compulsory. On some extreme cases, your appearance sometimes are considered as part of your value, e.g. wearing expensive watch is considered as being successful.",
        "For another type of jobs that are not client-facing and quite flexible, I do not think that these job put high emphasis on appearance. For example, some jobs such as content creator and web developer. These type of jobs usually allow employees to work remotely, which also serves as part of job benefits and perks. In that case, those who are workiing in these fields do not face the hassle of thinking what to wear on the weekdays. There are quite a number of stories from web developers who like wearing pajamas while working!",
        "To conclude with, I think context matters when analysing these two opinions. Personally, I think the type of work, either client facing or not, is essential to consider whether dress smartly or work quality is more important."
