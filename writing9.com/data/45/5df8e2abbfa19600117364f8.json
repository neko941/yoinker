        "Topics of public fund never fail to arouse people's attention. Many individuals think that it is wise for governments to spend money only on health care and education rather than on theatres or sports stadiums. Personally, I think the government should coordinate budgeting to meet the needs of both.",
        "The first reason backing my stance is that health care and education are fundamental to the stability and development of a country. Firstly, the well-being of a country, especially in an undeveloped country. Providing the needy with medical service can strengthen citizens' safety and loyalty. People will feel assured if they live and work in a country where they can be given medical care when they are unemployed, sick, injured or retired. If they cannot afford the high cost of visiting the clinic, hospitalization or buying drugs, they are less likely to enjoy their living.",
        "Secondly, making education available throughout a country and eliminating illiteracy can pave the way for economic development. By receiving education, children from impoverished families can shake off poverty, climb high in the social ladder and live better off. Education allows citizens to secure employment and earn regular income the development of a country is linked to the skilled workforce and to the high productivity which affects both resource use and national output.",
        "Although, the key role of education and medical service to each individual and a nation is obvious the importance of theatres and sports stadiums should by no means be ignored. In the hierarchy of human needs, those needs for food, shelter and health are among the basic. After these demands are met, people will turn to higher targets like entertainment and recreation. Leisure facilities such as stadiums and cinemas can satisfy people's needs in these fields. For example, a basketball match between their motherland and a visiting country can raise people's sense of national pride and ethnical unity. Cinemas bring people, artistic pleasure and spiritual enjoyment.",
        "When a government allocates its financial budget ti various sectors, priority should be given to education and healthcare. A reasonable proportion of budgeting should be appointed to recreational and entertainment projects."
