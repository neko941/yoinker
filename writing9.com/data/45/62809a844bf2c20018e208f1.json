        "Large-scale landscape features including natural and man-made barriers contribute to habitat fragmentation and connectivity, affecting animal communities and posing a threat to species' long-term sustainability. Barriers have been proven to affect a wide range of species' roaming behavior, dispersal, gene flow, and distribution. Differential effects of barriers may influence the geographic distribution and overlap of species, and consequently community structure, when species coexist in a landscape system.",
        "Human-caused habitat loss and fragmentation are frequently cited as critical causes in the current biotic homogeneity. Many empirical research now support the notion that such processes affect a wide range of animal species. Many vertebrate species have seen consistent population declines as a result of anthropogenic landscape fragmentation.",
        "Conservationists try to maintain or rebuild linkages between residual habitat fragments as landscapes throughout the world become increasingly fragmented. Connecting remnant patches or protected places like national parks are strips of high-quality habitat (corridors).",
        "Landscape fragmentation has long been recognized as a hazard to biodiversity. Farming techniques, urban development, and the construction of transportation infrastructures are all key contributors. Significant losses in the quantity and size of habitat patches cause wildlife populations to become isolated, increasing the danger of extinction. Landscape fragmentation can be avoided or reduced in several ways: by preserving existing elements (patches or corridors) that facilitate movement; by improving the quality of such elements, for example by increasing their size; or by using restoration measures to create new habitat patches or corridors.",
        "Connectivity, or the ease with which a landscape promotes or hinders movement between resources or habitats, is an important feature of land management for species and community protection. Connectivity has an impact on demography, encourages dispersal and colonization, preserves genetic variety, improves a species' ability to adjust to disturbances and changing climates, and promotes long-term persistence in varied settings. As a result, enhancing landscape connectedness has been identified as a critical method for minimizing climate change's effects on biodiversity.",
        "The fragmentation of ecosystems, and especially the loss of connectivity between different habitat areas, is considered to be one of the main impacts on biodiversity caused by linear transport infrastructure and is also known as the barrier effect to wildlife dispersal movements.",
        "Here we describe Circuitscape, a computational tool which applies circuit-theoretic connectivity analyses to landscape data using large-scale combinatorial and numerical algorithms. Modeling of ecological connectivity across landscapes is important for understanding a wide range of ecological processes, and for achieving environmental management goals such as conserving threatened plant and animal populations, predicting infectious disease spread, and maintaining biodiversity. Understanding broad-scale ecological processes that depend on connectivity, and incorporating connectivity into conservation planning efforts, requires quantifying how connectivity is affected by environmental features. Thus, there is a need for efficient and reliable tools that relate landscape composition and pattern to connectivity for ecological processes."
