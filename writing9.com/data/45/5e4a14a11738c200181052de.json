        "Every year a million people visit tourist places around the world and several people travel to places such as the Sahara desert and the Antarctic,where the weather conditions are very tough. Visiting such places with challenging weather conditions has their own kind of experience, which comes with its benefits and disadvantages .Many of the people may like the challenges it includes and take it as an adventure, whereas the others either may not be able to financially afford it or may not like it.",
        "Traveling is a leisure activity and a great break from the busy working life. Tourists decide to visit places according to their interest, people who like to adventure and love to challenge themselves often prefer to visit the regions with adverse weather conditions. Furthermore, when people are away from their tedious life ,they prefer things which give them satisfaction. As a result, upon their return, they become happier, enthusiastic and more focused on their work than before.",
        "On the other hand, surviving a special weather condition requires special kinds of gears and clothing, which could be very expensive and people with  limited amounts of cash may not be able to afford them. However, if they manage to buy the required clothing and travel. Consequently,after returning they may come under debt and become unable to pay it off ,hence it could turn out to be a miserable  journey for them and may also make their life even stressful.",
        "In conclusion, I firmly believe that traveling is the way to explore and learn the world. Although everything has pros and cons,it is the individual who is responsible for the consequences and needs to consider all the facts before making any decision or choosing any destination to travel."
