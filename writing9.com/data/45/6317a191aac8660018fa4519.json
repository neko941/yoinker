        "In this 21st century, people like to explore different locations on the earth, in such a scenario it is debatable whether low-cost air movement would help them to fulfil their desire or if it is creating adverse effects on the flora and fauna. This essay shall discuss both views before drawing a logical conclusion along with my opinion.",
        "On the one hand, to begin with, one of the most feasible aspects of affordable air travel is that it offers time-saving to the common people ,consequently it makes it easy for them to explore various destinations across the globe. By the completion of this wish, ultimately they contribute to the upsurge of the tourism industry where many folks get an opportunity to have employment in the travel and tourism sector ,eventually it leads to a boost in the economy of respective nations. In addition to this, it is obvious thatSome people say that cheap air travel is good because it enables ordinary people to travel, others think that it is bad for environment. Discuss both the views and include your opinion as a byproduct of air travel cultural exchange among the folks leads them to mitigate their own  loopholes in society.",
        "On the other hand, though travelling provides enormous benefits to common people, it has certain ramifications on the environment. To illustrate: the rise in air travel results in the combustion of fossil fuels to a large extent which causes air pollution ,emits toxic gases and creates undesirable noise in the surroundings of the airports, these factors attribute to global warming  which has, undoubtedly, detrimental effects on the environment. Furthermore, low-cost air travel demands a plethora of airports, for that , the authority needs to acquire fertile land which, in turn, promotes deforestation, as a ,result natural habitats of endangered species will get affected and the ecosystem will be disturbed.",
        "On close scrutiny, air travel is not the only factor which hampers nature and can be taken care of by taking appropriate steps, on ,contrary I believe that, it is no doubt, low-cost air travel facilitates humankind in numerous ways in order to  explore the wonderful world."
