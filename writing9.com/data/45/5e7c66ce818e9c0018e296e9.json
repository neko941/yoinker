        "In competitive era, in advertisement has become a virtual sources to introducing upcoming products. Some people argue that it brings a negative effect impact on children parents and market, while others and I believe that it have a more benefits compare to the drawback as it has created employment and awareness.",
        "One more hand,  it attractive people for impulsuve buying by providing different promotional offers that is why instead of saving money might be spend on purchasing unnecessary goods. For example, in the season of the big billion day on Flipkart which has continuously given large number of discount on a variant things which is why people would purchase on unusual things. Consequently, people are misguided and cheated by such marketing tricks. Moreover, it only highlights the positive characteristic of products and tries to hide its negative impact.",
        "However, I reiterate that an  advertisement has brought revelouation in marketing strategies, it is effective way of the spreading of awareness and creating an employment among people about the use of new and existing product. For instance,Patanjali, world largest herbal product company,  has introduced organic product which are healthier for human beings. Furthermore, an  advertising help in  educating the society about the various health and safety issues, it is the best way to rise the demanding of the product.",
        "To conclusion,  advertising have a more benefits compare to their negative impacts, although sometime people might be cheated by lucrative profile of higher status brands."
