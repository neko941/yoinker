        "The pie charts illustrate the proportion of sodium, saturated fat, and added sugars in standard meals in the USA: breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks.",

Plus, the percentage of saturated fat at dinner is lower than sodium at 37%; however, it is still the highest on the saturated fat pie chart. Both breakfast and snacks have the approximately same trend on the chart.",
        "In addition, snacks are at a peak with 42% on the added sugar chart, while the rest of the chart is not different significantly. Consequently, the ft and sugar are the same trends at 16% at lunch and there is a huge difference between the 3 substances at dinner with sodium (43%), fat (37%), and sugar (23%).",
        "In general, one can see that breakfast is the most healthy meal and has a low ratio of these three substances while snacks and dinner are the opposite."
