        "Nowadays, it is a common trend to have a pet at home. But a group of people believes that kids like them while the other think that they can be dangerous and can be the cause of many health related issues. I personally consider that having an animal at home can be the reason of many diseases. In this essay, both sides of the topic will be discussed with illustrations.",
        "Domestic animals can harm the children at home because we cannot predict the mood of an animal. For an example, people normally have dog or a cat a pet and leave their kids with them in a room and according to the research under title \u201cAnimal Behaviour\u201d conduct by the National University, Australia (NUA) 25 percent of recorded attack on the kids were done by pets while they were alone with them. Furthermore, another research published by the same department of NUA described that animals have germs on their hairs and tongue, those cannot be removed from their body because those germs are produced by their body.",
        "However, people have pet to protect themselves from thieves. Specially, in Europe and America single mothers mostly have one or more dogs at their places to protect their family and home from any intrusion. Moreover, some dogs are specially trained to help the aged and blind people to move from one place to another place. On the other hand, 50% of aged people get injured while they were walking at home and collide with a sleeping pet on the floor. So, keeping an animal at home has its own pros and cons.",
        "In conclusion, taking an animal inside home can be dangerous for your family\u2019s health and specially, for kids. If you want to keep a pet for safety, it is suggested to have a pet house out of your home or at least outside of your bedroom."
