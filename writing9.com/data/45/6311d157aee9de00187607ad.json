        "Moreover , sometime we get other products , when we ordered online , owing to the temptation of bucks , such as during a COVID it increased rapidly , therefore it encourage the public to do fraud , as a result, we lost our hard earned capital. Furthermore , we cannot purchase groceries online , due to if it turns out to be bad , we do not use it , for instance, whenever we go to grocery store them we check time after we perchase it so it will not get worse.",
        "On the other hand , a plethora person give order on online application, therefore it encourage them to do more spread business rather than in the past , for instance , last year , thousands of people change their mindset and they are forward shop to online.
