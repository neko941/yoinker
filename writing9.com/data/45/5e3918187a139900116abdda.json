        "Intelligence of persons is largely dependent upon the types of tasks they perform in their life.  It is usually believed that the intellectual ability of humans is enhanced by involving them more in various group activities. According to me, skills in a person improve significantly if he/she indulges themselves in some team activities.",
        "Firstly, a person involved in any group participation develops some very good attributes like team management, leadership skills, communication skills, cooperation and empathy and various other social values. As when someone works in a team, he/she has to deal with other fellow members or we can say have to compete with other persons. For instance, a football player makes so many permutations and combinations that how with the help of other team members it is possible to make a goal on opponent side. Thus involving in any group activity not only improves ones confidence in them but also enhances their decision making and problem solving capacity.",
        "Secondly, working in some group allows a person to get a constant feedback about themselves from the others persons involved in the same activity. As opposed when a person performs some individual tasks, there is no one to inform him about his positive and negative approach for that particular work. However, working collectively allows a person to be more flexible with his ideas as there is a continuous support from others which boosts up a person\u2019s mental ability to perform any activity.",
        "To conclude, skills in a person are improved to great extent by indulging them in various group activities. Hence, performing in a group not only enhances ones strengths but also helps in maintaining a balanced life."
