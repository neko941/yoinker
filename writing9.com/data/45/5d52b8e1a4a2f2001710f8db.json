        "To remain healthy,section of people think that sports education plays a significant role in syllabus of the school students but group of people deem that children should spend their time on theoratical subjects rather than physical knowledge.According to me both the subjects are equally important to learn in schooldays.This essay will discuss both the views followed by my opinion.",
        "To begin with,academic subjects are very important to survive in this highly competitive era.Though,it is imperative for students to focus on academic subjects such as maths,science and english because every subjects have their own potential.Spending time on such subjects will be fruitful for students because it leads children towards bright future.In other words,to open a simple business needs mathemtical and communication skills.Moreover,parents are worried about future of their child due to unemployment rate has increased.So,it is obvious that they prefer that children spend more time on academic subjects rather than sports.",
        "On other side,some people have underestimated the problems related to health which are proliferating among children such as obesity which sometime leads to diabetes and bloodpressure problems also.Therefore,it is essential to have a class of physical education where students can exercise their body and get knowledge about human body.So,having physical education is very beneficial becuase students will understand the value of their shape.It is fact that children can not focus on study if they are physically ill or weak.For instance,Beacon Hills School in America has introduced the physical education class after majority of students faced obesity.",
        "I opine that academic as well as physical,both the subjects are equally important becuase academic subjects help to build career,whereas,by physical education,children can curb common health problems which helps to focus on study."
