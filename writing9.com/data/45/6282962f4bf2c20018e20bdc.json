        "There is rising number of arguments that  nowadays media are becoming less and less objective. Focusing on this statement, in my essay, I am going to discuss the possible reasons for this situation and  attempt to offer some solutions.",
        "It cannot be denied, that number of media has increased enormously in recent two decades, including the social one. From one point of view it is progress, we have a vast number of a different kinds of information from entire world-  without dispute. On the other hand, like everything even this may be the source of some issues, with which we have to deal daily.",
        "With the increasing number of media directly proportionally their viewership is presumably decreasing because we have many options for what to follow. Understandably, it is not linked with increasing incomes and therefore the medias have to create a strategies how to entice customers again. One of the possible ways how to achieve this is to offer more interesting information. However, this might be linked with decreasing objectivity. Media are accommodating  an objective information to make them more attractive to users. Moreover, there are people who enjoy releasing incorrect information, which may be attractive for certain types of people and subsequently there are gathering still more followers on social media and they have higher incomes.",
        "Moving to the solutions, we have different options. Governments should decrease or at least regulate the number of media. Additionally, the content of media should be examined before publishing. In addition, there should be restrictions about which kind of information is certain media allowed to work with. With the most important ones only official media controlled by the government should work with.",
        "In nutshell, there are different sources of this issue including earning money and prestige. Nevertheless, we have different options how to solve this, but the government must engage in this."
