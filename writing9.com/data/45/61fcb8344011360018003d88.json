        "The citizens of developing countries such as India and China have seen an increasing number of  cars. In some nations  the car is not just a transport media, it is also a status symbol, thus people chose to buy another car then they have a need for. Having their own car does give benefits for individuals, as it makes them more independent but this move affects nature because a huge amount of carbon dioxide is released.",
        "The growth of infrastructure gives advancement to people in many ways. In a country such as ,India people enjoys the high-speed roadways network through which the distance between major cities become half. As the standard of living is increasing, people tend to buy cars for convenience also they do not need to depend on public transport. Moreover, as the country develop majority of a general population own a car through which they can travel to work on time and also visit places where the public transport is not strongly connected. For example- in the ruler areas connectivety of the buses is not great, in such places the private car made life comfortable.",
        "However, the increasing  number of cars on the road is a major concern for air pollution. Although, the goverment restrictions on car manufacturing companies have put restriction on emission through cars, it is still the topic of concern. A number of surveys has shown the results, which explain that carbon dioxide realised through the cars is the top reason for pulluted air in major cities. Furthermore, The maintenace of the cars also create  dangerous waste, such as a removed oil from the enigne. This non decomposable waste is detrimental for the living organisms.",
        "In cpnclusion, The individual owns the cars through which they can independently travel around the area for work, on the other side ejection of the carbon is also need to be noticed. The cpuntries need to look for ways to reduce the effects caused by cars on the environmnet. concerdering this, the effects on the environment is outperform by the ownership of the car."
