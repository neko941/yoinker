        "There is no doubt that purchasing digit of vehicles were increasing once country developed. There are minor environmental impairment for this movement, namely increasing air pollution as the result of many people having a car. But the benefits of having a car personally would prevail over the drawbacks in practical term.",
        "To begin with increasing purchase of car rate can deteriorate air quality. Although as it seen today most cars are driven by fossil fuels which emit harmful gases like carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide, recently car company have been developed modern technology to using electricity, solar power and biofuels for new type of car that we called as an eco-friendly car. For instance, The Sion, an electric car launched by Sono Motors, that is powered by the sun. Thus, by using those renewable energies, car will no longer generates poisonous gases.",
        "However, having cars have brought significant positive impact for human being: one essential benefit is convenient mobilty. Private cars are an excellent choice for daily commuting as they provide their users flexibility, convinience and safety ride. For instance, if a family chooses to go for outdoor activity such as hiking or camping, private car will suitable to meet their needs. In addition, cars also are particularly helpful in emergency situation where getting to the destination in time is very crucial. For example, when one of the family member get sick in the middle of the night, private car will very helpful to go to hospital immediately.",
        "To conclude, although people tendency to buy car can have certain negative effect in environmental side, it has an extremely positive influence in some practical ways and I believe that these benefits of private car outweigh its drawbacks."
