        "The two maps display the way to go to a city hospital in two different years.",
        "According to two maps, the city hospital is surrounded by Ring Road. It is obvious that the location of the bus stop transfers to the southwest of the city hospital in 2010, which was alongside the Hospital Road in 2007. The hospital staff and the public used to share a car park which is on the east side of Hospital Road in 2007, but a new car park is built at the east side of the city hospital and opened for public use in 2010. Moreover, there are two circle roads are established on both conjunctions of Hospital Road to connect the bus stop in 2010.",
        "Overall, the city hospital and Ring Road do not have much change between 2007 and 2010. The bus stop is moved to a new place. Also, an extra facility by the hospital is added for parking. The original car park remains the size. Two roundabouts are made to fluent the route."
