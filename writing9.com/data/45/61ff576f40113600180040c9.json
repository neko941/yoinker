        "There are some controversial perspectives heating a debate over the fast development of communication technology such as smartphones, tablets and other mobile devices. While this advancement has its own pros and cons, I would contend that its disadvantages still outweigh its advantages.",
        "Communication technology has globally connected everyone, and makes human\u2019s life more convenient. Since communication technology was created, people can communicate with each other much more easily than before, which made our life more comfortable. For instance, since  Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone, people can communicate with each other without any difficulties. Those advantages have clearly proved that communication technology is potentially made if the society uses it correctly. Nevertheless, these usages of communication technology also brings out some disadvantages.",
        "While those upside of communication are well-known, it would be unfair if the counterpart is ignored. Communication technology causes a very significant phenomenon in society, which is laziness. With the advancement of communication technology, people are more likely to rely on it. To give an instance, instead of having a face-to-face conversation, teenagers prefer having an online meeting because of its convenience, which causes teenagers\u2019s laziness. Not denying those helpful usage of communication technology, its bad affection is more likely to be seen. If there are not any solutions for society\u2019s laziness caused by communication technology, the disadvantages will significantly exist.",
        "Overall, communication technology has its own advantages and disadvantages, however those disadvantages can be noticed more easily. If people use communication technology in a reasonable way, it will be very helpful."
