        "Exercise is the most important determinant to have a healthy life. Now a day, people are not getting enough time to do work out for hectic work schedule. This essay will analyze the root cause of working people having inadequate exercise and which is resulting to health hazards.",
        "Why do people not getting enough time for physical activities? Answers may be restless work schedules and tiredness. These two facts are related to each other. In recent times, working people, especially doing job for private organizations are in enormous work load. Individuals need to work 10 to 12 hours, whereas the stated office hour is 8 or 9 hours per day. This daily vast workload lasting almost half of a day, resulting tiredness in working people and also making shortfall of time to maintain a daily exercise schedule.",
        "In the case of mine, I have to go out at work within 8 am daily by having a one hour journey to my office. Then I work for at least 10 hours daily and I get back home spending one and half hours on the road. It is pretty much clear from the above that, there is a very little time remains after all these hazards to do some body works and get refreshed after a devastating day.",
        "Above aspect will surely outline the reasons behind people not getting enough workout times daily which are resulting the health related problems."
