        "Getting experience is more important than getting paid. Some communities argue that students should prefer a volunteer profession rather than paid work meanwhile others are not choosing to be a volunteer. In this essay, I will discuss my opinion regarding the given statement.",
        "Firstly, In this modern competitive world trial involvement is more important than money. Many organizations choose pupils with good knowledge in their task field. For instance, the pupil who works as a volunteer in their job field then they will get production involvement which increases the package like a software engineer who has more job participation will get more wages.",
        "Secondly, Volunteering freely is also a good opportunity for any inexperienced pupils. Unpaid professions engender building standard life with practice. People with good technical skills will utilize this opportunity. For example, entrepreneurs are the people who choose to volunteer to improve their skills.",
        "To conclude, I agree with the given statement that It is better to choose unpaid jobs in their leisure time which will give good experience in their work."
