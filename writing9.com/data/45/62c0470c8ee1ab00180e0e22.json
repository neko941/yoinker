        "This is a well-known fact that prisons are becoming overcrowded now a days. In this essay, I shall be discussing whether jails are key to low crime rate or community service help in improvement of criminals.",
        "Firstly, captivating culprits help maintaining law and order in society, leading to better control of crime rates by the Government. Also, it has been observed that in some cases, when the criminals are released, they are involved in another crimes. Furthermore, serious offenders such as murderers and rapists are grave threat to community and their isolation is required.",
        "On the other hand, community service is likely to be more successful for people who are involved in crime for the first time or are juveniles. If such persons are imprisoned, it would provide them opportunity of acquaintance with dangerous felons. Absorbing petty criminals into community service will give them sense of belonging and may deter them to become criminals. For instance, my cousin got into bad company and was involved in petty shop lifting. Once he was caught and the court compelled him with community service of teaching slum children in night school. It was a life changing lesson for him, which made him better person. Also, staying with his family may have resulted in better outcome.",
        "In a nutshell, authorities can punish lawbreakers in many different ways including prison sentences and community service, however, I believe it should be regard to their crime and scale of their danger to society."
