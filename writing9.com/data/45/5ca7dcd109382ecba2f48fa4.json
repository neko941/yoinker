        "These days people are become less interesting in reading in general and especially newspaper, no matter  which country they from they mostly prefer to use the internet.",
        "However, in my opinion, i believe that one of the causes is because newspapers are not interesting any more. especially for  young generations who likes more to read about musicians or artist for example.  which might be mentioned in the newespaper but not that much as they want it to be , we can have a newespapers which concentrate more on these  topics to encourage people to read more.",
        "Also besides that now we can read about anything just by look up in our phones or laptops it is easier than buying a newspaper everyday.furthermore, we can only concentrate on the topics that we prefer. indeed these websites can not be trusted unlike the newespapers which is considered cheaper than news websites we can inform people about the possible risk  for  these websites and the effect of  fake news on socity and that the newespaper are more truastble than websites",
        "in addition, the size of the newspapers can become a hindrance. normally, the size can make it harder to read on the bus or in the coffee shop .if we  can reduce the size and make it easier for people to carry it with them it is will makes meny people read more  in any place so the number of newsapers reader will increas.",
        "in conclusion,  we can induce people to read newspaper by except their interest and try to focus in what attract them the most."
