        "Nowadays, performing multiple duties as well as altering profession frequently during life is becoming increasingly popular. For many people, this is the crucial decision to make their future bright and colourful by which they can complete their basic needs in future. However, there are both pros and cons to deciding to do this. In this essay, i will discuss some of the reasons why doing more than single job and changing career many times is so popular and some of the challenges to be overcome.",
        "Let\u2019s begin by looking at the advantages of working in more than one job. One of the main positives of performing multiple duties it that it broadens your horizons. What i mean by this is that you have a chance to complete your all desires by making money. This can make you a wealthy in your life. Secondly, it can lead to a better quality of life. You have an opportunity to meet different kind of people from different business backgrounds. Take people from western countries as an example, nearly 91% of people do side business or work at other part-time jobs which gives them extra income.",
        "Turning to the other side of the argument, time factor is the major problem. Many individual who change the work frequently or perform more than one job find it hard to cope with the time management, family care and many more. This often leads to incline family problems such as giving less time to family members, communication gap between life partner as well as with children\u2019s. Another issue is that it can be difficult to manage family functions. In other words, when you do more job, you are time poor and can not act as a family leader because you can not concentrate on your family and your mind always roam around within your work zones.",
        "All things considered, doing many jobs and changing occupation many time is never easy. You need to weigh up the pros of better lifestyle, career goals and so on, and the cons of time management and family problem. Personally, i believe the negatives in terms of family problems eventually outweigh any positives."
