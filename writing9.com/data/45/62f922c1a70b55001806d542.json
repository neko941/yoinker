        "Learners are proving to be over-dependent on technology, such as the Internet and mobile phones. This essay will discuss some of the major problems associated with addiction to computers and how this situation can be alleviated.",
        "One of the crucial problems associated with over-reliance on computers and tablets is plagiarism. Clearly with the advance in technology and easy accessibility, students are more tempted in using search engines to answer a question and simply copy the text from a website, rather than using their own ideas and abilities. For example, teachers often complain that instead of applying their own ideas while doing the assignment, children just replicate the same transcript from the internet. As a result, children will not develop their intellectual ability and thinking skills. In addition to that, another critical situation associated with addiction is the loss of eyesight.  Continuous usage of electronic gadgets will affect the eyes very badly, due to the light emitted from the screen. For instance, a recent study conducted by the WHO tells that, 60% of children are using spectacles because of low eyesight which is caused due to the over-usage of electronic devices."
