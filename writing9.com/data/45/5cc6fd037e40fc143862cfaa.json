        "These days, the number of diseases is incresing day by day, and it is increasing because of plethora of reasons. It is a need to take some steps to control these diseases. I think that the best way to improve public health is by taking some measures such as control the traffic, control deforestation, limited the number of industries, stop the pollution of water, air and noise etc. rather than increasing the number of sports facilities.",
        "To embark, I believe that environment plays a vital role in people's health, so there is a need to improve the environment which is very beneficial to the public and environment can be improve by the number of factors such as afforestation, for example, if a country plants more than 20 trees in a day so it is fruitful for everyone. By controlling the amount of pollutions which is produce by different industries everyday can improve the public health, it is a great deal for countries to minimise the amount of pollutants  from industries because we are living in the era of industrialisation and globalisation. Other factors, for illustration, by reducing the usage of air conditioner and refrigerators etc because global warming is reached at its highest peak and by this, the ozone layer is depleting day by day which is detrimental for everyone.",
        "However, some people think that by increasing the number of sports facilities, the public health will improve because health can also improve by exercising, for example, some people damage their health due to the lack of exercise and they eat lots of junk food. so they think by increasing the number of sports facilities, one can improve his health but I disagree with them because exercising is depend on individual's motivation, so it is great to establish some programmes for awareness of people for doing exercise rather than increasing sports facilities.",
        "To sum up, some steps should be taken for improve the public health like smoking should be banned and like start the environmental friendly programmes."
