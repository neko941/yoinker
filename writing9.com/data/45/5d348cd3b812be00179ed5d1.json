        "Owing to the advent of the medical field,most of the people believe in immediate results either it is relating to medicines or acheiving the aims. However , taking precautions is lawys better than painful or exorbitant treatments . In my opinion, people should be given preference to preventative techniques instead of curing the illness.",
        "one primary reason to believe in these adages is that hard-earned money is a valueable thing to everyone . Therefore, people would give importance to take the prevention. It appears that by giving some money and time to heakth can bring an enormous advantages to human bodies. For instance, daily 20 minutes of rapid walk can shield the people from various chronic diseases as wella smaintain the balanced body weight .",
        "Another point to consider is related to saving the individuals time and money .Money can be spent in severe health conditions but the time which people devote during the treatment of illness,cannot be recalled ,which in turn, decline the productivity and efficiency of the patient . Hence , by becoming a little health conscious person , everyone can protect one's health from virsuses and bacteria.",
        "It appears that costly treatments could be used only when the illness becomes unbearable and decreasing the people's life-expectancy . Through , caring and proper nurturing , society can also save the health sector budgets of the government as well as government can get a chance to use it on the other important areas like education , employement .",
        "To conclude , although the medical drugs can bring a tremendous benefits to people , yet , people should given some time to their health and may live longer than expected."
