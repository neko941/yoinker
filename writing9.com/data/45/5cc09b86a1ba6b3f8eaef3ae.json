        "Agressive acts, such as , terrorist attacks and murder shown on TV channels may stimulate aggression within our communities. I agree with this notion to some extent. This essay will analyze the different effects of this on people.",
        "Many unstable people worldwide are mentally fragile, therefore, when they see morbid acts on TV, they are often triggered into mimicking what they see. This is because, they may share similair idealogoes, however, are uninspired in terms of the execution of these acts. For example, the New Zealand terrorist attacks on Muslim Mosques in 2019, resulted in 4 other attacks on places of worship in Singapore, India, Nigeria and Haiti. Undoubtedly, the media may indirectly encourage violent acts in society when they report atrocious crimes.",
        "However, one must not disregard the positive effects these crime reports have on people. Alternatively, some view these channels and are enlightened about the dangers that happen around them. In turn, they educate their families and spread awareness abut the negative ramifications of these acts. For instance, going back to the example of the New Zealand shootings, people all around the world were united against the violence. Furthermore, they took a stand with the muslim community.",
        "In conclusion, although the murder and crime portrayed by the media may influence societies negatively, they can also englighten people and unify them."
