        "Modern day buildings are known to change the appearance of towns and cities. It is some people's view that government ought to make it compulsory for houses to be built traditionally so as to promote culture. In my own opinion, I completely disagree with this view because it is  individual preferences and choices that matter more and also the benefit of being able to incorporate latest technology into the building.",
        "On a first note, it is important for buildings to reflect the style and preference of the individual who will reside in the building. People who reside in a place are the greatest determinant of how it should be built, in my own view. Since, government will not live with anyone in their homes, the choice of appearance and  style ought to be theirs. For example, my father has to build a new duplex  that had a garden and a gymnasium, these were great relaxation tools for him, whenever he comes from work.",
        "While I agree that promotion of cultural heritage is also crucial, I, however, strongly think that this should not be placed above personal choices and preferences.",
        "Another reason why I disagree is that mordern day houses can benefit from latest innovation. Many homes, nowadays, are enhanced technologically. It is not uncommon to see homes in the 21st century with in-built solar panels, as an example, which helps to serve as a source of clean energy. Another example is that of buildings in many big cities in my country, Nigeria which have green roofs. This innovation helps to ensure that such homes have sufficient natural oxygen which is a by- product from the plants on the roof, which is the taken through vents into the houses. While some may tend to argue for the protection of cultural heritage by advising government to promote traditional styles, this modern day advantage of technologically empowered houses overrides this argument.",
        "In conclusion, there is a need to promote modern day buildings over the olden - days type, in order to ensure that people live happily in their homes of choice ,while also enjoying the additional benefits of technology in their homes"
