        "A number of people suggest that children should be allowed to make their own decisions in everyday lives, while others claim that this may result in the development of selfishness. From my perspective, adults need to understand why children should make their own choices.",
        "Allowing children to make their own decisions seems to be good in most cases. Firstly, the awareness of being independent of children should be controlled when they are young. In early childhood, every child is gradually discovering their relationships with other individuals. From childhood, everyone is required to make various decisions for different things, gradually taking over their own lives. Otherwise, they would be dependent on their parents for support when they reach legal age. Therefore, children should be encouraged to make their own choices in daily life.",
        "On the other hand, if children were given complete freedom to make their own choices in everything, they might suffer serious consequences. Studies show that those who are selfish are likely to come from a family, in which they are usually spoiled by old family members. Therefore, how to guide children to make proper decisions is very important. Parents could first pick three suitable dresses, and ask their children to pick their favorite, rather than ask them what they wish to wear. This could allow the children to make a choice with proper control, and could prevent them from making a wrong decision. In summary, children sometimes need to learn how to make the best decisions when they are immature.",
        "However, giving children proper control and guidance to make reasonable choices seems to make best decision in depend on their family. The child\u2019s behaviors or mind relate too much to their parents."
