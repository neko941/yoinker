Similarly, transportation of perishable edibles can also encounter the same problem. By contrast, nowadays, very few people cultivate products their own and most of them depend on  others, therefore, adding additive is the best method to preserve food items for future use.",

        "Many countries do not have the resources to regulate the  various additives use in foods. However, food producers are asked to adhere the government's  directives to maintain the standardization. This is extremely essential for the country to closely monitor  the use of any unauthorised presevatives in edibles"
