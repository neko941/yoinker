        "There have always been two voices regarding the solution regarding unnecessary product packaging. One of which claims that the manufactures should be liable to reduce the packaging materials, while the opponents argue that the responsibility lies on customers who make the purchasing decision. I believe that to control how much resources are allocated towards product packaging, both the manufacturers and customers should be held accountable.",
        "First and foremost, to limit packaging to its minimal level, the decision is for businesses who produce the products to make. As long as the managerial team decides on reducing the packaging complexity, such decisions will lead to minimalized product design, which does not require excessive packaging materials. A good example would be Apple's industrial leading design concept. In the past 10 to 15 years, Apple shipped its products with recyclable paper boxes for their complementary accessories with minimal packaging. This should be something the other manufacturers can emulate.",
        "In addition, consumers' purchasing decision is an influencing factor which can develop a trend for businesses to change their packaging, and it would work if consumers avoid products which are packed abundantly. However, such conduct is a passive measure, which means that heavily packed products could have already been supplied to the market, and the environmental damage could have been done. Nevertheless, avoiding excessively packaged products, in the long run, will force manufacturers to react to the customers\u2019 newly developed preferences.",
        "To conclude, it should be commonly agreed that although customers can play a role in solving this problem, the primary responsibility of reducing packaging materials on products should be put on the manufacturers who design packaging and make products."
