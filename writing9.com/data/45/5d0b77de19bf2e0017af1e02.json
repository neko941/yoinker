        "Certain individuals opine that music is a great method of uniting people of various cultural  backgrounds and age grades. In my opinion, I completely agree  with this statement as it is a form of  relaxation and some  renditions  comprise  of folklore stories .",
        "To begin with, entertainment is one of the ways music brings people with different practices and age grades in union.By this I mean, when  foreigners come in to a particular country for recreational purposes,  different  cultural beliefs are present. They get to interact and know more about one another, as a result,  togetherness is fostered. This is further exemplified in 2018,  when P square ,the famous Nigerian musicians which comprises of twin brothers ,held a concert tagged Mega jamz.This had in attendance, individuals from  diverse nations and age class. They had fun and interacted amongst them selves Thus, strengthening the ties between these set of people.",
        "Another point to consider is that  some  songs consist of folklore stories. In other words, elderlies  sing this type of song to the younger generation at bed times.Hence,  fostering the unity amongst  various age  categories.  To simplify further , in my home town,  the children usually dance as  grandmothers  render  songs at  bed times to their grand children during folktales. This has made the young generation to always confide more in their grand mothers' than in their biological mothers.",
        "To conclude ,  the essentiality of music can never be downplayed .  I am still of the view that it is a useful tool in uniting  all kinds of people in terms of cultural differences and age range because  it entertains the public  and also contains informations about the past.",
