        "An issue that exists around the world is heavy traffic. However, in this essay I will not only explain the factors why traffic congestion occurs but also discuss how this obstacle can be easily resolved.",
        "Wrong plan for time management by the government is the root cause of trafficking. By explaining, it will be clear to you I hope. All government and non-government offices, all educational institutions, private and multinational business farms and organizations, and all other local shops open and close at the same time. As a result, all the people of various professions, students, teachers, as well as guardians, come to the streets at a similar time, thereby causing traffic congestion. For example, Dhaka is a city of 10 million people, and except the elderly and housewives, more or less 9 million dwellers set out for their respective places at around 9 a.m. That is why all the streets abound with a total of two million private and public vehicles, though the streets have a capacity of holding half a million vehicles.",
        "The proper distribution of time for each organization can be a way of curbing traffic congestion. Schools, colleges, and universities open at 8 a.m. and end at 1 p.m., while all the offices must lunch at 11 a.m. Japan, for instance, reduced twice as much traffic in 2021 as it was in the past. By adopting this strategy, Japan, for instance, reduced twice as much traffic in 2021 as it had in the past.",
        "According to me, with an aim to mitigate traffic, the government in collaboration with different political, social and cultural organisations should enect legislation to separate official timetable."
