        "Children's needs are highly prioritize and also put into consideration while carry out their wants and need. In this essay i am of the say that television watching is not really good for the kids.",
        "Firstly, children has a very tender but smart memory while they are much younger, exposing children to watching of television could make their mind to be preoccupied by some nasty home video display, also. Watching of television abstract them from their social lifestyle amongst other children thereby making them  to become anti-social.",
        "Secondly, there are other device kids can use in place of television for example , kid's iPad tablet all thanks to iPhone company who created such products. With this iPad tablet lots of kiddies games and educative apps could be downloaded and further broadens their knowledge especially in calculation scheme.",
        "Thirdly, it encourages them to take studied serious ,and perhaps carry out their assignment diligently. Getting glue to the television will detrimental to child's mental health because it  limits so much basic knowledge they ought to know while studying. Other than watching television kids can get diversional therapy by taking them to the park or shopping mall to play different varieties of children's game with their fellow peers, and hence, improve their physical fitness. Furthermore , children will learn the basic things around the house for example, there comes a certain time in age of a child he or she will be to carry out domestic chores at home. Reading certain interesting novels improves learning and vocabulary.",
        "Children who study more outshines more than other peers who spend more time in watching the television."
