        "Many applicants are required to share additional personal information such as hobbies or marital status during job selection process. Some people believe that this information can prove beneficial for the employers whereas others claim that this information is useless and holds no value. This essay will discuss both view points and present my opinion.",
        "To begin with, whether an applicant needs to share such information depends upon the nature of  job. Companies do not need to ask for personal information while hiring  contact employee or consultant for short period of time.But in case of permanent job offer, personal information will help the employer to give insight into job applicant\u2019s personality. They will get to know if the applicant possess the leadership skills or a team worker. For instance, in case of a marketing job,candidates who love travelling and meeting new people would be most suitable as compared to others with same work experience and skills.",
        "On the flip side, sometime this information can be misused by the recruiters. They can use it to discriminate against an employee and this argument is valid to certain extent.To Illustrated my point of view, an employer may decide to not hire an employee whose political or religious ideologies clashes with him. Moreover,many times applicants feel uncomfortable to share their personal data with strange firms.",
        "Summing up, there's no argument in saying that personal information is crucial for the employers to know about their potential employees and this also smoothens the decision making process in an organisation. It is therefore understandable that why employers ask for such information."
