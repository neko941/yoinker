        "Many people opt sports like cricket, football, rugby, tennis and other main sub fields as their main career in life. During research, I read that according tyo Gardener's eight multiple intelligences, those who have selected sports as their profession are actually body smart that is they are extremely fit for physical activities. In my country, famous sportsmen are highly paid for their winning matches, advertisements, brands attratction, public following and countless awards. Despite of the fact that many people think that they are paid unjustly, I feel that they are paid for the hardwork and risk they have taken in their life to lay every brick of their career.",
        "First of all, the hardwork these sportsmen do to start their careers like the time they had invested in gaining the stamina and boosting physical strength to be fit for the chosen sports. Moreover, these sportsmen spent handsome amount of money on hiring personal trainers and dietitian who look after their fitness. They also work day and night to learn skills, techniques and modern workd tricks to beat their competitors in games.",
        "In addition to the hardwork, these sportsmen take a huge risk of injuries, sucess, growth, fear of unknown and defaming. If they are highly paid after becoming a celebrity, this is because they have inculcated risk and hardwork to be here at this stage in their career.",
        "On the contrary, some people believe that these sportsmen are paid way more than what they deserve as people in other professions are doing more or less the same hardwork and taken risk to build their careers. For example, in the field of education, teachers do a lot of hardwork before they go to the class like planning lessons, designing worksheets and bring innovation. Similarly, business man take risk in setting up their own merchandise companies but the pay back dont only depend on hardwork.",
        "To conclude, inspite of the fact that famous sportsmen who are now celebrities take huge amount of money, some people think this is not fair with people working in different fields. Howeve, I feel that these sportsmen are paid for the hardwork and risk."
