        "No doubt that Technology has brought so much of advancement to our life, however newspaper and magazines are are our traditional trends and replacing them will be challenge. It a very good point for discussion but it should scrutinize before be provide our opinion.",
        "Advantages",
        "To begin with, E- Books are convenient to carry anywhere and moreover like books we do not have bother about storing space because we can save it all in our phone memory, not only this but this technology provide us the ocean of opportunities to get access to e-books and magazines through internet, which is just a click away. It also helps us in saving money which we spend on books.",
        "Disadvantages",
        "On the other hand, technology has negative impact as well, people are getting used to it; without it they find that they have lost, because of internet we are facing lots of health issues as well like insomnia, eyes burning issues etc. We are so much occupied with this, where we don\u2019t even realize that who is sitting next to us. So I can say that till some extend we are loosing your relationship.",
        "In conclusion, technology has become major part of our life and now it not possible to beat the word without this, accepted that technology has given access to e-book where you can read anything, any where at any point of time, however this can not be replaced by the feeling which we get while we hold the book or magazine in our and read."
