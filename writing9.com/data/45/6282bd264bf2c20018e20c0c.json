        "It is generally acknowledged that the majority of people are encouraged to work hard when they get promoted in contemporary society. This essay will outline why people want to get promotions and suggest other factors that should be taken into consideration.",
        "To begin with, some people argue that people can have better job satisfaction when they receive promotions. they also believe that not only can promotions for workers bring about confidence among them, but it may also contribute to receiving well-paid, thereby leading to a sense of satisfaction. However, from my point of view, it is not always benefit to workers due to high responsibilities. when people level up to an upper position, to a certain degree, they have more responsibilities. Therefore, they might become stressful due to excessive burden on them.",
        "There are other factors can help workers work hard. Providing a peaceful working atmosphere can enhance teamwork, and therefore individuals respect on another. As a result, they do not need to use their energy for the difficulties of relationship, rather they can concentrate on their work. For example, In Korea, a lot of nurses who are disappointed at intimidating coworkers tend to make more mistakes due to nervousness. As the example clearly illustrates, a peaceful working atmosphere plays an important role to work well.",
        "Moreover, working place is also a crucial factor to help people focus on work. If their working place is located at the point that can easily be approached, workers do not need to waste their time and energy for commuting. If they use excessive time for commuting they would become tired before they start work. For instance, a survey conducted by the Korea Labour Foundation has revealed that the performance of companies that are located downtown is approximately 20% higher than that of companies that are required a long commuting time.",
        "As a result, while I accept that getting promotions can sometimes be useful for people to work hard, it can cause stress. From my perspective Working atmosphere and the location of working area are important factors make employees work hard."
