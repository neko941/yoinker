        "In the era of continuous scientific and technological developments, art-related works such as musicians, painters and authors still gain a lot of respect from the public. This is because we can have a deeper understanding of our surroundings which high-tech products fail to bring.",
        "Firstly, the arts allow us to perceive life from different angles and thus enrich our souls. While the world of technology provides us with a picture of daily events, the life of artists gives us an opportunity to imagine what we have an interest in. In the researcher's eye, for example, a dog is just an animal with soft fur and four legs, whereas, to a writer, it is regarded as a loyal friend and an indispensable member of his family.",
        "Another point is that arts are likely to build up a spiritual life compared to technology and science which brings benefits to our physical life, making us become a more well-rounded person. For instance, books always accompany me whenever I fell under the blue, then help me relieve stress.",
        "In conclusion, despite the time of the technology boom, the arts still hold a vital position in broadening our knowledge about every aspect of life which technology does not meet demand."
