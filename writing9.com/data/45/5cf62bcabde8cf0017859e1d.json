        "Education is an important sector in each country all over the world. Some people believe that the government should prioritise  the funding  allocation towards sciences education instead of any other kind of education for a country to be able to grow and evolve. This essay will explain the reason why it is true and give some supporting facts and opinions related to it.",
        "I believe that it is important for the government to focus on science-related allocation compared to other subjects, for instance music, sport, and art. The question is: why is it important for the government to outweigh the spending on it? The main reason is the number of scientists in the world is getting decrease year by year while the country need of their existence is getting increase.",
        "Nowadays, there is a shifting of current generation\u2019s interest regarding what is the most interesting and important to them at the same time so that becoming a scientist is not favorable anymore compared to in the past decades. It is because to become a trusted scientist, they need to purse higher education, at least owning a master degree. They need to invest more time and money in pursuing higher education, in contrast most of them get lower salary than expected after finishing master or PhD. However, in my opinion, if the science education is totally free, the interest of pursuing higher education in science will increase. Moreover, if the infrastructure of learning science had been well-built, the students would have been attracted to learn science than other subjects.",
        "To sum up, it is important for the government to outweigh their focus on allocating their funding to teaching sciences rather than other subjects by giving grants and scholarship both to teachers and students because without scientist, the country will not be able to develop and progress properly."
