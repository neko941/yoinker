        "The science is a quite essential subject for all the primary students all over the world as it provides basic knowledge of the objects and things related to day-to-day life. If person wants to study more about the science they tend to go to the university, while others are choose to observe in different subjects.",
        "As we can see currently, most student do not choose science subject in university in many countries. The main reason is that the science requires special knowledge and skills to innovate and understand the basic elements. It is also more complex rather than doing any other subject. The second reason is that the students think the science will quite boring, since they always have to be in the lab doing observations. The final supporting reason is time because most students tend to learn subjects without spending much time. But obviously, science requires patience and tolerance.",
        "If students not choose science subject to begin their career, there will be some adverse effects to the society. The major effect is shortage of employers related to the science, such as Doctors, Chemist, Environmental scientists, Geoscientists and Hydrologist. However, without those employers the world will not be exist as they are doing extra ordinary job to our society. Secondly, there will be no mentors to recreate the new generation as a scientist, and which will lead to enormous impact to the whole world.",
        "Consequently, I strongly believe science is a best subject in the world because it helps to create new innovations, medicines, and the materials. The responsibility is that the pre-schools should encourage and teach the value of the science, and which will lead enough students to choose science subject in near future."
