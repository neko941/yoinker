        "In the modern era, some masses feel a blessed, and happy to get the opportunities to live in various parts of the world, but others want to spend whole life in a single place. Now, I will discuss both views and my opinion in the upcoming paragraphs.",
        "To commence with, numerous people habbit to spend their whole life at the different places because they want to increase their skills and knowledge as well as people know about the various cultures, and traditions. For example, a huge amount of students go to abroad and other states for their higher education and  a job, and they feel happy to spend their life at the various places. Also, folks meet with number of people in the world when they move from one place to another place even, they learn various languages.",
        "On the flip side, some people want to spend their life at a single place because they depends upon their parents for their basis needs. For instance,  the child of farmers depends upon their parents business in their future, and they think it is typical to survive away from home. Moreover, in rural area, parents do not allow their children to live away from home and they lost a number of the opportunities in their life which helps to enhance their future.",
        "In my opinion, nowadays, everyone busy in their life due to their job and some masses get the opportunities from their company to go various locations due to their work. Also, some people want to take break for their headech schedules and make trip at popular place which helpd to make their career best and they increase their skills and parctical knowledge.",
        "To conclude it can be said that, living at the different location is necessary for everyone and its good to interact with different kind of people as well as mind relaxation, but its negative effect on younger and society because some time people forget their cultures."
