        "It is true that in this era,Several individuals think that school children should be wear a uniform,However other people say that children should wear any type of clothes in this school.This essay will highlight both opinions and also elaborate that are certainly a mastery over the fundamentals of it.",
        "To embark with, in schools uniform should be compulsory for toddlers.Firstly, from school youth learn about society values discipline along with uniform is the first step to learn atticates.In addition, in schools from different religions childrens come there for studies, with the help of same uniform children learn all adolescence are equal and the easily make friends in their school.Uniform also describe every school beauty and repetition.For example, in America there are many schools which which are not allow uniform to toddlers and there are some children belong to rich families this use do bowling with middle class children if they are wearing same uniform .It a make equality in the children.",
        "On the other hand, in our nation There are several schools which are not allowed uniform to the children.Firstly, it is depend on toddlers age which children are starting their school from Play School and others. Additionally, in these schools from 4 to 8 age group of adolescence dose not wear uniform .If children's wear other clothes rather than uniform they go School easy everyday because in this age many of the offsprings  did not want to go school along with which parents do job they are troubling from this situation.For example, in many schools children wear other clothes rather than uniform in once a week.Furthermore, in this way children do little bit fun and they are very excited to go to school.",
        "To conclude, after analysing that according to my point of view infant should wear uniform who are 10 to above age group.Moreover ,which of offsprings starting their school they should go freely because in this way they learn about colours and different costume."
