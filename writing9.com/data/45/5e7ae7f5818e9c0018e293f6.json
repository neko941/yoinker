        "Overpopulation has become a major problem in the world, especially in urban areas. This could be attributed to several personal and professional issues guiding to immigration to city centres. Effective management practices to deal with such situations can play significant role in reducing severity of this issue considerably.",
        "Firstly, capitalist free economics have encouraged an increasing number of migrants to city in order to boost their revenue, which has led the population to higher than expected. moreover, urban areas could provide more job opportunities to people than in the village, where they can satisfy their needs smoothly. For example, there are many employees who prefer their work place to urban centre rather than rural areas. In addition to that, the incredible facilities which cities provide, lured the person's mind and force them to live in city. Shopping malls, live restaurants and the transportation are ideal examples.",
        "Effective rules and regulations by the Government can tackle this situation quite effectively. I believe the most obvious solution is to create a significant number of job opportunities to educated youth in village areas along with more recreational activities to entertain them. Indeed, there are many proved instances where people like to settle in rural areas by provides these elite mode of facilities.",
        "In conclusion, personal and professional issues can be a cause to overpopulation in city centres and these problems can be solved by the government by implementing certain regulations and facilities."
