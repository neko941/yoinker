        "The number of crimes are increasing day by day in every country because those people who committed crime do not have a feeling of fear, they think they will be rescue from the jail by giving money to the advocate and I strongly agree that there should be fixed punishment for each type of crime because criminals will think hundred of times before committe any type of crime.",
        "To embark, I believe that there should be a fixed punishments for criminals such as death penality and life imprisonment because crime is likely to be low by this, for example, if there is a punishment of life imprisonment for a thief so he thinks thousand of times before stolen something. It will save a lot of time and money, for instance, some cases take many years to be solve and a plenty of money is wasted in it, furthermore, sometimes people do not even submit their report to the police because they think they are going to waste their time by go to the court everyday, moreover, some people try to hide their problem because of embarrasment and they know nothing is going to happen and they will not get justice.",
        "However, some people believe that the circumstances of an individual crime and the motivation for committing it should always be taken into account when deciding on the punishment becuse they think there is always be a compulsion behind every crime, if we take an example of Bhagat Singh, a legend of India, who sacrifices his life for nation, he committed plethora of crime for the independence of India so there was a big reason behind his every crime, therefore, they think circumstances should always be taken into account but I disagree with them because instead of a meaningful reason of Bhagat Singh for committing a crime, he had to be a victim of death penalty",
        "because he was also knew too that he is a criminal and he wanted nobody to do it what he did.",
        "To sum up, If we want to stop the increasing rate of crime so we should take some steps and government should be strict and need to take high actions towards it."
