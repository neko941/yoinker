Moreover, when some urgent problem can not be solved, maybe since the government has less money. All over the world some people have not got any house hence if the administration won't spend money for this situation they can build some house and will give to homeless people. However, society will have much fun together thanks to art, music and stage games consequently of this issue perhaps people will not do harmful things. Many people can meet new people and be friends with them when  they go to art exhibitions, concerts or theater. Moreover the artist\u2019s budgets are increased and they can focus on creating new things for the art.",

I talked with him and he said to me \u201cThe government must help me so I am dying day by day.\u201d I thought when he was in like that status the government how can spending money for other citizen\u2019s funs.",
