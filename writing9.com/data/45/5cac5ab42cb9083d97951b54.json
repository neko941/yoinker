        "It is evident that children are shifting outdoor activities to indoor thanks to the advance of technologies. I concur with the idea that this tendency only render detrimental effects on the youngsters.",
        "The consequence of children altering their spare time activities would be also deleterious. In terms of physical impacts, as they solely seek entertainment from television, it is inevitable that those young audience would neglect their participation in outdoor activities, which makes them prone to sedentary-related diseases such as obesity, muscle degeneration, and high blood pressure.",
        "Regarding mental influences, since they could not distinguish between the right and the wrong, counter-educational programs which broadcast violence and pornography as well as negative modelings such as smoking, alcohol abuse, and swearing, could easily make children fall under the impression that those things are trendy. More seriously, they could end up imitating those inappropriate behaviors and adopting an unhealthy lifestyle. As an illustration, children who are exposed to violent shows and games at the early age not only often exhibit aggressive emotion and behaviors but also have a high potential of committing crimes, which poses a threat on the well-being of society.",
        "Additonally, excessive attention paid to TV shows would also impair their communication skills. Specifically, by spending overmuch time in front of the screen, the juvenile would be discouraged from real-life interaction with family members and the outside world, depriving themselves of opportunities to socialize. This, hence, would hinder their social development and profoundly affect their adulthood in the long run.",
        "In conclusion, it is imperative to provide timely parental guidance coped with stringent governmental regulations in order to balance the time children spending on the Internet and in real life."
