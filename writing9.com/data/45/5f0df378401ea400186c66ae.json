        "-  Many people argue that people tend to study at universities rather than enroll in the vocation training courses in today\u2019s modern world. Therefore, there is a shortage of human resources such as eletricians, plumber ,etc. Personally I completely agree with the view that modern people should be promoted to attend vocation training .",
        "There are two reasons why people should do vocation training. Firstly, they give the opportunities for students, who can continue learning another program  when they can not have a great result in the national exam. It\u2019s significantly reduced the myriad of unemployments all the country.My cousin is a case in point. He has a great job after 3 courses at Engineer training center. Secondly , not all of the student graduates from the different kind of universities can find out, great career, even some of them will be unemployment or  working  a job with low salary.",
        "Apart from the benefits expressed above, I believe that the vocation training also creates a balance between manual work and white-collar job. If everyone has taken the academic courses about finance, accounting at college, thenthen who would solve the problem relate to electricity ,water in hospitals and schools.",
        "Furthermore, the knowledge of about apprenticeship programs can be easily applied in real life, whereas the academic theory sometimes different from the reality. For instance, people can not use the fomula probability statistics to solve the problem in real life but they can use the range of Electric skill to fix the electrical circuit.",
        "In conclusion, for the reason I have mentioned above, I strongly believe that the society should be encouraged  everybody to learn apprenticeship programs .If we do not have different types of jobs , we can not function an economy effectively."
