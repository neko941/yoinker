        "Expert has emphasized that music unites people of different background, ethnicity and with unique  cultural difference to came together as one member.I hereby support this idea and promptly list my reasons.",
        "For instance, music is regarded as stress reliever by different scientist and professors by giving you intense happiness and feeling of relaxation. It also provides away of communication to other people, its lyrics for instance it directly  conveys massage to the listener hence making him feel joyfulness. Henceforth, music  brought human of all age groups together by involving  music classes and singing top celebrity songs. Music on other  hand made same individuals successful by working in those industry for instance Lady Gaga, one of the most well known celebrity.",
        "Same sources also indicate the side effect music has led to the society which made young immature teenergers to depend on and make a living out of it. It also led young adults to listen only music in high voices which inturn damages there delicate organ of hearing. Music has being recently used as source of sexual leisure thereby depicting  immoral behaviour to the communit which inturn mislead the whole society as large. This can be handled by the government butting counter measures to the institution and musical industries  and putting them huge fine ot banning them.",
        "I hereby conclude by saying that music and songs bring diverse categories of people to be under one shade and practise to one tone all at once. Lets all smile under one song."
