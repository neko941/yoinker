Being with them help to understand each countries values, tradition,  culture respecting each other .",
        "Furthermore, having a internationally recognized academic qualification and language proficiency helps to find a well paid job easily all around the world .for instance,  student who enter Chinese university must learn chinese language in order to complete his studies which open more high salary chinese jobs in future .",
        "Even though studying international university bring more positive results , students has to stay away their family and loved ones long period of time bring detrimenatl health issues.  International students have to stay another country away from their family and has to manage every needs without help .
