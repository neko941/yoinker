        "Advertisement has became a vital tool to sell your products or services in a competitive market. Some people think that advertising is successful in leading us to buy the offered products or services but some people might think that advertising is getting common these days.",
        "To successfully survive and be attractive in a competitive advestisement market, advertisers often have to be creative in advertising. A creative advertisement can successfully catch the attention of viewers because there are wide range of similar products and services in the market these days. For example: items offered not only similar functions but also at a competitive price. With advertisement you may get to know the products or services more and if you see the same advertisement more often, you will most likely go for the particular advertised products or services.",
        "Meanwhile, there is another point of view on advertisement is getting too common. Due to the similarity of advertisement, viewers will start to get bored, lack of freshness and interest while watching the advertisement, they may even get annoyed by the repetitive and similar advertisement keep on broadcasting in every 15 minutes. At this time, viewers will rather take a break from watching TV or skip the advertisement to avoid watching it.",
        "In my opinion, advertisements may succeed in convincing us to buy the offered products or services or it can also be unsuccessful in many other ways. Advertisments can be commonly seen these days on TV or social media so it must be advertised in an appropriate way to achieve the desired marketing results."
