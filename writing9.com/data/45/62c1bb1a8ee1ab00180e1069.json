        "The bar chart shows the percentages of British persons donating to charities by paying money in the range of 18 to more than 65 years old, in the years 1990 and 2010.",
        "In 1990, for people aged 18 to 50 years old, the percentage of donations and their ages had a direct relationship, and the most significant number belonged to those who were excited in the range of 36 - 50 at above 40%. Nevertheless, this relationship was inverse for individuals up to 50 years old. In addition, the smallest number registered for the 18-25 age group by nearly 12%.",
        "Also, in 2010, the proportion of persons who gave money to charities directly related to ages, except those up to 65 years old. The most significant number was for the 51-65 age group at little under 40%, and the smallest figure belonged to the 18-25 age group is 7%.",
        "Besides these, in 1990, for less than 50 years old, number in average almost 10% bigger than in 2010. However, in 2010, for up to 50 years old, on average, around 5% more than 1990 people donated to charities.",
