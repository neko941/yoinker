        "In recent years, People migrating to other countries for various reasons like higher studies and work have become popular. In this essay I will discuss about the advatages and disadvanatges of relocation of people.",
        "Travelling to a new country may provide series of benefits to people. It may provide an opportunity to learn about the culture and language of the visiting country. This will reduce the gap between different cultures. Economy of the country may get a boost by taking higher number of international students. For example, Students travelling to other countries has to pay a huge amount to universities. Tourism is another prime reason for people to visit different nations which can also contribute to the economy of country.",
        "Migration is a serious threat to most of the developed countries.  one common problem is the lack of jobs to the native people. Students after completing their higher studies starts to work in the same country which",
        "creates a problem for the people who lives there for long time. For example, currently the USA faces the same situation where people protest againt their jobs being occupied by other nationals. Prevention of spreading diseases from immigrants is an another issue. Sometimes, immigrants are capable of spreading new bacteria or virus to the visiting nation which will make their own people vulnerable to disease. In addition to that, theft is an another issue among tourists. Money or things of high value are being robbed by local people.",
        "In summary, migration is definitely an important aspect in the growth of nations where it has some disadvantages."
