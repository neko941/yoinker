        "Over the last decade, concerns.er= have been raised about how animals are exploited for human benefits. This has become a controversial topic. Some people think that feeding on animals are beneficial to man's diet and therefore necessary for consumption. Others believe that it is inhumane to use animals for experimental purposes and should be stopped immediately. In my opinion, exploitation of animals for fun or hunting games should be banned.",
        "Humans need to eat, and animals are essential part of the meals we consume. Studies have shown that there are many nutrients and minerals that can gotten from animals. Animals are the only natural source for these nutrients like animal protein. Omega 3 for instance is important to man. it is a fatty acid with many health benefits and it can only be obtained from fish. This cannot be made possible if we do not take advantage of this nature\u2019s gift.",
        "On the contrary, some people think these nutrients can be manufactured artificially and it is not compulsory to get it resources naturally. They believe that anyone who indulge in the act of killing animals for any purpose is inhuman. And that these animals have life that should not be ended abruptly. Furthermore, they are living things that go through pain when they have face the wrath mankind for unnecessary reasons.",
        "Some of man\u2019s activities should be banned immediately. These actions involve killing of animals for amusement or for playing games. For example, people hunt animals as a competition and this is enjoyable to them. They derive pleasure carrying out this act and this should be stopped. And I think the government can develop policies to curb these actions. Animals should only be exploited only when necessary. In the laboratory, where human subject cannot be used to test experimental drugs, animals become the alternative. Therefore, should humans cancel all such experiments? No. This is because these works are important to our survival and we are left with no choice than to use them.",
        "Summarily, although exploiting animals is debateable, and some think that due to its merits it should be encourage. However, others oppose it. In some cases, it is inevitable to do without using animals this could be for research or food purposes and therefore it should be exploited only when there are no other options."
