        "Some people think that only governments or large corporations can improve the environment while individuals cannot. I am afraid that I cannot agree with this thought. The role of individuals is as important as governments and companies.",
        "Firstly, one person may not have adequate influence but people around the world taking the same action will definitely create a large impact on the environment. If one person comes to plant a tree in an abandon piece of land, nothing may happen. Nevertheless, if all citizens of that city plant their own trees beside the first tree, there will be a garden, or even a forest showing up. It is undeniable that more forests are covered in the world is a good prospect, because they will enhance the air quality to a great extent.",
        "Secondly, efforts to improve the environment do not need much money or complex technology to carry out. Nurturing simple but frequent good habits can change the world remarkably. Indeed, daily actions like saving water, saving electricity, using less paper, using environment-friendly or organic products as alternatives for plastic ones can contribute to prevent the deforestation or unstable urbanization. The more trees and wild animals are kept alive, the better the mother nature becomes.",
        "In conclusion, to make the environment better, that is not the task of only large companies or governments, but it is also the responsibility of each individuals living in this planet."
