        "Improvements in health, education and trade are essential for the development of poorer nations. However, the governments of wealthier countries should take more responsibility for helping the underdeveloped nations in such areas.",
        "Developing and Industrialised countries have divided today\u2019s world, where the main difference between them is the amount of money that governments apply in vital sectors such as education, health and commerce. Because of unbalanced finance, most of the poorer countries buried in debts, which reflects in reduced health care, an unstructured education system and weak international trade. This vicious cycle will continue indefinitely unless wealthier nations show interest in minimising the worldwide economic differences, as well as taking more responsibility for assisting less fortunate countries.",
        "Most of the African countries live in inhuman conditions because of the extreme poverty, upheaval, hunger, disease, unemployment, lack of education and both inexperienced and corrupt administrations. The devastating consequences of the AIDS epidemic in those countries could improve if the infected population were to receive free drugs to control the disease, have access to health professionals and get information on how to prevent its spread. But this can only be achieved through international help programs in which leaders of the world\u2019s wealthiest countries donate medicine and send doctors and nurses to treat and educate those in need.",
        "Moreover, most of the developing countries rely on selling agricultural products and raw materials to rich nations and buying industrialised products from them, resulting in a substantial financial deficit. Consequently, they borrow a significant amount of money from the World Bank to try to improve their broken economies, but sometimes the money disappears with no significant changes, and they cannot even pay the interest to the bank. Regarding this issue, the G8, comprised of leaders of the eight most prosperous nations, decided to forgive billions of dollars\u2019 worth of debt owed by the world\u2019s poorest nations. Besides, they developed adequate loan programs to assist those countries financially.",
        "In conclusion, leaders of the industrialised countries play an indispensable role in assisting developing nations in dealing with essential areas such as health, education and trade. Also, their aid is the key to breaking the vicious cycle, which results in poverty and death."
