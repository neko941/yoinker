        "These days travelling on airlines take a wide range from our discussion. Some people think travelling with a cheap airline best than travelling on a normal one. The others believe the normal one is better. This  essay will discuss both  views and will draw down my point of view.",
        "On one hand, say that when  travel on the cheapest one will give them chance to go anywhere easily and they will be able to travelling and  save money more.Forever, That gives people saving money and helps business to grow up it is very important to the economy and they can travel more that means extra jobs , destinations. It will save time also. The opposite think that is very bad for the earth and more exhausting and causes problems for our environment. No more efficiency.",
        "On other hand, people think travelling on expensive airlines argue that save our planet we can tolive save. They trust  these companies Saudia airlines instant. It does not use second-hand spare parts. However, that does not give us 100 % airline accidents. Good quality parts and standards are very important and it gives significant decisions to choose which way to travel.",
        "In my opinion, More airlines company makes our lives better.But we have to follow particular standards. For example. Observing the quality of operation and setting a limit for engines. Arrange a system to lead these organisations in the best way. To be active in this field."
