        "In recent years, the one of the hugest threats to our environment are global warming. In my point of aspect, I will give reasons and keys to this issue below.",
        "Let\u2019s begin by looking at the causes of the argument. These days, many people, animals and their habitat to are undergoing from different global warmings because people throw much amount of variety trash every day to sea and river as a result of a fishes and other ocean species are dying. Nowadays, the forest is being as a cause of heat weather and especially when people go to forest for travelling and having a rest from a habitat, they light fire and at night and at the finish trip they forget to put out the fire as a result of forest will bury for example, approximately six moths ago was forest fire in continent Australia because there is heater weather. Following that, as I said above one of the largest continent is Africa, there is being a lack of fresh water and people are drinking dirty water as reason of hot weather.",
        "Turning to the other side of the essay. Firstly, individuals must not allow to enter or having a rest to people in the forest. If someone enters to there, governments must impose a tax on them. Some people hurled variety of rubbish on water as a result of animals will die therefore individuals must alert them if it will be returned again, he should be sentenced to 15 days in jail.",
        "In conclusion, in my opinion if individuals will be responsible for them, it would be beneficial. Governments can not afford them as a consequence of they will return it again."
