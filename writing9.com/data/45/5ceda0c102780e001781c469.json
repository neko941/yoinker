        "Are we buying more stuff than we need? Recent research indicates that a large number of people who run into debt is because they have bought things that they cannot afford with its wages. The endless desire of buying unnecessary things is caused for many reasons and some solutions are mentionated below.",
        "To begin with, the trend nowadays is towards buying things on the internet even if people do not need or use them.In addition, thanks to technology and online stores hardly a week goes by without receiving a sales email of some important brand with incredible discounts that in physical stores are not given. As a result, people clic on the advertisement and end up buying something that they did not need it.",
        "But, where does this desire of buying more material things comes from? Many experts say that we are living faster than ever before.Paradoxically is we achive more then, we want more consequently, we buy more hence, we need to work more. It is never ending ,we are constantly having a vicious life. The more people have the more they lost focus .To begin to tackle this situation, individuals need to start taking some meditation courses ir order to be more aware of the situations lest take rush decisions when people see advertisements also, people should ask this question before buy something ,do i really need this? In this way people can start to be more conscious about the money they spend.For instance, in countries like India where meditation is taught in schools since early childhood are the ones where people only purchase stuffs with a real purpose of use.",
        "To sum up, excess material possesions do not enrich our lives.",
        "No marketer is pulling out our credit card at a register or clicling to ship.In fact buying things we do not need keep away people from being who they really are, meditation is highly need it so as to open our concious and spent money on what they need."
