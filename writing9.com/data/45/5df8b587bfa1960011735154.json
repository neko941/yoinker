        "At the present time, college students prefer studying aboard in an increasing way. One major disadvantage of studying in a foreign country is the high cost of it, despite the disadvantages, a common advantage is the opportunity to accumulate more ideas about their culture. In my opinion, students are better off studying abroad although minor obstacles needs overcoming.",
        "Studying in a foreign country can lead to personal growth and exploring new cultures. To clarify, studying abroad gives university students the chance to get to know the world from a different perspective and discover fascinating  lifestyles. For instance, when I used to study in Lebanon I learned about their astonishing traditions and mouth watering salad called Tabouli. Overall, this challenging trip to adapt to a new culture is what help you grow as a person.",
        "One disadvantage of studying somewhere else is the cost of it. To put in another words, studying in your own country is far more inexpensive than pursuing your studies in a foreign country. For example, when I decided to study in Lebanon I compared the prices of the trip, hostility and the university and it appeared to be double the price of studying in my country. In short, if you are not looking forward to spend a great deal of money then you should stick to studying in your country.",
        "Myriad amount of university students chose to pursue their studies in a foreign country rather than their own country. Although studying abroad can get expensive, it can help a person grow spiritually and gain information about outside cultures. I believe that these challenging experiences is what makes studying abroad more beneficial."
