        "It is true that in some nations, the rates of crimes are decreased but people feel less safe as compared to the past.

For instance, a few days ago, some individuals spread news about the bomb blast in Karachi but that is fake news. The main purpose of illegal news is to earn profits to attract people attention. Furthermore, the cause of people's fear is the speedy traffic of cars, buses and vans. To explain it, according to research, people loss their life due to road accidents. It is also the main cause of public unsecured.",

Therefore, this country has a low rate of traffic accidents around 7%. Furthermore, the government should pre-check social media posts and take action about this fake news. Hence, the crime rates and people fear about society will be reduced.",
        "In conclusion, people feel unsafe as compared to the past. This essay discussed how fears are often caused by fake news and fast-moving traffic on roads. This essay also suggested that the solutions to these problems are twofold: to manage a better infrastructure of roads and monitor social media apps."
