        "A common debate in today's society is wheter governments should invest moneys in the arts, building theatres and museums and and organizing events, or not. I am of the opinion that if a country has the economic possibilities it should definitely invest some moneys on the arts. It's a different situation if it's still a developing country without basic services.",
        "Art should have a role into the like of everyone and the governments have the duty to make it possible where feasible. Art should be considered a form ongoing education that doesn't finish with school and should be therefore considered in investment plans. There is a study that shows how much is it important for the well being of individuals since going to a concerto once a week improves not only mental health, but phisycal health too.",
        "A second more pratical reason why i think governments should invest in arts it's because in doing so they can actually gain back even more moneys. This is of course in small part thanks to the seeling of the tickets, but on a larger scale a town with many artistic events attracts more tourists that will enrich the overall economy.",
        "However, this is true only for developed and rich coutries. Poorer countries must first make sure to invest enough in public health and basic education. Without these two things it would make no sense to invest in arts, people in bad conditions would not go ad would not appreciate it.",
        "In conclusion, I think that when health and education are guaranteed, governments should have as a priority to invest in arts in order to improve people's lives."
