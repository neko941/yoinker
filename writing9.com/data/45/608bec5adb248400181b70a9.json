        "Most of the countries around the world, in general, used to examine the students via the end of every semester formal tests. Most of the universities and other education institutes believe that having the exams at the end of each semester will allow the students to study the subjects thoroughly and also provide more opportunity to engage with the teachers or lectures. However, these institutes can also conduct subject base evaluations, group assessments, or workshops as an alternative for the students.",
        "Allowing enough time for the students to learn on the subject and allowing them to get feedback from the teachers is very important. Because the students will be able to do self-studies and discuss their doughts and opinion with the lecture. As an example, most of the lectures can not cover every little information on a subject. There are some parts the students should learn by them selfs. Also, the students can share their opinion and findings with the teacher in private sessions before the semester-end exams and the students will be confident and ready for the examinations. Therefore, having the evaluation exam at the end of the semester will allow the students to widen their knowledge before the test.",
        "Despite the popularity of these semesters, it will be always beneficial for the students to have a subject base evaluation and group assessments. This will allow the students to know the subjects or the topics from top to bottom and having group assessments or work-shops will allow them to apply the information learned into a practical scenario. As an example, providing them tasks and allowing them to conduct presentations will highly beneficial for their career as well. Due to these reasons and many others, it will be a wise idea to conduct assessments topic-based and also conduct regular workshops.",
        "Universities and other teaching institutes in most countries assess their students using exams at the end of each semester. As explained earlier, this will allow the students to spend more time on self-studies and researchers as well as the chance to interact with teachers for their feedback. Despite the widespread usage of these formal examinations, it will be vital for the student to have a topic or subject-based monthly evaluation and regular workshops."
