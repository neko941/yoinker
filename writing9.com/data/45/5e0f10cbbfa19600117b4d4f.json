        "Gone are the days, when the less dimension of population influence on environment. Not only that, it was noticed that climate change does not affected towards disasters situations. But, however, at present tables have turned. Nowadays, the increasing numbers of populations have demonstrated various factors in pollution and seasonal effects such as natural disaster or global warming.",
        "One of the most convincing reason I have in this regard is that usage of plastic bags are really harmful on each places of earth. Whilst, people should be contemporary reduced the plastic and control the phenomenonal problems. Likewise, waste materials are accumulated into the rivers and lakes in some places as water bottles, plastic bags and polythene. As a result, the environment can be destroyed drastically. For instance, it has been an unsual perception that prohibition of plastic utilisation may be an implement to keep environmental more greener and save for future also.",
        "On the other hand, my inclination is also supported by the axiom is that government and large companies are responsible to improve the environment. As a matter of fact, large companies are manufacturing eco- friendly products which does not harm the societies as well as effectiveness toward environment. Consequently, this outcome have also revealed the fact that large companies can make an difference to improve the natural world. In some countries the politics have discussed on environmental protection to government. Nowadays, in some developing countries the governments have succeeded to find the alternative sources of plastic waste.",
        "In nutshell, my concern has revealed the fact that government and large organisations influence, the situation would not improve the environment without human action. In this foreseeable future, the individuals can protect and save our planet."
