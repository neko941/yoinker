        "In this generation were pace of globalization is quickening, Communicating is made easier by letters,e-mails or telephone calls. However, I believe that personal communication is still the best way in communicating with other people because of it's positive impacts towards the well being of people.",
        "Interpersonal interaction is essential for every human being for them to have a well developed social skills. For instance, as a child some are sent in formal school not only to acquire knowledge from teachers but also to have interaction with their other classmates. Talking with their classmates face to face will strengthen their bond. It will help them deal with other people. For example, they will learn that being generous and kind will bring them more friends. Therefore, this prepares them for their future relationships towards their colleages.",
        "Another effect if discussion of  one's thoughts, disappointments and dreams are done personally would be sense of belonginness. That leads to alleviance with isolation and depression. Communication can also be done by observing. Example for that are body language such as shrugging of shoulders,pouting and many other gestures and facial expression. This is for better understanding towards the person we talk to.",
        "In conclusion, people invented many alternatives for communication, but nothing beats the same old style our ancestors did for this past decades of human existence in this world, which is face to face communication."
