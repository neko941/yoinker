        "In the present world, the field of science is getting wider and expanded remarkably untill today, so that Researchers have already demonstrated some progress in indentifying human traits On genes according to their ancestors gene respectively. Therefore this is concerned as a debatable matter whether characteristics of people acquired genetically has a great impact or experience gained in life. I opine the idea of lifetime experience which has totally major impact on individual's development.",
        "On the one hand, scientists observed people's inherent traits and examined them according to their gene respectively. Reporters defined such Hereditery characteristics transmits from gene to gene and shares a some sort of information that in future shapes personality and appearance naturally. For instance dwarf couple can be observed here, people can become a witness of their identical body in future as well as they usually be as dwarf again. In fact, they present their emotions and behaviour similarly as they are peas in a pod, by feeling anger, and sensitivity at the same time, in addition they feel such feelings as innate. Initially, it proves the idea of  real impact on personality and development is considerable.",
        "On the other hand, most observations support the view of greater influence by Lifetime experience. In fact, people learn from life unstoppably, they often tent to change their mind and make a conclusion from tricky situations. For example my friend was extremely introvert one, he went to overseas to work and study so that he had to live in host family. It is obvious that the active interaction is required to live in this environment. In a result, it opine that innate characteristics can possibly altered as required by surrounding environment. Moreover one's progess depends on his or her own hard work and dedication.",
        "Hence, the life of individual has positive and negative effects on his/her personality as well as inborn characteristics. However i opine mainly the point that outlook and appearance can be acquired but not the personality. Because, clearly mentioned above that lifetime circumstances show a major influence on our ability to cope with our tricky matters to succeed in life."
