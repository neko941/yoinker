        "At the same time, internet has too many risks. There are a lot of new social media platforms that allow us to connect with friends as well as with strangers. Youngsters are unaware of the such traps and end up conversing with outsiders who take advantage of it and mislead them.",
        "In the recent times, there are a lot of cases being booked where there are frauds who socilaise online and lure kids and later assault them physically or blackmail them and mentally harass children. For example, many teens are involved in such cases and are subject to being sexually exploited and threatened to expose them.",
        "Parents should have a watch over what are the sites that are being accessed by their children, the kind of people they talk to, etc. Communication and transparency is the key to dealing with this. Having a friendly conversation with kids these days is essential in order to supervise them.",
        "If parents are too rigid with adolescents, they go astray and become prey to such dangers lurking around them.",
        "Hence it is of great importance to handle this by giving limited access to media, internet and at the same time ensuring to monitor the activities of children.",
        "Internet can be used in a good way, misuse of the same would lead us to face unimaginable consequences. So it is advisable to guide children on the usage of the internet."
