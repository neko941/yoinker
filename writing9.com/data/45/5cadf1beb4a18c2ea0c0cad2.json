        "The statement makes a point that since the invention of the automobiles, number of vehicles have increased to a great extent. The solution is to figure out other forms of transportation and form laws about ownership and usage of personal vehicles . This essay agrees with the argument because it will solve traffic issues, help to reduce global warming and make citizens healthier.",
        "Firstly, every house has atleast one automobile owned and this increases the amount of cars and scooters on roads leading to hour long traffics. Changes mentioned in the statement will clearly solve traffic problems faced by every individual. Lesser the number of cars, lesser the congestion. For example, public transportation such metro trains with low fees costs encourages people to not use personal automobile and instead use public transportation.",
        "Secondly, it will help in solving global warming issues. Due to burning great amount of fuel, the temperature of earth is increasing on a daily basis. If the changes in law and transportation forms are brought, then it will help to save the  world from global warming.",
        "Lastly, now a days individual prefer not to walk but to use their two or four wheelers to travel short distances making them lazy. This will encourage public  to walk for short destinations and not rush through using their two-wheelers. It will give them a good exercise and a healthy heart.",
        "To conclude, reformation of strict laws on cars and scooters owned by public and brainstorming new ways of travelling can bring about major changes in solving traffic problems, cut down global warming and reduce unhealthiness in the public."
