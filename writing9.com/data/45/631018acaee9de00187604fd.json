I'm writing this letter to inform you that the noise you have been making is beyond just loud especially in the night time. I have been having hard time sleeping because of the massive sound. I have a job where I have to wake up early in the morning meaning that It is very important for me to go to bed earlier than most of the other people. I understand you and your co-workers work hard to get the office done but would you please lower the noise after 10 pm? I know you guys start working around noon every day but can you consider start off eariler from now on so that you can finish it earlier. That way, it won't affect the timeline that you have.",
