        "It\u2019s often said that, learning multiple language has always been best for a child, it builds a new character and children can get an exposure about the new culture by learning their linguistic. It has proven that many people believes that a children should learn a foreign language in primary school in place of secondary school. This Essay will talk about the advantages and disadvantages of learning foreign language in primary school is an essential part or not.",
        "In regard of the disadvantages, while learning a foreign language in primary school students can underperform their vital subjects like Math\u2019s and Science which are more important to improve their academics score and job security in future, whereas every child should understand their native language first than any other languages, for instance an English native speaking student is also learning French and while learning the foreign language they are losing their command on English and making multiple grammatical errors while writing and speaking as well. Children first expertise their native language first and then should go for the foreign language.",
        "On the other hand, there are lots of benefits of learning multiple languages in primary school, like in primary school children are very eager to learn new things and adapt new habits, and at this stage if they will get a chance to learn a foreign language it will benefit their communication skills and build their character. Learning foreign language can also provide various new information about the related country, like when I was learning French, I got to know about how beautiful country France is and it also gives me the exposure of France culture. Learning foreign linguistic will always help a child to learn not just language but also the other traditions.",
        "By Concluding this essay, I would prefer a children should learn foreign language in there primary school because there is lots of advantages in it."
