        "I am witing this letter to you, to request a kind favour in my project. I am visiting london next month with my friends and plan to visit london library for my research purpose. I have reviewed some great journals that are available at the library, those would be a great hand in my project. Mentioning the project I am researching on, is to study the antioxidant properties of root exudates.",
        "Let me give you the background of my study, I am persuing my masters in chemistry. The books and journals I need to scan encodes the medicinal properties of plants without their destruction. However, there are several guidelines available online but either I dont have access to them or they are not completely avaible to be reviewed.",
        "Futhermore, I would need to reach the computer present at the library so that I can get research those articles that require a registeration, and libraries have those registeration iD's. To do the literature review of my research project, i will have to study both hard and soft copies of books and journals relevant to my study.",
