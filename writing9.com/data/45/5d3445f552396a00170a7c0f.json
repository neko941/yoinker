        "Education is nothing but knowledge. Gathering knowledge with learning vast variety of skills then people become more intellegent. However, since ancient period reading, writing and mathematics are only plays vital role in academics. Although, debat says that computer knowledge is important for this comtemporary era and it should added as fourth skill to education. I partially agree with this debat. The following paraghaps gives brief idea before a valuble sum up.",
        "For education system, many people argue that computer knowledge is significate. In my opinion, i think this is a good argument because in this modern era we cannot servive without a knowledge of computer. Indeed, this situation is not only in a private sector but also in public sectors. In every corner of world priory of computer escalationg dramitically. To illustrate, a recent study conducted by indian government says that less than half percentage of people were not aware of computer. For this impact they conducted awarness classes and also government provided free computer knowledge who are in needy. If this skill added to academics is benfical for teenagers and they can save time and money for later on.",
        "On contrary, this old type of education such as reading, writing and mathematics can improve cognitive ablities in children. If children adopt calculator for maths and for writiing they install  apps like grammarly then they lose their cognitive skills. So, such type of skills should not be encouraged in schools. This cognitive ablities are important in competitive type of tests.",
        "In conclusion, reading, writing and maths are plays vital role in education system which they improves cogntive abilites. However, computer skill should be added to academics because it",
        "Is a upgrading to future generation."
