        "In the world today, there has been a widespread controversy that some skills are inborn  such as games and music while  others think same ability can be put into practice well when the teaching is passed to an individual. This essay will discuss the two viewpoint and my personal opinion will be drawn.",
        "On the one hand, supporters of this view claim that enthusiasm shown towards music at a tender age could depict an innate attribute in a child. For instance, at the sound of music, some infant stops crying and tried to make a dance movement at the same time. Also few youngsters skills in kicking an object despite non prior knowledge. This may be due to their inborn talent for sports.",
        "On the other hand, opponent of this notion allude that, knowledge are Practicable and not necessarily inborn. The reason is that when children are being taught a skill such as music or game, there is tendency the will act on it. In addition, learned knowledge can be likened to being gifed. This is due to the expertise shown at the acquired attribute being taught. For example, an African man with no former knowledge was taught football skill by his uncle, he then later become a professional at it and famous as well.",
        "In my opinion, talent can be an inborn personalities for some people while others can learn the same skill, develop it and become an expert at it.",
        "In conclusion, this essay discussed the two perspectives of people that, some gift can be learned due to the fact that learning can be practiced and knowledged passed can become an act of expertise. However, some ability and expertise can be born with an individual due to few traits shown during infancy period.",
