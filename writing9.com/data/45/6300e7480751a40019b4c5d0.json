        "Nowadays,  the events of celebrities become the famous and the tag that attract every ages of people. Someone believe the trend of the media pay much attention to the life of celebrities is good. In other hand, people suggest the media should spend more time to report the lives of ordinary people. Personally, I think the events of ordinary people are more important than celebrities\u2019 events.",
        "In recent years, there are more issue appearing in the society which catch human's attraction. It is certainly true that young people will be influence by those bad events which come from celebrities. For example, people get new on the internet or other media.They must get some information about actors, singers or footballs.However, the event which is not good will give young people negative energy. And young people maybe will learn what famous person do. The example describe a very clear example",
        "that will happen.",
        "The main argument I also against of is that reporting the life of ordinary\tpeople that is the country need. The reason of this argument is people should live in the world of their daily life but not to copy what life like to live. It just Means people should know moe daily news in the society which they live. For instance, people should remember how to be an excellent residents in the country and observe what happened around them. Those are what people do not interest in and lack of. But it is necessities. Consequently, I support the media should spent more time on the lives of normal person.",
        "All in all, it is a best choice to pay more attention to the lives and relationships of stars in very pat f the world.The information of them is more and more appear. What I believe is that people live for their own but not for the celebrities so that need to get the informations of what will happen in society and daily."
