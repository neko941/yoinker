        "It is now controversial whether students should only take up beneficial courses such as science and technology which will become essential later in life or they should be allowed to follow careers that they crave for. In this essay, the consequences of learning only versatile majors will be discussed while putting forward my point of view on this contention.",
        "On the one hand, there is no doubt that science and technology courses will become useful indeed. Firstly, this is because those two subjects make up our core knowledge since almost everything is dependent on them. Therefore, the more students acquire that knowledge, the more help the world will receive and needless to say, the better future will be built up.",
        "Secondly, students need not worry about their career as IT development is irreversible. This means that acquiring science-related or technology-related skills can grant students to have a plum job with enticing salary because IT field is advancing with unbelievable speed without pausing.",
        "On the other hand, the repercussions of this idea should also be taken into consideration. First of all, other majors have their own merits as well. For instance, if history became a dead subject due to this idea, nobody can assure that humans will not loop the same blunt again in the future since there will be nothing we can look back to.",
        "Another major matter that we should consider is a student well-being. Different people have different hobbies and interests so that although parents forcefully choose trending subjects on behalf of their children, this does not necessarily mean that they will become successful. Moreover, in the worst case, they will be stressful and cannot fully enjoy their university life which we cannot get for a second time.",
        "In conclusion, I personally believe that increase in the number of professionals in the fields of science and technology can result in construction of a road to better future as other majors are of little benefit to human race. Therefore, emphasis must be on those core subjects so that humans are granted a harmonious world."
