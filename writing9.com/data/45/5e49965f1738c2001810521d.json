        "Nowadays there is a sudden and steep rise in the number of commercials that we come across. Clearly, products like toys and eatables target on impressing kids to make them their customers. In this essay we will discuss on the ill effects of these advertisements on the kids and their families.",
        "Firstly, the major problem caused by this marketting strategy that specifically focuses on kids is degradation of their mental and physical health. Obviously, most of these eatables are not healthy or organic but junk food. Although parents tend to keep this away from their toddlers, they can\u2019t help much when kids are persistent to get it. In addition to this, children easily get distracted by these products. Besides, small ones cannot take a decision based on the nutrition values or overall benefits of a product. Instead, they are merely attracted by the packaging, colors and other mere marketting aspects of the item.",
        "To illustrate, consider a platform like youtube with lot\u2019s of content for young generation. Depending on the content that is viewed on, advertisements targetting that audience is played inbetween the media. Without a doubt, this distracts our children leading to choosing things without thinking about the real benefits.",
        "To summarize, contents targetting kids and weaker section of the public who tend to decide without full knowledge of any product is not a fair strategy. I believe developing neutral content to present new features and options available for people to choose from would be a good commercial."
