        "It is often claimed that history has an essential role in our life while people are only concentrating on current scenarios. According to my opinion, our ancestors travelled and experienced several critical situations and provide viable remedies to confront the challenges.",
        "To begin with, a section of society believes that today's life is entirely different from that outdated past. Moreover, no similarities in their standard of living.

As a result, following grandparents' rules in new areas make an adverse effect.",

In addition, in the past, people are supposed to be trusted at any time. I believe, that trust and genuineness are the foremost lessons we should learn from our formers.",
