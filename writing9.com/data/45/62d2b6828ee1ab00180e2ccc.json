        "Language has played a very vital role in Human Civilization. The world has more languages than the number of countries, mainly due to several different culutures and communities existing over the past few centuries. However, it is seen that some languages are on the verge of extinction due to not many people speaking it. In my opinion, it is a very negative thing as it also manifests death of the culture associated to it.",
        "India is the most diverse country in the world, where its population uses more than 1000 languages. Though India comprises of 29 states, there are more number of languages spoken as their origins go to many different civilizations born here. One of the world's oldest language 'sanskrit' originated in India, however it is losing focus as it is not being spoken by a lot of Indians nor taught by most of the schools of India. Similarly, there are other languages such as \"Persian\", etc which are also near extinction as they are not being widely used. Moreover, some tribes in India have their own dialects however due to migration and development such tribes are disappearing and so is their language.",
        "After the british colonization, in India and most of parts of the world, English became the most dominated medium of communication between societies. Moreover, most schools in India and world over started making English as a mandatory and primary language.According to me, this is one of the biggest reasons that local dialects are dying.",
        "Additionally, i think with the development of the nation, there has been a great migration of people from rural sides to the urban cities. I sight, this as also one of the reasons, as to why people not able to use their mother tongue as they migrated to different cities for employment purposes. With their language losing importance, the string associated to their culture is also getting weaker and weaker.",
        "Finally, i would like to conclude that language have originated as part of societal development of cultures and communities. However, with migration and large scale use of english language, i feel it is not just the language which is losing importance but slowly the cultures associated to them are also dying."
