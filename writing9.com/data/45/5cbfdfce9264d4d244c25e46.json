        "The government has funded the arts, and many consider this a misuse of money, which should be invested in more significant causes. In my opinion,  investing in the arts is not a waste of money as the government is responsible for financially supporting all sectors of society.",
        "Some people underestimate the arts because they do not generate as much income as other fields such as chemistry and mathematics. The majority of artists tells that their parents were against when they decided to pursue a career in the arts industry. One of the most common argument to convince children to change their minds is that they would work for free and consequently face famine.",
        "However, It is impossible to imagine our world without art and creativity. It has been among us since the cave age when the first human being registered their daily activities and rituals on the rocks which are strong evidence that the arts are an asset in our society despite all prejudice surrounding them. Art is not only a way to record facts but also captivate emotions which can be transmitted to others across the time and cultures embellished with the power to inspire and change people lives.",
        "In conclusion, It is clear that art plays a significant role in society and is crucial for the wellbeing of humanity. If the artists' salary is not enough to live on, they need subsidies to keep working. For this reason, the arts deserve to be supported by governments."
