This belief in oneself will ultimately make them a better a conversater, which in turn will improve all aspects of their relationships be them at work or personal. A research undergone in 2003 at Belfast university showed this point in a population of office workers. Results from this study found that employees who held a certificate in vocal presenting to an audience, were three times more likely to be rated as confident by their peers in a survey.",
        "Most schools do not have a formal way of teaching public speaking, as it is not a part of the curriculum in England. ,Nevertheless it is proven that institutions which voluntarily choose to implement verbal coaching for pupils, often always see a strong correlation in speaking skills and better performance in core subjects in the syllabus. Leading to a more active school community, in addition to improved numbers of university offers for the youth.",
