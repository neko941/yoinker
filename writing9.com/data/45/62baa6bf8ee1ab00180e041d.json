        "Nowadays, students have a lot opportunities to choose where to study the courses. Some students want to learn the classes from home, but other think that learning from home will get less benefit from studying at school. This statement will clarify the both thoughts and show my opinion.",
        "On the one hand, study from home will makes students get more comfortable because they are in their comfortable zone. In addition, it will less the stress from the students. For example, some children have stress from teachers and some classes that they are not understand. However, students could pay less attention from classes because they can play games or watch video from internet while the teachers are teaching. Furthermore, they can cheats the exam during the test.",
        "On the other hand, learn from school is a good opportunities for students. They will get to know their friends and will get to learn there passive skill that school did not teach. Moreover, study onsite will give benefit than study online because when the students do not understand in the class, the teaches can clarify what they do no understand. According to the scientist, they said \" study onsite is better than study online because it will make student enjoy about school and less the stress that students have.\"",
        "In my opinion, I totally agree that attending to classes at collage will give more benefit to the students more than study online. From experience, I had to learn at home because of the Coronavirus, But it turns out not as good as I expected, I do not get to see my friends and teachers. In this situation told me that learning at school is fun and more enjoy than study online."
