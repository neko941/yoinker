        "When we say film the first thing in our mind is Hollywood and expensive film production. Every time when new film is presented one of important information about movie is how much it cost and  the secound one which actors have been acted. Of course, some actors are more expensive then others and it is important things for movies lovers. Some movies are popular just because of actors. If public hear that Bred Pitt acted in some film it is pretty sure that the movie will be successful and expensive also.",
        "Does expensive movie mean  successful movie? I think it is not the rule. There are many films recorded in one room and with just two actors and it had strong influence on public and got award on film festivals. Sometimes, success is  just because of original story or because it is about current topic in global society.",
        "The success of a movie depend on many factors. In my opinion story and the way of story telling is rhe most important factor. For example, there are movies with great idea and story but during the movie people lose motivation to watch it. It happened that the end of movie is meaningless and people were disappointed. In that case, it looks like producer hurried to finish the movie. Movies based on true story are interesting because public have in mind that it really happened and it can increase art effect.  New indian film \u201cPihu\u201d is movie about little girl, 2 years old,  which stayed alone at home with her dead mother. Public assessed this movie as the most stressful in modern society and it is recorded in one apartment with two actors. Also, the little girl was not famous actor but on the other side it was a big challenge to work with kid and gain sense of true story. People want to know details about life of famous persons. In that case, most of people is interesting for movies about famous politicians, actors, singers, and so on. \u201cBohemian rhapsody\u201d is popular movie because it is story about interesting way of living of Freddie Mercury.",
        "So, making movie is really art and it doesn\u2019t depend just on money.  It is wide story about talent, originality and creativity."
