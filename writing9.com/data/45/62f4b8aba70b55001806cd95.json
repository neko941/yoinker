        "Globalization is one of the processes to increase  business productivity. In the last few decades, globalization has strengthened and many countries like India came to foreign states. In this ,process global accent also plays a vital role in the development of businesses. This essay will illustrate the importance of English as a global accent in the globalization process.",
        "On the one side, English is the most used language around the world. Many communities use English as their accent for communication purposes. To develop the business, the technology, etc proper communication is important. Most countries around the world prefer English as their second language. For instance, in India English is the second language along with Hindi language.",
        "On the other hand, Even though Hindi is the common language and prominent in India, it will not replace the English language. In Globalization, telecommunication also plays a vital role in the nation. In this conversion process, English have its prominence to develop the business.",
        "In my opinion, I think English plays a crucial role and it is necessary for better communication. To sum up, Globalization has a global language as English."
