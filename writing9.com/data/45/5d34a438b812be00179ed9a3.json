        "Nowadays, two school of thoughts are present in the society regarding education system. Some are of the notion that gender specific schools are more beneficial for adolescence as it allows to focus on study and avoids harmful activities. On the other hand, a group of people argue on the favour of co-education considering the competitive environment it offers and the scope to become respectful to opposite gender. In this essay I will depict both the views and will point out my personal opinion as I recapitulate.",
        "To begin with, people who believe in separate schooling mostly advocate this system as effective way to grasp the student\u2019s focus. By this I am referring to the fact that young generation tend follow the study materials and teacher\u2019s command attentively when there is no other distraction from opposite gender. A recent study has shown that parents who prefers boys or girls only institutes marked concentration to academic activities as the key reason behind preferring it over co-education.",
        "Another reason is that, parents often like single gender campus because of safety. They fear that female students may get harassed by the male classmates, or even there can be chaotic situation between male and female group if they do not bond well. For example, a feature in The Guardian has mentioned that young boys are usually naughtier than the girls which may cause unhealthy situation in campuses unless it has been taken care by school authority.",
        "On the other hand, mixed schooling allows student to be competitive. To elaborate, by natural instinct most of them study harder to achieve better result than the opposite gender. This healthy competition prepares them for the professional life where both the gender will work hand in hand. A survey from Harvard University has shown that pupil study 20 times more in co-ed environment due to challenge they feel from opposite gender.",
        "In addition to that, when everyone studies together, they learn to respect each other. To be precise, studying in co-education allows one to be more respectful and resistant to opposite gender. Students do not only become conscious about gender equality, women right etc, but also grow empathy for gender related issues as they build friendship with opposite gender from the early stage of their life. For example; people with co-education background are often found to be more open minded towards opposite gender.",
        "To conclude, there are some pros for both the education system, single gender schooling and for co-education. However, my personal opinion would go for mixed schooling as the feeling of competition and practicing to respect each other help the young mind in a broader way."
