        "In recent years, Fatness are becoming more problem all over the world. Many say that junk food ads is the only reason for causing this problem. Other argue by saying that advertising is not the main cause for the problem. People can control their obesity by do some exercise and eat limited junk food.",
        "First of all, sometimes people sell their bad foods through food advertising with some known person, which effected general people. For example,  Food and beverage company or any restaurant are advertising their foods with any celebrities. As a result, those who follow this celebrities, they will generally buy that foods. Apart from this, restaurants are gave food offer through advertisement, for instance, popular offer buy 1 burger get 1 burger free. This type  of offer people do want to miss. They usually take 2 burger and than get 2 extra, which total 4 burger. Thus, food company are attractive people through advertisement.",
        "On the other hand, people can loose their obesity by doing some exercise or eating less amount of junk food. For examples, people can keep their body fit with regular exercise, which not only reduce fatness but also make their people life easier. Apart from this, People can eat low amount of food.
