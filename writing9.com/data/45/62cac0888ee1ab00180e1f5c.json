        "There is a significant rise in number of undergraduates those who are studying in the other part of the world for their higher education.Although there will be a cultural,communal hindrance while abroad,they will get better career opportunities that will help in their future growth.In my opinion the students should prefer to study in abroad inspite of the troubles and challenges that they will experience inevitably.",
        "First of all, The crucial benefit is the they will get a chance to live in a new culture , atmosphere and socialising with the new people .On top of that,they will get exposed to foreign language and they should learn that inevitably.Because,when they live in a better environment ,students can build their determined path with conscience .For instance,when i lived in a country called germany for my undergraduation,I met so many students from different parts of the world .Not only it helped me in learning various types of cultures,traditions but also in choosing better path to excel in my career.",
        "By adapting to new cultures and language it helps you to grow as an intellectual person.",
        "On the other hand,The major disadvantage the students should face is the lingustic,communicational barriers.Additionally it will be expensive to study in abroad.Because ,It is not possible to afford such huge amount of money for middle-class families.In addition with ,Without knowing their language it is impossible to build good communication bridge with them.For exmaple,When i was in germany i had to learn german language inorder to communicate with them  smoothly and fluently.Often times i have felt low self-esteem to speak with them in their native langauge.",
        "Long back,The students used to finish their education from their own country.From the past few years, We are witnessing a huge increase in the number of outgoing students for their higher education.Although it is costly to go abroad,but it will be benefical for their career growth.I believe that to get educated in abroad helps in building of self-esteem in the student while abroad,student should face the challenges inevitably."
