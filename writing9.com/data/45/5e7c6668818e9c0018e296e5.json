Second, \u201cUp scaling of pro poor rattan/bamboo value chai development for women and the ethnic minorities\u201d action aims to enhance the livelihoods of ethnic and poor people through scaling up value added rattan and bamboo value chain, and in which VIRI worked as a co-applicant. VIRI also focused on reducing child labour in Vietnam with project \u201cEnhancing national capacity to prevent and reduce child labour in Vietnam (ENHANCE)\u201d, the main objectives is implement direct livelihood interventions in Hanoi with the main outcomes include: IO1: Livelihoods of targeted households will be enhanced through an improvement of their family business; IO 2: Knowledge and awareness of child labour and its related national and international laws and capacity to address the issue will be strengthened among targeted households and local businesses. Additionally, VIRI proposed \u201cInternational One Village One Product Alliance (IOVOP)\u201d Initiative with vision is to achieve overall improvements in local economic activities and people\u2019s welfare through global alliance and sustainable community empowerment. IOVOP official slogan is \u201cGlobal connections for local impact\u201d. \r2.\tAbout CCS CCS is also an organization focused on promoting sustainable developments in Vietnam. Firstly, Action \u201cPilot application for Small and Medium Sized Enterprises (MSMEs) in Vietnam to undertake a pilot application of the eco-innovation methodology in MSMEs\u201d targets to integrate sustainability and innovation into MSMEs business strategy, follow each of the steps described in the UNEP eco-innovation manual to assess the market suitability for eco-innovation, identify main challenges and opportunities, create awareness about eco-innovation and interest and engage a sufficient number of MSMEs so that the eco-innovation methodology is implemented to produce case study results from the pilot application in at least 5 engaged MSMEs. In addition, CCS coordinated in \u201cProtecting Local environment and promoting sustainable livelihood for farmers in Cu Khoi guava cultivation area through the application of advance high-efficiency batch residential biomass gasifiers and the Product-Service System\u201d to showcase the feasibility and up-scalability of adopting biomass gasification househoud cookstoves and turning waste disposal of guava farms in Cu Khoi into cooking fuel. Moreover, CCS worked as contractor in \u201cPilot the Product-Service System (PSS) of continuous biomass gasification for household tea-processing in Dinh Hoa district, Thai Nguyen province\u201d in which the main objectives is to pilot and optimise the PSS of continuous biomass gasification as on-site renewable energy solution for tea-processing in Dinh Hoa district, Thai Nguyen province; adapt the gasification equipment design to local mechanical capacity; support saw mills and furniture producers  in biomass residue treatment to fuel for gasification. CCS served as an affiliated entity in \u201cApplying zero-waste pressurized bamboo treatment  technology into production of high-end bamboo floor and furniture\u201d with targets is to increase the productivity and quality of bamboo after treating with zero-waste pressurized equipment system, as well as minimize production cost and utilise bamboo residues. Lastly, CCS also implemented project \u201cCampaigning for Vietnam: building capacity to maximize impacts of farming for biodiversity\u201d in which Conservation agriculture leaders inspire positive changes, individually at the site they are working and nationally as a team, through effective social marketing and behaviour change campaigns"
