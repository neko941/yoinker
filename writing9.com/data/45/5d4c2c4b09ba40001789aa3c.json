        "For some people, shopping is a crucial need, therefore, the method of shopping also counts, in this essay we're going to discuss one of these ways of purchase, which is online shopping, as well as getting a brief for its benefits and flaws.",
        "Why take a journey instead of clicking a button? nowadays the online shopping has saved both time and effort in order to buy something, by placing your order, making the payment and writing your address, everything can be done by using your computer while you're at home wearing your pajamas .. why bother going to the store, if the store can exist on your home computer screen.",
        "It's often said that easy come, easy go, in other words, can you guarantee that whatsoever order was placed will match your expectations?! The answer to that is obvious, it's impossible, moreover, there's a possibility that any sort of mistake can occur in the middle of the process, whether it's related to the size or the colour or even the selection of goods itself, that's why there's a flaw in buying something you didn't actually touch it.",
        "In conclusion, I'm personally convinced that as well as there's an ease in online shopping, there's a disadvantage as well, from one hand, you can place an order with no efforts, from the other hand there's no control of the outcome of this process."
