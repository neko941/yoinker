        "Some people concur that students should study in groups while the opponents of  this idea support self-discipline. While I believe that sometimes students should study alone, I argue that it is usually better when study in a group.",
        "On the one hand,  it cannot denied that self-education brings a large amount of advantages. The first benefit is self-studying helps people learn more effectively than just learning in schools. By exploring topics on their own, they will actively engage with new information. Self-learners are able to think about topic deeply and make connections between that they are learning, thus, they will remember it better. The second advantage is that students can learn at their own pace, whenever they desire and do not depend on others like learning in groups. To be specific, the learners do not have to rely on their friends\u2019 time, the attendance of groups\u2019 members, among other examples.",
        "On the other hand, many people argued that pupils could achieve more advantages in learning in groups. Firstly, students could discuss their ideas with others and point out good and worse perspectives from their opinions. This will force them consider more about their position and therefore, develop their critical thinking skills while helping them study. Secondly, by learning with friends, students can break their monotony. When people study alone, they tend to cram all new information, which makesthem stressful and not be a effective way. However, by learning from other members in their groups, they can learn a lot of  different lessons with less strain and efforts. Furthermore, cooperation can help procrastinators improve their time management skills because in a study group, students have to be present at a specific time and they are not able to postpone studying until the night or other days.",
        ".",
        "In conclusion, self-studying could guarantee the efficiency and increase in achievements more than just study in schools. However, students should consider group study for the most practical methods of their long-term development."
