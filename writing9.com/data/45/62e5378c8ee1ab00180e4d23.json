        "The world is currently entering the era of digital world. Most of the activities are carried out by the community through cell phones. So  cell phones consumption has increased significantly. However, it has a positive and negative impact on the lives of individuals.",
        "On the one hand, cell phones make life easier for doing  plenty of activities. For example, financial transactions can be done through mobile banking, including paying the order of online shopping. Time becomes more efficient because transactions do not require someone to come to the bank to transfers money. This can be seen where the growth of online shopping is more significant than offline shopping. First, buyers don't have to spend time on the road to hop from one store to another. Second, sellers enable to minimize budget because there is no need to rent a shop in a strategic area. Third, banks are also able to do resources efficiently because they do not need to provide a lot of resources for tellers.",
        "On the other hand, people become much more addicted while using a cellphone. From the subconscious, humans can directly hold cell phones when they wake up, work, or interact with other humans. This can be a distraction so that it will lead them less focused and reduce intimacy during interacting physically with others. In  research, cell phones can have negative impacts on mental health. An addiction  arises as same as addiction to illegal drugs and alcohol. This can cause brain changes that enable to lead to poor communication skills and excessive anxiety.",
        "Overall, the use of cell phones in this digital era has good impacts on the convenience of people in carrying out their activities without physical meetings. However, this also brings consequences to the addiction that causes an impact on mental health."
