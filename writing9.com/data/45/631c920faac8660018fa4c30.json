        "Some people think that fresh water should be freely available, while others think that governments should tightly control the use of fresh water as it is limited resource. In this essay, I will discuss both views in this debate and give my opinion.",
        "On the one hand, some people argue that we should pay for water. They suggest that water is a utility and it is a service provided to the public. Firstly, we should pay for water because it is a limited resource. To illustrate this, if water doesn't cost anything, the community will not respect this natural resource anymore and they will start to waste it.",
        "On the other hand, some people say that water should be free of charge and should always be available everywhere. It is bacause water is a basic need of every human being and there is a serious lack of water in some places. For example, access to safe water was declared a basic human right by the UN, and people shoudn't have to pay for basic rights.",
        "In conclusion, some people think that fresh water should be freely available, while others believe governments should tightly control the use of fresh water as it is limited resource. I think that although water is limited, it should be paid in full because it is a  basic need and basic right of every human and we should educate people to use it properly instead of make it cost money."
