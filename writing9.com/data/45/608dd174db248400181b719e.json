        "Adolesence is very crucial age where youngsters do not know what is wrong or right.So,it is utmost important for the children to know what is good for them in their near future.That is the reason  why few masses presume that it is beneficial to give them punishment in order to learn discipline.I am totally agree with this statement and i have given my opinion in following paragraphs.",
        "To commence with,there are plethora of reasons why learners should know the difference between right and wrong. First and foremost,nowdays society has become materialistic and it affects on children at their early age.The company of bad friends also put deep impact on them.For example,parents can give them punishment of not using mobile phone or watching television if they are not getting good marks or do something bad.Secondly,technology has penetrated in each and every segment of life  so children are always busy in their gadgets and they are not interested in communicating with their parents and grandparents also they see bad things on internet which put impact on their minds and they got distracted from their path.",
        "Morever,childrens are also over burdened because of their studies and they are not left with enough time in order to focus on their health.So,teachers play important role in their life.It is the onus of teachers to teach good qualities and also direct them to choose right path for their studies and job.To cite an example,teachers also give them punishment to not play in playground for two to three days in order to learn them lessons.Also,it is necessary to refrain them with prizes like chocolates if they are doing something good.It gives them internal bliss and they tried hard to do good things in life.",
        "To encapsulate,punishment is necessary to learn them morality and to do good things instead of bad ones,but this punishment should not be physical,rather practical."
