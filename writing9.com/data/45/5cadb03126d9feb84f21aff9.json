        "People argue about huge pay of few people. Some people opine that it is beneficial for a country, others disagree that disagree that the government should introduce limitations on earning. In my opinion, I believe that people who have high salaries, deserve it as whatever a government earn comes from them.",
        "On the one hand, some people think that the state should impose restrictions to payments. For them, it is better to spend more money on needy people rather than spending too much on employees, who can afford to have basic facilities of life. Furthermore, a great amount of government amount of government budget needs to be invested in other sectors of great significance such as education, health and infrastructure, which will benefit everyone. Moreover, the government of some developing countries cannot manage to provide high salary packages. For instance, Pakistan owing to its crippling economy is unable to pay more to its professionals because by doing so they would have to compromise on basic amenities of middle-class people.",
        "On the other hand, I believe that the government ought to give handsome salaries to everyone who deserve it. Firstly, whatever a state earn comes from its people. The population of a country face many taxes while purchasing any items, even there is deduction from salaries of employers. This setup generates enough resources for a government. Secondly, increasing cost of everything due to government policies jeopardize its people and they cannot have comfortable life with lo payment. Finally, with attractive salary, people will be more devoted to their work. They don\u2019t need to indulge in any other business if they have enough financial support from their only job. Therefore, they will be more focused on job rather than other methods of income.",
        "In conlusion, I believe that deserving people should be rewarded a good salary and this will be helpful to make them more loyal to their work."
