        "The given flowchart illustrates the process required to follow in order to get a driving license in a developed nation.Overall, Acquiring a driving test involves multiple steps which are mandatory.",
        "As observed from the flow chart, the process starts by visiting the driving license centre to filling-up a form. Next, an eye test is conducted. Those who are unable to pass this test, are denied the license. However, other candidates who pass it, need to pay the fee for a written examination.  If this exam is not cleared then, candidates are allowed to resit the exam without any additional charges being charged to them.  However, if they again fail to clear it then they may apply again by paying the fees once again.",
        "Once, the above test is passed , they must undergo a practical test which tests road driving. Here onwards, unsuccessful ones have to re-apply for the road driving test. This re-application is on a chargeable basis. Finally, Successful individuals are granted a driving license."
