        "In some countries people live in Old age homes after certain age, served by the staff there, whereas some others prefer to stay at home with family, children and relations, which is the right way. Generally, one can hardly do any work at this age as the physical stamena is very less compared to that of the early thirties to fifties. So, they need someone one's support who shall stay as a back bone to that person every minute, paying utmost attention, rather diverting on other things.",
        "Many-a-people, are introverts since their childhood, who cannot express or ask what they want, nor can get the things done by themselves due to weak personalities. Health gets hampered, obviously requires lots of care, proper medication to be provided. Food supplements add a big advantage to them, irrespective of either taking medicines or not, as they are naturally dull and unexcited to do the tasks. Due to such weakness, they might be short tempered but the one who nurses them, should be with strong patience and understanding their timely needs.",
        "Serving such people is not an ordinary task but in fact, a big deal of challenge, as it's very tough to know their nature, to locate the causes behind their impatience. This is the reason, it is suggested that it is always better if they be with their blood relations like their own children, family, or so on. Not only cause of passion or as a rule people are moving to the old age homes, but also because of the well known fact, that they are being driven by their own kids, perhaps, due to one or the other reason, impacting the mental and physical conditions of old aged people very adversely.",
        "Ultimately, the government is baring all the expenses that happen for such people, as they are the sole cause of the Nation's growth and existence. Instead, they could conduct the awareness camps or like wise, in order to educate the young generation of the necessity of their parents and the way they have to be taken care of. They have to be made learnt the responsibilties, the pros and cons of the requirements and the repercussion that they face practically. It has to be inculcated in their minds that, even the cost of living is not burdensome at all, and would in turn, levitate the elderly shadow of the house.",
        "An amazing truth that has to be remembered is that, there is no existence for the next generation without their living, also that HISTORY REPEATS. Conclusively, I prefer and say that one has to be matured, take the core  responsibility of their elated parents with love, sharing their affectionate care with never ending gratitude."
