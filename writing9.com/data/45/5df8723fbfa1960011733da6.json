Others say school uniforms infringe upon students' right to express their individuality, have no positive effect on behavior and academic achievement. Discuss both sides & give your opinion.

        "Many of us believe that educational institutes should make an attire mandatory at the premises. This will create equality feeling among the students as well as they will remain focused towards teaching rather than getting indulged in fashion at an early age. Whilst there are many who opined with another view that says uniforms do not have any impact. I full concur with the former notion that defines the rule of clothing for each student.",
        "It is irrefutable to say that the standards of the person in society can be seen via the clothes they are wearing. And school is the place where one goes to gather knowledge and other traits that makes him good human being to live in the society with harmony. Thus, donning the same type of clothes will give the equality, that ought to be the essential criteria when they are recieving the enlightenment. It will not only save the poorer student from getting inferiority complex among other richer student but also teachers will be able to treat them accordingly without looking at their social status.",
        "On the other hand, the schools in US, Canada and mnay other countries do not suppor the dress code idea for the youngsters. In fact, it has has been regarded as their right to showcase their personality. Even though, the juveniles cannot judge the social stature by clothes but sooner or later they got involved into race of looking good that have always plummeted their key interest in studies.",
        "To sum up, to enforcing the dress code might take away the basic rights of an individual but its long term benefits are much more fruitful for him that can serve the society in much better way."
