        "some chest and abdominal pain, with a dry cough. His nursing management in the hospital initially consisted of a walking",
        "frame and assistance with showering and dressing. Mr Ramamurthy is now more independent. He is also able to walk",
        "about slowly without assistance, and shower and use the toilet independently.",
        "Paracetamol may be administered as needed if chest and abdominal pain persists and Mr Ramamurthy should be",
        "kept warm. Please encourage oral fluids, and ensure that he sits up, rather than lies down, whenever possible to",
        "ensure postural drainage. He should ambulate regularly, and continue with deep breathing and coughing exercises.",
        "Mr Ramamurthy was very weak on admission to hospital, but has gained weight with dietitian input. He will",
        "need ongoing monitoring of his diet.",
