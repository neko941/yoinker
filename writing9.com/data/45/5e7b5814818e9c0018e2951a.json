        "It is a debatable issue that how children should be assessed in school. Many people opine that students should be divided by their education status, while others argue that students with different abilities must study together. In my opinion, school must not select pupils according to academic qualification.",
        "There are many reasons why it is effective that students should be selected by education abilities. Firstly, scholars can concentrate properly on their studies as they will not be disturbed by unworthy pupils. Consequently, they will provide better outcomes and school reputation will increase globally. Another reason is if children are separated accordingly then they will get similar interest mates in school and can do innovative things because this situation will arise competition among them. Hence, it is wise to select them according to their education scores.",
        "Conversely, there is no doubt that school should balance students of different capabilities together owing to they can handle different types of people; as a result, they will learn co-operating skill which will assist them in the future. Further, if all pupils will study together then perhaps squalor will get encouraged by their school mates who are good in education and enjoy studying with them.",
        "To conclude, although people may vary in their opinion, I think that both of the above views have certain merits and demerits. However, school should not differ adolescents based on their academic abilities since everyone has their own talent. Some are productively in education whereas others are at practical skills such as sports."
