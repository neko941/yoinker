        "A section of the population are of the view that not an agreeable amount of domestic waste is recycled, and that the only means for a rise in recycling is for governments to make it a laws concerning it.",
        "I think laws are to a greater extent necessary because of the points displayed below:",
        "A huge number of citizens can only be motivated to carry out certain activities by forceful means. Climate change has been a topic of discussion in the recent years, but people choose to ignore it even though the human race is to blame for that change owing to repetitive environmental pollution. If the government set up rules and fines emphasizing on recycling by for example, ordering companies to package in reusable material with failure to abiding to the law causing closure of that factory, this would instill a sense of fear in the would be culprits hence cutting down on the use of harmful non recyclable containers.",
        "Secondly, fines would be a good method too since most people are very obsessed with money and loss of a portion of that income would affect them negatively. This would be of an advantage in places where rubbish bins are put with 'recyclable' and 'organic waste' labels on them. A large clear sign would then have to be put, stating that a fine of a given amount of cash would be paid if the labels on the bins are not followed while dumping waste in them. This would lead to careful disposal of the rubbish.",
        "On the other hand, in reality, not all laws are followed because the human race looks at them as threats that will not be acted upon. Hence, if all those legal requirements are to be emphasized, cameras and other kind of technology should be installed to mark the assailants. Also, the big companies that do not act according to the rules should be punished and publically shamed.",
        "In conclusion, government laws can only be effective if they don't just stay on paper but put into action."
