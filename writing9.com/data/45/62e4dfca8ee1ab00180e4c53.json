        "Nowadays, society tend to earn money for comfortable life. One of the most considerable aspect of choosing a career is  its salary. There is a lot of contraries argued which satisfaction is more important than monetary part of the job. I accept this suit for many people but in general, I disagree with this phrase which we consider salary as the most important reason to choose a job.",
        "Firstly, satisfaction can bring happiness and fulfilment to people in spite of that salary can not guarantee your mood. For instance, if you have been chosen by the employer who has  nice behaviour, respect for all employees and pays attention to them can make  sense of self-satisfy and also workers get a responsibility to work harder and take care of the big target of his/her position.",
        "Secondly, if public be a good industry and have satisfaction to their post, their mind turns to empty of any tension relevant about their career, so they can make a better decision and enhance their creativity. Hence, when they don't have any issue with another and have a passion for their work, automatically they tend to do the assignment in perfect way and in ,conclusion company can achieve to his goal . For ,example researchers find their appointment because they like to do something for science and also can help human life.",
        "Other community argued their ideal career doesn't exist and they live  a pressured life just because of the monthly payment which their company gives to them.",
        "In sum part, I want to restate my opinion which satisfiction is more important than salary because can bring fulfilment and sence of responsibilty for employee."
