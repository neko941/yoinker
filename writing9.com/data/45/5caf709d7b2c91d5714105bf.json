        "All of the legal and acceptable activities ranging from a variety of the fields of life deserve to be worth-trying possessions. Being an expert in sports industry is not an exception. Therefore, from my own perspective, parents should offer a boost of motivation to their children who in pursuit of becoming a professional athlete due to some rationale reasons.",
        "When it comes to the financial benefits deprived of pursuing sporting industry, it is the intrinsic key factor implementing to the parent\u2019s support. The plain truth is that people who are perceived as the experts in this fields could be able to achieve the handsome income. To be more specific, Ronaldo, one of the most well-known football players, does receive the a-million-of-dollar salary every year stemming from taking up the professional tournaments. However, no sooner had he overcome the extraordinary severities of the rigorous training courses daily under the consistent encouragement of his beloved family than he had the feat and hit the peak of his career. Therefore, the parental members ought to foster their children to diminish the obstacles in this industry instead of hindering them.",
        "On top of that, albeit the ambiguous future for those who harbor the dream of being a sport athlete, this action also makes a significant contribution to children\u2019s sustainable development in terms of characteristic\u2019s. Inferred from the fact, thanks to the fear of a fail achievement, the younger generation would be naturally piqued to make more endeavors to master their essential skills no matter how long does time take. This reinforces and enhances not only their endurance but also their patience. As a thrust of many experts\u2019 arguments, for instance, the leading successful athletes are twice as calm and patient as the normal. Henceforth, those, who are in charge of parental roles, should help their children get the great level of improvement of characteristics by carrying out their dream in the sport fields.",
        "As aforementioned explanations, by ignoring the uncertain sense of failure, the older generation, especially the parents, should give a hand to motivate their children\u2019s sport-related career"
