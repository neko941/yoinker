        "People have differing views when discussing about dealing with crimes. These caused fear to some people which opted to stay at home for self-protection. While others think that more action from the government is necessary, I firmly believe that they already proved their efforts and minimal action is enough.",
        "On the one hand, some people feel that they do not feel safe as the crimes remain rampant nowadays. They are not convinced with the action made by the government. They believe that the biggest law offenders are still out in the street and they are the one who need to watch out the most. They further argue that enable to fight against them the government and the law enforcers should double their efforts to make sure of the people\u2019s safety.",
        "Be that as it may, I firmly believe that the government already have proven effective measure on keeping people\u2019s security. The rise with the number of law offenders caught and sent to prison will prove these claims. Based on the recent statistics conducted by Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism (PCIG), jails have currently experiencing 3000 over-congestion due to large numbers of prisoner caught and proven guilty of their crimes. This event is due to serious intake of our government officials and law enforcers to ensure people are safe inside and outside of their house.",
        "In general, although there are some good reason with the people appealing for more action, I personally believe that the government already proved their efforts to make people safe at all times."
