Those who categorized as low-end society finds it so tough to fulfil their children with such proper nutrients. This, Eventually, assists they to reduce their needs regarding to the babies necessity. In several nations, such as Indonesia, the government has provided them with social assistance funding. They acknowledged that this support was helpful.

Insufficient badget might cause a high amount deficit of a country. India and China, for instance, which are well-knowing as the greater population in the world are not able to pay for any household needs to rise their generation. This, also, might be difficult to manage by the regulators in term of the cashflow. Owing to the wide range of the owning-baby families population, government finds it so hard to track the flow of the monetary. This cause the badget would not be targeted properly to the citizens who have children.",
