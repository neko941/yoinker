        "An argument that has been put forward is the notion that the effect of technology developing lead to the narrow between the rich people and poor people bigger. While, others have the opposite opinion of this view. This essay will explore both sides of this issue and present a personal view on the matter.",
        "Moving on to the negative aspect of technology for different society layers in terms of income, first at all. Some of the technology can help people to earn more money. Rich ones have more advantages to get to know the technology than the other category of people.Moreover, some of the new technology are extremely expensive and therefore, rich folks could  be able to pay the exorbitant prices to use them. Most of the destitutes have no time and energy to pay attention to the new technology as they have to work for long hours to make up for their living expenses. This leads to increase in  the gap at the different economic layer on the society.",
        "On the contrary, others take the view that the reduce the gap between the rich and poor people. Many new technologies make the world more convenient. People can be easy to get the information via technology. For example, internet. People can search for all information which is they needed. Also, internet provided a space for people have to contact each other easier than before. Different types of social position have the same right on the internet. It makes the gap between the rich and poor people smaller.",
        "In conclusion, I agree with the later argument because a range of new technology makes the world better and convenient. All of people in the society, does not matter if they are rich or poverty stricken, can get benefits from it."
