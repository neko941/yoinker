        "One of the highly controversial issues today relates to whether developing train and subway lines or expanding roads have more effects to cut down traffic jams. In this essay, I am going to examine this question from both points of view and then give my own opinion on the matter.",
        "On one side of the argument there are people who argue that the benefits of public transport such as train, metro considerably outweigh advantages of road widening. The main reason for believing this is that public transport are cheaper and safer. It is also possible to say that citizens may just pay a little money to travel by modern vehicles and these transports are driven by professional drivers so people can feel comfortable. One good illustration of this is a person was traveling by tube when he was reading book or listening to music even sleeping and need not to worry about driving.",
        "On the other hand, it is also possible to make the opposing case. It is often argued that in fact road widening help vehicles moving faster and more flexible. People often have this opinion because if roads are built more and expanded larger, vehicle capacity will increase thus people might not waste lots of time to wait so long.",
        "In my opinion, both arguments have their merits. On balance, however, I tend to believe that developing public transport such as train, metro lines is the better idea to decrease traffic jams."
