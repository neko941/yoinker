        "It is true that the conventional notion of having an only full-time work as a career is becoming out-dated. On the contrary, doing various paid jobs at a time and simultaneously carrying on formal higher education is becoming new trend. I shall discuss this topic in depth in ensuing paragraphs.",
        "Nowadays, more and more young people are choosing to get involved in more than one careers and this fashion can be justified by several reasons. Firstly, the means of bread-earning is increasing day by day. Young adults after completing graduations are given plethora of career options to choose from and they are starting to opt for more than one. Secondly, People are becoming curious and enthusiastic to explore all the alternatives. They do not want to limit their horizons in order to brighten their future. Finally, as the inflation is swelling all over the world, individuals having responsibility to run their families are trying to earn more and thus, they are trying to have multiple jobs at a time to provide sufficiently for their family members.",
        "To be able to get into different work areas, one needs to have relative professional knowledge and degrees/certificates in most cases. For this, people are not reluctant to resume their education even at a later stage of life. Professionals are completing new courses while working, with an intension to strengthen their resumes/CVs and to achieve promotions/increments in some scenarios. To compete with professionally smart and highly intellectual other candidates, one has to have several qualifications in hand while going for an interview. Due to such reasons, professional individuals are ready to learn and earn additional certificates throughout their lives.",
        "In conclusion, traditional way of having a single profession is fading away gradually. Number of people having multiple careers and getting higher education throughout life, is escalating in recent times."
