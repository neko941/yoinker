        "On one side of the argument there are people who argue that the benefits of studing lecture and dealing with courses that university performed by internet. considerably outweigh its disadvantages. The main reason for believing this is that the first pros is the student can be working and studying at the same time . if anyone have another target like business scope , he can continue in his business by this offer. It is also possible to say that study online depends on utilize enormous academic layers for students and teachers community from severed countries . One good illustration of this is financial economic and no body need to transport vehicle .",
        "On the other hand, it is also possible to make the opposing case. It is often argued that in fact one of the most cons are boring and determining options . People often have this opinion because no reaction by body contact while it\u2019s main reason for obtain ensure data.  A second point is that little trace for students from their teachers .A particularly good example here is.",
        "As we have seen, there are no easy answers to this question. On balance, however, I tend to believe that this offers are opportunity for maximum students . overall , it\u2019s distinct and unique option in my opinion ."
