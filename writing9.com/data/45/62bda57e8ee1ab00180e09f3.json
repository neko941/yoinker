        "Normally each person should have complete right. However, some experts suspect whether every individual should have the right to end his or her own life. To this issue, many people support this practice; on the other hand, several thinkers oppose it strongly.",
        "To begin with, a lot of professionals agree that if anyone wants to exercise the right to die, that person should be able to do so. The two most obviously important reasons are that sometime the patients do not want to suffer the extreme pain and that a large number of them can not pay the medical bills. They do not want their relatives to be sad or to carry the burden. My neighbor, Sanuss, for example, suffered from third degree cancer. He was in his deal bed for three years, crying day and night. His family spent a fortune for medical treatments and drugs. He wanted to use the right to end his life but the relatives refused. Finally, he was allowed to use the right to die after long of deal. If only he died earlier, he would not have to suffer and pay that much.",
        "On the contrary, many hopeful people do not support the use of right to die. They expect that after the long rest, the patients may recover on the doctor may find the better solution to solve serious health problem. Eleven years ago, a daughter, Tida, was hit by a car and lay in the bed unconsciously for two years. Everybody thought that it was a waste of time and many to keep Tida alive. Yet, her mother denied to allow anyone to end Tida\u2019s life. Formerly, Tida and her mother loved to sing together, especially the song, Deck the hall, during Christmas. When Christmas came that year, the mother played this song loudly in the room where Tida was. Suddenly, the mother saw the lips of Tida move. She called the doctor who encouraged the family to play that song for Tida. Two years after that, Tida gained move conscious.",
        "Although the medical miracles are rare, my position is __ the individual to use the right to die. As long as that individual still breathes, that person should have faith and hope for better life."
