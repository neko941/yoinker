        "Sports are an important part of indivisual's growth and there is no sport which can be considered less than the other.Sports like tennis or swimming have advantages such as independent growth and learning how to compete with oneself ,however according to my opinion team sports teach a person much more in comparsion.This essay will cover views for both and also how team sports generally prove to be a better choice in my opinion.",
        "To survive in society it is important that a person must posses good social skills such as team work and cooperation and the team sports teach a person exactly the same.It makes a person adaptable with different type of personalities and adjust according to the team requirements.These qualities are always required",
        "to live a happy and satisfactory life.For example,a person must know how to adjust with different type of people in office and also at home to be able to settle without much conflicts.Learning these simple social skills help a person to be a better citizen for the society as well as an asset for any organization he associates them with.",
        "Although I am inclined towards the group sports,but we cannot deny the fact that the indivisual sports also have their own advantages.Firstly,sports like swimming teaches people to compete with themselves which proves to be an asset in one's life.There is less blaming on the other people or environment and more focus on one's own faults.For example,if a person plays single tennis match and does not do so well,he knows who is at fault and when you accept your own mistakes ,there is always a scope of improvement.Secondly,the major advantage is that a person can always go and play these sports alone ,whenever he gets time if the peers are not available.Thus the dependency is decreased and you can keep yourself fit.",
        "In my opinion group sports teach a person much more than the indivisual ones and the social qualities are really important for a person to survive in the world without hassle,but with the advantages of independent growth and independent fitness regime that a person can follow with indivisual sport,it is not a bad choice either.To  recapitulate,whether group or independent sport,it is a must to learn atleast one sport and keep your mind and body fit and healthy by indulging in the same."
