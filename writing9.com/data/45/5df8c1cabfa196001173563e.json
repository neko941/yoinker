        "Eating sugar very much is not good for health.  Majority of masses think that government should limit the amount of sugar consumption while opponents believe  that it is individual's responsibility to eat less amount of sugar.  This eassy will discuss both contradictory arguments. I, however,  side with lateral view.",
        "There are some reasons why few people think that it is government responsibility to control the number of sugar consumption.  First and foremost reason is that the daily consumption of sugar is very high.  To put it simply, due to  increasing amount of sugar consumption,  the price of sugar is very less therefore people eat sugar to much which leads many health problems like ; obesity. If government control the consumption of sugar then this problem might be solved.  A survey which had been conducted in Australia in 2017 could be an ideal example of this,  this survey showed almost 40% people control their eating habit of sugar when government decreased the amount of sugar consumption and price of sugar increased.",
        "On the other hand,  few people believe its individual responsibility to control their eating habit of sugar.  As a reason,  a person can control eating sugar to much because sugar is not beneficial for health.  A rich people can easily purchase sugar according  to own need because one cannot face any financial problem,  and easily store sugar in own factories.  A best illustration is that my uncle who is very rich person so who can easily  purchase sugar to much and eat it.  So it is individual responsibility to control eat sugar because of its I'll effects.",
        "As such it can be concluded that although government contol the consumption of sugar,  In my perspective,  individual can batter solve this problem through control on eating habit of sugar."
