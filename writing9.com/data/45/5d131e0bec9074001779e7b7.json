        "Children usually learn foreign language as early as in secondary school even though some experts believe its better occurs in primary school. It seems for me that foreign language should be taught to our children at elder stages rather than youngest one.",
        "It is undeniable that young children will easily learn vocabulary and pick-up the pronunciation of language much better compared to elder people. However, they have to learn basic subject such as sciences, mathematics and moral which essential for them to survive in future especially at the beginning of education system. In addition, it is compulsory for non-native English student to focus on their mother tongue language and might start with English language. Learning foreign language other than English would make them confused and distracted so that generate negative effects on development of education system.",
        "On the other hand, other subjects are more importance at that age. We should allow them to focus on the basic subjects which requires them to put much effort and time consuming. Therefore, they can begin to learn foreign language after establishment and understood the concept of study in primary school. Furthermore, it could easy for them to practise and enhance the usage of foreign language with attractive approach. For example, they may enjoy learn language through games and debate, present a current issue, as well as establish the social conversation with others people from different location either locally or internationally.",
        "In conclusion, I strongly believe that children may begin his education in foreign language at secondary school rather than secondary school because the benefits are outweighing the drawbacks."
