        "Technological improvements are on the rise each day, and this has benefited us in so many ways. However, there is an argument that these technologies have affected the way people interact with each other negatively, making the less social. I totally agree with this claim and this essay will illustrate my reason.",
        "Firstly, the mobile telephone has made it possible to communicate with anybody without moving an inch. Before this gadget, people were fond of visiting one another, which was the major way of communication. For example, in a survey lyrics in the United states, it was observed that since the introduction of mobile phones, the traveling rate reduced with almost 60%. This means most people prefer phone communication than actual visitation.",
        "Furthermore, the Internet offers everything from the comfort of homes. Online shopping is making visitation to stores unnecessary. Also, online workstations are possible, hence you can work in your home without any office environment. It is safe to say that there is almost nothing one cannot do via the Internet. With such technology at our disposal, going out and interacting becomes really unnecessary.",
        "In conclusion, I totally agree that with more advancement in technology,  people will become less social, due to the relative ease technology making communication possible. However, it is also advisable for people to engage in physical interactions."
