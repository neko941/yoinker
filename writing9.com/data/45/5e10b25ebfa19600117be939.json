        "I am Ayman Nakib, working as a freelance photographer, looking forward to a career in Visual Documentary sector.",
        "My interest in photography grew in childhood. As a kid, whenever I saw something beautiful, I would feel an urge to take a photograph, but as a 90's kid, technology was not available at my hand to fulfill that urge, so the passion remained sleeping in my heart.",
        "I rediscovered my passion for photography when I was a 5th semester student of my university in 2016. I put together some money from tuition and bought a canon 700D camera and borrowed an 18-55 lens whose autofocus didn't work. And my journey in photography started. A short basic photography course and weekly photo adda at my university photography club helped me a lot to learn different genre of photography. Among which street photography attracted me the most.",
        "As I was always an introvert person, Street photography was the most convenient genre for me. I started exploring different streets of Sylhet and silently photographing candids. later, I also started exploring different lifestyle near Sylhet and my hometown Sherpur and started documenting daily life of the people of Bangladesh.",
        "I have also done and still doing wedding and other event photography in a small scale. But my passion is and always will be exploring different aspects of life and represent them visually though my photographs.",
        "Though I have not been able to do any striking or significant work on important issues because of lack of education and time, but I hope and believe that through better learning and education, I would be able to pursue my passion for documentary photography."
