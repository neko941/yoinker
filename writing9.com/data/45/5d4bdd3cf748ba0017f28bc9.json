        "In 2007, the city hospital can be accessed through Hospital Road, which had a junction with City Road. After 3 years, the crossroad was replaced by a roundabout, and a junction of Hospital Road and Ring Road also experienced the same replacement over the period shown.",
        "In addition, a car park for staff and public located east of Hospital Road in 2007 was superseded by a car park for staff only in 2010, and the public car park was moved to a larger space positioned east of the Ring Road. Moreover, bus stops on two sides of Hospital Road were eliminated in 2010, and a bus station had been built near Hospital Road having connections with the two mentioned roundabouts."
