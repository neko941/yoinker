        "Can poorer countries improve their economy with the help of richer countries? It has been said that in order for a poor nation to progress in their economy advances in health, trade and education are needed.In my opinion, rich countries can do a great  deal of things to help poor nations.",
        "To begin with, there is no rich country  that started being rich or that have become rich from one day to another, a lot of effort, honesty and the most important intelligent decisions are required so as to strengthen and enhance their economy.In addition, health , education and trade are vitally important for the the economic progress because these three concepts are linked to each other and if one of these standars is not good enough the other two will not work properky. For instance, in poor countries where education is poor people get sick bescause they eat in an unhealthy way as a result of having not received a proper education and they do not have enough money to pay a private doctor due to the fact that most of them have a low wage.Hence, if richier countries hel the poorer through donations of medical equipment, books or things that can be very useful for those poor countries, people in poorer nations will have a better quality of life.",
        "Although, the burden of responsability of poor countries lies in the hands of their presidents richer countries can do a great deal to help them wihtout taking any political advangate for example, Venezuela which nowadays is a country that urgently needs help from other countries but,no one wants to take action without receiving some benefit whether economical or through taking some petrol.",
        "To sump up, the world surely would be a better place to live in if richer countries helped poorer countries giving them useful equipment such as medical equipment, computers, books that they dismiss every year and their presidents of those countries started taking smart decisions."
