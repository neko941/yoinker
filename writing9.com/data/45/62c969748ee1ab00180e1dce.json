        "In earlier days people are mostly engaged in different forms of art activities.But now the situation has changed and people are more inclined towards other sectors like science, technology and business.",
        "I will discuss more in detail  the possible reasons for people taking less interest in arts.",
        "To commence with, in the olden days parents encourage their children to take up arts as part of their education and there is positive encouragement from the government and society as well, but now in the modern era with technological advances parents and children are also taking more interest in science and technology sectors. One of the possible reasons for this could be there is less profit and opportunities . The recognition from the government is also not that great in arts.",
        "In contrast to arts, there are more opportunities to grow in other sectors as in today's world where   we are completely dependant on science and technology. With this, people are getting more jobs with high salaries unlike arts.People are also getting more abroad opportunities in other fields. Lack of awareness about the importance of arts is also one of the reasons for looking down at arts.",
        "To encourage more people to take interest in arts is to create an awarness on describing the importance of arts in our culture and knowing its legacy. First of all,  Government and educational institutions should make arts as mandatory in their course, so that its importance can be taught to children from their childhood onwards. Government should also recognise the good work done in arts and should reward people , so that it will be encouraging to others."
