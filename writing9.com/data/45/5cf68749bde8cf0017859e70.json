        "Invention of electric run cars has made the fossil run cars obsolete. IT has also raised a burning question\u201d Should electric cars be totally replace fossil run cars?\u201d I agree with it as igniting fossils raises pollution level and it is also a renewable source so switching to electric cars and disconitunig fossil cars make a sense. .",
        "Fossil fuel cars when used causes polution and in turn increases global warming wheras cars which are run on electricty are a clean source of energy and it should be fully replaced by fuel cars. When the combustion of fossil fuel takes place it emits carbon mpnoxide and other harmful gases which cause and cause pollution and is a source of global warming which is a major concern for whole world nowdays. For instance, Venice in Italy has discontinued the use of traditional fossil cars and it was able to reduce the pollution by 50% .",
        "In this modern era, we definitely need to find a alternate to fossil fuel as it a renewable source of energy.It is a big question: Will Fossil Fuels be able to meet the ever increasing demand?\u201d . It\u2019s cost has been surging whereas electricity is a cheap and an excellent source to run cars. Additionaly, these cars require one time investment and are pocket friendly to customer.  For instance, every major company has forayed into electric cars seeing its long term benefits and people are purchasing them in quite high numbers.",
        "This essay discussed the reasons why fosil fuel cars should be replaced by electric cars. I completely agree with it because burning fossils is a source of high pollution and global warming plus they are renewable in nature and would not be able to meet the demand in future."
