        "Now a days people entertrain themselves by watching different kinds of movies. It's completely depends on person's interest, weather its comedy film or else message voriented film. According to me, i like amusement based films after a longday of work, but some times my friends insist on watching a fantastic or scary movie just to diversify our repertory.",
        "one on the hand, comedies make one laugh. People can just relax, buy a bottle of coda and some popcorn and enjoy those moments. Such movies allow them to take a break from the rigors of life by making them laugh and putting in a good mood.  Usually, we go to the movie theatre once a month because in this case we always find new fun to watch. I like those moments when it is dark and one just can enjoys the actions from a large screen.",
        "On the other hand I do like movies that make me think. Sometimes I really fascinated the plot or performance. For example, \"Traffic\", a movie about drugs and young people, is very touching and topical. From my point of view, every family should watch this movie together and discuss the important aspects of it. One more example of this kind of movies is \"Mister G\". It is about a little boy who needed a surgery to live. His heart did not work properly, so a boy needed another one to survive . Basically, the movie is about a family that faces many difficulties and obstacles, trying to save their only child. I think that humankind needs such movies. First of all, they help people enjoy their life and be grateful. Second of all, they help people realize that they are a big family.",
        "In summary, I think that every movie must teach us be kind, strong and grateful."
