        "Whether or not watching a hollywood movies has bad influence on society is a debateable issue. There are some people who claims that seeing movies of western world will be benefical for us. On different side, many believes that,  pictures from another culture will affect our own culture and has determent consequence. In this essay, i wll discuss both side of aspects and give my personal opinion afterwards.",
        "Those who are in favour of watching of hollywood movies claim that, it will provides us opportunitiy to learn and understand their culture. As hollywood movies are great source of information and enterainment. Secondly, as we know, these movies are mostly based on various advanced technology and modern world so watching them will provide us up-to-date information. For instance, NASA mars mission movies is best example of movies which is based on latest exploration on other planet.",
        "Moving further,the reason why community who thinks that, our culture get bad impression if people start watching movies on foreign culture is because of their life style and moral values. It is common in western culture young people starts living together before their marriage which is not very common in some community. In additions to this, some people believe, most of hollywood pictures based on drugs and crime which can be a harmful for their children because they will get exposure of such unknown things .",
        "From my viewpoint, I think , we should watch hollywood pictures as they do have significant information and great source of enterianment. Moverover, movies are they only way in which we can understand and learn what is going on around the world with emotions.",
        "To conclude, we can say that, they do provide great information and knowledge on various aspect of the society and culture. Watching other kind of movies will not harm our culture if we educate people to take in positive way and learn something such movies."
