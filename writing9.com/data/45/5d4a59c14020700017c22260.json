        "Nowadays, adolescent are more inclining to spend majority of their time with their friends rather than with their family members. This is mainly because of working parents and more indepence given to them at early age. I believe parents should not force their children to spend more time at home.",
        "At present age, everyone is working and busy with their jobs. Most of the parents are working and as a result give less time to and attention to children. Often children take their decisions and become more independent at early age. Till young they find their comfort zone with their friends so they spend more time together. For example, a recent study found that the average youngsters spends 5 hours per day with their friends.",
        "Forcing the youngsters to spend more time at home is not a good idea this could sometimes lead to depression in children. Sudden restrictions on how they should spend their time. According to me parents have given freedom to children at this age so in this case also they should leave the decision on children that with whom they want to spend most of their time. For instance, a US survey it is found that 25% of youngsters are depressed due to parents restrictions.",
        "In conclusion, from the foremention points it is lucid that youngsters spend more time with their friends and why this trend has come. And parents why I believe parents should not force their children to spend more time at home."
