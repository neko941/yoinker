It happen because in the recent times the technology has grown rapidly and it makes there are alot of obstacles to concetrate. In this essay I will discuss the problems and the solutions in way to increase the standards of education.",
        "There is no doubt that technology has become growth, furthermore the technology also become easier to access. For example the Internet and the smartphones, where it become primarily needs. Either old people or young people can't live without the Internet and smarphones, such as the employees and the students. In many case, the system of education force the students to have smartphones, moreover, during the covid 19, where there is no offline class. In some countries, for example in Indonesia, before the pandemic has come nore all the students have smartphones. But the condition force the parents to bought a smartphone for their childrents, if not it will impact the children where can't following the online class. Following the grown of the technology, it makes study become easier because the source of the literatures are unlimited.",
        "At the same time, the students not only use their phones to study and get in class, but also play a game using their phones. Additionally, the growth of the technology also makes a game can be downloaded easily. This game is so refreshing, but without limits of time it can be the obstacles for students to study. This is the problem why in recent days, the standard of technology was decrease gradually.",
        "In conclussion, the technology helps the students to study, even in pandemic where there is no class in school. But following the grown of the techonolgy, a game also become easier to access. This is the problem, because the students have a lot of obstacles to concentrate."
