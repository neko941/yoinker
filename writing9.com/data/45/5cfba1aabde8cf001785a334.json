        "In the last decade body modifications in the form of injections and surgery is gaining popularity. As more and more people are undergoing these changes there is a growing debate whether or not this should happen and why do people try to look young.",
        "Although aging happens to us all, in some areas incereased age may mark the end of our career. This is especially true in the entertainment field where most of the lead parts are given to young beautiful actors in their 20's and 30's. It is easy to understand than, why local proceedures and other surgeries such as face lifts, botox injections and rhinoplasty to eliminate age related changes are so common among entartainers.",
        "Other reasons may also acount for why we want to stay young at any cost. Getting old is associated with being dependend on other people. Furthermore, it is associated with illnessess and mortality. These feelings are frightening to many people and it is only natural to try and fight them. As a consequence we tend to hold on to things that makes us feel youger. examples to that include doing a new tatoo or attempting  an extreem sport for the first time. It makes us look and feel young again.",
        "Despite the natual concerns about loosing our youth, I believe getting older is a beautiful event and we should not be scared about it or try to hide it.  Every period in life, both being young and being old, has its positive and negetive effetcs. Elderly people are more calculated and have better prespective in life, characters that should be respected and looked uppon rather than fighting it. External changes associated with getting old is an amazing and natural process and we should learn to admire it rather that trying to prevent it. Being old is as bautiful as being young.",
        "In conclusion, attemting to look youger than our true age is an understandable urge. Despite that we should realize that getting older is a natural part of our life. We should not be scared of it or try to prevent it because it is as amazing as being youg."
