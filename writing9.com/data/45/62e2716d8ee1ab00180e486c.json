        "Technically, sharing of information plays a vital part in our lives. Some people believe that information should be shared freely, but others are of the view that important and valuable information should not be shared freely. This essay will discuss on the pros and cons of the both views.",
        "Sharing of information for scientific research, businesses and academic purpose has it's own benefits. Firstly, scientist uses free information to make new discoveries. secondly,  companies benefit from free information to produce new products for example IPhone products which are more convenient for use. Thirdly, it helps to broaden knowledge and less cost for student who goes to make research online for assignment purpose. Gathering informations promotes better education and better education leads to better future. It also help for individual to secure knowledge with little or no cost irrespective of the class (rich or poor ).",
        "On the other hand, sharing of valuable information should not be assessed free because a lot of time was spent on collecting data and cost is significant. People may find free information insignificant, and misinterpret it to be a threat. Thirdly, there should be valuable information which should not be shared free. Again most free information can give false reviews on some certain cases. Again, with no free information students will be able to visit there school library to make research for their assignments and projects. Also, caution will be applied in the collection of data to avoid displaying wrong facts to people.",
        "In conclusion, it is beneficial to share informations free but also we should consider the valuable and crucial ones that will be shared to public."
