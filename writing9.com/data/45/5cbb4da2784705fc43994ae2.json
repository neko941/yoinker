        "A large number of people move to big cities because the resources that those cities provide.With the resources comes the problem. People face plethora problems in their daily life.Problems like pollution, heavy traffic congestion, high rents are faced by the citizens. This cannot be solved just by relocating them to regional towns.",
        "Living in big cities has equal amount of pros and cons. Both the government and the people are responsible for these problems. For instance, heavy traffic problems can be an issue if the people opt to travel in their own car instead of public transport. Futhermore, the larger the number of car usage, the larger the amount of carbonmonoxide is released, which inturn causes air pollution. Hence these problems create a chain reaction from issue to another.",
        "Despite of the problems, people still continue to live in cities because of its perks. Most of the people migrate to city in search of employement and good education for their children. So encouraging to move them to town is not an ideal solution. For example, the authorities can provide low income housing for low income group which can be ideal solution for high rent problem. So the government should take necessary steps in improving their quality of life rather than moving them.",
        "As long as the city provides benefits, people continue to live there inspite of the problems. Problems like high rents, less public transports can be addressed by the government and help them finding solutions which doesn't include relocating them to regional towns."
