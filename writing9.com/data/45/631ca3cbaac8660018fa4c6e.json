For example, formal academic such as university can help those who are struggling by providing them a scholarships for an excellent students, or student loans or accommodation closer to the varsity for those who live in rural area so that it will lessen their burden in transportation. In addition, if the pupils are motivated by the aids of the academy, it is more likely they can give the best contribution to the school and society after graduation.",

Therefore, the university should do a thorough review and regulations for the students who is willing to dedicate their study. Since might not all of them want to pursue a formal education.",
