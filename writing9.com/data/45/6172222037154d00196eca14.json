        "Few individuals do opine that people who are artistic or creative should be financially aided via government. Whereas, some others believe that there should be another options available for this. These view points correspond to the personal belief and perception of these people. I would discuss both the sides and give my opinion on it in the following paragraphs.",
        "Some group do certainly think that government organisation should provide supporting hands to the talents, so that they can grow in their area of expertise. Financial help provided in shaping their future will in turn help the country to be known to the world through their creative talents. Most of the people, who are born with innate talents are not able to come up due to immense struggles or pressure in life. These people can be brought up in their life, if certain standards or measures are adopted by regulatory authorities to help them flourish.",
        "In contrast, some people thinks that there should be some other sources, that could actually economically aid these people to come up in their life. Such as, providing classes or lessons to the talented singers at subsidised rate. Similarly, building platform through which these gifted people are know to the whole world. For example; India idol, star singer shows, D4Dance. Through which they can earn fame and money. I personally believe that along with alternative source, financial aid through governemnet is essential to combat the scenario.",
        "Hence, it can be concluded that there is a need of correlation effect between both the government and alternate sources, so that the budding artists, musicians or painters can come up in their life."
