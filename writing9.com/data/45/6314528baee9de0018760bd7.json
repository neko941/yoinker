        "It is often argued that it is more advantageous to choose a job with high wage ,even if it does not appeal to you at all.I completely disagree with this opinion and think that job satisfaction is much more important than salary.",
        "First of all,I believe that job satisfaction gives people a sense of fulfilment that no money can guarantee. Even if someone is earning a high salary,but feels tense and compromises with his conscience, this person won't enjoy his life.While pursuing one's interests will always bring pleasure and feeling of satisfaction. For example, a lot of famous researchers made their career choices not because of appealing wages,but because they were passionate about science.That's why it's more important to choose the kind of work that makes you happy than look only at high salary",
        "Secondly, doing what you like keeps you motivated and therefore leads to a career growth. In other words,there is a strong relation between job satisfaction and productivity.People who live their jobs can easily excel in their fields of work and achieve better results than those who put salary on the first place.For instance,Henry Miller decided to leave his everyday job despite a good wage and ventured to become one of the most famous and well=paid authors of the twentieth century.",
        "Thus, advantages of jobs that keep you satisfied outweigh the drawback of a low salary in a long -term perspective."
