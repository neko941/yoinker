        "Supply chain management is a series of businesses as well as supply units that link together in product production and distribution of goods or services required by consumers (Buurman, J., 2002). Milk and coffee are a good example of a supply chain. In order to reach consumers, they actually have to go through many stages from raw materials to delivery to users. The following is an analysis of supply chain management of the main sub-systems in the supply chain and goals for the supply chain.",
        "As we know, there are three of the prominent main sub-systems in the supply chain are products, quality, and process. Firstly, the product is one of the key elements of a business's supply chain distribution. Entrepreneurs are always looking for and considering what products they will produce or distribute. In order to make these targets, we have to understand the current market and find the outstanding and prevalent products that need to be created and developed. The supply of the wrong product chain will result in loss of business (Lambert et al, 2000). Secondly, I might assume the product quality is intimately related to supply chain management. This is a fundamental factor to maintain a long-term supply chain between suppliers and customers. Thirdly, the process is a crucial factor to develop the supply chain business. Typical examples show that one of the successes of Amazon is that they mostly ensure the accuracy of the operating group. Besides, along with the automation of technology encouraged the operation of the whole system. Eventually, according to Mentzer et al. (2001, p.14), three factors are considered to be the main elements of sub-system because it brings seamlessness as well as relates directly to both competition in the market along with the revenue of a business and end-user satisfaction.",
        "The second analysis is four goals for the supply chain, such as customer service, time, profit and environment. It is also the order in which I propose to align the goals of the business which based on the aspect of company influence from internal to external. Obviously, customer service is an exchange between the list of customer information and the goods to be delivered, which greatly affects the accuracy of the business in the supply management of goods. Along with that, time is a prestige point that businesses should follow in order to bring credibility to customers and create loyalty as well as the efficient when products are provided in the market. Besides, Bhattacharjee and Ramesh (2000, p.400) noted that the price is indispensable that the company needs to consider and calculate to bring the highest profit in each stage. However, environmental protection is also considered policy in every business. Businesses can be penalized or deactivated if they do things that affect the surrounding environment such as waste, garbage or air pollution (Lamming & Hampson 1996, p50).",
