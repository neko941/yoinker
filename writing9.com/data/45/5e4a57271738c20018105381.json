        "Medical and health care systems play such an important role in every country people\u2019s life\u2019s and it\u2019s also one of the key features of that countries development ranking. It is expected that all nations should provide free health services although it may not be the most up to dated procedure and treatments due to its high price and expensiveness. This essay will discuss why all nations should give free health services in any quality available despite the high cost of it.",
        "Governments always claim that they have provided a decent health care system through their insurance policies. These policies are designed to cover the most common health issues which do not require a heavy budget. As an example, in my country, if you need to cover some sophisticated diseases, you have to pay the extra money and get supplementary insurance. These issues make people worried about their future and make them feel that their health services are unreliable.",
        "Despite the wrong policies that governments follow on their health programs, the idea of a complete and free of cost medical care system not also affects the societies health quality, but it also pays off in many different ways for the nation. When people are healthy, they work more proficiently and there will be stronger economics. As a record, if an employer takes care of his employee's health conditions, it will surely cost less for him to replace him and train another professional in the long term.",
        "This essay argued that countries should provide free health care and medical services freely to its citizens due to the high cost of it. In my opinion, expending on society's health system not only costs less but it will pay off in the long term despite its quality and the technology and also governments should invest more in people\u2019s health."
