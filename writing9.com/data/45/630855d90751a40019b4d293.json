        "Nowadays, popular events like the football world Cup and other international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way. Yes, I agree with that.",
        "Recent days in worldwide there are so many sporting events organised by different organisations. Football World Cup, Olympic games, Paralympic games, ICC Cricket World Cup and Tennis World Cup are some examples. These events are popular in different regions of the world. But people all over the world like to watch the events even if their country is not participating it. They witness the special occasions of the events and enjoy them and they live in the event. They move here and they are trying to kick the ball by sitting in their living rooms. That's how people feel it.",
        "On the other ,hand by living in these events people forget their problems. They feel free and their minds will be out of tension. For  example, India is a huge country with a large population. Most of the people in India live in tension because of so many problems. When they come to watch cricket matches they live in that march and forget all their difficulties. That is why those society cannot tolerate it when the Indian team lose the match. They act very aggressively.",
        "In conclusion, most   people live under tension. By watching popular events like the football World Cup, Cricket World Cup, Olympic games, Tennis games and other international sporting events people can release tension and patriotic emotions in a safe way."
