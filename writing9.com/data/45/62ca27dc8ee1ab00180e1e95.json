        "On the other hand,I still accept that parents should make the majority of choices so that children will be more responsible towarda others.They have controlled completely over them with some forces ,not with struggling stress.For instance,some parents have made the logical and ethical choice to be vegetarians and they force their children to do the same.This can have a positive effect not only on their individual health but also on the environment.And also,parents should have some  behaviors to keep them up with the trend of times.",
