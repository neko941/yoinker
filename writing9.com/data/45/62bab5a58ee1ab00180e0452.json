        "the chart above explaining about the export earnings between 2015 and 2016 and the percentage of each category compared with every year. Overall we can see that the export earnings from 2015 to 2016 gradually increased.",
        "to begin with there are various categories of exports from the highest to the lowest earnings of 2015-2016. According to the first categories we can notice that the values percentage of petroleum products gained a tiny fraction, in spite of, it had the most earnings of all categories in 2015-2016. Furthermore, engineered goods and textiles had rapidly grown from other categories, particularly the textiles despite it being the least earnings, however it had significantly increased from 2015 to 2016 and was up to more than 15%.",
        "Moreover, there has been an increase in agricultural products even though it was being the least growth in export earnings. On the other hand, after looking at those four categories there has been a slightly different in gems and jewellery which dip up to 5.18% from 2015.",
        "To summarize, the highest value of export was still from petroleum products and there was an opportunity for some categories growth such as engineered goods and textiles to contribute more for exports earnings in the future."
