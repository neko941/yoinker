        "Some people have the opinion that data related to the various fields should be shared in order to people have access to it,however some people including myself have the opposite point of view.",
        "Sharing academic, scientific and business information can have drawbacks for both society and people. In the era of technology people can access to all kinds of information that they want to know about just by one click. As much as the information becomes widespread among common people the problems along with get more and more. Finding reliable information becomes difficult, and at the same time some of it can be misleading. For instance, someone who has a medical problem instead of visiting the doctor may search on the net in order to find some solutions to his problem, and follow one of the instructions which can make his life in danger. Because he does not take care about different parts and is common people. Having not enough knowledge and trusting the information on websites, books or other social pages can cost a lot.",

They may have the opinion that it is not fair to share data that someone has bothered a lot, worked and studied to gather it freely which loses its worth. Unfortunately, there are always people who misuse. In other word they may use that special kind of information and put their name on it, and the right of copy right and other rules become meaningless.",
