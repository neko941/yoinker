        "Nowadays mobile phone is necessary to everyone.  While some parents think mobile phones good to have with their children, but others argue that not to have mobile good idea.  In this eassay, i will discuss both sides of the argument.",
        "Firstly, today mobile phone is neccessary to every one in daytoday life style. If you kids having mobile is good and useful for certain tasks.  For example, if your kids are running late from school or college you can track them and any urgency directly call them and convey the message.  Also mobile phone use for browse study material as well as use for checking their bank info and required info.",
        "But other hand, people using mobile phone for useless purpose like chating with unknown persons and wasting time with smart mobile phones.  For example, they are using mobile for social media and other adult sites, then children will get into wrong track.  Moreover, nowaday children are addicted to video games in mobile.  Recently I heard the news, somebody is playing pudge game and he loose his life due to the accident.  So mobile usage should be in restricted mode.",
