Furthermore,   All my friends  admired  the table, which was designed perfectly, on the corner for us .  We  really like  beef tenderloin with fresh salad and absolutely mind- blowing.  Similarly , the birthday cake that was served is the best one that I have ever eaten.",
        "I thought that small suggestion would contribute your fine place.  You may  add  the calories list along  with  the food. Because two of friends, who are on diet,    asked the calories list of food.  One more thing is that the parking area of back of the  restaurant  was really dark and  so, if you  add  lighting there, it makes it easy for the customer to  park their cars.",
