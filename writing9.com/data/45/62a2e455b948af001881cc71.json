        "Overall, the income from sales in all sections except agriculture rose over the period. The gems and jewellery were the only items in this group that dropped in value.",
        "The output from the sales of the petroleum products and engineering goods constituted just over 60 and about 57 billion dollars, respectively, in 2015, while the income from these sections a year later was approximately at the same level, at approximately 63 billion dollars. The profit from the export of gems and jewellery declined over the period. It was at about 43 and 41 billion dollars, in 2015 and 2016 respectively. the outcome of sales in the agriculture section experienced a slight increase by about a billion dollars and reached 31 billion in the last year. The export of the textile products made up just over 30 billion dollars in 2016, rising the previous year's outcome by about 6 billion.",
        "The most significant changes in the 2015-2016 period were in the value of the engineering goods and textile products, at 8.5% and about 15%. The rise in the cost of agricultural products comprised a mere 0.81 %. The gems and jewellery declined by approximately 5.2 %, while the petroleum products rose in price by 3%."
