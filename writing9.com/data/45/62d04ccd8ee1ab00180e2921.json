        "One important stage in a child's growth is certainly the development of a conscience, which is linked to the ability to make difference between right and wrong. It is generally believed that punishment can help them to learn this distinction.However, it seems to me that punishment does not have much of role to play in this.",
        "First of all the question depends on the age of child.To punish a very young child is both wrong  and senseless as an infant will not understand what is occuring or why he or she is being punished. Punishment can create some pschological problems in the later years of the child. Most of researches show that some criminal and cruel people were exposured to violence and punishment of physical nature in their early ages. When even they did not understand what were doing and why they were being punished. Majority of these kind of people always say taht if we know reason of punishment before getting penalty we can change our behaviours and we also can pay much attention to this problem. However, a child can be rewarded for good behaviour and it can help them to be discourged from bad. This kind of approach will achive more than harsh punishments, which might entail many negative consequences.",
        "It is true that punishment causes some negative results but after that , if sanctions are needed the punishment should not be of a physical nature, as that just sends the message that it is acceptable for larger people. Punishment should not be in any cruel way.",
        "Finally, children try to immitate their parents for this reason parents have to be good role model for this children with their good attitudes.",
        "In conclusion, importance of punishment depends on the age od child and measurement of mistake but if it is needed then it is should not be of a physical basis it can contain little messages but it is not acceptable by cruel way."
