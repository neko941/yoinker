        "People believe that spending money on arts is useless and not essential, instead they appreciate if the govenment spent this money on the society on more beneficial things. I am writing this essay to mention the reasons why spending dollars on arts is good for our community.",
        "Initially, arts is considered as a part of education. Each piece of art has a tragedic history. In other words, histroical paintings, for example, describe an event, or represents a historical place. Without those paintings, historicans may could not now the plot of many events or wars that happened long time ago. On the other hand, many sculptures represent known philosphers, scientists, and even strong rulers who died long ago and shared in the development we are in today.",
        "Second, without these arts that the government bought, we would not have the history we learned and that will be passed to our kids. As well as, many theories will not be known. Such as, the atomic theory, how our bodies work, and also what natural treartments we can use when we get ill.",
        "But, why people prefer spending money on the society instead of arts? Many countries do not have a good acommondations, government do not see this, they concentrate on things and forget about others.",
        "Also, many people suffer from serious diseases, some cannot afford the expenses to treat themselves or one of his/her family members, the authorities should take care of those people and help them.",
        "At the end, history is very important in many ways, and we should care to learn it. But, as well as the importance of history, also being good and loyal to their society is the government's responsibilty, so they should know how people are living and ask for their needs."
