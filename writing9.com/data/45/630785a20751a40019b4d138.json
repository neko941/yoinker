        "There is no denying that since the pandemic started, work conditions change all around the world. Many people can be in favour or against of working from home. Furthermore, the advantages of working from home has far outweight the disadvantages, and in this essay I will support this view with arguments in the following paragraphs.",
        "To start with the advantages of working from home there are infinite reasons why this is an effective way of working. First of all, you don't have to commute because this is an incredible waste of time and money. Second of all, you can create an enjoyfull enviroment from your own house. For example, setting up some candles, some relaxing music, and it is the perfect time to spent out with your pet. Third of all, your schedule can be even more flexible that it was before. From my perspective, working from home is an excelent alternative to be more focus on the job that you are working on.",
        "On the other hand, some people claim that working from home has huge disanvantages in their lifes. Not only the felling of being lonlly is the first reason but also the feelling of being traped in their apartment or house. Which eventually can cause depression in this individuals. Clearly for them, going out and spending time with their peers are key in their lifes.",
        "In this essay I argued that working from home has many benefits in peoples lifes, that is an incredible way of being more efficient and focus in your work. Personally, working from home has more advantages than disadvantages."
