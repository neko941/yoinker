        "Many believe that media brought negative impacts for people's lives.I believe that medias can have beneficial and outbacks in our lives. This essay will discuss both views in the following paragraphs.",
        "On the fist hand, it is no doubt that media provides up-to-date information about various topics around the world in very short time. People can recieve any kind of notification by their eletronic applications via different channels like Facebook, twitter or other social apps. For example, during Covid-19, people are able to know the lastest news like which regions are in higher risk and what is the regulation if they want to go back their countries. Therefore, media can help us to get a lastest information across the world.",
        "On the other hand, this also can be a negative impact due to massive resources spread reaidly across from media. Most people not only wouldn't digest those information first, but also hard to distinguish whether it is true or false. After read the message, then they will share to their friends or families. Nevertheless, most of them are just a fake news. For instrance, my grandparents always share such messages in our family whatsapp group. These messages are from their friends and they even don't know there are true or not or how many precentages are real. Thus, we can see that although media can spread information timly, it also lead to comfusing people.",
        "In conculsion, i think media like a double-edged sword. In spite of media bringing us different benefical and drawbacks, i stil believe that it can make our life become more positive if people are able to use it correctly."
