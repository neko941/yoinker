        "There is no doubt that internet is gaining more and more popularity nowadays. While some people believe that internet shopping is extremely advantageous , others might argue that it has its fare share of drawbacks. In this essay i will discuss both and present my support on the former view.",
        "As internet is growing rapidly, all the customers are being diverted towards shopping online which is creating a big problem for the people who own physical stores. This is because internet allows customers to shop from the comfort of their couch. For example, Amazon has become the most famous online store in the last decade due to the convenience and comfort it provides to its customers. In contrast, if customers would still buy from stationary shops, they would lose more of their precious time and as a result, will not have time for more important things.",
        "On the other hand, I believe that online shopping has made our lives much easier. Now we have more opportunities than ever before for online stores are much quicker to set up and require only a minimal investment. For instance, drop shipping is gaining huge popularity these days as everyone who could not afford to open a physical store before,  now have the opportunity to do it.",
        "In conclusion, even though shopping from the internet has its drawbacks like creating a threat for the store owners, i personally believe that the advantages of online shopping outweighs its disadvantages."
