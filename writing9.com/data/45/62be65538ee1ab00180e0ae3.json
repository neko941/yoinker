        "Some people claim that granting children to make their own options in daily life such as foods, clothes and other activities make them to be selfish people who only understand their own wishes. However, other people assume that it is essential for children to make decisions about matters that can have impacts on them.",
        "On one hand, children can be unhealthy, stubborn, over confident and selfish if they are allowed to do everything with their own options. For instance, they eat whenever they are hungry even though the foods are not suitable with their health and unbalanced for their meals. Moreover, they believe that their choices are always right since they were young. Subsequently, they cannot judge what is wrong and what is right because both their eyes and brains are covered with their thoughts. And then, they do not accept any suggestions although their parents and teachers advice what to do. They only know about their choices whether they can affect the other people or not.",
        "On the other hand, teaching children to be independent plays an important role nowadays. Everybody were born lonely so that they need to stand on their feet in their lives. Some children are taught to make decisions about every matter. Consequently, they are confident enough to face every problems without fearless. Moreover, not only their brains but also their thoughts are intelligent and extended. When their parents leave them or passed away, they will never hesitate to make decisions with their own thoughts.",
        "In conclusion, form my point of view, being an independent is smarter than the other people. And then, paying respect to our choices of can make us confident. I am the one who is not controlled by my parents since I was young. So, allowing children to make decisions is an awesome way to teach them how to live alone.",
