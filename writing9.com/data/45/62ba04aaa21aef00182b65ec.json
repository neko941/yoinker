But the current era and rise in competition this proverb is demolished. Nowadays the working class people dont have enough time to look after his own health due to work loads, excessive working hours. To tackel this issue the govement has to play a vital role in implementing the fixed weekly working hours and complusory holiday on Sundays as well as festival days. On that invest in parks with out door gym equipments.",

When they come back home their full energy got used in office and they lost insperation to go to park and do some excerise. They eat dinner spend time with family and go to sleep to live for other day. This is brings disease and health get deteroite. For, instance in Japan its ilegal to become fat.",
