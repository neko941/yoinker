        "It is no doubt true, that it is the thought of some that the essence of being wealthy is the privilege it gives to assist others. Personally, I quite agree with this.",
        "Wealth is a gift by providence, as such, it does not come solely by wisdom or hard work. This explains why lots of wise and industrious people are not rich. For this reason, it is a popular belief that whoever is blessed to be wealthy should assist others especially the poor and the less privileged. Not only that this is good as a moral obligation but also it is the most essential thing to do with affluence . Lending weight to this is the fact that investing in people and impacting positively in the life of persons is the way to greatness, power and unbeatable influence, because people is power and one of the greatest assets. A good example is the president of Uganda. When he was the MD of a company, though he was not so rich but he helped people with the little  he had. Subsequently when he joined politics, he did not lack people to support him. Though he was no where near his political rivals in terms of money, he won all positions in contested with large margin. He seamlessly kept rising in political position from a Governor for a President. Therefore, the act of philanthropy and benevolence by the rich is not only good for the people, but also benefits him, the rich.",
        "Although , there is a negating idea that the most crucial thing the rich with his money is to keep investing in profitable business in order to be richer. But this I dissent. What could be better than the satisfaction and fulfilment we have when we see people happy and relieved from difficulties because of helps with rendered. Moreover, an affluent man who does not invest in people will never rise to greatness and will know no fulfilment.",
        "In conclusion, I believe that the most important thing the wealthy can do with their money is to help people, as this is a privilege they have and this even benefits them in a way.",
