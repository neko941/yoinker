        "How much freedom should children have on everyday matters is controvercial. People, who are gainst giving the boudless liberty to children, believe that it will result in creating a selfish and self centered society, while other opine that certain level of freedom is necessary to nurture the creativity in growing minds. I believe, parents should niether give a total free hand, nor they should restrain them on every step.",
        "On the one hand, allowing children to do whatever they want to and letting them chose anything they like, creates a sense of arrogance and self centerdness which is deterimental to their growth and mental development. For instance, the psycholofical researches have revealed that, the childhood events and experiences have a lasting effect on shaping anyone's personality and mental approach. That is why parents should make important decisions for children, those are beneficial for their future.",
        "On the contrary, researches have expressed that, restraining a child from making simple decisions in the daily life, creates a sense of depreviation and such children lack confidence. That means if a child knows, his liking or dissliking will not making any difference in taking a final decision, it will put an end on his , eventually,thought process and  it may shape him to be a good follower, but definitly, not a good leader.For instance, when i was a child, i was not even bothered to be asked, whether i like or not what is being brought or bought for me, while i could see other pupils doing thing of their own choice, it made me frustrated and my school grades were decreased greatly.",
        "In conclusion, offering a child freedom to make simple decisions on day to day bases, will polish his thinking, encourage better ideas and rationalise his choices which are key qualities of a successful man."
