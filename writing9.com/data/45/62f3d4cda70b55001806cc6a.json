        "I am writing to complain that I have been hurt in a minor accident inside your supermarket in Downtown. I have been a VIP member of the supermarket for decades and I have been keep buying foods and daily goods in the supermarket for years. The polite workers and the well ranged products as well as the clean flat has always make the shopping time in the supermarket enjoyable.",
        "However, I was buying things in the supermarkt this afternoon when there were several children were playing around. The children were so dedicating in running and chatching after each other. One of the children fell down because of the slippery floor with some water on the ground. It was luckily that the child didn't hurt very much. However, the sheet nearby was pulled down by the child  when the child falled down and one of my tow was badly hurt. I went to the hospital and the doctor told me to have a rest for at least two to three weeks. That is a big problem for me as my job does not allow me to work at home and I need to take care of my two little young baby. Although I am sure that no body want these things happen, I do believe that the supermarket can do more to avoid such things happen again. For example a notice of no running in the supermarket or keep the floor dry by cleaning the waters in time.",
