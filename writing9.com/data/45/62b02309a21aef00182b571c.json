        "Economy plays a vital role in our life. Although, people those who are qualified these days are involved as labours due to least job vaccancies along with competent individuals. As the world is developing , the monthlu expenditure of people are aslo rising with it. The crucial point that lays is few of it believes that there should be an equity  in salary of both labours and professionals.",
        "To begin with, an average amount of pay scale should be given to daily paid workers ,as a minimum of it is required to fulfill the basic needs of life which includes food to meet the nutrients required, education for a good future of it as well as for the country's development. It is evident that those who belong to a group of underpreviliged caterory have to go through a lot because of financial crises.",
        "In addition, after being qualified also people are not getting employed as per their educational degrees. The main reason for this is overpopulation as well as lack of placements in companies.I have noticed a lot of people who graduated from deemed universities also either run their small business or work ina factory to load goods and many more.",
        "Furthermore, it is also seen that those who persue subjects like literature, philosophy are less likely to get a better employment. As this world is becoming technologically advanced due to globalisation . The rate of hiringing employers is also increasing in this field. Our daily life process is way more dependent on electronic devices which includes bill payments, shopping and many more.",
        "I agree that those who work in higher posts has a good yearly income but along with that those who work physically hard should also get a  salary nearby to the high skilled workers. it will lead not only to equity moreover will enchance the level of living a good life as its reduces the rate of poverty."
