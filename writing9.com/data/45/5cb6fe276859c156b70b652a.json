        "As a consequence of globalization, nations have more chances to trade/interact with each other, and have minimal differences. I think, although it is a valubale change, but we must acknowledge the impact it will have on cultural diversity of the countires.",
        "On the one hand, globalization has brought us a myriad of benefits as a result of international uniformity, that means if we can understand other cultures, we can comprehend to cooperate with them, reduce conflicts and positively augemt businesses. Firstly, international similarity also stand for improved living stand throughout the world, people are not bounded geographical boudries, they can purchase items alike globaly. For example, a resident of china can buy things from the USA, which is now possible through online shopping .e.g. amazon, taoba etc. This has played a level ground in boosting international economy.",
        "On the other hand, globalization can also have some drawbacks, the regional values and cultural diversity is the beauty of the world, due to easy travelling, online businesesses, similar style of infrastructure, local culture and languages can be assemilated. Greater countries, like, USA and China can easily influence the smaller countries like, Veitnam. For example, younger veitnamese are more impressed by the hollywood and chinese movie culture, resulting in decreased appreciation of their ancient culture plays.",
        "In conclusion, even though, globalization is beneficial for all people around the world, its drawbacks of reducing cultural diversity, outweigh its benefits."
