        "It is argued that more funds should be allocate to the development of railways instead of building highways. This essay agrees to this viewpoint that railways should be more funded. Firstly, this essay will discuss that trains are fastest and cheap means of transportation and secondly, it will also help in minimizing environmental pollution.",
        "Metros are considered to be a speedy and an economic way of transportation. Many people choose to travel by train as to save money and a lot of time to travel within or outside the country. For example in Europe, metro system is very popular and people prefer to travel by train to their work on daily basis and many tourists also opt trains to visit different countries of Europe due to its affordability and accelerated pace.",
        "Furthermore, metro also helps in reducing environmental pollution. Fossil fuel burning vehicles create huge amount of pollution e.g. air, noise and visual , caused by traffic congestion. For example in Pakistan, a number of people travel by roads, as trains system is not so strong over there, which ultimately causes air pollution and different types of vehicles create a lot of noise and visual pollution.",
        "In conclusion,  railways should get enough financial investment by government, than roads. It is agreed that trains are low in cost and a speedy transport to travel within or outside the city or country. It also helps in diminishing environmental pollution caused by traffic jams on roads. It is suggested that government should initiate campaigns to encourage people to travel through metro and avoid using fossil petroleum vehicles to overcome environmental adulteration."
