        "People have different view about whether giving longer prison sentences is the best way to reduce crime or there are better ways to reduce crimes. It seems to me that we have more ways to reduce crime than longer prison sentences.",
        "On the one hand, there are many benefits of giving longer prison sentences. Firstly, if we giving longer prison sentences, many criminals will be more feared and scared and not to commit crimes again. It is the best punishment for wrongdoers, it help to prevent a serious threat to society. Secondly, citizens feel safer and more secured when lawbreakers is put into the prison. For example, in a residential, there are many burglar, so the residents very worry. If criminal is put into the prison people feel comfortable.",
        "On the orther hand, there are more better ways to reduce crime than giving longer prison sentences. Firstly, the criminals will be put on probation if they commit minor offenses such as: pick pocketing. The lawbreakers was followed by police make sure that the criminal will not reoffend in sociability. Secondly, if the criminals become good person after reform offenders, the government will decrease the prison sentences. They will rehabilitate to the society earlier than they expected. In addition, the criminal should join in vocational training or take part in community service. The wrongdoers will ghet a job after being released.",
        "In conclusion, I think the government have more better ways to reduce crime and help they rehabilitate to society"
