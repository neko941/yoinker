        "Childhood obesity become a typical sign of deteriorating public health. It is said that the government should have the responsibillitity. In my opinion, the authority is not only singled out, parents and schools also take responsible for it.",
        "Firsly, the goverment\u2019s responsibility is to ensure the people life. They must detect a threat and disseminate information about the risk. But beside the encouragement of regular exercise and healthy diets, i can harly see any new point in their boring campaign. They seem to ignore this potential epidemic. As the result, according to WTO, there are about 41 million children under 5 years old and 340 million children aged 5-19 years old came down with this disease. Secondly, they build a giant curriculum for children from young age in which focus on mathmetics, science and literature, lacks hours of extracurricular activities. So that students don\u2019t have any concept or skill to take care of themselves or self-esteem whether this food is good nor not.",
        "On the other hand, parents also hold themselves accountable. Instead of teaching them the important of healthy meal, they buy junk food and processed food which is much faster. But they don\u2019t know that these things contain massive sugar that not good by no means to eat it. In addition, the vices of parent like spending too much time on smart phone or stay inactive life affect their son. Because of the imitation, it is not difficult for their child to follow their habit. Hence, If the parents change their mind, i swear that childhood obesity is no longer to exist . they can take up by engage in sports, limit sugar intake, hit the gym, eat a balanced diet.....and especially, show your children how delicious the healthy food is, educate them the value of active life.",
        "In conclution,  the life of our children fully depends on the goverment, schools and parents.",
        "Change for the better and our younger generation will develop in the most comprehensive way."
