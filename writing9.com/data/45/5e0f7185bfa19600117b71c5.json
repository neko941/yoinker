        "In the past few decades it has been undisputable that financial resources has been indispensable and prominent part of human well-being. A certain number of experts hold an opinion that adolescents adore to receive money as a present , whereas multiple opinions postulate that money has unpleasant impact on teenagers .Analysis of arguments in favor of both sides of the coin will be envisaged in the framework of this essay supported with my personal viewpoint.",
        "On the one hand, advocates of the monetary gifts adhere to their position that money become an integral part of contemporary society and almost every area requires money. Hence, it would be wise to give the money to juvenile\u2019s birthday . Another convincing argument in favor gifts of money is that tremendous and priceless opportunity to purchase desired items. An explanation lies on the fact that in most cases parents have no exact ideas about children\u2019s wish-list and buy items based on their desires. However, in reality, adolescents might not like   purchased presents that were given ,even it could indeed be unnecessary stuffs.",
        "On the other hand, opponents of money gifts see no prominent benefits of giving financial resources to teenager\u2019s birth date, on the basis of several arguments. First and foremost, there is no absolute guarantee that teenagers will spend provided money on really useful items, since they might purchase  drugs or alcohol beverages. Besides, a common scientific belief proves the harmful affect of complimentary money to teenager\u2019s psychology. This inevitably leads children to believe that such present is normal , or even desirable and gradually the value of money will be lost.",
        "In the light of above mentioned arguments, it may be summarized that albeit money can provide numerous opportunities , I , personally reckon that there are range of alternatives to money gifts that would be actually helpful as long as present would be carefully chosen."
