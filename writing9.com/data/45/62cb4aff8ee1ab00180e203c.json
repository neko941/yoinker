We have got different musical instruments Let me give an example; tambourine, triangle, trumpet, trombone, drums, harp, saxophone, keyboard and violin. When we are going to a party or birthday We can listen to a beautiful tune. Some people enjoy hearing soul. we can listen to rap everywhere. The piece has a different sound.  The rock is very beautiful. My sister loves to listen to music with dance when she is going to school she listens to singing. I remember when I was a child my mother bought a piano for me and I loved it so much and I tried to learn the piano. I gave a harp to my friend and my friend loved it so much and she enjoyed it.",
