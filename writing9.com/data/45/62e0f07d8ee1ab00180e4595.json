        "None of us can reject that money is one of factors playing the central role in life. Insufficient finance leads to various difficulties for not only a single individual but also his or her family. In view of this, there is a controversial opinion that the salary is the most notable factor when applying for a job. I am unable to deny the truth of this statement, but I do not completely agree with it. Aside from salary, working environment is also worth our consideration.",
        "While minuscules population is working in order to satisfy their own passions, the majority is struggling with living expenses. In modern society, people have abundance of costs and bills, which need to be punctually paid. Therefore, money is extremely virtual and necessary. Moreover, most of people have a family to feed. Living alone without money is an impossible task, let alone taking care of a whole family with a modest salary.",
        "On the other hand, if a job-seeker only focuses on how much money he or she is going to get for the job, but ignores his or her interest, it is unlikely for him or her to get promotion in the career. When a worker is not really into the task he or she performing, there is neither creativity nor devotion for it. Employees with such work attitude will surely never get exaltation from manager. There is an undeniable fact that, working is not only a way to survive in modern society, but also a daily activity that every single individual has to engage as a part of life. Because of that, we should choose an appropriate job with a comfortable working environment that we can enjoy, but not a high-paid one with a lot of pressures.",
        "Although salary is one of the priorities which should be regarded when someone apply for a job, he or she should consider other aspects such as work-related pressures, relationships with colleagues and superiors and so on."
