        "It is true that student behavior in many countries is getting worse and worse nowadays. There are various reasons why schools have serious issues with pupils'actions, but measures can absolutely be taken to address this problem.",
        "Firstly, the educating the children of parents apparently affects the students' behavioral patterns. Many mothers and fathers neither have the time nor skills required to teach their youngsters not to be rude and actively rebel against school regulations. Secondly, inappropriate behavior of students can be attributed to the social media and video games. A lot of students are behaving aggressively due to the games they often play and the media tools they often use, which show a lot of violence and sadistic scenes. Consequently, fighting with their friends or being discourteous with their teachers are normal actions.",
        "There are some solutions to deal with this issue. I believe that parents should spend more time for the children, be patient and sympathetic to them, and help them to overcome the difficulties in school life. They can also set strict rules and use reasonable punishments in order for them to behave properly and be responsible for their actions. Furthermore, schools should cooperate with the families to guide the students how to use media tools usefully and take part in some extracurricular instead of playing video games.",
        "In conclusion, I believe that all children are born with an innate good nature, which can be easily damaged by their external factors and the wrong education. Therefore, it is necessary to take steps to tackle this problem."
