        "The two maps illustrate the industrial area now and planned future modernization of this place in the town of Norbiton.",

        "Looking at the details, it is evident that today this place is almost vacant and unused. There is a long river on the north side of this industrial area, while the town is located far to the west. Also, there are a small number of factories.",
        "This spot will later undergo striking modernization in the future. In a place where infrastructure almost did not exist before, now will be a big urban area. There will be plenty of new installations, for example, a playground, school, shops and medical centre. There will be a lot of houses as well."
