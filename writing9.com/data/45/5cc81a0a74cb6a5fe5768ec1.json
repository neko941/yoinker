        "Thesedays , foreign language play a vital role in developing education . Several people believe that childrens should be learned new language at primary school while the others content that it is better for students to begin this subject at secondary school . From my perspective , I agree with the first view .",
        "Admittedly , there are drawbacks of studying a new linguistic for the child . Firstly , there are various subjects which are necessery to learn for students at school such as math , history , geography , art \u2026 Childrens can not study a lot of subjects at the same time when they are small age , this makes affects to brain of their . Secondly , childrens should be learn a mother tongue language than learning more languages at primary school , this makes embarrassed and confused for their . Studying more linguistic to lead to childrens can not well focus in many different subjects.",
        "Despite the arguement above , there are merits of learning a foreign languages at primary school . First of all , childrens is a age of developing so they can easy to acquire and inquire a new language at this stage . Students are in the habit of aping the grown ups , therefore they can learn foreign languages by rapidly way . Moreover , childrens alway confident and not feel shy when they practise to pronounce like native people . Secondly , foreign language is really important in the education nowadays . This is a necessery subjects like math , history , \u2026 Further more , learn more than two language helps students can easy to find a good job in the future .",
        "In the final analysis , I believe that there are a lot of advantages of studying a foreign language , therefore childrens should learned this subjects at primary school in order to create many benefits in their future ."
