        "Mostly older people have opinion about any topic which you ask them.They have more experience than younger people and help you to choose right way for you.Because they can find and explain some factors which you could not think about these.Also sometimes we want to doing something but could think results of this act.In this occasion,getting older people's advice may be profitable for any young people.",
        "In addition to this factors,sometimes older people can not understand your idea.Because at the moment we living modern world and tecnology are developing.But some older people have 1900s mentality and they can not understand or do not want to understand today's standarts.As a result of this,sometimes there is misunderstanding between children and their parents.In this occasion get advice from people who is approximately same age as you.You can tell your opinions to each other peer-to-peer. Sometimes this may be more effectible than getting advice from older people.You can evaluate your friend's opinion and do this successfully. Also it is important to pay attention other young people's opinions because they may push you dangerous things such as drug,smoke and etc.",
        "At last,according to my opinion, it is valid to getting advice from both younger and older people.After getting advice someone can analyze two of opinion and choose one of them."
