        "Since the 20th century, the civilization has covered all global aspects due to the foreign languages such as english has connected human together. Some people argue that traveling or working in a foreign country having been caused by learning a foreign language as the only reason. Whilst other ones say there are more reasons to determine. Personally, I exactly agree that there are plenty of reasons about this topic. Nevertheless, they are going to be discussed below.",
        "To begin with the purpose that many of us dreamed to spending their life in abroad whether traveling or working, they need to improve their language skills to ready for their oversea trips. As we seen nowadays, there are many alternative institutes to teach foreign language such as japanese. Moreover, they have a course teaching about japanese culture along with the academic skills to help their students feel easily to adjust themselves.",
        "On the other hand, it can not be denied that no matter places on earth, they are similar. Because of social applications, people can do their works everywhere. Leading to the result that they learn foreign languages in order to complete their tasks with international connections for every issues. For example, the business owner want to deal their goods with foreigner so they have to learn the foreign language to contact the abroad dealers. Another example, since the trade war happened, languages are not only traveling or working but it also dealing with relationship between two nations.",
        "Carefully discussed, learning other languages in order to travel or working is not the main point. In my perspective, there are vary of reasons to regard about learning foreign languages and I am pretty sure that the more foreign languages you get the more benefits you gain."
