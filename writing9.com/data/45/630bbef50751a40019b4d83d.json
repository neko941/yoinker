        "The provided line chart reflects the variations in the quantity of reports which have received by the complaints department of a one airline over a half year period in 2009. In this chart there are 3 types of methods to send the complaints: in person, by email and fax, by telephone.",
        "Overall, after analyzing this chart, it can be found that acquiescent reached to the department in person and by telephone was the most popular ways to use by the end of this period, whilst sending by email and fax gradually decreased over the time. In fact, using fax and email was on the second place at the beginning of this given time.",
        "Between February and March complaints in person, email and fax scored around 700, whilst what have arrived by telephone slightly less than 1000. after words sending in person and by telephone hit the same amount (slightly more than 1000), but by email and fax was less than that and recorded almost 600.",
        "In addition, both methods: In person and by telephone have increased. However, in person slightly less than 200, by telephone scored almost 1800. Eventually sending by email and fax was the lowest and reached below 400 complaints."
