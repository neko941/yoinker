        "Nowadays young folk find trouble when they have to select their work which is become a controversial issue. Some individuality opine that youngsters have right to choose any job while others believe that they should select their job to be more realistic way.",
        "On the one hand, many people are in favour of selecting job freely because they think job satisfaction is more important than job security. Youngster should choose a job which they find comfortable and easy for work. This may help them to concentrate more on work which may lead to a successful career and happy life.  To be more specific, when a person find happiness on work, they have not any kinds of pressure including mental or physical, resulting in their personal life will be more happier. For this reason, young blood should select their favourite job freely.",
        "However, others believe that young pupil should focus more on secure job so that they can progress their life in future. Young folks should choose a job which have a big wage and can earn more money to develop their daily lifestyle. Put simply, If they select a less wage job, they can find difficulty to maintain their daily life. Beacuse ultimately money have the power to lead a modern life. The more money you have, the more beautiful your life will be.",
        "In my opinion,  young blood should think about their future when select a job. Because people work in this earth to live a beautiful and develop life. For doing this, first people have to earn lot of money which make their life beautiful and happier ultimately. For examination ple, if a person have less money, he/ she can\u2019t fulfil his personal or families all demand. This can become a reason of inquietude on family. So, I personally think that young people should choose a job where they can earn more money.",
        "To sum up, choosing favourite job can give satisfaction on work, but big salery can give progressive life. So, job satisfaction is important on work but job secure is more significant on life."
