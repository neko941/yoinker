        "Nowadays, Increase of population creating lots of issues in almost all the countries. Growth in density of people effects in many areas of that contry like provision of basic needs to their people. Even my country is facing the same issue's, which i am going to discuss below.",
        "Major concern for any nation, nowadays is their count of people living in that country. Its reposible of the united state to provide food, shelter, medical aid for their citizens, which made it difficult to provide for their voters. Its not only effect the growth of it but also increase the crime rate to poor standards of living. In present situation according to analysis of UNO, illegal activities are more in poor nations rather than the developed one. The main reason behind it is, due to lower income rate of an individual living there. Not only that increase in people count decrease the living standards but also chances of increase in crime rate. Its also impact on the environment, by creating huge waste from the people living over  there.",
        "Considering the above points, some of the solutions are, government should educate their human resources regarding the consequences of having too many kids. For example, if any income of a person is 3000 with a family of four members then he will spend around 750 per person. For the same income if he has four kids along with his wife, then he can spend around 600 per head. So, he may not be fulfill all their needs, which may impact their basic neccessities like education and medical provision.",
        "In conclusion, Its not only responsibilty of the people's representatives to create an awareness in their public, but also all the educated people should also take an intiative for it."
