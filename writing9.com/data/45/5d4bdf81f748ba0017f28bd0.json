        "In recent years, due to the rapid development of new technologies, people from not only developed countries but also developing countries can purchase a variety of household appliances, such as air conditioning, wash machine, toaster and so forth. Although whether appearing so many household goods is positive development or not is a matter of some dispute, I side with the view that these household commodities are beneficial to our lives.",
        "TV, air conditioning and rice cooker have become three indispensable goods in every families. TV has been entered into families for a long period. TV programmes spread both educational and entertainment plots everyday and everytime for people to enjoy. In other words, rich and colourful TV programmes can enrich children\u2019s extracurricular knowledge and alleviate people\u2019s stress. As to air conditioning, it as temperature conditioner plays an important role. For instance, when extremely low or high temperature arrives, air conditioning will release a large amount of cool air or hot gas which makes the temperature of room more comfortable. According to the latest survey, there are plenty of people died in the excessive hot weather because of the intensification of global warming, while with the help of air conditioning, the number of deaths is declining. As well as those two applicants, rice cooker can be used to enhance efficiency for people to a certain degree, especially for workers. People can use rice cooker with timing function cooking rice in advance and then having hot meals after work, which saves much time and easy to use.",
        "However, some disadvantages of household goods cannot be ignored. A large quantity of TV and computer are widespread used, as far as radiation of them is concerned, scientific evidence has shown that radiation that a working TV or computer produces has the potential to cause brain cancer. In addition, there are more generalized environmental problems caused by the power production of air conditioning. Becaused a large percentage of electricity is created by coal-burning power plants, air conditioning contributes indirectly to the release of greenhouse gases and other pollution.",
        "It cannot be denied that the development of household goods may have some drawbacks. However, taking all factors into account, its advantages carry more water. From my point of view, the use of household appliances should be advocated and encouraged."
