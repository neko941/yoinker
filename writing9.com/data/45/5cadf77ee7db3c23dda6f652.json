        "Some people debate that locally produced food items should be solely relied upon to boost local economy of a region as well as to protect the environment as compared to food brought from far flung areas. Personally, I agree with this approach partially. Although the benefits to rely on indigenously produced items are many, but viable options to fulfill the needs of masses for some regions become limited by this approach.",
        "By opting this strategy, there will be cheaper food items available well as environmentally friendly. The farming-products grown in surplus are exported and as such their prices remain relatively high. Take mango farming in Pakistan, the country is the single largest producer of mango fruit, yet the prices are high as most of the yield is exported and in addition most of forest land is converted to agricultural units to accommodate high demands. As a result the natives do not enjoy this delicious fruit to their fill and they are experiencing effects of climate change as well.",
        "Another reason consistent with this line of thinking to rely on indigenous farming is that people will enjoy healthy fruits and vegetables. People throughout the world have become accustomed to eating fruits and vegetables which are treated by cold-storage process as shelf life of fresh products is merely hours. There was a documentary broadcasted on the Discovery Channel which focused on the nutritional value of storage fruits and vegetables. It concluded backed with ample scientific research that the efficacy of these products were severely affected by cold-storage. Thus, foods that travels through cold-storage processing is not good for health.",
        "Some regions of the world are very population dense and these states rely heavily on others to meet the need of their people. For example, China has a huge population and it  depends a lot on imports of food items to feed its population. The option to depend only on native farmers will result in famine for China. Hence, indigenous production in this case is not a viable and sane approach.",
        "All in all, the befits of this strategy are numerous which includes tackling climate change as well as availability of nutritious foods .However, practically this strategy cannot be adopted in population dense regions."
