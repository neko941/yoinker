        "Advertising sector has emerged with new improved digital ways to source customers. Even consumers cannot ignore the digital adverts in various mediums they use oneveryday basis. It is agreed that advertising encourages wasteful purchase that are actually not needed by prospects. Analysing the emergent models of sourcing with adaptive interests of customers and appealing celebrity endorsements will prove this.",
        "There are many reasons why it propells people to buy unecessary products. Firstly, with the adaptive nature of search engines they gather information of the pages and articles that the buyer browses through. A plausible explanation can be the social media portals which match the interests on common topics wherein the seller can collect information of these users. For instance, watching videos related to cars can bring pop-ups on products on the  screen of the  person hovering across the site. Thus, the viewership of the advert originally for entertainment leads to a sale.",
        "Another reason why this is prevalent is due to interesting creatives involving famous personalities. Why would you not buy a watch promoted by Tom Cruise? Since people who are popular are followed and adored by fans they blindly purchase the item. Only if celebrities actually used the items which they promote would they know the holistic benefits and not by taking fees for it. For instance, a beautiful actress promoting a beauty kit acts as if it is the only reason for her wonderful skin. Therefore, personality and fan following affects the buying patterns.",
        "In conclusion advertising encourages selling of things that the individual has not even inquired & owing to capture of advanced sourcing models in the internet and due to mindlessly taking advice from television or hoardings with their idols this takes place."
