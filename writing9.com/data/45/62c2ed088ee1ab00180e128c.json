        "You can a see a trend in many countries, a lot of young people are leaving the countryside to live in citeis and towns. In some countries it is worse than others, a recent survey suggested that in America 5% of the young adults are leaving the countryside. However, in china this number is 10% and increasing each year.  I will discuss in this essay what I think the problems are that causes this problem and what can be done to solve this situation.",
        "First of all, in many countrysides there is no proper education, which result in that many students will go to the big city to study. For many students they will also live there, because it is to far to travel. This is the first reason why young people are leaving the cities and towns, because they now have new social lives and they often get a job offer in the city where they study, due to the interships that they do.",
        "There are many things that can be done to solve this promlem. In my point of view, it is the travel time that is the main factor in why young people are leaving. All the big companies are located in city centres and you will not change that. So there are two options to help this problem, the first option is that componies need to make it easier to work remotely, with the current day technology it is possible to work remote. The second option is to upgrade the public transportation, in this way it is easier to get to work.",
        "However, the house market is now sky high, so many young people are forced to live in the countryside because they are not capable to pay the rent. So it is important that companies make it possible to work remote and that the governement invest in the public transportation."
