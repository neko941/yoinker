        "In recent years, statistics indicate that young children are more addicted to watching TV than the other generations. Some people attribute this phenomenon to relaxed parental education while others believe that it is the creative content presented on TV that captured the attention of children. In this essay, I will elaborate on the reasons behind this situation and its corresponding solutions.",
        "Admittedly,  relaxed family education plays an important role in affecting children's leisure hobbies. Unlike decades ago, younger parents have become more open-minded and tolerant of children's hobbies as they won't interfere with children's leisure time planning. As a result, children may spend more time in front of the TV screens instead of participating in outdoor activities. Studies reveal that children's screen time has increased significantly more than their parent's. Many students are glued to the TV series and have a hard time focusing on their studies.",
        "To solve this problem, a joint effort from parents and school is required. On the side of parents, it is necessary for them to explain the negative impacts of  watching TV to their children. Clear guidance on how to counteract the negative influence of TV should be given as it may force children to reconsider before they take up the hobby of watching TV. At the same time, schools should provide extracurricular courses for students and encourage them to engage in sports activities.  Theses measures would be effective to inspire children and reduce their screen time."
