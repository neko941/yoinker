        "It is true to say that is a number of coutries young people are encourage to work or travel for a year between finishing high school and starting university studies these days.Atlthough this brings positive effects, there are some negative effects that we should consider.This essay will analyse the pros and cons of this issue",
        "On the one hand it is obvious that there are many significant advantages of working and traveling after gradueing from high school.One of the major plus points is that young people gain a lot of experience and social knowledge.In other words when people are in high school,they live under protected home environment,in the case of any problem,they can seek parents and friends help and advice.But when they travel,they are on their own and if they face any problem,they will learn to deal with it.Needless to say this not only gives them the experience to deal with tough situations later in their life but also gives them confidence",
        "On the other hand there are some adverse consequences that need to be taken into consideration.One of the serious problem is that education process will be disrupted.The student might foget some essential knowledge such as physics and mathematics which is ussually need in the University.In other words students can face some difficulties when they came back to the university.Undoubtedly some people would think that completion the academic studies education is not really neccessarily as long as the money is available",
        "In conclusion,it can be said that there are both positives and negatives of taking a year gap between the high school and the university.My personal view is that",
        "the advantages far outweigh the problems. It is advised that it should be encouraged for young people to work and travel for a year between finishing high school and starting academic studies so they can build a better life for their future"
