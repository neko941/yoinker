        "Many people think that group or team activities can be more useful for life than those activities which are done alone. It seems that argues under that statement will never end. But I totally agree with that!",
        "First of all, human is a collective animals.  There are a huge amount of !-examples -!. The main thing of all of them is that people can not leave without society. And if people have a lack of communication with others it can cause !- psychological -! issues. And to be able to leave colourful and !- healty -! life you should know how to act in society.",
        "Moreover, nowadays, many of educational systems are established on group activitiesactivities. And this is additional proof that humans are able to do their best only with a team. If that statement is not true, why do so smart and high-educated teachers support it?",
        "Lastlast, but not least is that team membership develops many of our useful skills. For example, leadership, personal communication, teamworking. All of them are important to us just to have a good job and social status. And can you imagine someone who is able to develop their leadership skills without other people? It is simply impossible.",
        "To sum up, I should say, that indeed there are some activities that require doing them alone. But what are the most popular sports in the world? Right-teamteam sports, such as football (\u21161) and ice hockey (\u21162). It is always more enjoyable to follow how the whole team works, than to follow   one person."
