        "The working scenario has undergone a major transformation and the current working pattern is in vogue. Some credence that the masses continued with the same company throughout their life,however,another school of thought refutes it by arguing that it is best to be part of a distinct firm, which makes this topic a controversial issue. Let us discuss both  aspects of the argument before coming to a logical stand.",
        "At the onset, it is irrefutable that working style differs through various mindset. First and foremost,the pupils who work their entire life with similar limited group company  might be aware of the environment which makes them perceive familiar  culture, hence experiences more comfortable at workplace. On top of that,employees are cognisant about working style and how to achieve growth ,which leads to  distress and relief from myriad sorts of anxiety in leading the project.",
        "Conversely,those who argue that there are alternative ways by shifting from one agency to another is that, the job seekers can get financial growth,which leads to their lavish lifestyle and can survive deliberately. Furthermore,in a co-operate era, the workers can able to build a powerful network,that makes them flourish their image with applause and also acquire skills in broad perspective which will broaden their horizons. Probing further, the members of the workforce can get a chance to drive themselves in various departments,that can increase their view of experience level and construct more flexible in handling multi-task by migrating to different work areas. For example, it was noticed that people who are deviating to another organisation in due time are more knowledgeable,malleable and risk takers in any situation.",
        "Agglomerating the above discussion,it is evident that working with the divergent firms can raise employee's strength, so I believe that the co-workers should work in the  non-identical places which can aid to foster social network and well financial growth."
