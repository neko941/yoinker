        "As referred above, there will be a significant change in the gate centre to the shape of the Y letter as if there will be two ways. As a result, the number of gates will be increased from 8 to 18. In the same area, the walkway will be replaced with a new innovation of the sky train.",
        "Furthermore, the departures and arrivals doors will be doubled in number in the future. currently, the check-in counter is to the left of the departure gate while in the coming plan it will be replaced on the opposite side from now. New facilities will be added. For instance, there will be two cafe stores, one in the right corner near the departure gates and another one in the left corner next to the ATM cabinet which is considered new facilities in the new plan. Furthermore, the corner near the arrivals gates will be extended for car hire. On contrary, the only two things that remain the same on both maps are security passport control and passport control customs."
