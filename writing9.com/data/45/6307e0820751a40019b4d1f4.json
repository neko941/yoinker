        "In the last years, the rapidly changing modern world such as technology and other events, especially pandemic covid 19 had made creativity have an important role in companies, much is said about how important business innovation is to improve results, especially in today's highly competitive market. But what is it? This word is defined as \u201cthe use of skill and imagination to produce something new or to produce art\u201d. (Oxford Learner's Dictionarie.com. n.d. Creativity). This essay focus on factors that impact creativity and the importance of keeping it on the job.",
        "Firstly it is  important to understand the relationship between creativity and innovation: Typically, creativity is associated with an individual who generates a novel idea, which plays the role of the \u201cseed\u201d (Amabile et al., 1996), \u201croot,\u201d and \u201cstarting point\u201d of innovation (Lin and Liu, 2012). Innovation, on the other hand, is commonly portrayed as a collective effort aimed at the (successful) implementation of creative ideas. The concepts of creativity and innovation are often used interchangeably in the literature (Mann and Chan, 2011). Some authors clarify the relationship, \u201cCreativity and innovation may be considered discipline-based synonyms because different disciplines use different terms and emphasize various aspects of what seems to be the same phenomenon\u201d (Wehner et al., 1991). \u201ccreativity represents the first phase of innovation and echoes the simplistic linear model of innovation\u201d (Rosenberg, 1991)."
