        "Most children are allowed to use phones by their parents in new age.This is believed to help in increase their knowledge and help them become familiar with gadgets for example phones",
        "They end up using these phones to watch cartoons,play games,take pictures and so on. They could therefore become attached to their phones that  most of their time is spent on them.",
        "It could have both positive and negative effects on them. Although,the advantages could be more than the drawbacks.Some children when given the opportunity of having phones use it wisely with parent control,as their being  restricted  from using the phone for a particular time,for example, most parents allow their kids use the phones during playtime only. They are only allowed to play games and watch educative films or cartoons with it.This will help such children to learn more and prevent them from spending excess time on their phones.",
        "Other kids,that are restricted or controlled by their parents could be affected negatively as this will result in the misuse of those handsets of smartphones.They end up browsing the internet through it and discovering various sites that could influence them in a bad way,for  example pornographic sites.",
        "In my opinion, I believe,it's a good development as it will help to expose the children to new happenings around them.And educate them more on their vocabulary, teaching them new things.It  helps them to relax and keep them calm In a kind of way.So with parent guide,the advantages of using gadgets are more than",
        "it's disadvantages."
