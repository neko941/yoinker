        "Global temperatures are rising throughout the years and one obvious growing evident is that it is caused by man-made activities. Sensitive topic such as this requires our genuine concern and appropriate action. As I look into this, I find that there are a few causes leading to this issue and I will state them below.",
        "To start of, the business mind of human beings are often causing the environment serious damage. People have been cutting off trees for their logs, construction material, furniture and paper making. Besides that, referencing to the recent Australia forest fire, 24 people are caught suspected to lit the forest for their own convenience and causes a huge outbreak of uncontrollable flames around the country. These action are one of the main cause to global warming because the trees helps to absorb CO2 and release them as oxygen that helps cool down the air. Hence, less tree also means more heat trapped on earth while burning also increases temperature.",
        "Another reason is that, people are always looking for convenience especially in the agriculture field. We can take paddy field for instance, after harvesting the crops, farmers usually lit the fire and burn the field to get rid of everything on it by saving cost and time. However, this activity clearly lead to more heat generated by the CO2 released and from the burning flames.",
        "In conclusion, with an influential issue such as this, a soulution is much needed. Government should start applying restrictions on logging activities and make replanting a compulsory act in the industry. Other than that, forest and field burning should also be banned in all countries and those who fail to obey the rules should face serious penalty."
