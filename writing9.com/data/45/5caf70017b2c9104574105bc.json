        "A mode to transfer information to other and by sayings or writing or any other was is called as communication which has been there since the beginning of mankind. Now-a-days with growing technology, one can sit in a room and get connected to many other through an invisible network called internet and is growing enormously.",
        "Anyone can establish a link to social media sites with the help of a single click and these provides the best platform. Some of the greatest and most widely opted ones are Facebook, Twitter, snapchat, WhatsApp etc. People from a remote location can also make friends from cities sitting alone at backyard. The major advantages are that there is no location barrier, no time barrier and no language barrier or in other words it is flexible. The best examples is when Ryan Jon from London found his biological father on Facebook. This was the finest example which implies that online communication establishment is effectively great.",
        "But with all these advantages and advancement, there is a cost associated to it which I personally believe is too big. Staying connected virtually is making humans less emotionally connected. For example now-a-days children make friends through there gadget and not from playground. There was a time in past when people were more eager to meet new friends in person which used to strengthen the bond and is lacking the most now-a-days. The dept is fading away.",
        "In my opinion, there should be a balance of online and offline communication which help us to grow maturely."
