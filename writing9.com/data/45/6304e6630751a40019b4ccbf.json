        "The map illustrates about the change in the infrastructure of the University campus between 2006 and the present day.",
        "Overall, there are many changes in the building of the campus. Most of the old building is rebuilt with modern infrastructures and the scale of these building are broadened with many higher towers. Besides that, in 2016, the lawn and seating area, which is located in the centre of campus, is evicted for other purposes.",
        "First of all, the university offices located on the north of the campus are altered by the science building for the purpose of science activities. Besides that, student accommodation, which is next to the university offices, is broadened with the second block.",
        "Secondly, after 16 years, the teaching block is changed into an art building to serve for arts. Simultaneously, the shops and restaurants are modified by another student accommodation. In addition, these figures are incorporated into the student facilities- shops offices and put to change for the old student accommodation at the corner in 2006. Although in the past, the lawn & seating area was the place for students to take a break, this factor is eliminated and the university campus just has the lake in the middle."
