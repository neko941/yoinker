        "Few people are of the view that having physically fit",
        "players and the team, determines success in games. On contrary, other argue that wining  psychological stability plays a vital role. However, I favour the latter notion as positive thinking boosts morale and eventually helps in achieving the desired goal. In the upcoming, essay both these views will be discussed along with personal opinions. In sports, keeping a tonnedbody is always desirable. Various outdoor sports activities demand stamina and strength. Moreover, athletes have to go through rigerous training in order to cop up with different on- field challenges. All of this has proved beneficial for getting the upper hand on their opponent team. For example many known playersspend most of their time exercisingand practising different techniques in order to perform well in an  actual matches.",
        "On the other hand",
        ", Mental stiffness is more important to overcome undesirable obstacles that can arise due to many reasons. Keeping an optimistic image about the result can help the teams or players not only stick to their strategies but also to feel motivated. Furthermore,  a strong mental attitude provocates sports people to push their limits. For instance, in, games few situations comes up when scores are unevene and players may feel demoralised but with goal -oriented mindset groups can turn the tide in their favour. Apart from it, while training for game players get exhausted or may even face injuries but if they keep their focus intact they are able to set records and can recover from any fatalities.",
