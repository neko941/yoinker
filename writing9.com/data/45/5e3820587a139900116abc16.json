        "Staying with families brings students some merits like they do not need to worry about expenditures or their meals. However, this makes children extremely dependent on their parents, and taking university lectures in a different urban area would be more beneficial. I am a strong advocate of this approach, and i think that the advantages do outweigh the disadvantages.",
        "On the one hand, it is clear that travelling to a different city for higher studies would bring students' lack of care from their families, thereby adversely affecting them easily, for instance, some students have tendency to use stimulants and influence their outcomes. In addition, living alone caused some pupils homesickness, and consequently distract them from schooling.",
        "On the other hand, i agree that the benefits of this solution would prove to be worthwhile. It provides students with valuable lessons. In particular, they will learn how to be more independent during houseworks  such as cooking meals, washing clothes and cleaning the house. Moreover, they can understand the value of money and learn to use it wisely. Furthermore, not sharing living space gives students free time to enjoy doing what they want, hence forming their lifestyle and personalities.",
        "In conclusion, while living independently away from family has both advantages and disadvantages, it seems to me that its advantages would be more important regarding."
