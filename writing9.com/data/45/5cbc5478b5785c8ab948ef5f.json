        "During the last football world cup there was an allegation made by the International Human Rights Organization, that the football manufacturers in Pakistan had employed underage minors as child laborers. Due to the backlash from the media organizations the companies had released a statement including three points justifying their action. Firstly, the parent\u2019s consent was taken prior to the hiring of underage employees. Secondly, they were hired during the summer vacation days. Finally, the time which they had spent was valuable since they had gained valuable trade skills.",
        "I almost entirely disagree with the statements of the manufacturing companies. Recent statistics published by the labor office of Pakistan shows that the unemployed skill individuals has increased in the last year. This was as a result of corporate offices opting to go with cheap unskilled minors with poor working conditions rather than unionized adult skilled workforce. These days the lower middle class and poor families can barely make ends meet thanks to the inflated economy. They would prefer for their children to work as manual labors for a mediocre salary rather than sending them to school and securing a bright future.",
        "I am for children from the age of fourteen years to work for a part time job but with conditions such as, it should not affect theirs studies, should not involve hard labor such as lifting heavy equipment or working a jack hammer and finally their pay should be justified. Finally the government should also be involved and regulate this workforce. In case of any violation there should be fined and temporarily banned."
