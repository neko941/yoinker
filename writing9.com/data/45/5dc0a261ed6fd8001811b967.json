        "In recent times there have been a number of ailments which are attributed to excessive labour. This essay will discuss factors that are responsible for it as well as measures to be taken to tackle the menace",
        "One of the causes of stress related disease is poverty. This is so because when there is insufficient funds to cater a person's basic necessities, the tendency to consume an unbalanced diet which often leads to malnutrition becomes high. Another factor responsible for this pitfall is highly challenging jobs. The reason for this is that If there are less hands on deck to perform a particular task at work, the fewer individuals who are available would obviously be overwhelmed since they will be saddled with more responsibilities than their energy can carry. To illustrate, in the United Bank for Africa where my husband works, a colleague was reported to have been struck with stroke few hours after he resumed at the office. Test conducted revealed  that the incident was as a result of accumulated stress. this shows that poor standard of living as well as overwhelming responsibilities can lead to health breakdown.",
        "To arrest this predicaments, the government should make provision to cover for the basic necessities of the citizens.  For example, there should be availability of adequate minimum wage that can afford a balanced meal for the country's inhabitants on a daily basis. Also companies should invest in more employees in order to reduce the workload of the staff on ground.",
        "This essay has itemized reasons why there have been increased stress in related ailments. it has also explained certain procedures to remedy this issue."
