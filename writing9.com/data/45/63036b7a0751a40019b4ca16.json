        "Learning the difference between right and wrong for children at an early age is a fundamental skill. A punishment can be a way to teach them to be better generations in the future. I completely agree with this idea.",
        "To begin with, the young one has no idea about what is good or bad for an action. Thus, they need assistance from adults to make it clear. If parents have never implemented punishment to their kids, how can kids\u2019 behaviour be built. For example, a child pushes her friend in the playground while they are playing together, and her parents who are whatching it prefer to do nothing. This can cause her to do same thing again in the future, and might give her impact ending up with no friends.",
        "In other hand, kids need a control of their life. Control can be made by giving an appropiate sanction for their bad actions. For instance, a toddler refuses to eat his dinner and prefers to throw it on the ground. To deal with this attitude, giving the limit of their playing times can be a good solution as his consequence. Moreover, He has learned that what has done with his food is unacceptable and the posibility to repeat the same action is lower.",
        "For the reasons mentioned above, I believe that giving appropiate punishment is the right tool to help children building their personality. However, the punishment should not include any physical actions."
