        "In modern times, individuals are able to puchase the same items across the globe and this is resulting in countries becoming similair to each other. This is a positive development as it aids in migration and production of international quality items.",
        "Nowadays, individuals are not intimidated by migration as they are aware that they would be able to get their local procude and their favourite item in a different country. Digitalilsation has made everything possible with few clicks. For example, a person immigrating to U.S. would not miss eating the pickle as it is widely imported in the U.S countriesfrom India and moreover, it is available online. So, this gives a sense of comfort and familiarity to a national while visiting the foreign land and would not gie him a cutural shock.",
        "Moreover, manufacturer makes sure that they produce the highest quality items otherwise they would not be able to stand up to the international competition. Since, every product is available globally, the market share of the itmes depends on the quality and price of the item. This helps the consumer to get the best goods available in the market without compromising on its quality. As an instance, Pear fruit is available all over the world and is imported in high numbers and local producers have to match the foreign standards to get their item sold. This is clear, that to combat the competition, they have to maintain international standard in their work,",
        "To conclude, availablity of goods world wide has benefits which makes the life of a person easy especaially when he wants to migrate. It also enforces the enterprises to maintain certain standard of the product to have high demand."
