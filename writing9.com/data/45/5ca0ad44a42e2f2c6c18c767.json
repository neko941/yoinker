        "In the wake of modernisation and higher living standards, many have been seeking to have more than just 1 career in order to earn their living. Consequently, there has existed a trend towards having several careers, which results in the fact that further education will be long-lasting throughout one's life. In my point of view, the notion mentioned above is something that really works.",
        "People's choices to take up 2 or more jobs at the same time appear to be actually wise when taking these following things into consideration. Firstly, this can give them an additionto their income. As having been mentioned, higher income is somewhat almost all of us desire since the quality of having more money helps cover the growing expense. Secondly, a vast majority of people now want to gain experience that cannot be gained from their current job, so they apply for the second (or third, even fourth) one. Some want to meet new people and make new friends or aspire to take up a job that fits their interest. In one way or another, a multi-career person benefits a lot and their options unquestionably make sense.",
        "Together with the multi-career fad, there is also a trend towards ever-lasting education which means the practice of people receiving a further education even when they have graduated or have nothing to do with shooling. Again, I want to emphasize that this is a beneficial trend and people have dozens of rationales for it. It is undeniable that what we do not know outnumbers what we already know. As soon as people are aware of this, they have an increasing inclination to further education. Besides, the world never stops changing and there is certainly up-to-date knowledge one must know in order to keep up with the mainstream.",
        "Of course, multi-career and everlastiing education have their own difficulties and adversities. However, on a general scale, their bnefits and wonders inarguably outweigh all of their backdraws."
