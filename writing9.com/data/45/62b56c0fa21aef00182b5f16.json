        "Lately, companies usually try to prove to their customers that their products are not something we are unfamiliar with in order to make people curious about them. Personally, I think it is a drawback in the business field.",
        "\u200bCompanies nowadays put most of their efforts in advertising than in their manufacturing processes. Putting more investment in the advertisements is not wrong but adding false informations about their products is an unacceptable manner which is called scamming. As the time goes on, scamming people becomes normal in our daily lives which obviously is not a good thing. Sometimes, the problem got out of hand and became a crime and the only victims who had to suffer were the normal people.",
        "\u200bAlmost every new ideas are inspired by the previous successful or failed ones. However, the companies try to seek out our curiosity by convincing us that their product is the first ever invention which can improve our daily lives or shorten the time used on house chores. We can simply be seduced to buy their products without us even noticing. There are times when we have paid the product with a good amount of money but when we start using it, it is just one of those daily products we are already familiar with.",
        "\u200bAs the method of advertising becomes more advanced, the amount of negative consequences we have to deal with becomes greater. Like I said scamming becomes so spread out and the times when we didn\u2019t even notice that we got seduced to buy a normal product are countless. So, I doubtlessly can say that this kind of development has no good intentions but only bad impacts on us.",
