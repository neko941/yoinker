        "During this era, people prefer to live in apartments and flats commonly rather than houses built on their own, as it is financially more beneficial. So they like to know about the origin and the history of the buildings they are living in. This essay will contrast the reasons and the way of researching those apartments.",
        "Firstly, in most countries, cultural beliefs have become a prominent aspect to search for past because sometimes humans suspect having mysterious souls can lurk around. Also, there are some records of paranormal incidents in the past. Moreover, humankind is interested to check previous deeds and the owners to get an idea about the places they lived. However, it is a good trend to get lawful clearance about the lands, before settling in. Although it is better to know on transcripts because when re-selling, that information are much beneficial.",
        "Furthermore, details on deeds can be found through relevant lawyers who are responsible for the lands in certain areas. Additionally, public libraries are the best resource to find the history of the properties because they hold the record of old newspapers. Even though written methods are more convenient, mouth-to-mouth transmitted stories are also the best means of knowing the past of any construction. On the other hand, it is better to ask regarding those matters as family can be more trustworthy than the other people in community.",
        "In conclusion, it is more advantageous to get acknowledge the house one's living or before starting to live in especially in both cultural and legal ways."
