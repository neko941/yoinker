        "The recent proliferation in road dangers and, accidents has led to a scourge. While some people are opined that the decline in speed limits on cars can lead to safety others think there are more good ways to inculcate safety on roads. In my opinion, I believe that the best way is to apply laws and different disciplinary measures on vehicle owners.",
        "On the one hand, some people have suggested putting a limit on the speed of vehicles as the appropriate way to reduce road dangers. The reason is that most road accident occurs due to over speed of drivers beyond the level they can control and thus leading to road accidents. For instance, even after the awareness created that over speeding kills, most road accidents recorded all over the world are  due to the same problem of speed of drivers as most people are impatient in nature. Hence, making the speed limit on vehicles necessary.",
        "On the other hand, others consider other measures more effective such as implementing laws on driving and applying ways to discipline drivers that default and I agree. There are ways to implement road safety which should involve jail term for drivers who drink while driving. To illustrate, France has implemented the use of points thereby failure in any driving law causes one to loose some points and get suspended from driving for a while when all the points are lost. Consequently, laws as this are considered a better way to safety on roads.",
        "In view of the issue discussed above, while people may vary in their opinion. I consider other ways such as suspension, jail term and, lose of points as the most effective way to safety on roads."
