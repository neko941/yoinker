        "In this modern era, almost everybody watches TV and surfs the internet. It is then said that media has overpowered the politicians in terms of influencing people\u2019s lives. I consider this idea to be true and this essay will explain why.",
        "There are two main factors that affect this matter. First, most of the people nowadays have an easy access to TV and internet which allows them to watch and browse in a regular basis. Furthermore, the availability of these media whenever people seeks to use them has a great impact on how they make decisions in their life. To exemplify, In a recent poll conducted in my hometown, 90% of the responders facing problems would ask for help from the media rather than going to a politician. Secondly, most of the TV shows and the internet contents are edited and delivered to be attractive to the mass. These media shows what people wants to see and tell what people wants to hear to gain their trust. This can be proved everyday when the TV and the internet always contain the trending topics to allure the mass. It is because of being accessible and having an attractive presentation that the media has become so influential.",
        "While it is true that politicians can also influence peoples live by the way they lead, it is not everyday and not every people see it.",
        "To conclude, although politicians can influence people through their leadership, the accessibility and the alluring delivery of media made media more influential."
