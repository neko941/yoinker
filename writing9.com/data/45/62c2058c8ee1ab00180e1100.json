        "Recruiting a skillful employee is a huge challenge for companies that sometimes they choose a person who does not match in a group,some employer opine they have not a suitable feature such as poor commucation to adapting in their community ,however ,I believe when a person has losen coonection with others may be some reasons not only to the behavioural matching, so I am going to explore this topic in upcoming paragraphs.",
        "In a beginning , teamworking is a complicated process amongst people to handle their tasks,when individual fail to adapt with others first idea that passed from their mentor there is not a good relatinship between them ,in deeply ,may be related to a difference personality that It will become difficult to keep their connection,for example,introvorters would prefer to work in solarity while extrovorters always enjoy to do their duties with by building a strong connection with costumers ,finally , their mentor may be think entrovorters have not behavioural strenghts to managing  their responsibilities.",
        "Second, competition is not a positive aspect between members in a departement  because it will be destructed coordination,the sense of cooperation and increasing a struggle in a group,for example,",
        "i have worked as a researcher in a medical clinic and we must present a manuscript as a final outcome of a project ,for becoming a corresponding author, my friends have tried to intruppted in my tasks such as mocking me to weakend my confidence, ,as a result , the goal of group have failed and it is completely not depended on my poor interpersonal communication.",
        "In conclusion,poor adjustment in a company has many reasonns such as a negative compitition like a jealousy manner , different type of personality is the other cause which it will be so difficult to work all in a same place , so, the board of company must describe a position as a coordinator to accelerating and giving their tasks and solving the possible interpersonal conflicts between them,in addition , the advisory persons of a institusion must have enough expriences to choosing a right person to involve in a situation based on the personality of an employee."
