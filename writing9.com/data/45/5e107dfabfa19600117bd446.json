        "Parents are the role models for children because they  are introducing the world to them. An array of people thinks that parents must educate their children  to make a good person in society While others think that school is the place where  children can get values about society life. This essay will discuss both sides of arguments  in details and  it provides an evidence as  to why parents play a  vital role in the development of their child life.",
        "Parents are the buildings bolcks for their children life because they are  the first induviduals  who give guidence for their life. Childhod is the significant period  of everyones life because it paves a fundation for  their behavior.In Childhod parents are closely connected to childere's life  hence  they can make a  good impact in child behavior. For example , if a child  resepct their parents , they will respect the society beacuse they get the  moral values  from their parents. Morover,Most  of the children have the tendency to immitate their parents .while they are adopting behavioral qualites from parents  parents are indirectly teach moral priciples to thier childern. To go indetail ,  communication style is varies from person to person depending up n the culture of thire  family. if the parents having good control over communication childern willinherit those values",
        "Teachers play an important role in society building, but their role is limited,  whereas it mainly restrict  with in the walls of the school.  The teacher can teach values to students, but it depends on them whether they have to accept  it or ignore it.Teachers  having some limitatin because inherited behavioural qualities cannot be controlled to a limit. For example,  if a students get moral values from teachers, but if their family is totally discouraging  then its not worth. In addition teachers are mainly concentrated on accdemic sucess of students  rather than students sucess as a citizen in the society. Role  of a teacher is limited in school to guide thier students eventhough teachers concentrate more on accadamic rather than values. For example, School duration is limited to cover accadamic topic  and make  them to face exam",
