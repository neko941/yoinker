        "Some people indicate that now we can watch movies on our own electronic devices and there is no need to go to the cinema while others think that to be fully enjoyed, films need to be seen in cinema. In this essay, I'll discuss both views and explain why I agree with the first statement.",
        "On the one hand, films are now possible to see on electronics such as phones and tablets. Firstly, this choice would save a lot of money. For example, a person can still see a movie at home free of charge while his neighbour have to buy a ticket at the cinema for 70 dollars to do the same. Secondly, it is easier and you don't have to waste time queueing up. For instance, instead of queueing in line at the movie theater, a person can just sit at home and turn on his tablet to watch a movie.",
        "On the other hand, to be fully enjoyed, movies need to be seen at the cinema. Cinemas have a certain atmosphere that people can feel when visiting. It is true that people love the vibe at the cinema with the big screen and lots of popcorn. Furthermore, people think that it is full of emotions at the cineplex.",
        "In conclusion, both choice has its own pros and cons. But considering the advantages above, I prefer watching the movies at home on elctronics."
