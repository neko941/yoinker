        "Although some individuals opine that the valuable role of exceptional instructors has been more noticeable in learners\u2019 educational achievement, students\u2019 outlook towards performing successfully in knowledge acquisition has been asserted to be more of significance by the others. Both ideas could be supported by relevant proponents which are explained in following paragraphs.",
        "The presence of teachers in creating positive motives has been always undeniable. This important effect might be at first encouraging students to find a way which they are educationally interested in. As a result, a success may be enjoyed by them if learners have thirst for knowledge showing burning ambition to look forward. In addition, creative and practical exercises provided for them by sympathetic instructors might be conducive to spark motivation in learners in order to follow higher education in leading universities. Thus, teachers could pave the way for students towards acquiring educational accomplishment by doing so.",
        "While learners could be taught exceptionally, how longingly they think of pursuing academic goals could certainly give rise to their promising performance. This can be interpreted as their determination which should be a significant motive force lighting their way towards success. Since this occurs in their spirits and minds, definitely possessing a long-standing impact on them. Therefore, their enthusiasm to embrace victory in higher education can be constantly maintained. Along with insatiable desire formed by their way of thinking, when an aim is set through an individual\u2019s mindset via a profound thought, that person fiercely endeavor to achieve it by lasting perseverance. This fact should be thoroughly confirmed about students demanding for glorious triumph in education as those must be substantially self-motivated by meeting that desirable target.",
        "To conclude, there has been two different opinions concerning whether the role of efficient teachers more important than the learners\u2019 attitude towards fulfilling attainment in education. Although impressive tutors might have positive impact on students\u2019 performance through giving encouragement as well as providing them constructive assignments, the substantial effect of learners\u2019 mindset should be undoubtedly long-lasting building up remarkable tenacity and resolve in their minds and souls. Consequently, the prominence of students\u2019 way of thinking should absolutely dominate the position of a knowledgeable instructor in terms of achieving success in education."
