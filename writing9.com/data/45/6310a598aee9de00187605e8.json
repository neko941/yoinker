        "Entertainers,such as,actors,sportsmen,singers,influencers are becoming increasingly popular in several parts of the world.A few people believe that,this part of the society receives a higher income compared to the other working sectors.Considering the workload and the stress,people are of the view that Doctors,Nurses,Firefighters should be paid significantly greater income than the entertainers considering the stress,workload and the dedication to become a part of the crucial team.In this essay,I will firstly express my views regarding this issue, followed by the varieties of job that certainly should require a higher pay.",
        "The entertainment sector is known for their fame and name so they are receiving a considerable greater income compared to others.They spend a huge part of their time on screens,either for shows,gaming events,to host ceremonies so they become famous in a place.When this happens,firstly,they gain popularity in the area which allows them to be a suitable person for advocation,education and a figure for inspiration.In addition,their well known status engages a wide and a variety of audience.Take Bhutan for example.Actors get a minimum of Ngultrum 5000 for a 3 day shoot,which is almost double of what others receive.Therfore,I agree that this sector has a higher pay scale than most workers.",
        "I strongly hold the opinion that,professionals such as Doctors,Nurses,Soldiers,Fire-fighters,Life guards should be paid more as they contribute to a crucial part of the society.If a  disaster occurs,without these set of professionals people would be in between life and death.Not only during disasters but in everyday scenario ,they remain an important team.With adequate training and support,they can become entertainers but not vice versa.",
        "The sad reality nowadays,is that the famous people are paid more than the ones who are working tirelessly such as health workers and social workers."
