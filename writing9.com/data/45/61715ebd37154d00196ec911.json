        "It is irrefutable that tourism has supported english language in becoming an indispensable part of the global culture, due to which some people claim that will become a global language. In this essay I will discuss both positive and negative points of english becoming an international language.",
        "To begin with, tourism has been becoming more common and has also been promoting an english language. If it becomes the only language spoken, it may provide mainly two benefits. First, there would be more job and academic opportunities. In other words, there would be an ease for youth population to grasp these options because of no language barier, thus better interaction. Hence their performance and production would incline. Another benefit could be the culture .As language is the major way to learn the culture of any country. Therefore it is highly likely that people travelling to other country would be aware of the traditions and there would be no problems in even moving to other country. Thus, the whole planet will be a small village and this will increase the closeness among the people.",
        "However, there are also the disadvantages to consider. the eroding away of the origional languages along with the culture and the traditional values is more detrimental . To elaborate India is the diverse country it has 28 states with even more than 28 languages. and if english will become the only lanuage there would be no diversity and people would forget about the authentic languages. Despite the common language, the tourism may fall to the greater extent as theere would be no curiosity to know about the other countries due to the same culture. hence, there would be a deleterious impact on the revenue of each country from the tourism, consequently, decreasing the development of nation",
        "In concliusion, english as an international langauge though has benfits, the drawbacks would be crucial to look at beacause it may not only affect the culture, but also the development of nation."
