        "Since fast foods and sugary drinks prevail these days, there is a problem that a lot of people in society have too much sugar. Against this current situation, some people say that government have a responsibility to tackle this issue, others complain that individuals must make effort to it. In the following essay, I would argue both perspectives.",
        "First of all, since the ministry are obligated to spend revenues on healthcare as a part of their job, they might be in charge of the role. As the government burdens tax on the citizens and acquire their budget, they are responsible to maintain the life of the individuals happy and safe. The healthcare is closely related to whether the citizens could spend their life with reassurance; therefore, it would be included in a responsible of the ministry.",
        "Second of all, on the other hand, there is an opinion that the individuals are accountable because they are increasing sugar intake intentionally. Since a plethora of people who consume sugar excessively typically know how it is negative to their health, it could be regarded as their problem. Furthermore, even though the government endeavour to solve the matter, the consumers might be addicted to sugar; thus, they might not reduce intake.",
        "In my conclusion, I believe that the reason that government are accountable is because it is included in their job and reason why they exist, and the reason that the consumers have to tackle is that it is their problem and also the government cooperation might have less impact."
