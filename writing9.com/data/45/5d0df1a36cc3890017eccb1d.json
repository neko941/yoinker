        "How will the government function? When old age finally sets in who ll take care of the medical bills of the old? Finally how ll development take its course in the society if taxes are not paid? This essay seeks to answer these questions.",
        "Taxes are money paid by individuals to ensure proper functioning of the society. Through taxes, government generates funds to provide basic social amenities which are essential for standard living. For instance, in the educational sector, most families find it very difficult to afford private schools for their children but public schools which are funded by the government through taxes,promotes free education and free feeding scheme for these children. Therefore,with this the government serves the people better and in turn the people are also served better. Furthermore, proper medical and healthcare is ensured during old age as the government through taxes paid during they working years by these people are later used to take care of them during old age by subsidizing the bills or even giving free medicals. Also so many families may decide to take their older family members to old peoples home which are mostly owned by the government. Finally, taxes if properly used can futher bring futher development in the tourism sector as tourist attraction sites can be built and money realized to improve the economy of the society.",
        "On the other hand, if individuals resolve to keeping money in the bank without paying taxes all these listed above and more cannot be achieved. In most places, the government does a tax return at the end of the year and money is given back to individuals to encourage tax payers.",
        "In conclusion, individuals should endeavour to pay taxes as it ensures cooperation with the government to provide needful amenities which individuals nor private firms cannot provide solely to improve the quality of life."
