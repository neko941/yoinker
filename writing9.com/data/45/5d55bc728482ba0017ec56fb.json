        "In the recent times, it has been observed that youngsters hardly spend any time with their families. Most of their free time is spent outside homes in parties or other fun activities. Though these extra-curricular activities are as essential as other things, their free time should be divided wisely and a major portion of it should be spent with the family.",
        "Young people are at a risk of being mislead. Their minds are less firm and their morales are not as strong. Spending excessive time out of the house in parties or in wrong company can encourge them to develop bad habits. Some people get involved in crimes and drugs. Therefore, people strongly advocate to monitor activities of youngsters. Some go as far as to put exessive restraints on their free times and strict orders are given to spend time at home. However, an extremist approach in this respect will not be fruitful as teenage children are less likely to respond to strict rules.",
        "Another school of thought encourages youngsters to get involved in as much extra-curricular activities as possible. As most of the time is spent at home, people believe that the free time should be spent outside home. It is said that young people are energetic and they should enjoy their time to the fullest. Moreover, entertainment activities like watching movies, going to parties or games stimulate creativity in young people and broaden their horizons. Social interactions with their friends and colleagues enhance their social abilities and shape them to be better individuals.",
        "What I propose is - a balanced time-table covering all social as well as family time should be devised where once a week family bonding activities must be included. This may include any form of sports like fishing, playing cricket or tennis. Frequent sight seeing and picnics must be planned in which youngsters can rejoice and enjoy time with their family. This time can be used to strengthen family values and increase love between the members and children can connect on a better level with their parents. Similarly, time should be allocated to fun activites with friends and colleagues where youngsters can learn mutual respect and practice living like adults without parental supervision.",
        "To recapitulate, both ideas are valid; however a balance of free time activities for a youngster is vital. Spending time with the family is as important as entertainment activities. I strongly believe that if fun activities are inculcated in the family time, youngsters are likely to devote their free time to family."
