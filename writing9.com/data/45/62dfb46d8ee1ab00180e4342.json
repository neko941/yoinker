        "In today's era of advent in technology , use of mobile device has helped in communication between one another. In this essay I will discuss on both upside and downside alongside with my honest opinion.",
        "With the use of mobile device, it has enchance communication between the young and elder, loved ones who are far and near, parents and their kids. In this new advancement in the use of mobile phone children gets the benefit in communicating with their friends and loved ones , it improves learning and intellectual habits through searching new informations online , and improve their finger reflex on typing. furthermore, children use mobile phone to download games which helps to keep mental state active. This also help to keep them busy after school activities. With this the can communicate with their parents if there is emergency cases or danger. Mobile phone exposes them to new ideas , watching of online movies and cartoons of their favourite.",
        "On the other hand, the downside is that it affects the sight of kids because they will be glued to the phone screen always, it creates anti social for instance, children will find it difficult to play with other kids outside , and this also affect physical fitness. This causes obesity because of lack of exercise. This can also be detrimental to mental state because it deprives them of their nap.",
        "Notwithstanding, communication through the use of mobile phones is subsequential but I am of the notion that the downside affects more to childrens' health."
