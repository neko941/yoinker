        "Research has shown that music is an art that is loved by people. This day, there are various kinds of music heard around the globe. There are numerous reasons we need music and I believe that traditional music of a country is greatly essential than foreign music and reasons are discussed below.",
        "Firstly, one of the reasons we need music is that it gives inspiration to create music. Listening to music has really made people to discover their own talent leading to creation of their own music.  For instance, a gospel musician named Mercy started her music career at the age of 30 after been inspired by  chioma Jesu's music who is also  her mentor. In addition, music helps to relieve stress,pain and anxiety. It serves as a source of psychotherapy which aids relaxation. For example. A state teaching hospital in Anambra state plays music therapy for their patients who have stress and anxiety disorder and it has been very effective for clients' recovery.",
        "Conversely, Local music is more important than international music because it creates the vital part of people's  cultural heritage that is never forgotten. It preserved for generations. Take for instance, in Anambra  state  Nigeria they are known for this traditional music called egedege music. More so, local music strengthens national unity thereby reducing riots or war within a country. To give an example, in October 2020 during end SARS protest in Nigeria,the  Protesters were chanting local music for peace and unity which at the end yielded fruitful result.",
        "Conclusively, there are  myriads of reasons why  we need music. Chief among these reasons is relieve from stress and anxiety and also being a source of inspiration . As explained in the essay , traditional music brings the nation together."
