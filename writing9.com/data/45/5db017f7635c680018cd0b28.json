        "Nowadays the cost of living is increasing to a great extent due to which both parents work. According to some, the reason for teenagers suffering from a lot of social issues is that absence of parents in their life due to busy work schedule. I completely agree with this statement. The following paragraphs will highlight the key reasons behind my opinion with an example.",
        "Firstly, there is no doubt, parents play an important role in keeping balance and check on every activity of their children\t, especially in teenage. But, these days due to their busy lifestyle they are not able to supervise their children. Without restrictions and guardianship, children may involve in immoral activities. It is often reported that the most common reason for teenagers being involved in criminal activities is lack of parental guidance.",
        "Secondly, it is commonly know that parents are the best teachers of their children. Most importantly, moral teaching can be only learned by spending time with parents and learn from their experience. Teenagers c3=an learner faster when it comes from parents. If the parents not giving required time to their children then it is a possibility that they will never get mature in tackling adult life problems.",
        "One perfect example to support my viewpoint is that when parents are busy at work, children spend time with their friends and may be involved in inappropriate activities due to lack of supervision from parents.",
        "Abridging all the details from above it is clear that there are a number of serious problems for teenagers such as involvement in criminal activities, the reason being parents being busy and not spending time with their children."
