        "Academic performance has always been a vital issue both to parent and their ward. High number of youngsters receive little support from their parents in respect to their academic results, while others are excessively pressurized by their extremely zealous parents and this pose bad effect on the child. The reasons why parents over pressurized their kids and also their duties towards their child's academics will be discussed in this essay.",
        "To begin, most parents force their children to perform well in their place of learning due to their past life experience. Most parents during their adolescent  performed badly in school and this prevented them from acquiring and attaining their life goals. They believe their bad performance was due to lack of interference and pressure from their guardian.So to prevent their youngsters from having same experience they compel them to perform well in school.To elaborate a young man in Abia State aspiring to be a local government chairman failed his election because he had no academic qualifications. Due to this his children has always been over pressurized, they are never appreciated for their little effort. He ensures they come back with nothing but the best results.Secondly lack of trust make parents to constraint their young ones to do well in their place of study. Most parents do not believe, when their children tell them that they have read and covered their curriculum or when they say they have finished their assignment. They believe that each hour of the day should be spent studying. External tutors and online lecturers are employed to always teach this child. And this has made many children to lose interest in their school work .",
        "Furthermore the role of a parent towards education are many first is support, parents should support their kids emotionally and spiritually. Show love and care while correcting their mistakes, and also back up their efforts with prayers. Additionally parents should always provide books and necessary items like laptops and phone and also pay necessary fee needed in school to avoid frustration.",
        "In summary lack of trust in kids and parents failures in past years has made most parents to force their wards but if parents carry out their parental roles like providing finance and support, youngsters will definitely do well in school."
