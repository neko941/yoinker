        "The extent to which youth  follow the  rules,  in itself it is  very complex issue, since  children across the world grow up in very different cultures. In India, youngster are expected to be very submissive to their parents and other adults around them. However, it is not the case with the Western countries of the planet where children follow the motto \u2018Thou shalt do what thou wilt\u2019  promoted by the celebrities and rock stars of region. I believe, following strict rules has both, the  advantages as well as serious drawbacks as discussed below.",
        "Firstly, the strict rules of behavior creates responsible and respectful attitude to the teenagers, they will become  mature and respectful adult. This forms a stable society which is virtually free from negative trends, such as prostitution and drug abuse. Secondly, if children do not obey straight forward concept of behavior, they may took wrong path and become indolent. It creates a burden on the society, since the government has to find a better way to cater for these social ills.",
        "In addtion, forcing on the adolecences to follow strict rules of behavior does not always yield positive results as discussed above, most of the time it backfires and works against society. For example, teenagers are more likely to do the opposite work, which they are instructed, because they wants to be an independent person. The scholars should have rights to exercise their free will and develop their own pattern of personality. Imposing strict rules, may simply destroy the individuality of children.",
        "At the end of the day, it is clear that children should be guided by rules, but these rules should not be imposed on them because as human beings, they need to have room to develop their own traits of character and adopt a behavioral pattern of their own."
