        "It is often argued that however there are many ways to reduce crimes, giving severe punishments to the criminals is proved to be the best. I strongly agree with this notion. This essay will first demonstrate how giving harsh punishments can bring down the crime rate followed by an analysis of other ways to achieve this.",
        "Critical punishments set examples for criminal mindset people to stay away from executing the bad plans that they have. Thus, to avoid crimes, it is really necessary to handle the offenders with severity so that they should not be involved in any criminal activities ever.. For instance, if traffic police starts treating the traffic rule breakers leniently, it will motivate other commuters to break the rules which eventually will end up in a life-taking road accident.",
        "Better education and abundance of job opportunities will be useful ways to reduce crimes. Scarcity of jobs creates a sense of depression in the youth of a country which provokes them to make wrong choices. In the developed countries where education standards are high and ample amount of jobs exist, crime rates are considerably low because people are too busy with their own lives and they lack time to think about destructive things.",
        "In conclusion, good quality of education along with better job opportunities can bring down the crime rate but the best way to achieve this is giving severe punishments to the offenders."
