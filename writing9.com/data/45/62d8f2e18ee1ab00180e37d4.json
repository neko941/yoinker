        "The two pictures illustrate the transformation at Sunnyhill University in 1995 and today. There were many changes to new buildings and recreation areas during this period.",
        "in the past, the Scott library was opposite the founder\u2019s building, but now the Scott library moves to the right-hand neighboring position to the founder\u2019s building; and it is expanded as twice as it was. To replace that position, the new laboratories were constructed. Furthermore, in 1995 the car park area was in the top-left of the campus, but now it is moved to the near area, and replaced by the main reception building. The halls of residence, in 1995, were next to the Scott library, but now it is separated into two buildings in the far-left area of the campus. There was a large area for sports facilities including a football pitch, tennis courts, and gym in the past, but now they were moved to other areas and separated into many areas including in the far-right of the map for new table tennis tables and in the top-central of the map for squash courts and gym facilities. At present, the right-bottom of the campus contains a recreation area, pound, trees, and seating areas for students.",
        "It is clear that the campus of Sunnyhill University was undergone many changes in the period of 1995 and today."
