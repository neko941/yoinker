        "Man through the ages, from a period  one can hunt for a food to the present time. When one can buy a preprocessed food in restaurant/Small shops some people say nowadays we can prepare food easily without putting lots of effort  with the help of preprocessed items and technology  when compare to olden days, other people think that consumption of preprocessed brings a lot of disadvantages for human health so they prepare for freshly cooking food. In my view we do have an advantages and disadvantages of both options so  I\u2019ll analysis, both options and present my opinion in following paragraphs.",
        "From one side, Preprocessed food brings lots of benefits to the human beings and society. Firstly, one can save lots of time with the help of preprocessed food and one cannot spend his time in the kitchen  for peeling and cutting of vegetables, washing, cooking and preparation of various kinds of dishes. One can spend his time with his loved ones, exercise and walking with friendly dogs. Secondly,  we can taste out  a lot of varieties of items without spending much time with the help of  modern technology and also we can use microwaves to prepare the food in short span of time in addition to that one has capability of spending money there would be an option to visit the restaurant where a person can enjoy various variety of items like Mexican and American extra  with good service and one can enjoy food by sitting in a nice environment and get relaxation.",
        "From the other side , some people think that preprocessed food is not good for health  because of ingredients/chemicals that are used to keep the items of preprocessed food .Unfortunately , we\u2019re seeing negative aspects of eating of preprocessed foods in newspaper and television moreover health experts  are alerting  us to go for cooking rather than preprocessed items and they advise us to cook when we\u2019ve a sufficient time .",
        "In conclusion ,cooking is a great tradition and brings lot of relax ion for the people more over helps to come out from  pressure and we can spent time with loved ones and helps to come out daily activities .Every person has own scale of thinking I can say based on one\u2019s time availability financial condition they have to decide option  either cooking or proposed foods .finally we can\u2019t forgot cooking and do not abuse/avoid the proposed foods .",
        "Please note I\u2019ve to develop in spelling \u2013 auto corrected lot of spellings \u2013Please review and provide comments now I\u2019m start seeing yours."
