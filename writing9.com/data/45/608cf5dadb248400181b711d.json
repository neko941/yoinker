        "One of the most conspicuous trends of today's world is a colossal upsurge in the contractor built the same style houses as older houses in the local areas. There is a widespread worry that this will only lead to a myriad of concerns in one's life. However, I do not entirely accept this and I will explain why in tis essay.",
        "There is a number of arguments in favour of my stance. The most prepondarent one is that the same style houses is good for all society people because all the them feel equalities in the society. For example, some people live on the rent and some people have a own house if the all houses construction is same then so no people is rich or poor.",
        "On other side hand, If all people make the houses in your styles then the societies are looking very bad in the outside For example, All people using the different types of colour in outside.",
        "Some people however,",
        "There are however, some pitfalls that can easily overwhelm in potential benefits of some people think that the older houses as new houses should be built in the same style in the local areas. The primary one stems from the fact that by obsrving the aforementioned trend, people had not only realised its gravity, but also gauged the magnitude of its repercussions when it comes to being today's everchanging lifestyle. Besides, its impact on social people is far-reaching indeed. ence, it is apparent why many are against the same styles and old styles apartments.",
        "In view of the arguments outlined above, one can conclude that despite drawbacks, the benefits of the same style houses is good batter then old houses."
