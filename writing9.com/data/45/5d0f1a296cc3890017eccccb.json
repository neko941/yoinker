        "In recent times, technological innovations have revolutionized our lives, especially our workplaces. One of the developments of this advancement is global connectivity that enables the employers to reach their employees at all times. At some corporate spaces' employees are expected to be available whenever their managers need them, even on off days and holidays. In this essay we will discuss some of the pros and cons that are associated with this development.",
        "Clearly, there are quite some benefits of a 24/7 connectivity between employers and employees. Firstly, this certainly leads to a better relationship between a superior and their subordinates, if used wisely. If they are well connected at all time via phones or email, then there will be fewer misunderstandings, better rapport and a certain amount of comfort level, even for the employees.",
        "Additionally, a good sense of understanding among them also encourages creativity and better productivity. When any crisis comes up, the manager is able to reach out to the concerned employee at any time which helps in timely resolution that consequently saves time and resources.",
        "On the other hand, undoubtedly the drawbacks of this development are many and worrisome. Firstly, this is one of the main reasons for the ever-increasing work life imbalance which eventually leads to increased stress level and other health problems. Moreover, this affects an employee\u2019s production at work, eventually making them less competent which in-turn adds to more stress.",
        "Also, such arrangement affects their family life. Employees are not able to devote sufficient time to their families as they are expected to deal with work related issues even when they are possibly on vacation with their families. This might eventually have a very damaging effects of ones\u2019 children and family development as a whole.",
        "In conclusion, it can be reiterated that if used prudently, the communication technology can be a boon for both employees and employers. However, in my opinion, the detrimental effect it might have can be quite grave, if employers don\u2019t respect the staff\u2019s personal and family time."
