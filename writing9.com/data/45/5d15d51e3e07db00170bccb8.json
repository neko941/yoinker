I totally agree to have these kind of sport activity across the nation, so that all kind of people can experience the delightful moments.",
        "To begin with, extreme sport are really exciting the people across all ages though it has some restrictions in certain health conditions. People who are fond of getting thrilling experiences will definitely opt for these kind of sports as the feel while performing these is unimaginable. For instance, I personally with my family went through the river rafting sport in Teesta river during one of our vacation with two kids. I would definitely say that\u2019s one of our unforgettable holiday as we enjoyed to the core. We were accompanied by two more adults who are really well trained in the sport and they were able to provide proper guidance for us throughout, which negated that the initial hesitation we had is meaningless.",
        "Secondly, extreme sports are not as dangerous as many people think. There are several regulations and safety procedures that one must follow to prevent the possibility of accidents.",
        "However, we must agree that it has the other side as well. These sport are likely to pose a life threatening risk to the people. Not only can perilous sports leads to serious injuries, sometimes even cause death of persons involved in them. Eventually it also require huge amount of money to be poured in.",
        "To conclude, these perilous sport shouldn\u2019t be banned as it will demotivate the people who are really interested in, but the organizers should continue to improvise the equipment and safety measure to nullify the accidents.",
