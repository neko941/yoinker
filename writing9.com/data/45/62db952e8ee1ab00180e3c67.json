        "The pie charts illustrate the percentage of the five methods of hazardous waste management in the Republic of Korea, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.",
        "Overall, what stands out from the pie charts is that while the prevalence of underground dumping can be seen in the United  Kingdom and Sweden to dispose of harmful garbage, the Republic of Korea mostly relies on recycling for the same. Moreover, Sweden and the Republic of Korea are following three major techniques to manage unsafe waste, whereas all the waste management methods are used by the UK except recycling.",
        "In regards to the United Kingdom, most of the perilous waste goods are disposed of by dumping them in a landfill, which accounted for 82%. Only just a small quantity of 2% of waste is incinerated whilst Chemical treatment and dumping at sea are used equally to get rid of hazardous waste material which amounted to 8% for each.",
        "Moving to Sweden, although 5% more than half of the dangerous waste is dumped in landfills, the rest total of 45%  is being treated by burning and recycling the formal accounts for one-fifth and the latter manages the one-third of the total harmful waste produced by Sweden.",
        "Turning to the Republic of Korea, while 69% of hazardous rubbish is being recycled, underground dumping helps to destroy 22%, and only 9% of dangerous waste is treated by fire."
