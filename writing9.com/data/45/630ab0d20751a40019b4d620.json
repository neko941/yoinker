        "There is a common debate about who is responsible for preparing children to interact positively in their community, parents or school.  In my opinion I am convinced that  it is mainly the parents\u2019 responsibility .",
        "The role of the schools in providing the society with well upbringing  members cannot be neglected.  Schools have the proficient stuff  to educate children. teachers are always well prepared to provide guides  and deal with the character problems of the child in scientific way . In addition, Schools are like a small society. Children can examine the theoretical knowledge about the behaviors which they gain from their parents through interacting with their colleagues and teachers .",
        "On the other hand, Parents play an important role in teaching their children how to be good in their society. Firstly, it is their own responsibility . They brought them to the life and they have to meet all their needs, most importantly is the guidance. For instance, children do not just need foods  and drinks, they also need to be taught what is right and what is wrong and what are the consequences of harming others. Secondly. Children trust their parent. as a result, they depend totally on their parents to evaluate the behaviors and define the good and bad things, so They can accept the advices from them easily.",
        "I am agree  that parents are responsible of providing the community with good members and the  children trust them more. However, schools create a small social environment where children can learn how to interact positively under the supervision of the proficient stuff"
