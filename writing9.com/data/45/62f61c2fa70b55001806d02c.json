        "I only agree with 50% of that for getting to improve the quality of healthcare in a country is to train and hire more doctors and nurses. Yes, that is right to run a healthcare system we need a number of doctor and nurse but we can not run the healthcare system if we don't have sub-clinical facilities such as healthcare worker who works in laboratoties, IT staff, house keeping, receptionist, security, accountant.",
        "One more thing that is more important to contribute the quality of healthcare system is quality of healthcare staff because they are special workers which they work with people's lives. If there were some mistakes happening with their customer the outcome is dead or disability so that they required to be trained with restrictly program in a certain process with excellent output controlling before they can practice.",
        "For example, in Vietnam to pass the exam to become a medical student at any medical university is an exellence that is proud of the teacher and family and this is meant they are exellent pupils, next they have to spend 6 year with many subjects/cirriculums and pass all the testes/assessments/evaluations and they have to spend many hours to practice simulation firstly and then real patients and even they have to participate with theirs teachers/attending to do research.... After 6 year they will be greduated and they become a doctor and next they have to study to become a specialist and they also have to study more and more to be come a named doctor.",
        "Another thing to contribute to becoming a named doctor is where they were trained to become a doctor. If they were trained in America/Europe or at Mayo clinic medical school they would have a good chance to become a reputed doctor.",
        "Finally, I believe that the best way to get a quality of healthcare in acountry is to train more exellent doctor and hire more reputed doctor and valuable nurses and we don't forget to train more healthcare staff who works in sub-clinical area with a suitable administrator with the population."
