        "The flow chart illustrates how sugar is been processed from sugar cane in seven different steps.",
        "Overall, as per the schema chart, sugar production involves several steps such as growing, harvesting, crushing, purifying juice, evaporating, centrifuging, and drying and cooling.",
        "In the very beginning, the sugar cane plant must be planted. The gestation period to become mature to harvest is 12- 18 months. After these long months, the pants are harvested either by machinery or manually. Then it is taken to crush in a crushing machine to produce juice and later the yield juice is purified using a limestone filter.",
        "After the juice is been purified, it is then heated in a container in order to convert it to syrup. The process is called evaporation. Further, the syrup is centrifuged to segregate sugar crystals from the syrup. Lastly, the final step involved drying and cooling the sugar that was yielded from centrifugation. These are all the steps required to produce sugar."
