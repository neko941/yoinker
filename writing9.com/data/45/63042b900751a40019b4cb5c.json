        "The given line graph compares the amount of bought electrical appliances and the total hours spent on housework per week in a particular country from 1920 to 2019.",
        "Overall, it is clearly evident that ownership of electrical appliances experienced an upward trend, while duration spent on housework saw a downward trend.",
        "In terms of buying electrical appliances, the refrigerator was the least popular appliance among people in 1920, which was almost 0%. However, this went up dramatically to 90% within the next 40 years and reached the maximum (100%) in 1980, and then remained stable until 2019. Similarly, vacuum cleaner ownership began at 30% in 1920, which steadily increased to 100%  in 2000 and plateaued for the next 19 years. In addition, the washing machine was the most popular appliance,  which was owned by 40% of households in 1920. This figure showed a gradual growth to 70% in 1960, before reducing to just over 60% in 1980 and rose again slightly to just above 70% in 2019.",
        "In contrast, in 1920, the number of hours of the housework was 50 hours per week, which plummeted to 20 hours per week in the next four decades. After that, the number of hours gradually declined to 10 hours per week in 2019."
