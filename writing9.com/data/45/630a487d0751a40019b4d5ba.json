        "It has been noticed nowadays, that high school students tend to take a gap year before they join universities. They aim to travel and gain experience before starting another phase of their academic learning process. Personally, I find myself inclind to admit that it is an effective way to help students to decide exactly the field or the programme they want to join in the next academic year.",
        "The first advantage of the gap year is that it offers the diligence students who worked hard some rest to get rid of stress and have enough time to expolre the life before sarting their studies again. However, a lot of  recent studies have shown that students, who took a one year break to travel and work before deciding the college or university they want to join, had graduated fully satisfied of their choice and they had shown enthusiastic to start searching for jobs.",
        "Another merit to highlight, is the work experience or skills they learnt during this year, which can be highlighted in their resume. Certainly, this would facilitate for them finding a part time job to support themselves financialy during their study. a good example to illustarte this point that around the world we can hear about companies specialized to organize and guide young people during this year, a lot of them are keen to find for them opportunities according to their desire to try practically the duties involve in such carrier.",
        "At the same time many people stress out that the importance of such long breake is overrated and some my lose their enthusiastic to learn. they also believe that the expeirence they seek for can be gaind during their study as a part time job or even after they graduate. They claim that being familiar with the required knowledge is more important before starting any jop as proficinals in any field would certainly performe much better than those who are not.",
        "To conclude, the aforementioned points clearly showed the potential advantages and disadvantages of this phenomenon , but I find myself enclined to state that the demerits are eclipsed by the merits of such experience as it helps the student to be resposible individuals and one hundered percent sure about the programme they want to join in universities."
