Mostly, children addicted to using a computer, and also it became part of school study. Generally, in the new syllabus have a subject called computer science. Socially, 90 per cent of children prefer to learn a computer.",
        "To Continue, using a computer every day can have more negative and positive effects on children. Physically, children sit in one place and spend more time with a computer it is an effect on the health and the mental as a result of children became a robot and also don\u2019t have a feeling or emotion with family or society that became negative impact. Furthermore, using a computer make distance with refer a book. Mostly using computer to make danger effects on children there are, use a computer for an illegal thing such as money printing. However, children spent their time using social media through a computer resulting from children don\u2019t have time to study.",
        "Furthermore, using a computer has positive effects on children. There are, it's very useful to get information and video related to study. Therefore, it will be help to learn very easily and clearly and also the world run by modern technology.

Therefore my opinion is using a computer can have both negative and positive effects, but have maintained and focus on the right way then it will make positive for children."
