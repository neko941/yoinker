        "The issue who is supposed to take the responsibility of the disciplinary education, teachers or parents, has been heatedly discussed recently. In my opinion, only when schools and families work together, can students have a better understanding of discipline.",
        "It is universally acknowledged that teachers should impart their academic knowledge to students, however, what should not to be ignored is that teachers can also provide role models for students. Although some children gain an excellent mark in their examine, those who have behavioral problems can not succeed easily in the future. For instance, somebody who cheated in the test may hardly find a decent job, because he or she is unreliable and violate the rules. Thus, it is significant for teachers to teach moral principles and behavioral norms in school.",
        "On the other hand, there is no denying that it is obligated for parents to establish some strict rules for their children, which can help these children to develop a good behavior from their childhood. Moreover, the young kids are prone to mimic their parents\u2019 behavior, so that adults need to pay more attention to their daily performance and even set a good example to their kids. In this way, the child can raise the awareness of some essential virtues,such as honesty and integrity, which may generate huge influence in their whole life.",
        "In the view of the importance of discipline to students\u2019 development, I firmly agree that it ought to combine the two methods to all-rounded educate children to obey the rules.",
        "Above all, with the assist of teachers and parents to form correct sense of discipline, children not only can make a great success in the work, but also have a meaningful life after growing up."
