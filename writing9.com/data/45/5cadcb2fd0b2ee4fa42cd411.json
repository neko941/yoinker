        "In the 21st century, the market of solar panels is growing and is expected to touch new heights in the upcoming years. However, till now we have managed to make use of just 1/14000 of the sunlight we get from the sun. The visionary entrepreneurs Elon Musk started the company solar city with the main motive of making the maximum utilisation of the resources we have. Solar city is a company founded by Elon Musk, which makes solar panels.",
        "There are several advantages of using solar energy. For instance, we can save more electricity. The electricity we save could be used in villages and rural areas of the country. As poor people cannot afford to buy solar panels. Another advantage of  using solar energy is that it is cost effective. It is also beneficial for people living in the urban areas of the country, as it is a one time investment.",
        "Some of the disadvantages of using solar energy could be, it is costlier for most of the people. Poor people may not be able to afford to have solar panels in their house. Apart from that I don't see any disadvantages of using solar energy. It is has gained it's popularity because of the fact it is eco friendly and as the technology expands the world is going to have better and eco friendly products.",
        "To recapitulate, every product or service has it's own pros and cons. But in my opinion there aren't too many disadvantages of using solar energy. Rather I would suggest people to invest on solar energy as it doesn't harm the environment or the eco system of planet."
