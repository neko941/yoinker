        "The number of people who have overweight are increasing along time in everywhere .For this reason many counties try to find out solutions to attack this problem which is treating those live .One of the suggested solution from some people, is increasing the prices of fatty foods due to several reasons .Firstly, the main cause of this issue is consuming a large amount of junk foods ;therefor ,when hike the prices of none healthy foods especially that contain high level of fat and sugar , they think a lot before buying also replace it by multi kind of food which is might be more healthy. in addition , if they buy the fatty food in high price and with bad taste some of them  giveup to eat this king of food.",
        "On the other hand there are persons disagree with increasing the prices as a solution of overweight owing to they see the food addiction not related to a type of food eaten. But it is depends on the amounts .The effective solution is to search on the reasons of overweighting such as problems in body hormones of problems of way of living .Personally, I disagree with rising the prices of fast food; although, it is harm on health but some people like to eat it even one time a week .it should be in more reasonable prices specially for whom have limited income.",
