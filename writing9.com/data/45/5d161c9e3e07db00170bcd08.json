        "With the evolving inventions and busy lives,  people often tend to use certain things for a brief period of time and dispose of it when a better version of the good comes out or if the object gets broken. There may be quite a few causes for this which may or may not become a problem.",
        "The irresistable advertisements by companies often play a role in this. An example would be the evolving and changing fashion trends especialy among woman. With the different and unique outfit designs and materials being adverstised with changing seasons, women tend to be attracted to buy these costumes for self satisfaction and then when these outfits go out of season or become less popular, these clothes would either end up in the giveaway items or unfortunately the garbage. Another example includes mobile phones, laptops and other kinds of electronic devices. Another reason would be the busy lives of people which forces them to buy new appliances instead of getting the one they previously owned fixed",
        "Unfortunately , this trend could lead to a threat to the environment. With all the mass productions and inventions of different and better products to attract consumers, companies often use materials that may not be recyclable or harmful to the environment. For example with the high demand on wooden furnitures could cause a requirement of large amout of trees to be cut down leading to destruction of forests and causing harm to many wildlife habitats.",
        "To conclude, the 'throwaway society' is a replesentation of our selfish and materialistic mentality where we give little or no regards to the consequences our choices could lead to and therefore these practices should be limited for the sake of the environment. The government should launch compaigns and spread awarenessof throwing goods and also ennact laws to make recycling mandatory."
