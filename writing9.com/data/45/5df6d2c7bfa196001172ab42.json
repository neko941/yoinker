        "Over the past few decades,the villagers are shifting to urban areas,leaving their agriculture and farmland for seeking good jobs.The rural people seem that living in town is cozy as well as earning money is possible effortlessly in any time anywhere.However,in this essay,I intend to explore the sources of this problem along with some possible solutions to it.",
        "Chief among the causes of this problem is the movement of people from village to town not only reduce the food production but also the country faces food shortage.As a result the regime has to import food from other parts of the world.Moreover,moving to an urban area indiscriminately,the town becomes congested day by day.Furthermore,getting an apartment in an urban area has become solid hence the residents have to count a large amount of money for rent of house.For example,my uncle used to live in a village but recently he has shifted to the  city,it becomes solid for him to pay the rent of house monthly.It is noticeable that the price of vegetables in the city is higher than the village due to the huge consumer in this area.",
        "In order to resolve this there are many steps that can be taken as the solution,the local government can provide modern facilities like town.Moremore,the local councilor can take some steps to upgrade the rural situation.Furthermore,the transportation and telecommunication system immediately should be developed.If the farmers get their reasonable price of their products effortlessly.Consequently, they will not make determine to move an urban area.For instance, I heard that my grandfather was a successful farmer but he did not get his reasonable price of products as a result one day he got angry and came to the city.However,if the villagers get good the opportunity of works as well as the salary is reasonable they will not intend to move to the city.",
        "In conclusion,I believe that this is clearly a problem of such complexity that no solution is likely in the short term.However,the government should provide employment for the people of village like people of the city."
