        "Technology has greatly reduced the requirement for manpower Since the 18th Century and with the increase in the rate of technological advancement this changeover is occurring at a faster pace. These advancement are often sighted as the major reason for the rise in unemployment.",
        "I agree with this statement because many tasks that previously required human presence for their functioning are now handled easily by machines. Machines and Artificial intelligence complete most tasks with more accuracy than humans. The speed at which machines complete these tasks surpass human capability. These technological features are being utilised by newly emerging multi-national companies for their smooth functioning. IT had proven to be of great practical significance during the recent pandemic when lock down and the absence of people from the workforce had forced many companies to rely on their technical facilities.",
        "Analysing from the viewpoint of an employer, employing a human for a job that can be done by a gadget or artificial intelligence is more profitable in monetary terms. Apart from the initial acquiring costs of a machine it does not require monthly wages, funds or pensions. Adding a cherry on top is the fact that a single appliance or software can perform a task that would otherwise require a team of people. Operating such an appliance would hardly require one or two people, sometimes even none at",
        "all. These factors reduce the employing tendencies of company owners.",
        "A good example of technology overtaking the human presence in the workforce is of how many restaurants nowadays have automated systems for placing orders and serving making waitressing an obsolete profession."
