Their issues are almost come from our supervisor, he is really poor capabilities management. So I think you should choose the new one as soon as possible in case our work will become more worse. For about myself I would like to introduce to you that i have more experience in this industry and i has just got a certificate about how big data for financial management so I think i can help our organization go over those obstacles. So I really appreciate if you give me a chance to interview about my knowledge and skills. And if i can become a manager I think i can give our organization some solutions to resolve those issues, for example the first I will transform our financial system to concentrate on informations to make decisions instead of administrative. The second i will mobilize our tools and the change the way we work by thinking out side of our department and focus on our company\u2019s visions and purposes. Or if you can choose a good supervisor is better then me i will work with he or she to learn more, that\u2019s no problem.",
