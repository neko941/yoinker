        "There are a lot of criminals who repeat their crimes after they were reconvicted. Certainly, the number of criminals depends on several reasons. And I would like to start with the first of them.",
        "Firstly, the society has great impact into the level of crime. For instance, if person was growth in the negative environment, he or she will repeat crime. Unfortunately, in Russia there a lot of small towns with high level of robberies. It happened due to lack of workplaces and low salaries. Certainly, if person arrive in this place after the jail, the crime will be repeated.",
        "Secondly, some individuals have unequal mental treatments. Consequently, despite on positive impact of correction labor they will do a crime again and again.",
        "There are several possible measures to decrease the level of crimes after the first punishment. First of all, government should increase financial help to families who lives under the level of poverty. It will allow to provide children all necessary stuff for education. Secondly, government need create a special program for people who did a crime. This program must include financial impact, list of possible workplaces. If somebody has mental treatment, government should provide them different kind of tablets. Certainly, the conditions in the jails must be comfortable and consist of all kinds of facilities. It is necessary to create positive view on life and to involve criminals into the free life.",
        "To put it on the nutshell, I suppose that the main impact in the criminal sphere bring government. That is why politics are responsible for level of live and crime."
