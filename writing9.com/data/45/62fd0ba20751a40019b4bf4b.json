        "There have been so much arguing a research about how can increase employee's satisfaction regarding their job. In this essay I will discuss the factors affecting this and give my point of view at the end.",
        "To begin with, the relationship of employer-employee is so important for workres to staty commited to their job, in a way that if they both respect each other properly the outcome would be stisfactory. For example, In the survey has been done in 2009 it was indicated that the good relationship between supervisors and staff wes corrolate with more productivity. Secondly, if employers use a variety of incentive such as financial assisstanse, bounses, days off, it would also increase the outcome of company. Furthermore, Companies who organise gathering ceremonies with involving workers' famillies also have been shown that worker feel a sense of being respected resulting in more productivity and commitment. Also maitaining a blance between work-family is so crucial for employees which can be done by higher staff to show they consider human needs and respect them. For examlpe applying a combination of in-site and remote working can help employees to spend more time with family and work more efficiently. Other reason is that in this world we can't be happy alone, means any help, incentives and promotion are a humanly effort and likely lead to satisfaction would result in more popularity and production.",
        "I my way of thinking these factors are so important employers should take into account because in this way they show that their first aim is not more profit but the consider the needs of their staff too. In this way CEOs can be sure that the company is going to experience less risk in the form of staff uninvilvment and un productivity.",
        "To conlude, It is so crucial for people running business and company to use various kind of incentives to make their staff satisfy and cooperating which wise bosses know about and implement it."
