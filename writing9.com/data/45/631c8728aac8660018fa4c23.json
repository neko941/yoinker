        "In todays time we have a huge generation gap comparing to our forefathers when they had half the population we have now and since their generation was not much adavanced and had nothing much to do they enjoyed spending their free time reading newspapers or find themself lucky if they watched the news on a television.",
        "In most of the developed countries the young people of this era starts their childhood from high school at very early age and they remain continnum occupied by time which has been scheduled and preparped by their teachers. They remain constantly busy continously even at home after school and hardly has any time to sit infront of the TV becasue of the homeworks assigned due next period. For an example childrens in the Canada are supposed to start kindergaden studies at the age of 3 to 4 years old and carries on. From the first day they are being introduced to a smart mobile phone, smart tablet device or computer and they do not learn the habbit borne by their parents of reading news from paper or though a tv. Techonlogies have removed hard copies of news paper out of the market. and claiming them wastage.",
        "There is definetly a generation gap and rapid techonology differences. A smart phones today just not only make phone calls and holds contact numbers but it has become a game changer and has changed our living standard. Such phones has access to any news of any time in just one click and brings you live update around the wolrd to your finger tips.",
        "I think reading news paper and watching news on tv is just a waste of time and resources and they should consider download their favourite news channel apps in their mobile phone to follow up with daily live up to date and read it or watch it once a day."
