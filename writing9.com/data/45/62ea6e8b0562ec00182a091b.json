        "With the advance in digital photography, there has been unprecedented ease  in capturing image. Given this newfound perk, it is said that picture have since overtaken traditional text in terms of effectiveness in exchanging ideas. I do not entirely agree with this claim since it is evident that while graphical images have an edge in invoking feelings, written communication is more precise when delivering more detailed message where elaboration is necessary.",
        "In a world where seeing is believing, images undoubtedly exert greater influence on human emotions, and this can be more powerful call to action than text alone. A perfect illustration is the infamous photograph regarding the death of Alan Kurdi,  a three-year-old Syrian refugee boy whose lifeless body was washed ashore during his ill-fated journey across the Mediterranean Sea. The heart-wrenching picture triggered immediate concerns from the international community, prompting a surge in donations for the humanitarian relief effort. In comparison, no amount of words could create such emotional impact to the same extent given the limited representation of symbolisms in texts.",
        "Nevertheless, it is evident that written communication remains as the mainstay when presenting elaborate ideas. When pitted against imagery, words are more efficient and effective in presenting logic and examples in a persuasive argument, due to their flexibility in grouping meaningful idea using sentences and paragraphs. This undertaking is often challenge when images are used, in which the underlying message is interpreted through the colored lenses of respective individuals. As a result, reputable academic journals do not accept any forms submission unless it is made in writing. In spite of the increasing popularity of video essays, such way of delivery still has a long way to go before completely replacing written papers.",
        "All in all, we can argue that while impactful, realistic images have a more pronounced effect on human emotions, communication in writing is warranted when detailed explanation are called for. As such, seasoned communicators typically employ both when compiling a message, and in doing so get the point across to their audience."
