        "It appears that only person who was born with talent can succeed in fields, such as art and sport.In contrast,some people believe that any child can become accomplished and skillful athletes or artists as long as they have the right guidance and work hard.In this essay,I will discuss both point of views before giving my own opinions.",
        "People who receive a natural gift to have certain abilities often fulfill their goals with less difficulties than others.Their talent make them excellent in the way they do the things while their passion drives them to a huge success.For instance, Lionel Messi is considered as a football genius as this sport seemed to come naturally to him. The difference between Messi and other players is that his performance is such simplicity like football become a part of him but is almost impossible for anyone to imitate.",
        "On the other hand,many support the view that genius are not born,but made.From my own experience,I did observe and hear about people who are born without being gifted,but passion.Their way to success may painful and take a very long time of patience and persistence .Cristiano Ronaldo is a football player,in contrast to Messi,is called a hard working machine and earn his career with a lot of efforts.In other words,his speed and skills are totally built on his hard training.",
        "In conclusion, I believe that people can succeed in any fields with attempt and a suitable learning environment,while natural talent help people to achieeir gove thals easier."
