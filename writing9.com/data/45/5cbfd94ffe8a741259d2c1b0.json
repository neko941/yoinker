        "There was a raging discussion last week on sentencing reforms over the release of a juvenile murderer. It ignited a debate on whether some people should be forced to do unpaid labour instead of rotting in prisons. Some activists believe that it is the only right thing to do while the public sentiment seems to be swaying on the other side. However the reality is a bit complex.",
        "Firstly, success of any prison sentence would be measured in one thing, non-repetition of crime, especially the ones for which he had been convicted for,  after he/ she had completed the jail term. For this repetition of crime to subside, reformation of the jailed should be considered. Keeping people behind the bars hardly achieves this objective. If they were ordered to work during their term, they would learn some vocational courses which would help them live a decent living and it earns them respect in the society.",
        "Secondly, prisoners, especially those who were convicted for petty crime are also humans and should be treated that way. It is believed that incarcerations help in creating bad company, converting small offenders into rogue elements, thus should be avoided.  On the other hand vocational workshops will create a healthy and productive relationship which they could  leverage in the future.",
        "However not all criminals should be treated the same way. Violent and repeat offendors should not be shown any lenience as a token of juscice to the victims. Otherwise, it will lower the morale of the society but boosts that of the criminals.",
        "In conclusion, I opine that for small or one-time criminls, a lenient and productive verdict should be awarded instead of archaic torturous sentences. This is not only because of human rights concerns but also to create a healthier society. Also, hard work sentences improves the skills they need to survive post their release. However, those who commit abhorrent crimes shuold not be treated the same way."
