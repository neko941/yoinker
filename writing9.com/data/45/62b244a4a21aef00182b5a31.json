        "Then importance of children to participate in organized group activities rather than occupy themselves in their free time which was always debatable has now become more conterversial with Manny people claiming that it is beneficial while other reject this notion. The substiantial influence of this trend has sparked the controversy over the potential impact in recent years. In my opini\u00f3n the former proposition appears to be more rational. This esay will further elaborate my views for favouring the positive impact of tis trend and thus will lead to logical conclusion.",
        "Analysing the statement and explaining further , the first and the foremost reason behind this is that the group activities participation helps to better communication skill, improve thinking ability, make better power of concertration , they can learn from their group mates, learn to how to behave in social life and what type of challanges in future they might face. They will have more interaction power and they can express their view points more clearly and fearless like extrovert  people compare to interovert people. For instance the child you plays in theatre have more expressing power and can speak on stage in front of audience with you any hesitation.",
        "Probing ahead, on of the main underlying reason steams from the fact is that the parents for the sake of their child forc\u00e9 them to be occupied in any type of activity in the free time, because they want their child to become independent which helps them to learn how to organize their kepp room clean, organize book shelf, and study area. With that in future for further studies he or she might go to abroad they must know how to cook the food , wash clothes , iron cothes and be responsable of their belongings.",
        "To culminate , I reiterate that there are plenty of strong factors supporting the child to participate in group activities and become more socialise . However, contrary cannot be overlooked either."
