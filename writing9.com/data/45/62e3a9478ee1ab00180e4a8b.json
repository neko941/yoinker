        "Children are a gift from the Lord; they are a reward from him. Some folks argue that parents should control their children strictly other things they should control them freely. In my ,opinion kids should be treated with love instead of sticky behaviour. in forthcoming, paragraphs we will delve into the viewpoint of both sides.",
        "Firstly, if the public controls their guidelines  forcefully, there is a good chance that these kids will be disciplined but scared of their own parents. Controlled children's do not share their problems with their family members because they are scared of sharing them. for instance, a study reported that children with strict parents are less attached to their family members.",
        "on the other hand, parents who deal with their kids with love and give them full freedoms, those kids are more attached to these parents. they are not even very friendly with their family they respect them and shared every detail of their life.",
        "to sum up, the parent  should be strict with their kids but same way they need the love which they deserve."
