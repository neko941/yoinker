        "I believe that the worrying increase of infant obesity is mostly determined by negligence of the parents. For some people though, the main responsibility of the increasing number of obesities in children, is on the government\u2019s shoulders.",
        "As just mentioned, some people think that overweightness among children is government\u2019s fault. This might be the case for three reasons: number one, the government should control and regulate the food distributed in schools. What happens is that the government leaves the freedom to choose to each school what they want to have in their food offer, and often unhealthy food is less expensive and more popular among children than fresh food. Number two, governments should provide a better support to less wealthy families with children, in order to give them the possibility to afford higher quality food. Number three, the distribution of fast foods on the territory should be regulated e.g. there should not be any fast food nearby a school.",
        "For those who believe that it is parents\u2019 fault, there is one main reason why they support this idea. Parents are the ones who get to decide what their children eat during the first years, and a good food education depends mostly on them. Furthermore, if a child is gaining weight it is up to his or her parents to fix the situation.",
        "In my opinion, it is mainly parents\u2019 responsibility if the children become overweight. Apart from very few cases where obesity is a genetic disease and it is not strictly related to food, for all the other situations, the sickness depends on the amount of food eaten. Therefore, parents are the ones who should keep under control the weight of their babies.",
        "In conclusion, I think that too often people tend to blame the government for their mistakes. Parents are the main responsible for a good health of their children. With a better food regulation, it would be the child to prefer good quality to junk food and there is no reason why he or she should prefer a big mac to a good grilled steak. Only with a good education the number of obesity in children will start to decrease."
