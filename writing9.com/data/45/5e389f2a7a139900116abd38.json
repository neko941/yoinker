        "The throwaway society is a common terminology today. It means use a product for a short period of time and then throw away even though its life span has not expired. This mindset has emerged due to many reasons and has lead to several problems.",
        "The main reasons for the throwaway society is that the products are available easily through e-commerce websites like amazon. These products are cheaper and offer better feature at a reasonable price and since people have more dispoable income today they don't mind purchasing. For example, My brother had bought a i-phone 10 after a while i-phone 10x was released, my brother got excited about the new version, he got the product which had new features at a cheaper rate through amazon and so he threw away the old phone. Also, surprsingly there was no exchange policy offered by the company. This is a dreadful issue as it can lead to many cascading problems.",
        "The main problem when we throw away things is Recycling. The amount of plastics, e-waste and other wastes that are generated is immense and it is impossible to recycle these materials. Another impact is that these materials are disposed to a dumping ground, where it lies for years. Such materials then cause land pollution, which impacts the animals and humans residing near these dumping grounds. Some of the land pollution could also lead to water pollution. For example, there was a e-waste dumping ground near my previous apartment complex where a lot of people were diagnosed of cancer as they dealt with these e-waste. Therefore one action can lead to cascading problems.",
        "To summarize, throwaway society is caused due to accessible and cheaper products, also due to the increasing disposable income. The impact of this is on the environment and animals including human beings. It is high time now that there is a shift or change in the mindset of the scociety so that people start using products until its life span. Otherwise the day will not be far when our own action would lead to our extinction."
