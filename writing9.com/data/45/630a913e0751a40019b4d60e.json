        "In recent years technology has affected relationships and caused obvious impacts on the interaction between people.",
        "The change that happened in our lives and particularly in our relationships due to technology cannot be neglected. Technology makes our world like a small village and helps people to create long-distance relationships. In the past, people interacted and made relationships only with their relatives and neighbours who are living in the same place and usually had the same culture and background, however by introducing  technology in the communication field the case is different.  Nowadays  modern telecommunication devices make it very easy to create relationships with people from all over the world and share ideas from different cultures and change the limited relationships to be more open and international.",
        "The positive side of this development in the type of relationships cannot be denied. First of all, while  technology eases  communication and provides the chance to create an international relationship it enhances the exchange of cultures. For example, we know many traditional meals and clothes for others cultures from our friends on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. Secondly,  global interaction helps us to build a wide international network with people who have the same interest in  study or  work.  As a result, we can share our experiences and expertise with them and take their advice.",
        "Technology helps us to create long-distance relationships  that enables us to know others\u2019 cultures and facilitate the exchange of experiences and knowledge through our network ."
