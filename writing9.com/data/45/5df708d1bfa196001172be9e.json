        "With the increasing a number of vegetarians, whether or not vegetarian diet is healthy and can protect the environment has become a widely debated topic. While many believe that vegetarian diet may avoid animal being killed, other maintain that having meat and fish can maintain a balanced diet. Given that people is at the top of the food chain whish which is reasonable for us to eat meat and fish and we can use other methods to help protect the environment, I believe eating meat and fish better than vegetarian.",
        "To begin with, vegetarianism believed that vegetarian diet can improve health and be moral for animals. When it comes to eating meat or fish, a number of steps are required before we can eat them. It ranges from catching to killing. Animals are shocked by electricity or are killed directly Somebody thinks that that is not moral (humane). Moreover, research shows that most of the animals intake indigestible materials as their food, such as plastic bags and metal wastes because of the pollutions. It can threaten people\u2019s lives if we eat meat and fish frequently. Therefore, eating vegetables only can avoid the worries and concerns of intaking toxic materials into our bodies.",
        "On the other hand, some people said that a balanced diet tend to be healthy. Humans are omnivorous. Vegetables, meats and fishes all can become food for human. It will not be a balanced diet if we lack any type of these food. Otherwise, it can cause health problem. Since different food has different nutrition values, vegetables cannot totally replace meats and fishes., Vegetarians may need to eat other supplements to replace meats and fishes nutrition values. However, supplement is also processed food which cannot entirely replace meats and fishes.",
        "In my opinion, there are a lot of ways to protect the environment as well as having healthy diet. Firstly, when it comes to protect the environment, we all know \u20183R\u2019, which are reduce, recycle and reuse. For instance, we can reduce using plastic bags. We can also recycle papers, bottles and cans and reuse the clothes. Secondly, for having a healthy diet, we should follow the food pyramid. Actually meat and fish are located at level three of the pyramid which is not carbohydrates. We can also choose organic",
        "food which has less pesticide in order to be healthier. The most important thing is to choose legal slaughterhouse. Therefore, government should implement laws to protect animal from being immorally treated and to provide standards of hygiene. These tactics help to ensure the sources and quality of the food are safe.",
        "Having discussed that balanced diet is tends to be healthy and there are a lot of ways to protect the environment, I firmly believe that vegetarian diet is not the best choice."
