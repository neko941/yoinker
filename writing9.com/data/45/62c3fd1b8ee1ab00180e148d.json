        "In recent yearly most heated aruguments on poverty in several nations. The main way to reduce it to provide free education to childrens for atleast six years so, that very young people can able to read, listen and count the numbers.I completely agree with the given statement. In this eassy i will explain this point in details with relevant supporting ideas and examples",
        "There are myraids of reasons to support the given idea. Firstly,eduaction plays key role in every individual life and profession studies is easily able to decrease the poverity of country as if any orgainisation provides minimum studies  to poor people who are not able to pay the modren institution fees till the completion of primary school which results to their fruitfull life they will able to read and understand about education. Secondly, even in upgraded generations there are major concren about poverty in every single society, governament should make awarness program to make people educate speacially backward class people but also provide free educations in schools as these consequence to brithfull life and also they can earn minimum income in future. for example, people after schooling",
        "Admistration implement a offical plan on poverty which helps to take measures to resolve the problem of uneducation because, with the help of data in country constrution of institutions should be inceresed and make a rule any person can take a part atleast six years as this leads to important of studies amoung children. For instance, youngsters in the future are suitable to work as an assistant.",
        "Furthermore, parents also responsiable for making their childrens educating because, understaing the concrened about children and making them aware of studies since one year through documentaries, cartoons etc",
        "In counclusion, i believe that higher admistration of every nations should provide free education to citizens which results to reduce poverty.But, individuals and organisation in our societies also same responsiable as governament"
