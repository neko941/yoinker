Particularly, The table shows where the money came from and the charts show how it was distributed. It is clear from the graphs that the police budget increased in 2018 by more than 10.1m .",
        "According to what is shown, in 2017 , the total police budget was 304.7m which was spent for accounting 75 per cent on salaries for officers and staff. Then only 8% for technology .",
        "While in 2018, the police budget was bigger, but a good amount of money was spent on technology which lead to declining salaries.",
        "To sum up, we could say the biggest amount of money has gone to the National government in both these years. In addition the budget for local taxes a bit increased. Furthermore, in 2018, a lot of money is spent on buildings and transportation instead of salaries as occurred in 2017."
