        "Today's world is changing rapidly and so are the people living in today's world. Perhaps in this fast growing world there is a lot of external and internal pressure on students (mostly kids or teenagers).",
        "Most important factor influencing suicides could be the tough competition. There is immense competition now a days in children studying in schools in order to get higher grades than one other. They are mostly pressurised by their parents and relatives. When a child is not able to match the expectations of his/her beloved ones, they take it to their head and take harsh decisions for themselves. However, the consequences of such decisions are to be faced by their closed ones after they are no more in this world.",
        "Punishments is not a way to settle this problem as teenagers are mere kids who have just entered another stage of their life, where they have to face competition and they are expected to be competent enough to come out with flying colours. However, its not everyone's cup of tea, too much of pressure is extremely laborious to handle for children of this age. The parents should act like guides and they should be frinedly enough with their children so that the they do not hesitate to talk about their problems with their parents. The problem can easily be solved by taking proper interventions. Everyone has problems in their lifes, we all struggle everyday in our lifes and in order to succeed we make sacrifises and we work hard with determination and enthusiams. \" What doesn't kill you makes you stronger\" this is the lesson that has to be taught to every child after getting into the teenage and the parents play a vital role in phrase as it is said that parents are the best teachers.",
        "To recapitulate, I do not agree that teenagers should receive the same adult punishment which criminals receive. In my opinion, you just need to boost up their confidence again and help them out with their problems in order to get them back on track."
