        "Many commentators are of the view that certain non-cultured and refutable ways of advertisement are prevailing in our community these days. I agree with this statement to a large extent and will elaborate my perspective in the below paragraphs.",
        "Nowadays, advertisements can be found everywhere. Nonetheless, in the effort of creating an impactful advert, the makers forget the intensity of annoyance it can trigger, if not displayed effectively. For instance, persistent popping of adverts on smartphones has been considered as extremely interrupting. Instead of trying to perceive the advertisement, people usually close it with a sense of irritation. Another case in point is of advertisements on public transports which apparently is a total waste of paper and eventually tends to get dumped later.",
        "Moreover, some categories of advertisements act as bad stimulus to the thought process of young minds. An illustration of this is tobacco and liquor adverts where millennials are portrayed as taking pleasure in consumption of these alcoholic products. This tends to create a negative influence on the teenagers and adults who start recognizing them as the most fascinating form of amusement.",
        "However, there do exist few advertisements that optimistically attract the audience, but ostensibly, most of them are inclined towards deterioration. Therefore, there is an indispensable need of analyzing the means of advertisement so that they can be conveyed in the appropriate manner as desired by the makers."
