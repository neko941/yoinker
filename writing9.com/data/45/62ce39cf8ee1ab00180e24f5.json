        "Second, by owning a home, we can do anything to make our house becomes whatever we want. We can change the model, furniture, even colour of our house. We don\u2019t have to ask permission if we want to do something to our house.",
        "Besides that, owning a house means we have an investment for future. The price of house usually grows every year. For example, in Jakarta, capital of Indonesia the price of landed house becomes double every 5 years. This means having a house especially in Jakarta is one of the smartest investments.",
        "Having house is also means we know our neighbour deeply. People who live their own home usually know their surroundings better than those only rent home for living. The atmosphere of house also becomes warmer.",
        "On the other hand, owning home also has unfavourable things. We have to spent budget for maintaining of our home. We have to pay tax every year, and also some risks like natural disaster, earthquake, or even disaster caused by human.",
        "Consider their positive and negative sides, i conclude that owning a home still has more positive impacts to our life. So, if we have ability to have house then go to have it."
