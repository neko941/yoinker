        "Some people believe the the government should finance on social services like retirement pension for adults instead of spending its budget on public services like agent need while others say individually should save their fund during their working years. This essay will delve in the upcoming paragraph and subsequently will explore perspective in turns.",
        "On the one hand, Although I believe government should definitely allocate large part of it's budget on public services. The government economic sector determine overall quality of life, ensuring the basic sector such as school, hospital and roads are available to all the citizen irrespective their income and social states. The public services are needs are primary needs of the society and thus needs proper funding.",
        "For example, absence of medicine in any country will create significant problems. That's why government should adequately finance on public services in first place. Become old is normal things to everyone however younger citizen are participate important role for the country economic growth.",
        "On the other hand, retire adult are vital part of the every family. Whom encourage their close ones\u00a0 as well as providing their experiences. I think adult must save their funds during their working years. However old people also are integrate part of the society. Some ancient could save their money but most of old citizen could not save money because of high expenses. I think government should provide free medicine and treatments of low income citizens.",
        "For instance, in Sri Lanka have been provide  free hospital\u00a0treatments for citizens.",
        "In conclusion, after a thorough analysis of the topic, Although I believe government should allocate its budget for argent needs.",
        "However old citizen also crucial part of the society. I think government should implement long term concept for this problem thus if not it becomes huge impact of their life."
