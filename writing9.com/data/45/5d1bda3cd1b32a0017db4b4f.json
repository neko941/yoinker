        "People have different views about core quality of an employee whether it should be a brilliant outfit or a spectacular working performance. While there are certain of opinions encourage the benefits of dressing up brightly, an outstanding ability is also worthy to be considered.",
        "A few reasons can be given to prove that wearing smartly at work is advantageous to some extent. Firstly, appearances are usually considered in kind of jobs that require staffs must interact with customer instantly and directly such as receptionist, customer service or marketing. Having a good outfit would give clients a convincing impression that you are reliable. For example, it is believed that wearing a neatly suit will get customer an illusion about an employee\u2019s well-organization and trustworthy. Another plus point is dressing up would possibly increase a person\u2019s self-confidence. Human being would intent to have motivation to empower themselves when they believe they are being good-looking enough.",
        "On the other hand, there is a wide array of reasons that account for the magnitude of working\u2019s quality as well. In fact, a new staff\u2019s features are the aspect that enterprise would consider most. Their ability of absorbing pressure, withstanding high working intensity or a dynamic attitude would be the plus points during their probation. Another reason is the diversification of technology evolution is supporting a large number of companies that don\u2019t even need an office which mean their staffs can work at their place as long as they can guarantee the job requirement. As a result, which suit to wear at work is not a big concern anymore.",
        "In my belief, the correct answer is optional. It depends on the strategy of a company and the position people are working on."
