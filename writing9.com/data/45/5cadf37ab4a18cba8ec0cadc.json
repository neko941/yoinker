        "It is being argued by many that schools have to be entertaining , while others believe the primary objective of schools is imparting  education .keeping in view both narratives ,  I  firmly believe with the former argument.",
        "The mind of a child can only absorb limited amount of knowledge by use of conventional ways of teaching . It is of paramount importance that schools  incorporate extra-curricular activities  like singing and computer gaming classes between science  lessons to keep the minds of children fresh and receptive . To illustrate , there was a documentary broadcasted few years back that showed children who indulged in extra-curricular activities in school performed better in exams that students who focused solely on studies through out school-time . Thus, introducing fun activities is the new addition  to  achieve  high rate of success among school going  children .",
        "Another main reason is that entertainment facilities like musical concerts  in school can be linked to the performance of each individual , so that children will be more enthusiastic as well as more inclined to perform better   . They will be more receptive towards study, they will work hard to enjoy the various fun activities provided within the school premises  .As a result of this , the high achievers can be rewarded and it will promote a healthy competition as well . To illustrate , private schools in Pakistan are preferred over public school because of these entertainment facilities , as education  is nearly the same .",
        "All in all , by providing entertainment facilities schools can reward high achievers and  increase their success percentages  ."
