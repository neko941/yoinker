        "In some parts of the world, salaries of few employees are very high. Some people consider it is a positive sign. While, other set of people believe that government should impose cap on salaries and limit employee\u2019s earnings. In my opinion, I believe there should not be limit for earnings,  people get paid as per their skills set and talent, directly or indirectly it motive individuals to work hard and serve society.",
        "On the one hand, individuals who are highly talented with unique skills are very rare. They can contribute much more to their employer as well as to the country. So they must be rewarded with high salaries to motivate them to do more. One more thing, they are the job creators. With their unique skills and passion towards work get more projects for the employers. Which will indirectly help\u2019s the society and country.",
        "On the other hand, some people think it is better for government to control salaries and limit employees earnings, Government budgets will get increased. This amount can be used for the development of the country. At the same time, there would be equality among people. Government can spend more money on basic health care, education and housing, which are very basics for human.",
        "To conclude, I believe there should not be any cap for salaries which will eventually discourage people to work more and contribute to the society and by implementing a limit on people\u2019s earning will give a huge budget for government to develop country but every governments are not honest to their people."
