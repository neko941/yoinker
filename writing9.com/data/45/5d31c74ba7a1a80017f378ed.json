        "The loss of some plants and animals should be seen as a main environmental problem because of its impact. For example, the predators in the food chain cannot feed themselves when their preys disappeared. Some people said that we can feed ourselves with domestic castle and animals, so there is no harm to us. In fact, fisherman in some parts of the world cannot go fishing because of the loss of some particular types of fish such as whale. Furthermore, the loss of wild animals and plants places us under the pressure to build zoo to keep them safe in captivity.",
        "On the other hand, we have been poised on the brink of severe environmental problems such as water, soil and land pollutions or climate change that leave us more vulnerable than the extinction of plant and animal species. Of course, those problems are main factors that cause the loss of some species and put the natural habitat at risk of extinction. Moreover, water, soil and land pollutions make fresh water and agricultural land turning into a monetary and political concerns on a global scale. Also, climate change causes more frequent natural disasters of extreme weather that make our life more unpleasant. We can save wild animals and plants from their extinction, but the question is who can save us from ours.",
        "In conclusion, I think that the loss of some plants and animals should be worried, but it is just the consequence of more important environmental problems. I think we should concentrate our efforts on those problems rather than only focus on the animals and plants\u2019 extinction."
