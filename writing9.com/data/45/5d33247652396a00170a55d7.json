        "Nowadays, more countries aim to develop their medical, education and trade sector. Owing to this ideology some people higher authorities of developed countries should help underprivileged countries. I personally agree with this view point and will describe my own prospective in forthcoming paragraph.",
        "To began with, developed countries like United States of America have high gross domestic product rate as well as their primary, secondary and tertiary sector are developed. So, they should focus on other countries who are developing or underdeveloped. They can help those countries in the trade sector which directly affect there overall income of the country. For instance, most of the rich countries prefer to trade with other rich countries. Instead of that if they make policies that their 25 to 30 % goods or products should be from poor countries. Additionally, in recent survey, which depicted that if rich countries will follow this policy than the poor countries economy will increase to about 9.8% which would be a great contribution from rich to poor countries.",
        "Moreover, the underprivileged countries also have poor education as well as health sectors. However, the above strategy also affect these two sectors indirectly because if economy of poor country will increase then they can improve the infrastructure of health and education areas. Additionally, in health ares, the rich countries should give hands to poor countries. To exemplify, South Africa is a underdeveloped country and there are many diseases, do not have cure and suitable doctors to eliminate that diseases. So, developed nations should send their experts to that areas to cure people.",
        "To encapsulate, though poor countries are trying to improve their nation. However, in this field elite nations can contribute alot by follow above mention strategies and help them to build there health, education and trade areas."
