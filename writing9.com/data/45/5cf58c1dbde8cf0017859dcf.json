        "Advertising has always been a major component of marketing. There are different methods which has been employed by manufacturers to make the consumers buy their products. Some of the methods deployed in recent times have been tagged to be unacceptable and unethical. I strongly agree with this assertion and below are my reasons.",
        "Products are currently being advertised in different ways which can be said to be unethical. Manufacturers have been seen to put up adverts that don't just promote their brands, but also put that of their competitors in the negative light. A typical example is advert on detergents where one brand claims that it's product washes off aged stains while the others do not. Additionally, companies that manufacture products which have been identified as being harmful to humans, market these products as though the products are entirely harmless. The tobacco companies are the main culprits in this instance.",
        "These forms of advertising are totally unethical.",
        "Some other modes of advertising can  be deemed to be unacceptable in this modern era. Unlike in the past when televisions were not common, today most home can boast of having one. Some manufacturers come up with adverts that are targeted at children and these commercials are aired in the evenings when these minors are most likely to be watching the TV. For example commercials on unhealthy foods are advertised and target at this susceptible age group and some gullible adults.",
        "Furthermore, some of these companies use the image of children's hero to promote these products. Some ice-cream buckets have been seen to have the image of Spiderman on it.",
        "These adverts aimed at these gullible age groups is unacceptable.",
        "To conclude, advertising as a means of marketing is good but has its negative impacts. I strongly agree that some of the methods of advertising are unethical and unacceptable. However  with good regulations and enforcement, these negative impacts can be reduced to the barest minimum."
