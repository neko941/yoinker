        "The fact that all the news that we read in newspapers,hear on radio or see on television is not entirely true and is mixed up and messed up under the influence of various factors like political pressure and people's interest is not unknown.Political personnel tend to buy the news according to their requirements and people also like watching news which is negative in nature.",
        "The two main aspects that influence the decision of news editing are the political pressure and the inclination of public towards the negative.Firstly , bureaucrats or the government officials in power try to mould the news in their favour to avoid having an impact on their vote bank.For example,in India before the elections the news is always in favour of the current ruling party so that they can influence people to vote for them again.Secondly,the people like to see criticism and hatred in the news rather than the acheivements and the betterments that the society has made.In the recent survey by times of india ,the TRP of the news that is displaying war or anti police activities like robbery or threat,is a lot more than those trying to showcase the good in the society.",
        "People generate a habit of watching bad news,and discussing anti government or anti social topics over tea .Rather, if people focus their minds on the betterment of the society and generate productive ideas for the same, the world will become a much better place to live.In an interview , Sandeep Maheshwari a very famous psychiatrist suggested people sufferning from depression to stop watching news completely as it was bringing further negativity in their lives.",
        "In conclusion, its important that the news is based on truth and must not be inspired by such external factors like political  or TRP  influence.People must also focus on positives to bring and spread those vibes in the world."
