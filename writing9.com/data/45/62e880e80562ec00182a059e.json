        "The diagrams compare the university's sports centre layout prior to and after the renovation plan. Looking more closely at the layout, It can be seen that there are considerable discrepancies between the two maps after the construction plan.",
        "According to the map, All facilities are separated, which pool, changing room, gym, and seating are situated in the main building also flanked by the outdoor courts.",
        "Whereas, on the second map there will build more amenity functions. On the west side, the outdoor courts will be removed in favour of a leisure pool, which will be larger than the current pool. Moreover, the changing room is connected next to the new sports shop. In the middle of the layout, there remain unchanged except the gym will be lengthened eastward adjoining sports hall and two dance studios. Furthermore, there are a cafe and changing room opposite the sports hall on the south side."
