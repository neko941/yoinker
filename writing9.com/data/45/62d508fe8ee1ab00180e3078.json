        "Nowadays junk food takes control over the healthy diet and become poeple's number one choice. However, the usage of fast foods should be decreased by higher taxation of the sellers, as the alcohol and tobacco. In this essay, i will look at this solution.",
        "First of all, wa are all aware the healthy consequences of this eating type, due to their contents, they are rich in salt, sugar and fats as result of this community may suffer a high blood pressure, in addition to rise blood glucose and cholesterol,and obesity. For that reason government should take a step for this problem as they did in the  other unhealthy habits like smoking and drinking alcohol, in order to, prevent all these disease and their complications,",
        "When the items become expensive most of society will think twice before buying them whether it deserves to spend all this money or not. For instance, there are two shops in our village beside each other one of them is fast food and the other is fruit shop , so the local municipality charged both of them a tax per year, then suddenly they increases the tax charge which is not same amount, the pizza house have much more than the fruit shop seller, after that the owner of the pizza house told his customers that he will increase the the cost because of the government money, then he lost many costumers.",
        "Nevertheless, expensiveness of the items will not be enough help with out healthy education for the population. For example, the story above not ended their but there are many other who collect their money to buy one single pizza especially Children and teenagers.",
        "In cunclusion, adding some extra cost would be helpfull for the limitation of the quick service eating habit although it could not be enough."
