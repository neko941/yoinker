        "In the job market we can usually find two kind of job options. One group of people like the full-time woking  option as it provides more sustainablity. The second group of people think that the liberty to work pressurelessly is only possible with part-time jobs. From my point of view, full-time working facilities have more benefites than it's counter part.",
        "In todays world, the sustainablity of the income source has more importance than ever before. Expances of of our daily life is increasing day by day, which makes maintaining our monthly budget very difficult. A full-time jon generaly has more salary then the part-time job. This bigger wages gives us the space to expand our budget if nessacery . It also helps us to ensure to have some savings for our uncertain future. This full-time works also have other advantages such as pension, insurance support etc. Not only that, a full-time workers get more respect than the casual one in many society. Since a full-time job offers a future security, the employees remain mentaly calm.",
        "Have not casual jobs any significant benefite? Athough full-time jobs seem more appealing, casual works have some positive side also. The first and the most noticable one is the liteness of the work. Because of the low payments, part-time workers enjoy a very pressure free working environment. They also get more freedom of mobility than any full-time employee.",
        "That being said, the facilities a part-time worker enjoy can never overwhelm the positive outcomes the full-time workers usually get. A full-time job demands a huge amount of responsibility to a person. In return, it brings stability, financial comfort and a safer future."
