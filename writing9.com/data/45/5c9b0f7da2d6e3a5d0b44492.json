        "Examination play a major role to judge someone's ability. These days children have to undergo either the regular class tests or the periodical assessment. Both kind of assessments has its own benefits and drawbacks which will be discussed henceforth.",
        "Enumerating the pros of these examinations, the judgement of the two kinds vary. The daily tests could be beneficial to the child in revising the things easily without much hassle. The assessment of the lesson that is taught a day before, help child as well as the teacher to understand the strength and weakness. However, the examination conducted after few month or an year help examine the child's retaining ability. Because, it is very essential that the student remembers lessons taught in the beginning for the life time. This clearly shows the importance of both the types.",
        "On the other side of the fence, both exam system has its own weaknesses as well. Setting a paper and correcting them regularly could be cumbersome to the teacher who might want to indulge students in other countries curricular activities. Moreover, overall performance of the student who fell sick or took a few days break would get affected adversely; on the same note periodical tests have proven to be more stressful to child as it requires the revision of the whole syllabus at one go. Nonetheless, it is an apt process to judge someone's memorising skills but will be biased towards students who are not good at performing in time constraint manner.",
        "Conclusively, examining of various skills of students could be done more thoroughly with the blend of both the kind of tests. Since, each system has it's own issues, it is crucial to opt two of them to learn the child's abilities effectively."
