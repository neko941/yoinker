        "It is a common belief among the people that there would be problems for young generation if the employees are allowed to work post attaining the age of 60 years. This essay completely agrees with the above statement. Firstly, the unemployment will increase and secondly, there will be reduction in the promotions.",
        "To commence with, providing extensions to the retired employees will result in the rapid rise of unemployment. In turn, the well educated young people will be forced to do unprofessional jobs at a mearge salary. A prime example of this is the South-East Asian nations wherein, most of the unemployed youth are doing scale scale businesses to make both their ends meet. Hence, it is the need of hour to provide adequate opportunities to the youngsters.",
        "Furthermore, there will be lesser number of promotions for the employees working in government as well as private sectors. They will feel less motivated and as a result try to search out for additional opportunities. For instance, a recent survey conducted by \u2018Times Now\u2019 has found out that most of the youth from Asian nations aged between 25 to 30 years are migrating to North American countries in search of better job options. Therefore, organisations should work towards taping the skilful talent.",
        "On the contrary, experience of the elderly staff can come handy in case of critical situations. They usually possess vast amount of knowledge about different subjects. Moreover, this will ensure that they don\u2019t feel isolated with the increasing age factor. Thus, it would be beneficial for their physical as well as mental well-being.",
        "To conclude, with the every increasing technological advancement, it has become quite essential to provide opportunities to youngsters having expertise in latest trending skills. The governments can play an integral part to ensure that the transition is smooth."
