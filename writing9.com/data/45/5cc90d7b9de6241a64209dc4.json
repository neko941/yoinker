        "Nowadays, many parents arrange private tuitions for their children outside the school as they consider that this practice will help their kids to COPE with immense education pressure. Not to speak of only parents who are keen to provide extra classes after school hours to their kids, even, schools are also transforming into a full-day study centre. Additionally, there is a cut throat competition among all the schools to hold the number one position in their city, therefore, they do not leave any stone unturned. They do not want to show any loop hole in their education system. All these practices can cause unnecessary burden on kids.",
        "Neverthless, from last many years education sector has emerged a lot, most schools are not just educating children in the science, languages and mathematics. They concentrate on HOLISTIC development of children. Every now and then there are seminars, competitions and extra classes as well as special attention to be given to all the students. These extra-curricular activities always provide great help to students.",
        "Also in some schools due to large number of pupils, teachers are unable to concentrate on each and every student and this search end up by getting additional help from outside. What is more, extra tuitions are always beneficial for weaker students who find it hard to grasp everything related to vast subjects with deeper knowledge in schools. In these cases extra help provided to them after school hours work as boon for them.",
        "To conclude, children can be benefitted by getting this extra help, studying after school hours, should be encouraged among them. However, pressurising students unnecessarily to get into studies all day is not an ideal idea."
