        "In recent decades, the dilemma question whether children\u2019s education should be paid by governments or not remains a source of controversy.  Although numerous people argue that national defend and security should be considered as more important,  I personally support the idea of free education for all children.",
        "Firstly, free children\u2019s education supports poor people . In many third-world countries, it is difficult for poor people, whose working time is spent almost for survival purpose, to approach/ afford the fee of education . By paying the educational costs, the governments could assist poor children to have a chance of going to school. As an example , the proportion of educated people in mountainous areas of Vietnam has been increased quickly after 20 years of free education.",
        "Secondly, free children\u2019s education supports  to social equality of social  . One of the most popular aspects of social inequality is the shortage of education in poverty areas. So, there is a need to help children in all over society to receive education , because knowledge is necessary to reduce social gaps. For instance, various mountainous people have been given the chance to attend to national universities thanks to the free education policy.",
        "Finally, free children\u2019s education profits the sustainable development of countries. In light of the fact that third-world countries always have high proportion of uneducated people, free education helps  to promote the rate of development. As a compelling evidence, the Human Development Index (HDI) and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of Vietnam has have  been multiplied by 3 times after two decades of releasing free children education policy.",
        "Finally , in conclusion, it is important to have free education system because undeniable benefits it generates."
