        "Personality development such as social or intelligence among children's should be enhanced from their childhood. however, few people believe that educators should take complete responsibility rather than parents for developing their skills. this essay disagrees with the statement because parents play a major role in a child's life and moreover most of the time, kids are well connected with their parents.",
        "First and foremost, let us consider why parents role is more important than the teacher. that is mainly because in a typical day children are spending hardly 8 hours in school with their teachers, but remaining hours are spent with their parents, so they should take utmost care to teach the offsprings about the social benefits and how to face any situation in an intellectual manner. To cite an example, a recent survey on children has revealed that most of the students who are the leading fruitful life are the individuals who were nurtured basic manners from their younger age.",
        "Nevertheless, although the management takes steps to incorporate or educate children about a social well being, parents are really crucial to make a stronger Foundation because, mostly,  children try to imbibe their parents and they consider them as their role models. For instance, In a recent interview, a successful Businessman revealed the secret of his success stating that his father footsteps were the reason which eventually led him to become a famous personality.",
        "To conclude, in order to make a child lives more prosperous both educator's, as well as parents, should play a pivotal role in which, parents have a bit higher priority in molding their kids since, they are there real heroes and actual mentors."
