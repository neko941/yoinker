        "Governmental duties such as free university education are controversial issues. Some say that it is one of the duties of all governments to spend money for it because it is a priority for the society and some say that free education should only be provided for beginning to highschool students and the money for university education should be devoted to other critical issues such as healthcare system. In this essay I am going to discuss both sides opinions and give my own.",
        "In one hand some people believe that free university education for all who are willing, brings equality and helps the society to develope. They believe that the profit of this investment overweigh its costs for society and it should be done.",
        "On the other hand, some say that free education is  only necessary in limited grades. As society faces many problems such as health and environmental issues and budget is limited, Every dollar that is spent on free university education means that other priorities are ignored and would run out of money so this investments drawbacks, overweigh it's advantages.",
        "I agree that deciding about free university education is not an easy task and it needs experts opinion. but personally I believe that no one should be limited for university education due to lack of money. If governments are not able to provide free university education, they should consider aids like loans that could be afforded by students and they can be pay it back in a long term period after graduation."
