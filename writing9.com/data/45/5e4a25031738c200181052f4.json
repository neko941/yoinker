        "Music has always been a magical key that could eliminate completely culture barriers between people from different countries. Hence, some people would say that coud pul everyone closer, even at different ages Honestly, when I heard this a the first time, I thought it was exaggerative thingking. But recently, I certainly make an acception wih this statement that music is a well-appropriated way for lessening peple distances from every countries all over the world and at different ages.",
        "The major reason that I consider music as a comformable uniter is people all have music types in common, although having different nationalites, different ages or even different genders. Lyricists and musicians are likely to depict the culture and human lifestyles in their creations Also, foreigners would choose different languages songs and enjoy various music melodies primarily beause music is inspiration, motivation power and passion for huma-beings, especially young listeners. Furthermore, music is also considered as a invisual mentally friend which releasing pressure, disappearing our sorrow, leveling our lifetime and escaping from hectic pace life.",
        "In addition to this, music could open a new world for those who love and work related to this field. Some people would say that music is a mystical door which let people join another places without stress and tiring activities. What is more, music creates a plenty of oppotunities for people to live on their own ways, reveal their personalities and introduce our unique culture to people from different countries. This could be handle for people to easily exchange our culture, civilizations, languages, connect people an create good relationships. I heartily love this connecting way through music, music is not only connect our minds, thinkings but also our gorgeous soul.",
        "To summarise, music is such a specifc way to get people closer. Specially, music has a particular energy that could boost people moods and make happiness. People have similar taste in music could have the same way of talking, thinking and acting primarily because music is recognised as a soul, these soulmates could show our abilities and our personalities. People are advisable to spend more time on sharing with this soulmate in recent times when busy life is happening day by day to have a productive life and add more new friends."
