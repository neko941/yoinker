        "The charts exhibit the alterations of a certain UK academy in their yearly expenditures for the years 1981, 1991, and 2001.",
        "The highest portion of the money spent in all 3 years goes to the teachers' salaries.  On the other hand, although having the lowest total expenditure, a substantial increase can be seen in spending on insurance.",
        "In detail, there is a fluctuation seen towards the expenditure on teacher's salaries from 40% in 1981, rising to half the total spending on 1991, then lastly reduced by 5% on 2001. In 1981, 30% of the total portion of overhead is spent on resources, and furniture and equipment, subsequently reduced by 5% in 1991. By 2001, the total percentage of school spending on the latter exceeded  2% of that of 1981.",
        "Furthermore, a stable rise in the portion that goes to insurance can be seen, although it remains to have the lowest percentage among all of the school expenditures. Meanwhile, the proportion of expenditure on other workers' salaries declined over the years, from 28% in 1981 then dropping to more than half in 2001."
