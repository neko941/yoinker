        "Now-a-days technology is playing a major role in almost each and every aspects of the daily routine of all the individuals and also the daily businesses. Though it is good that technology is helping many of us in various issues, there are some drawbacks also. I would like to give some of the facts on technology pros and cons.",
        "To begin with, Technology brought a drastic difference in major sectors of the society which is very helpful for each individual. One of the best example for technological improvement is video calls.Even though our closed ones are very far from us, still we feel that they are very near because of this video calls.If we discuss further more, technology reduced the difficulty of carrying the heavy emotions.Where as coming to the technological development in businesses, the people are getting benefited through easier and simpler communication instead wasting lot of time in travelling and moving to the other places just because to update the information.",
        "On the other hand, because of the same usage of technology the human relations are getting disturbed. Not only the human relations but also the businesses too. There is a far difference between communication face to face rather than communicating through social media. Giving birthday wishes to the person directly by hugging is different from posting his photo in social media and giving the wishes. In the same way, going to the businesses place and explaining our concept will have better understanding rather than just sending an email.",
        "To conclude, I strongly believe that technology is very important for all the individuals these days but this doesn't mean that it can play a major role in killing the human emotions. Every individual should utilise the technology in a good way and need to get rid of the drawbacks."
