        "Governments of many states are supporting artists financially, but some individuals consider that it is wrong and there are many other areas to invest money in more productive way. This essay agrees with the second opinion because the art cannot improve people\u2019s life better in material way.",
        "Supporting artists by financing their creativity is the way to bring the art into the masses. This support could make the entire art more popular in the society and could increase the number of artists overall. For example, state could give aid to the beginner painter with renting gallery to expose his paintings and make them popular and in this way this artist could become famous. But this measures are not giving any significant values for the society and, to be honest, are really waste of money.",
        "On the other hand, there are many other institutions which continuously need investments and financing of them is vital rather than the art. One of such areas is the healthcare, because the level of its development takes effect on people\u2019s life quality immediately. There are big costs for the medical insurances in many states and giving financial support to this area could decrease final costs of medicine for the people. Based on said above, supporting social services are more useful than supporting arts.",
        "In conclusion, there is a huge governmental support for the art and artists, but who really need more comprehensive government\u2019s assistance are the social services and the first of them is healthcare because it makes people live better and longer."
