        "One can understand importance of things only when it\u2019s needed. But something is better than nothing phrase can only explain view of some people who thinks lessons of good parenting should be taught in school. As per my understanding parenting lessons does not hold much importance to school goers. In next paragraphs I will try consolidate my view about topic and view of teaching good parenting in school.",
        "It\u2019s of great importance that one must learn about parenting. Even though generally people don\u2019t go for parenting classes when it\u2019s required. Over and above reading habits of people are also on down side, which means mostly people don\u2019t even read about good parenting. So, in such a times, thinking of some people about imparting knowledge of such an important subject in schools can\u2019t be wrong, at least seed is sown.",
        "School goers may not be interested in such a subject. They can\u2019t appreciate importance of subject because they does not need this information at this stage of life. For example many subjects are complimented with practical experience in schools, like doing science experiment in laboratory. Where they can apply learned knowledge and appreciate the subject. But schools goers can\u2019t do parenting practical\u2019s, however parents attending good parenting classes can do apply learned knowledge from class and can understand and experience the importance of this subject.",
