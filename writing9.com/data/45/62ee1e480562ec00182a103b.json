        "After completion of high school, young people are advised to work or travel for a year before they join their university studies. This advice has positive implications on the youths such as saving money and gaining experiences but there are disadvantages that their motivation level of study can reduce and there is a delay for career development.",
        "The core advantages of taking a gap year are collecting money for the school fee and explore more about the world. Higher level study cost more compared to secondary school like textbook fees and other learning material so students need to save money ahead of the commencement of their studies. In outside world, there are a lot of interesting things to explore which can give life experiences. By travelling to different places will give these experiences for future studies. According to recent statistic, education fees in country is increasing 7% each year.",
        "Although students can gain above advantages, defer school for a year could result delay in future career as some students are not willing to return to their study life after travelling or working for a year. Nowadays, it is very competitive to get a job and employers prefer candidates who are young and experienced so it can result in adverse impacts when they apply professional job. In our environment, there are many youths, who gave up their potentials and decide to satisfy with their current positions.",
        "As a conclusion, taking a gap year can benefit if people gain life lessons while travelling or collect enough money for their third level studies. But it should neither lead youths to give up their studies which will lead them better future nor delay in their careers."
