        "The tradition of living with parents even after post-marriage years is relatively common in some of the Asian countries, such as India and China. Although living under such an arrangement might hinders couple privacy, there are other advantages which are so immense that they easily supersede any of the shortcomings of the joint-family culture.",
        "One of the most significant advantages of living along with parents is that they provide an excellent supervision opportunity to grandchildren. If both guardians are working fulltime, they can leave their infants under the custody of their grandparents. For instance, during my childhood period both of parents were working professionals and they used to come home late in the evening, I had spent most of my after-school-hours with my grandfather.",
        "Another factor to consider is that while living with elderly parents, adults could look after of their physical and mental health. This is also a social and cultural norm in some countries to take care of parent\u2019s health by staying with them, rather than admitting them to old-homes. Thus, such an approach is not only safeguard country\u2019s tradition and culture, but also provide an ideal opportunity to elders to stay close with their loved ones, especially in the later years of their lives.",
        "Contrarily, living in a big family may offer some challenges in term of lack of privacy. That is to say, by living in a single house with full of people, husband and wife may not be able to share their private moments expressively. However, this problem can be mitigated if the house provided is large enough and it can be divided into separate sections. In this way, everyone can live freely without being interfered by others.",
        "By and large, in certain parts of the world married adults, even with their children, choose to live with their parents. While this approach may not be able to offer full privacy to their personal lives, other advantages, such as children supervision and taking take of parent\u2019s health, clearly offer more benefits than drawbacks."
