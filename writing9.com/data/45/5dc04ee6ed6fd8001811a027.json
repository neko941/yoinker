        "We as adults spend most of our time at our jobs. Job satisfaction plays a major role if we enjoy it or not. While salary is a very important thing to consider before taking up a job, I feel there are other factors too that contribute towards job satisfaction. In this essay, I will discuss them and will present my view.",
        "There are numerous factors to consider before taking up a job. Firstly the organization profile, we should not take up a job with a fledgling company that might soon close. Then the commute time, any job that requires long hours of travel will leave us drained at the end of the day. We should also consider the future career prospects and the scope for professional growth in the organization.",
        "On the contrary a good salary is also required for our monthly sustenance. We need salary to pay for our monthly expenses like rent, utility bills, travel and other expenses. Also we need salary for future savings, so we can buy a house, car, take a vacation, etc. So having a below par salary would affect all these.",
        "To summarize, salary is one of the major issue to consider before choosing the job, but it is not the most important one. There are other to consider, like I discussed in this essay. Hence I disagree with the statement."
