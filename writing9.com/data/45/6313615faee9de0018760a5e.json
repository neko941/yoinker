        "Nowadays, bussinesse are willing to win against their competitors by decive their customers, telling them the false information about their product or survice. This action could cause a very remarkable impression towards the customers and can cause fatal damage to the company or the business. Some advertising uses spaical effect and image to attract customers but in some casethis can also bring misunderstand between businesses and customers, making customers belive the product in the advetise is identical to proct the busniess is selling. Misundance will also leave a negative impression of the company and so on.",
