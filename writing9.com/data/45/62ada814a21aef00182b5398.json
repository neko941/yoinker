        "It is believed that by some professionals that learning a foreign language at primary school is better compared to secondary school. This essay will argue that advantages of this outweigh the drawbacks. The esay will first demonstrate that the earlier someone learns an additional language the more likely they are to master it and it brings added congnitive benefits, followed by an analysis of how the primary disadvantages, namely confusion with their native tongue, is not valid.",
        "First and foremost, at a young age, children have a high memory power due to which they can learn new things in a lesser time. So, if children learn a new language during their pre-school days, then they will get beneficits of brains and get more time in other fields during the secondary schooling. Secondly, mastering a foreign language can be beneficial to many students if they plan to settle abroad for job opportunities. As an example, if a child learns 5 new words meaning of other language daily in young age, this child will be mastering in that language and brain will aslo be strong to memorize when that child becomes adult.",
        "Those opposed to this say that it causes the child to become confused between their mother tongue and the other language. However, there is actually no evidence to support this view and children from bilingual families do just well in both languages. For example, my niece was brought up speaking in both Chinese and Myanmar and she can do well in these two languages like as other children. Moveover, she can say English as well as other languages because of attending in International school.",
        "On balance, the fact that learning new language early can lead to higher fluency and improved brain function clearly outweighs the diadvantages of confusing languages."
