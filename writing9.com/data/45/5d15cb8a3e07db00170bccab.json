        "It is irrefutable that the mankind has evolved over a period of time from the perspecitves of not only technological but also social advancements and innovations. However, many vateran historians and archiologists are of the view that our ancient civilizations were not far behind in terms of knowledge.",
        "If we compare the technological capabilities of current era against the previous century, there is no doubt that we are much more sophesticated today. Over the last hundred years, we have jumped leaps and bounds when we think about the innovation in the communication and transportation technologies. For example; the internet, the satellite televisions and the radios would have been considered as things of fiction if someone would have talked about them two hundred years ago. Similarly; cars, helicopters or planes are invented just over hundred years ago. The industrial revolution and healthcare innovations in the last two centuries have completely transformed the way we live our day to day life today.",
        "However, as we might not be aware about the techlogies of the past, we cannot claim that they did not exist. Many archiologists from around the world have found the hidden evidences of advancements of ancient civilizations. For example, during the archiological surveys in Harappa and Lothal in India, the researchers have found the evidences of well paved roads, drainage lines and active ports which might have been developed about five thousand years ago. Additionally, the pyramids in Egypt have proven that even before five thousand years, highly advanced civil as well as biological knowledge prevailed on this planet. Preservation of pyramid's structure and the dead bodies (also called mummies) till date can not be considered as a small feat by any measures!",
        "In my opinion, I somewhat agree with the view that in the last two centuries, the human race has seen the knowledge transformation like never before. However, it would be injustice to our ancient culture if we would consider it as backward when would compare it to today's era without any concrete proofs."
