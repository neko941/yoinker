        "It is argued that rich nations around the world should take care of war affected migrants with basic amenities like food and shelter. This essay agrees with this idea because it is inhuman to keep affected people of other countries in barbarous conditions of refugee camps or jail while these people have the potential to be the active workforce of wealthy countries.",
        "When people are bound to seek assistance to get rid of the war or riots that is going on in their home countries, developed countries should respond positively. First world nations are capable of providing shelter or food for the war affected refugees. If anyone is capable of helping others in their need, humanity should act to provide assistance to those who are helpless. Historically, we have seen a lot of wars and numerous count of refugee migration from the affected countries to rich countries. For example, war affected people from Syria are currently seeking protection in Canada and Canada government with all Canadians are now ready to sponsor families of Syria.",
        "Rich countries often have shortage in the active workforce. Refugees from around the world are of different professions, and they are capable of filling the shortage on employees in different fields. When developed nations integrate immigrants with care into the mainstream resource pool, they will surely be benefited with further growth. For example, Japan and Russia have negative birth rate and each year they are falling short on active workforce. They can take policy to accept refugees and in turn fill the void in the field force.",
        "In conclusion, war affected immigrants should be welcomed by first world countries because it would be inhuman to keep people in vulnerable state and also immigrants can contribute to the economic growth of hosting country."
