Moreover, There is a big segment of society which is extremely poor. They can't even think of purchasing these electronic devices. Computer education is beyond their reach. To exemplify, according to world poverty clock in 2021, roughly 86-6 million of the population are living in poverty.",
        "Furthermore, There are bunch of people living in remote areas which has not any link with the rest of the world Moreover, There is no electricity in such remote areas. The utilization of electronic devices is far away from their thinking.

Nowadays, children need spectacles in their early childhood. This situation is a result of computer's bluescreen. which in long run could ruin their eye vision which we know is irreversible.
