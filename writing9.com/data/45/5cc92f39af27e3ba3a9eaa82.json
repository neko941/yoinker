        "Government should provide financial aid to educational sector rather than  health care delivery. In my own opinion, I feel the health sector deserves more funding.This essay will pinpoint reasons.",
        "Health is wealth,this is know to be a popular adage.An healthy nation is a wealthy nation.",
        "Without adequate funding in the health care sector many citizen of a national will not be able to get good health care and this can lead to detrimental effects.For example in developed countries like America where the health of all its members are very paramount,it can be seen that there is increased productivity in such countries. There is state of the art medical equipment to diagnose and treat any medical conditions because the health sector is fully equiped.No wonder why our own politicians and the rich people in the society run abroad with any little ailment but here in Nigeria thousands of people die yearly due to ailment that could be treated if there were to be medical equipments",
        "On the Contrary, failure in the educational system is also a failure to the economy.Ignorance they say is a disease.",
        "When the educational sector is left unfunded then we should expect an influx of illiterates in the society.This illetracy also affect health somehow. Research has shown that illetracy has a negative impact on the health seeking behaviour of people.Take for example a person with kidney problem will rather take herbal concotions which will further injure the kidney or better still the kidney will pack up,they are ignorant of the detriments of concotions to a failed kidney.If they were educated this would have been prevented.",
        "Moreso,one can be educated and education will not reflect in the person's character or behaviour..Education is not only about going to school.Also there are alternatives to been educated,one can decide to learn skills rather than going to school but health can not be compromised.",
        "In conclusion,education and health sector requires funding by the Government,health sector should be paramount because of the numerous disadvantages a failed health system might cause the nation."
