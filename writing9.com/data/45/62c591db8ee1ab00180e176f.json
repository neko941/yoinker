        "The art industry is a free market, which rewards only the best and government intervention would take away the incentive for hard work and perseverance and therefore rob us of some great works. For this reason I strongly disagree that governments should take steps to fix the unfair situation.",
        "Art as an industry has always been rewarding for a few artists and a nightmare for the rest. It is an immensely competitive, cut-throat industry and reaching the top is no easy feet. Some artisit's work is not appreciated during their life, Vincent Van Gough for example, and the struggle these people go through adds to their work. Many art historians believe that without the emotional and financial struggle Van Gough went through, his work would not be as beautiful as it is.",
        "Another reason why the government should not intervene is because by doing so it could damage the authenticity of the industry, causing people to enter this world for financial reasons alone, rather than love of art. Artisits enter this industry with no guarntees and do it for the love of their work.",
        "On the flip side, arguments could be made that the government is responsible for regulating the markets and making sure it is fair for everyone, and the art world is no exception to this. The government should help new artists with financial stimulus and give them the same opportunities that famous artists receive.",
        "In conclusion, while some can argue that government intervention is needed, in my opinion, tampering with the art world would  take away from its authenticity and may be detrimental to the art world."
