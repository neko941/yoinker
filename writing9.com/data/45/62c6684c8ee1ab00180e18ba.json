        "To begin with, most of manufacturing company have  created their commercials and tend to publish through news paper, TV, radio. They have spent money on create those commercials and published through well-known source. However, there are many platform has opened recently with the technology development such as online platform Facebook, Instagram, online shopping app..etc As a result, people who are interested in certain products, they can have chance to promote these items as their agent. So manufacturers did not need to spend money on the commercials. For instance, if they hired a celebrity who has certain followers in social media, they would able to promote their products without additional cost.",
        "In the other hand, Most individuals tend to select their items,if it is branded item. So when there is newly company, they could not gain recognition easily.
