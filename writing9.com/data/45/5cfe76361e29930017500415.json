        "In this digital world,smartphones have taken control over human brains and many businesses and individuals are fully utilising the opportunity of communication either professionally or socially with preference over of sitting and talking.There are pros and cons to this dependence on technology.In this essay,I will pen down to state some of them.",
        "Technology has crippled mankind with their easy access and superhuman quality.The screen based media has been rampantly used by the businesses for promoting their adverts as well as gaining propaganda in the world of human turned robots.We have been so much engrossed in texting and browsing that  the smartphones have taken away our capability of abstract and intuitive thinking.Cell phones are now being called as extended minds where humans lose their ability to comprehend.The age of face to face discussion has become extinct to such an extent that people cannot dream of a web free world.To add on,the crime rate has increased among children with their easy access to the prohibited sites along with  multiple social networking sites and thereby causing huge impact on their  psychological development and  forcing them towards a dark future.",
        "However,technology is not bad and we should be properly aware of its specific usage.Leaving apart the addiction towards texting,web media has provided  with  vast information within fraction of seconds that was unthinkable in the era of telephone and telegraph.Not only that, people can communicate with their friends and relatives anytime and anywhere across the globe.Social sites like facebook,twitter and instagram have become the closest friend of human beings, which apparently have removed all the  man made boundaries.Telecommunication has been really a boon to mankind with its justifiable usage.",
        "To conclude, businesses and individuals are using telecommunication both professionally and socially. Unfortunately ,this mode of communication has been exploited by the mass media leading to crippled human beings with loss of intuitive and critical thinking. Social browsing has increased the violence among children. To think in a positive way, it has helped us in gathering vast information and made communication easy through various websites  which have  created a new world of screen web media."
