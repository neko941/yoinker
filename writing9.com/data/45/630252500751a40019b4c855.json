        "The pie graphs illustrate the percentage of various kinds of cars which have used the major road bridge in the UK in 1965, 1985, and 2005. In the following paragraphs, the fluctuations in using diverse vehicles will be discussed in detail.",
        "It is evidently observed that the proportion of private cars has significantly increased in these three years. In other words, private cars were approximately half of the vehicles using the bridge in 1965, then, it grew to 55% in 1985, and finally, surged to three quarters in 2005. A similar trend occurs for recreational vehicles such as motor homes, although it is a slight increase, i.e., it started from 4% in 1965 and increased to 9% in 2005. Nevertheless, this trend is the other way around regarding public transport vehicles. That is, their use of the major road bridge decreased from 29% in 1965 to 14% in 1985 and 5% in 2005. Finally, lorries and other commercial vehicles used the bridge more in 1985 (20%) than in 1965 (1985); however, a sharp decrease can be observed in 2005 (9%).",
        "Taking everything into consideration, one can conclude that the private cars' use of a major road bridge in the UK has growingly increased in comparison to other types of vehicles."
