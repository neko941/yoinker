        "We are living in a age where every adult is supposed to update himself instantly with the latest happenings and rapid changes. In fact, all of us are literally coping up with the news and information overload through various sources like television, internet, radio and newspaper. Any news, good or bad, catches a massive public attention if media gives more footage.",
        "Bad news is often broadcasted as \"breaking news\" on television news channels. Even in newspapers, it finds a prime location to catch public's eye. Bad happenings or crime news catches early attention as it is different from usual, regular happenings. People are curious to know more and more about it as they think, \"It can't happen to me.\" On the top of it, TV or print media often does hammering of the same news for an indefinite period of time which makes people interested to know real-time developments in the news story. News on a serial-killing, for instance, would make people quite desperate to know about the further moves of the killer and efforts being made to catch him. Bad news also gains publicity as it provides warning and alarming signals.",
        "Good news, on the other hand, is related to technological advancements, sports, celebrity, events and so on. Such news can be further glamorised to catch more attention of the readers or listeners. It definately has a healthy impact on people's mind and is good for children too who are psychologically weaker to digest crude realities and shocking news. Even for the bad news, sometimes media has to perform a mildening role by reducing the shock intensity to lessen the panic.",
        "I think media should focus on such news that carries weightage to cause some kind of social development and is oriented to generate awarness and consciousness in the burning issues of the society."
