        "The growth of online shopping is believed ,by numerous people, will one day result in the closing of all store in towns and cities. Personally, I am totally against this idea because both store and the online shopping still have some advantages and disadvantages.",
        "In recent years, there were a significant increase in online shopping. It s not only an increase in the values of property exchange but also a various kind of property which be sold such as clothes, food or high-class jewellery. Online shopping is flexible, so it is suitable for  people who lack s time, or live far from shops. It is also easier for customers to compare the price of property or write a review for others. It may not need a real estate locations which may cost rented money.",
        "On the other hand, the store are located in a fixed position with  real estate. It cost more money for investment so the property may have higher prices. Besides these disadvantages, people who come to shops will have more experience with the property. They can feel it by touch, my the nose, and they can easily compare those. They believe that buying a good is an experience with both sense and logic.",
        "Inclusion, It is true that there is an obvious increase in online shopping in many ways, and in the future, most  the goods will be sold online. However, buying a good sometimes is an experience with both sense and logic  and the good way to get this experience is going and find it in the shops."
