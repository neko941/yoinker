        "Nowadays, technology plays an important role in our lives. We can easily access everything from the home even we can watch movies for the portable things like mobile, smart phone and laptop. Others believe that to get the full enjoyment you have to see it in movie theatre. In my opinion, watching films at home is more comfortable than going to the cinema.",
        "On the one hand, watching movie on the electronic gadget is less expensive than buying a movie ticket. The other advantage is you can watch movie any time and save money. In fact, you can pause or forward any scenes. For example: If we are going cinema, we have to pay for a ticket and taxi further us buys drink and refreshment is getting more expensive than relaxing  and watching movies at home.",
        "On the other hand, watching films in cinema give you more enjoyment because they are fully equipped and high technology machines and big speaker. In additional now in some theatre they provide a reclining seat that feel like a bed also provide a 3D effect. For example: Jurassic world was filmed with 3D effects to look and feel dinosaur realistic. Another reason is in movie house not one distract you in between drama, but at home you can easily distract.",
        "To conclude, I personally believe that watching films using tablets and computer is more joyful and interesting than going to the cineplex."
