        "Some people believe companies should only promote those employees who have been working for a company for a long time. I totally agree with them as it gives workers working in a company a greater sense of appreciation.",
        "Firstly, promoting people who already work in a certain firm gives other employees a sense of appreciation. The reason behind this is if companies promote their employees within its structure then it will encourage other workers to work hard and get promoted. It will create a sense of competition among staff to work hard and get their desired outcome. In contrast, if any business hires someone from outside the company or someone who has just joined and has been promoted to a higher position it will have a negative impact on long term employees.",
        "Secondly, a long term employee knows the company better than a newly appointed staff member. When a person works for a company for over ten years, he knows the ins and outs of the company\u2019s workings, and can be a much greater asset than a freshly appointed employee. Every corporation has different type of hierarchy systems, and an old employee knows exactly how certain work should be done within the firm. Lastly, long term employees may be more loyal as compared to novice employees as he has been working for so long for the firm.",
        "To conclude, long term staff should be given preference when it is time for a promotion as it give other old and loyal employees aa sense of appreciation and also acknowledges that they are more knowledgeable than newly hired staff."
