        "There is a growth in the options available for the employment throughout the world. Many",

        "On the one hand, people argue that working in the same company have a lot of advantages, for example, influence in the company increase over a period of time, which give you a sense of comfort.",
        "Additionally",
        ", the residence of staff most probably remains the same, and as a result, the commute may be easier. Furthermore, it is always smooth to deliver the task in a familiar environment. However, sticking to the same kind of job do have many drawbacks. With regard to change in work place, people have opportunities to explore new areas of subject. For instance, a surgery resident after learning surgical skills from one consultant might improve his skills further if he joins under another institute's consultant. Moreover, employee can develop new ideas if he is allowed to work in unfamiliar kind of office, as he thinks differently. Finally, if a person gain abilities in different sections of his field, it will improve his CV, which again help them to attain better positions in company.",
        "In my opinion, although working in same place can be comfortable due to familiarity of work and commute, people can gain better skills and develop novel ideas, which will improve the CV. Therfore, it always advised to change the employer after certain period of time."
