        "With the increasing level of violence in society, whether or not television and films are having a negative impact on society has become a widely debated topic. While many believe that apart for programs with violence, television programs have a huge variety of channels, other maintain that linking violence on television with crime rates in the real world is not directly relationship. Given that television programs can be informative and educational and violence in society may not be directly related to the fundamental society problems, I strongly disagree that violence on television and in films is having a direct result on levels of violence in society.",
        "To begin with, television programs have different types. Apart from programs with violence, television also have other programs such as documentary, educational programme, television drama. Arguably, not everyone wants to watch television programs or films with violent scenes. Furthermore, there are only few parts in the programmes contain violent scenarios. On the other hand, programs can also be informative and educational. For instance, Discovery Channel, TED talk and BBC Learning English. To a certain extent that programs can fulfil an educational purpose. Violence on television programs or in firms are only involved as a part of the whole videos. Therefore, that is not directly reason that leads to the levels of violence in society.",
        "Secondly, it is no reason to show that violence in society is the result of more fundamental social problems. The fundamental social problems can be widely debated issues. For instance, unemployment, infrastructures and health care issues. That involve different types of people in society. That problem with violence on television programs or in firms are not directly linking to the level of violence in society. Take unemployment as an example. It is not because of the increasing level of violence on television programs or in firms gives rise to unemployment rate. Conversely, the fundamental social problems rely on government\u2019s policy.",
        "In addition, many people believe that the increasing levels of violence on television and in films is having a direct result on levels of violence in society. Although some people said that the children can imitate the behaviours they see on the television programs. The truth is that the violence on television programs or in films is supervised. As we all know the films are classified into different categories in order to protect young people from exposure to material which might be harmful to them. And also, Parents and teachers teach children that violence is wrong. Therefore, we should not be over-worried that the violence programs twill effects children\u2019s psychological development.",
        "Having discussed that television programs have various types and violence in society is not the result of more fundamental social problems, I firmly believe that violence on television and in films is not having a direct result on levels of violence in society."
