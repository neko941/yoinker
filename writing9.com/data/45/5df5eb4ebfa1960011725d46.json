        "Nowadays, people have adapted to the throw-away culture and are involving in the over-consumption of the products. Moreover, within a short period they are disposing these items and running behind new ones. This essay discusses the problems, causes and also the solution.",
        "Firstly, consumerism plays a vital role in the lives of the human-beings and it encourages them to acquire more products and services. Henceforth, they are using the articles that they buy for huge prices, for a minimum period of six-months and looking out for new ones. In addition, the other reasons for them to live in this policy, is because they are getting attracted by the advertisements. For instance, my cousin who is studying college, has bought Samsung A30 mobile last year, but recently he has exchanged this and got A50 due to its advanced features without even thinking about the cost. Furthermore, this habit has also become popular among children, that they change the schoolbag, shoes as well as playing items like video-games every year.",
        "However, the problems due to such life style is enormous, because the others who are unaffordable try to adapt themselves to this new lifestyle, due to which they are squandering a lot of money unnecessarily. Secondly, the toxic garbage due to the disposal of large electronic items within a short time is polluting the environment.",
        "Indeed, some of the solutions to this problem is that, people must think twice before exchanging for new products within minimum time limit and must ask themselves whether it is necessary.  Secondly, instead of throwing away these items, they can sell them online so that middle - and low -class people can buy these new and less used products at a cheaper price.",
        "In conclusion, the concept of throw-away has disastrous impact on the public and the society, however it is better to abolish this culture so that everybody can have a peaceful life."
