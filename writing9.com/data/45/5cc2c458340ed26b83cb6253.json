        "It is common that travelling to another city or country at least once a year. Therefore, scores of people seek for new place to take a trip. Some places are not only fresh but also dangerous, such as for instance, Sahara Desert or Antarctic. It is better to investigate on the advantages and disadvantages to travel to those sites.",
        "As a colossal of people feel bored about their tedious life and going to a place that is too famous and almost everybody near you went their before don\u2019t decrease the feelings. So, they pursuit a new lifestyle for a while. For their sake, they don\u2019t mind it includes little dangerous. If it is a dangerous location, they will feel more self-satisfied. Maybe the more challenge it is, the more excited they are. I remembered several years ago; I and my family went to a place which not a lot people knew it. When we arrived there, there was no convenient stores in the small village. My father was proud to tell us that only traveller who were really good at finding a natural place can find that village. Even we just arrived, but he loved the place immediately(quickly). Therefore, those less popular places can offer a different feeling than other places.",
        "Even the experience is funny and interesting, the bad memories never recede. I remembered at that night, when we went to sleep, the pillow covers were one black side and one white side. They only showed you the white side. The blanket was not that clean too. That\u2019s the downside when you travel to a place usually not a lot of people come. The live conditions might be really bad when you decide to try those places",
        "It is better to know the exhaustive information about the challenging place before you go. Moreover, after traveling back, showing friends the picture and seeing their shocking face is interesting too. So, I don\u2019t regret to go there, but I don\u2019t want to go again."
