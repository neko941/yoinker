        "Entertainment and sports companies are said to earn higher than doctors, nurses and teachers which are taken to be professional sectors. In this, the essay I will elaborate on the impact on societies and state my own view.",
        "First, the setting of the entertainment and sports companies is designed with so much energy it is an avenue for creating fun and making people to gather with their loved ones to while away stress , anxiety and depression.  Entertainment has to do with constant practice , and more energy needs to be exerted , full concentration and moreso it helps in body fitness. ,Furthermore the government sees this as part of a huge way to raise funds for the societies especially when it comes to competition with other countries and because of how people are so entangled to it . Another reason could be that while on practice lots of people encounter a series of injuries both internally and externally. People see entertainment and sports companies as a diversional therapy which helps to ease off stress psychologically, mentally, physically and emotionally.",
        "Secondly, In the aspect of professionals like the doctors,nurses and teachers, people tends to value them more because they are seen as the front liners when it comes to health and moreso healthy life is paramount and this can't be achieved without the teachers educating the doctors and nurses.",
        "In my opinion, both sectors have their own vital roles to play in every aspect of life. But when it comes to who should earn more, I honestly feel that professional doctors, nurses and teachers should be highly rewarded more. firstly, teachers exhaust energy making research on new ideas and information for knowledge and also able to impact it to their students. While, doctors and nurses fight so hard to work as a team and save lives regardless of the pressure and stress."
