        "While some people are of the opinion that allowing an unpleasant circumstance such as dissatisfaction with one's work and inadequate funds to stay is the best thing to d Some others think that it is much better to take actions to counter such circumstances. I believe that as humans, we are in charge of our lives  hence, we can take steps to make better any unwanted situation we find ourselves.",
        "On the one hand, individuals who feel that unpleasant situatuons should be accepted think  so because if the tendency for desperation by men leading to criminal acts such as prostitution, fraud or even robbery. When trying periods present in a man's life, it is best to accept and do nothing about it, rather than go extra mile to act in discordance with the norms of the society. This is evident in countries like Singapore which has the lowest crime rate in the world because its citizens are contented with the status quo.",
        "On the other hand, individuals who opine that it is more beneficial to take actions to change this unwanted situations think so because as a higher animal, we possess the ability to struggle and get out of whatever situation we do not like which i totally agree with. This way, depression can be avoided and the trend of poverty in generations can be averted through breakthrough ideas and doing things differently to achieve a different result. To illustrate ,Dangote who is currently the richest man in Africa changed his own story by gathering ideas, then resigning from his former company before starting his own business in the year 1996, and gradually he rose to where he is today.",
        "To conclude, accepting an unpleasant situation is good, as individuals can avoid being desperate which can lead them to commit crimes but i believe that for every situation we find ourselves that we detest, we can take bold steps to reverse them."
