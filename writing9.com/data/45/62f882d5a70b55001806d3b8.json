        "Some communities believe that, it is unfair that everyone should get retired without considering their proficiency but for some ,pupils it is necessary to get retired at an early age and enjoy benefits. Certain occupations do not require a break at a certain age. In this essay, I will discuss certain reasons for this matter and then give my opinion on this statement.",
        "Firstly, Retirement is the break for a human being to enjoy the rest of their life with their family and it also provides some befits like pension, etc. For some pupils who are in a particular ,occupation it is mandatory to get retire from their work. For instance, for people who work in ,mines it is compulsory to give retirement at a particular age.",
        "Secondly, some organizations do not provide a retirement option for a pupil who works in the private sector. And it is also necessary for normal middle-class people to work even after a certain age. For example, A middle-class software employee works even after 65 years because it is  necessity to lead his family.",
        "In my view, I agree with the given statement that it is not mandatory to get retire after a certain age. And also this retirement process will give opportunities to the youngsters."
