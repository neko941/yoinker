        "Technological development has made it possible for almost every person to have a personal phone and computer which has resultantly made it possible for many working professionals to work from the comfort of thier homes. I agree that the advantages that working from home brings clearly outweigh any associated disadvantages.",
        "Firstly, working from home helps the employers to reduce thier operating expenses. Since the person is remotely at home, the spacing requirement for the office reduce drastically resulting in decreased rent and other auxillary expenses including electricity and other utilities charges. Working from home is also perceived positively by the employees which significantly improves employee motivation and results in better performance.",
        "Secondly, the employee also reaps great benefits by working from home. This not only helps the employees to save on thier commute time, which makes up a lot of time of the day due to traffic congestion at peak hours, but also the cost associated with travelling. Moreover, this also gives the liberty to work at flexible hours. This results in spending quality time with the family and friends, hence improving the work life balance.",
        "Admittedly, there are some basic problems associated with working from home. These include problems in monitoring of employees as the employees might feel that they are not being watched and start taking advantage of this. Also, there could be a slight loss in synergy as compared to when the employees are working in the same location.",
        "In conclusion, i think that there might be some disadvantages associated with working remotely such as difficulty in monitoring of the human resource but the benefits it yields are far more greater than any such drawbacks"
