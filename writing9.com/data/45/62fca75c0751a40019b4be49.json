        "On the one hand, taking time would have many merits. First of all, having a gap year lets students have various experiences. Through a gap year journey, they can have direct or indirect experiences that they have never had, facing new and diverse cultures and people which are in various new field and different from people that they have faced. For example, they can not only experience the cultures of other nations but also be taught  foreign languages. Secondly, a gap year can be the preparation process for university. For instance, pupils can study additionally about the parts which are necessary to university process but they lack. Moreover, if pupils cannot decide their major yet, working in that area would be of help to decide it and earn money for tuition themselves.",
        "On the other hand, there are some demerits which cannot be ignored. In terms of study, be the discouragements. The longer period that students rest from studying is, the more likely they are to forget the contents they learned and how to study. If students rest from studying due to a gap year, they cannot understand the contents which are educated in university. The second drawback is that it can be a waste. When pupils do not spend efficiently time, that time becomes just a waste. Moreover, if although they go abroad, they cannot adapt  there and come back, it could be a waste of money, such as airfare, starting up cost, and so on, which is invested can occurs."
