        "Nowadays, many societies facing problem with the obesity.  This problem is affecting both children and adult.  In this essay we will discuss about the reason behind it and how it could be tackle.",
        "One of the main cause is that, many people like to eating junk food like Chips,  Burger, fried chicken, Chocolate and cold drinks.   The reason is that, the people have not much time to make homemade food, so it is easy to buy junk food and eat, which is contain salt and high level of cholesterol, which is very bad for health.  One of the solution is that, government should increase the taxes on junk food and fast foods restaurant to discourage people to buy un-healthy food.",
        "Another reason behind the obesity is working environment.  People stay long time behind the table and they don\u2019t use to take break for walk or starches to keep fit. Children prefer to play game on electronic devices at home, instead of outdoors games.  The solution is that, people should do exercise and walk on daily basis. Parent should take their children outside and encourage them to participate in outdoor games like football and swimming.",
        "Third reason to increasing obesity is eating habit. Many people are used to skip lunch because they don\u2019t have much time to cook handmade food for office. They take dinner directly after breakfast. This habit will effect on digestion system and people started fatty.  The solution is that, people should take balanced diet, like vegetable, fruits and some protein in their meal instead of skipping lunch.",
        "The sum of that, people should avoid eating junk food, do exercise and don\u2019t skip the meal during day time. Government should increase taxes on junk food, people should increase walk in their routine life and take balanced diet."
