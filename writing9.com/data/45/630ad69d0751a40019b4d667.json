        "Nowadays, more and more students are having a part time jobs, some of them are aim to earn more pocket money for themselves, others work to subsidize their families. But is it really necessary for student to find a job rather than study more?",
        "On the one hand, some people might think it is a good way for children who have a part time job to learn something beyond the school. For example, they not only can learn how to socialize with other employees but also realizing how different the work is from school and workplace. Furthermore, having a part time job during the school time can help you understand the hard of making money, so that you would become more mature and would not splurge on something you want rather than actually need it.",
        "On the other hand, others insist that children should spend their whole time on learning, because they think it is the only way to increase their children\u2019s competitiveness in the future. If you don\u2019t keep the grades well in the school, it is impossible for you to get the tickets to enter the famous enterprises such as Google and Apple. Additionally, the opportunity costs are too big to having a work during school time. As a student who doesn\u2019t have any degree yet, the only payment you can get is the basic one, so why don\u2019t you study hard right now and search a high paid job in the future?",
        "As far as I am concerned, I think it depends on what kind of job you work in, if you work in a company that is related to your major during school time, it will be seen as a great experience when you are searching for jobs. However, if you work in a place that don\u2019t have any expertise, I think it is really a waste of time."
