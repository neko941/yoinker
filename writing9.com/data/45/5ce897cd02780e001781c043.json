        "Nowadays, schools are teaching many different subjects. Some people assert that it is important to teach children physical lessons, whereas other people believe that schools ought focus on academic subjects rather than other subjects.",
        "In one hand, schools should pay attention to the academic subjects. the more teaching the children have, the academic performance will rise. When children give their attention to something, they get better on it. Moreover, the academic lessons they have to attend will help them success in their future life after graduate from the school. For instance, If a child dreams to become a doctor in the future, he should be teached a scintest subjects.",
        "On the other hand, schools should include a physical education for children. The reason for why the physical education is important that children should not focus only on academic lessons, they also need to change and clear their minds. When children do something and pay a lot of attention on it they will get tired. Consequently, they will not have the energy they need to perform better at school. Furthermore, having physical classes helps children learn how to definse themselves. For example, if the children learn Kung fu, they will be able to protect themselves agains the brutal people.",
        "To sum up, people argued about if it is crucial to have physical classes in the school while others think that schools should only focus on the academic classes. In my opinion, schools have to include physical education in their curriculum."
