        "In the contemporary era, majority of the people spend more time on internet . Internet plays an important role in individuals life. On internet, there are plethora online sites such as flipkart, shein, clubfactory etcetera. So,numerous number of masses are buying what they need through online sites. I will discuss both pros and cons for individuals and organizations to do online shopping.",
        "Glancing towards my points of merits that firstly, it becomes a trend that individuals buy many things through online sites. There are numerous positive effects of online shopping on masses and organizations. People can save time,if they buy things through online. Secondly, many online sites provides many offers to the customers. In this way, people get offers and discounts on those things which they purchase through online . As a result, people buy more things. Companies can gain profits by the customers because if customers spend more money for purchasing things then organizations gain profits by selling cheapest things to the customers.",
        "Commencing towards my points of demerits that, individuals spend more money on clothes and other things and buy through online sites. Manytime they receive defective pieces. Moreover, many online sites do not refund the money  and then customers face hurdles because they lost so much money. Furthermore, sometimes customers do not like the online service then they send many comments on internet sites. As a result,  organizations face difficulties because in this way, they lost the repotation.",
        "To conclude, online sites is the best way fkr purchasing things in short time. Individuals can start new business through online sites. However, poor quality of online products also risky for both individuals and companies."
