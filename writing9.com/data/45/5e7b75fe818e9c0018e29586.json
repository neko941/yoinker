        "It is evident that, these days in many developing nations, the distance is widening between rich and poor when it comes to their earnings. This essay, I will shed some light about the factors contributing to this problems and will also suggest some solutions to tackle the same.",
        "Growing income gap between poor and rich people leads to arise many problems in any country. This will afflicit the society. More over it would impact on country\u2019s economy too. For any nation social inequality obstacles the growth of the country\u2019s economy and Government\u2019s would face lot of challenges to control economic problems such as price hikes, demand and supply chain disruption etc. If inflation goes out of control, poor people would suffer to afford basic needs like food, water and shelter etc required for them to survive everyday life and un affordability of these essential things would create other serious problems like in tolerance, protests raised by poor people. All of this happening in a country can create political instability or crisis, having no control on this can lead to civil wars.",
        "Goverments should take necessary actions in order to control the income gap between welathy, middle class and low class people. First Government should control illeterature in the country and come up with skill development schemes for mid and low class people which will help them to build necessary skill set to get a job which in return improves the earning capacity and to have a good affordable social economic life. Goverments should come up with the policies where minimum wages needs to be paid for the people irrespective of type of job they do to meet their living standards. Goverments should collect more taxes from welathy people and spend that money for job creation, build  good infrastructure, establish industries and provide finanace support and encourage skilled people among middle and down trodden classes to build good balanced society.",
        "In a conclusion, For any country,  social equality among all classes of people is a key for the growth of the country\u2019s economy and government should create an environment where people in a country can live with equal social economical life."
