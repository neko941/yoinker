        "Modern medicine significantly prolongs people's life. Moreover, elders live not just longer but happier too. Moreover, their increased health conditions allow them to live their senior years to the fullest and enjoy travelling or spending quality time with their grand-grandchildren.",
        "For the tousands of years, all the civilisations held respect to the older people due to their knowledge and experience. For example, the youngest head of the catholic church was no younger than 60 years old. The newer generations can strongly benefit from the guidance of their precedessors. Especially, professors and other high profile specialists are often working long after the retirement age to help new generations to learn and grow faster.",
        "On the other hand, the world is slowly but steadily getting overpopulated and faces new challenges. For example, China has crossed 1 billion population with the land half of the size of Canada which has rougly 65 million inhabitants. The governments across the globe are proposing new solutions to provide decent living for the seniors. The most common solutions are supporting immigration of young professionals and incresing retirement age.",
        "As far as history remembers, there was no age without major challenges. The civilisations fought deseases, protected their countries against ruthless invaders, or struggled to get food on a table. Today, none of the above is problem anymore on such a large scale as people were used to in the past. The advanced medicine helped to grow the population to the unprecendent scale but I believe that governments, scientists and entrepreneurs will again prove their qualities and solve this challenge as they did so many times before."
