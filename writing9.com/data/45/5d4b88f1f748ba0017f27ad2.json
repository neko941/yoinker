        "In the modern era, some businesses select employers from within their own country rather than sourcing the staffs from foreign country. There are a lot of pros and cons behind this phenomena which I Will discuss in upcoming paragraphs.",
        "To begin with,there are numerous benefits why businesses choose to recruit from within their own country rather than overseas, but the most conspicuous one stems from the fact that businesses are hired the employees from their own nation ,it overcomes the rate of unemployment, especially for youth.They attain well paid jobs in their own nation in order to fulfill their basic necessities. For example ,if employers are recruit the youngsters from their own country, then they can utilize their spare time on the work.Therefore ,the rate of crime and poverty are negligible from the country. So it is very good thing for the individuals as well as society.",
        "To contrast,having a lot of advantages, the re are also some disadvantages.first and foremost, developed nations have plethora of skilled worker and they also have vast amount of experience about every field which are very helpful for increase the productivity of country. In this way,if businesses do not choose the  workers from the overseas country, then they might loose  to recruit expert's who may improve the financial condition of the country. To illustrate,overseas workers have lot of experience how to deal with other nation,hence,businesses might loose their productivity by not choosing the workers from developed countries.",
        "To recapitulate, from what has been discussed above,it concluded that although, host nations loose chance to choose the skilled person from foreign country. However, it has also a lot of merits present. By selecting the workers from their own nation, it saves the nation from crimes and also provide job facilities in their country rather then moving another developed country."
