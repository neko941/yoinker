        "The first common strategy used by examiners is to replace the correct word or phrase with a definition. By doing this they can test whether students know the correct language. In this, case the correct word for \u201cfixed punishments for each type of crime\u201d is \u201cmandatory sentencing\u201d. Other examples include replacing \u201ctourists\u201d with \u201cvisitors to other countries\u201d and replacing \u201cgap year\u201d with \u201cwork or travel for a year between finishing high school and starting university studies\u201d.",
        "The second strategy that examiners use to test students is to use non-academic phrasing. A common example of this is \u201cSome people believe\u2026\u201d which is used in the example question above. Academic essays are about presenting ideas objectively and drawing conclusions. What an individual believes is unimportant \u2013 only the ideas are important. Using this phrasing serves no useful purpose and distances the writer from the ideas being presented. An academic writer must take responsibility for the ideas they are putting forward, rather than distancing themselves from them.",
        "The third strategy used by examiners is to present two extreme points of view drawing some students into thinking that there are only two alternatives when there is a range of possibilities resulting in incorrect language choices."
