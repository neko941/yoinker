        "No one can deneing the importance of internet in our life, which allow us to communicate and share information whith each others. However, going back in history we will find much more important inventions,which had have changing our life to be more easier in these days. I completely disagree with statment that internet was important than those inventions.",
        "Throughout the history there were inventors who still have a profound impact on our life today. Taking WWI and II, a medical exploration had saved millions of people life, which was a Penesilline antibiotic, before this medication more than 7 million have used to daying by small injuries if it get infected. Thus, such invention considered as life safer. Also, it was taking more than a month if you travelled from London to Roma on horse for example, this way of travelling have completely changed when one of scientists discover the automobile vehicle based on weel's concept. Therefore many dicoveries in transportion were mainly depend on such concept.",
        "In addition, they could not be internet, if the was not electrisity invention by Adison. So, even electrisity have more role in our life than internet, for example, many home gudget and machines depend on electrisity like TV, washing machine, refrigrator, air conditioning, etc. Although the internet has help us in communication with each other through chating and sprea information via education platform, Telephon and printer invention did it before. Therefore, the internet has excelerated and enhanced our old methods.",
        "In conclusion, after a careful analysis, I could argued that in spite of discovery of internet has broaden our world to become as small valliage, there were many invention much important than the internet."
