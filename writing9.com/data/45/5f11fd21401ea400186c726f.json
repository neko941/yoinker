        "The more country develops, the more people tend to buy a car. In my opinion, I consider that personal cars can bring more drawbacks for the environment compared to any advantages for individual it might bring.",
        "Admittedly, there are some basic benefits for the people who have a car. Firstly, it allows people more freedom to travel as they can choose the route themselves and take detours they want. Furthermore, cars have built-in air conditioning, cushioned seats and other luxuries that make it a more comfortable way to travel. Secondly, using public transport is more time-consuming and crowded, so with having a car you can read books, listen to music or even can play with kids while you are in your own car but those all seem to be impossible in public transport.",
        "Nevertheless, despite the advantages above, I believe owning a car has serious downsides for the environment. For instance, the number of cars in the road has a direct impact on air quality because exhaust fumes are a major contributer to air pollution. Another negative aspect is that as the number of cars rises, the demand for more fossil fuels increases, which cause more pollution as well as a depletion of world\u2019s resources. An issue associated impact of cars is the building of roads to support them as road building has a big impact on emissions and wildlife.",
        "In conclusion, serious disadvantages such as pollution and depletion resources that bring for environment  outweigh any positive aspects."
