        "In modern world, mastering English language is crucial for everyone. While many people believe that teaching English for students has a higher priority over teaching local languages,",
        "others see that this approach is risky and causing local languages to be forgotten. In my opinion, teaching English language is a necessity for everyone. On the other hand, we should not underestimate the importance of local languages.",
        "First, English is a primary tool for people's communication. As the world is becoming smaller and communication is being direct and live. People from all around the world are using English, especially when they don't speak the same language, as their main tool of communication. Consequently, whoever is lacking this skill, is at risk of being isolated. Therefore, empowering students with today's number one language is vital.",
        "For instance, multinational companies ensure that any recruited employee should have at least a professional English level. Otherwise, his hope of joining such corporation will never be achieved.",
        "Moreover, most of high tech and scientific articles are being posted in English, therefore, acquiring English is a one-way ticket to access these knowledge.",
        "Second, local language is a key for any people's culture. Their cultural and historical inheritance can only be maintained by preserving the language. For example, art work, such as poems , will be worthless , if the language that can decode its magic has died.",
        "Third, maintaining the local language require cooperative efforts. The whole society must take the decision to preserve their mother tongue language.",
        "Namely, social awareness is essential to make people stay conscious of the importance and uniqueness of their language.",
        "In conclusion, although English is the number one spoken language in the world, which is giving it unprecedented importance in all academic measures,",
        "local language is the only way for people to be connected to their history and culture, and all efforts reserved for maintain it will never be a waste."
