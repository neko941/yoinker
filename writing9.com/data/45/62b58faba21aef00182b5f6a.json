        "Thanks to the development of lifestyle. There is no denying the fact that parents odd the children who break the law also have to bear some kind of punishment. However, I completely disagree with this opinion and have opposite idea with that.",
        "Looking at the argument for the view that their children break the law and they have to suffer the consequences with them, it is admitted that some of them prove to be quite strong. In fact, one common justification is that not all children are good at listening their parents teaching them. One strong argument in this case is that there are some stubborn kids, they often argue back at what their parents say, they don't listen. So here, it is clear that the wrong thing comes from the children, not their parents, who have tried very hard to teach them. There is no reason to force their parents to be punished even if their kids did something break the law.",
        "Indeed, as for the supporters of the idea that punishment is unnecessary for parents of spoiled children, they certainly have solid reason for their own point of view. And obviously, their justification seems convincing as well. It could be argued that children spend more time in school than at home, so it is possible that things there such as teachers or friends are the cause of the problems. For example, in highschool there is some students have negative peer pressure. This leads them to turn to drugs, alcohol, and do bad things to get them because students can't make money yet and easily to become a criminal without their parents knowing anything.",
        "From what has been discussed. I completely disagree with the opinion claiming that parents of children who break the law should be punished in some way, because they are responsible for their children\u2019s actions. This stems from the fact that there are children who do not listen to their parents' teachings and they are more often influenced by the outside environment than in their own home."
