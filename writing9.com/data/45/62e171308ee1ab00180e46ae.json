        "Young peoples are the most important asset to the community. The growing pace of the major cities is tremendous. Due to the developments, adults face major issues in employment and cost increases in their education but these problems are resolvable by the government, implementing policies for the young people as well as providing liberalisation in their education cost.",
        "Employment stability is not guaranteed for adults. A company have more options to hire anyone from another state because of the city development as well as this will degrade the job opportunities for the young people. For example, my cousin was selected for the manager post in the food department but the company hired another person with more experience and older than him from another city. The government must look into the unemployment issues by the effect of city growth and implement a rigid protocol for the companies. Employment is always a basic right for  adults and this should be properly governed by policies from the government."
