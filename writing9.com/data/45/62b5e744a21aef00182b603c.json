        "Nowadays, modern life has a great deal effects on our bodies in terms of phsycological and physyological. With the development of technological instruments such as smart phones and internet, the accesibility to many things is provided easily. At the first sight, even these gains appear in positive in some ways, especially, this situation brings about various detrimental consequences. In addition that i advocate the view which familes are affected by this quick life, it is going to be detailed this claim by some examples.",
        "It is a strict fact that technological benefits, which are acquired from the past to today, have presented important opportunities. One of the most noticeable instance to be given at this point is the time saving. In other words, to reach anything, such as information, finance and health services, evaluated to a rather comfortable point. However, in spite of all positive sides, technologic addiction has commenced to threat each individuals up to a particular degree. Instead of allocation time, most of hours are wasted on screens. As this abnormal issue deteriorates the communication between people, at the same time, different psycological disorders are to emerge. Unfortunately, the biggest victim is families.",
        "When it is analysed the consequences which technologic addiction brought, it is declared the serious results. According to the scientific study which is conducted by Toronto University in Canada, families suffer from the lack of time quality. From different perspective, another meaning of this survey result is that family connections are erased thanks to the overmuch use of technology. Normally, this matter is another cause of stress. As long as the isolation increases among family members, stress levels will be higher.",
        "Eventually, from the examples and explanations given above, negative effects of modern life on families are a significant problem and it is a necessity to find solutions in order to avoid from this problem."
