My Government, is unable to provide job opportunities to all the educated. This in turn not only lead them to poverty zone but also poor schooling for their next generation's. For example, if a family has four members, out of which one was earning, then it won't be sufficient to fullfil their basic needs. So, they can't effort for better education for their children. They tend to move to outside of the city to decrease their expenditure. This situation contributes to deforestation, creating and hazzard to environment.",
        "In order to overcome the above problems, The Government should take following actions. First, It should create awareness in the public related to large families and their consequences. For example, creating a programe, showing the pros of small family and cons of large. Apart from the mentioned, it should encourage, employement sources, so that people can with stand by their own. For example, family with two salaried will have better life than the with single income.",
