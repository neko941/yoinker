        "With the advent of digital media, companies have been striving to increase their sales by using different ways to make their advertisement more effective. This has both a positive and negative effect on society.",
        "Celebrities have been used to endorse various products. Firstly, they are famous among the wide population. Secondly, there are seen as a role model by many people. For instance, research has shown that people tend to buy their favourite star use or endorse.",
        "While making different ads, the agency also keeps in mind the target audience. For example, a tv commercial of some toy usually incorporates a child or cartoons to make it more appealing to children.",
        "However, these advertisements can have good or bad impact on society. It can be good for the companies, as it is a source of introducing their products in the market. Nevertheless, for consumers it can be bad in some ways. For example, people consider some brands as a status symbol, which put pressure on other population to buy things they do not even need.",
        "In conclusion, advertisements have changed the way a product is now sold. In my opinion, it has mixed influence on the society as a whole."
