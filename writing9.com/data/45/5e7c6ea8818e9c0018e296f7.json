        "It is argued that,only governments and big establishments can improve the environment,that individuals have no impact.",
        "This essay disagrees with the statement because people's actions directly affect the environment and individuals are the ones to enact government law on environment.",
        "To begin with, individuals are always in constant interaction with the environment.The condition of an environment is invariably a result of how people in that area interface with it,that is to say that when an environment is in a good or poor state,it is a clear evidence of the actions of the individuals located within it.For example,a recent study which was conducted in Ireland on the importance of human activities on the environment showed that about 64 percent of a community's population stopped discarding their plastic waste carelessly after they were educated on the environmental problem associated with it.",
        "Furthermore,no government law on environmental protection will take effect if the citizens do not key into it.if individuals do not perceive any benefit for themselves or their environment from any law made by the government,they will be very reluctant to act on it.for instance,when governments world wide were clamouring for a green environment, encouraging individuals to plant trees or stop cutting down of already existing ones in order to save the planet,this movement would not have been successful if individuals did not see the importance of it.Hence,we can see that individuals play a massive role in improving the environment.",
        "In conclusion,it is totally agreed that individuals are actively involved in enhancing the environment as their actions influence the environment directly and they also act on government programs that are beneficial."
