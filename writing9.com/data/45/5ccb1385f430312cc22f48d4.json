        "Examination is said to be the boss of students irrespective of age or class and it is an integral part of learning process. Excessive special attention is given to testing recently, the necessity to prepare for it and examination mounted unrequired distress on young knowledge acquisitors. This essay will discuss in details why testing students is essential.",
        "To start with, there are limitations on what tutors can do when it comes to preparation for examinations but to impact knowledge on their students. For instance,  they do lots of work to preparing what to teach their students on daily basis, coming to the class to transfer every information necessary for students to know. Conversely, it is evident that teacher's duties during testing time is to examine their students.",
        "Moreover, readiness for academic evaluation start from the first day in class, it is an exclusive duty of each student to note and start preparing for examination as soon as possible as this will measure their level of their understanding.",
        "Example of this is, student who studied what was taught in class on daily basis and read ahead of the next class might not experience unrequired tension while preparing for test. However, anxiousness can not be ruled out in the face of examination.",
        "To conclude, this essay discussed prominence given to testing in recent days and the preparation which is limited to knowledge acquisitors even in the face of not needed distress. I believe that young learners should be evaluated to be sure of their level of their competencies."
