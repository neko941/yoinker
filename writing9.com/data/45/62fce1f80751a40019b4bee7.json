        "In this Era, people can work and live a comfortable and happy life anywhere they like due to the improvement of communication and and modern technology although it can be used in wrong ways which can harm the  society. I hereby support the this view and illustrate my remarks promptly.",
        "Whilst, Communication and transport had greatly advanced the human being can work and contact people while they are staying anywhere. Further more lets take an example, working in call center a person can be in different continent still work foe a company that is not situated in his country and still get paid and live suitable life. When it comes to transport, the use of advanced cars with high speed allows people to get there destination on points  and do there jobs effectively and efficiently.",
        "The cons aspect for the society is that the use of new technology has led to commitment of crimes like robbery and conducting miscelenous activities. When it comes to transport it has greatly led to pollution of the environment with carbom mono-oxide exhaustion which has effected the society which respiratory illnesses like asthma and others.In addition  due to high speeding and recklessness driving   transport system led to many accidents and death of many innocent people. Likewise the use of modern communicant technology and transport gives greater opportunity to mankind than its side effects which can be revised by the government and institutions.",
        "I conclude  that modern communicant technology and transport is beneficial  to the society at large and should be used as expected."
