        "Often people want to achieve a lot of success in this life , but they may face failures. And the problem might be in the person or it might be a bad luck. However, most people believe that the problem is just a setback.",
        "There are two types of people who face failure. The first one is common , who can\u2019t admit their failure. And another type of people are those who can learn from their mistakes and failures. People from the first type will always blame others for their failures. They can\u2019t learn a lesson from mistake. If we are talking about the second type, unfortunately this type is very rare. This type of people always gain experience from their failures and successes. If they failed , they will analyze what they did wrong. And they will not blame other people , only themselves. This type of people have a lot of chances to become a successful.",
        "If suddenly you got failed , you should understand that you did something wrong. For instance, you failed your school exams and you got a bad score. Instead of thinking that you got a bad score because , maybe the teacher doesn\u2019t like you , you should analyze why you got a poor score and prepare better next time.",
        "I include myself in the second type of people. To be honest, sometimes I can\u2019t just admit my failure. I think that\u2019s a normal human behavior. Because we always try to protect ourselves. In anyway after some time I can take my failure. But I\u2019ll always try to be better."
