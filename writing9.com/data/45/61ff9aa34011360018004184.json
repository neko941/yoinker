        "Many schools are facing serious problems of their students\u2019 behaviours, which come in such various forms as bullying, physically, verbally and socially.  In some schools, students simply do not respect their teachers and school staff, teasing or pulling dangerous pranks on their supervisors.  In others, students, often those in high schools, smoke cigarettes and do illegal drugs in school properties.  These bad behaviours can be traced to several causes, and I think the government, schools and families need to join hands to combat the situation.",
        "One important factor for problems associated with student behavior is parents.  It is true that parents play a crucial role in their kids\u2019 behaviours; children often adopt what they perceive at home and express it to other people.  In many cases, busy parents do not pay enough attention to their kids, so children do not learn to distinguish what they should and should not do.  In some cases, parents simply ignore their duties and are abusive at home, contributing to their children resorting to violence when in conflicts with their friends.  Another key factor for these problems is school. Many schools that face severe problems with student behavior are often negligent.  They take soft-handed approach when dealing with teenagers and are not strict enough to say no to unacceptable behaviours. Realising that their violence, pranks and disrespectful actions are acceptable, these kids will continue to cause troubles in, if not out of, schools, and some might become juvenile delinquents.",
        "To mitigate the situations, the government, schools and families must cooperate.  The government can run campaigns against inappropriate behaviors in schools to raise awareness about the gravity of these troubles. Schools, furthermore, must take a stand against bullying and disrespectful behaviours, setting zero tolerance for such actions and punishing students who violate the school rules. Teachers may employ severe punishments such as spanking or suspension to show that they are serious.  At home, parents must devote enough time to their kids, making sure to set prime examples for their children and understand their children\u2019s needs. For those who have troubled kids, parents should encourage children to express their feelings and take them to therapists if necessary.  They can also employ active sports that allow children to channelize their energy and temper in an appropriate manner.",
        "In conclusion, students\u2019 bad behavior is influenced by two main factors: parents and schools. At the same time, they are the ones who must take initiative to help these young people to behave appropriately."
