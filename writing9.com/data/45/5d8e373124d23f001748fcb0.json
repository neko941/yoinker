        "At the present time, the population of some countries includes a greater number of young adults compared to the number of older people. This situation has both advantages and disadvantages. these two category of people play different roles in a country. It is not easy to outweigh one another.",
        "When we talk about young people, what first comes to our mind is that this category of people are the future of a country. If a country do not have a large number of young aadults, it's future might be at stake. on the other hand when the number of senior citizen becomes larger in number comapred to the number of young adults, it may also affect one country badly.  the people who are young adults today are the people who are going to be the future leaders, doctors engineers and so many other proffessionals in one country. A country that has large number of young adults than older people can keep confidence about the well future of that specific country if the education system is good. Education system are one of the core things that are responsible for the situation of a nation. It is the education system that help todays young adults to have good and sufficient knowledge aout necessary things related to individual or country's wellbeing. Moreover, another advantagesof having young adults large in number is that, these people are more energytic and charismatic in comparison with the older people.",
        "Now i would like to discuss about the disadvantages of having less number of older people and large number of young people. firstly, the knowledge level of people increases with age. for example: there are huge differences between the skills of a 50 years old leader and a 35 years old leader. In the United States the leader is atleast 60 years old and he is better experienced than the president of Saudi Arabia who is 35 years old. Neither this young leader has good experience of how to run a country nor he has any previous experience or skills related to this. Secondly, the young adults learn things from the older people. for example: let us talk about life experience. an older person has more life experience compared to an young person. there are a lot of things that we learn from our parents and they are older than us. Similarly, young leaders can follow the footsteps of older leaders who have proper experience of running a country smoothly.  A country would face severe disaster if suddenly an young leader takes over the power without any skills or experience. another example is the difference between senior doctors and young doctors. It is said that people learn with time and experience. undoubtedly an older doctor would be much more skilled than a young doctor has he has better experience.",
        "I think, the advantages of this situation where the number of older people are becoming less than young people does not outweigh the disadvantages. there should be proper ratio of everything, be that number of people in one country. a country can never go too far if it lacks the skilled and experienced older people beacause it is the people who will prepare the young people for future."
