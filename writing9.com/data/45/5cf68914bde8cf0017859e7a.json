        "Money is cosidered as the sixth sense without which one cannot enjoy other five, so some people like to keep it safe for unpredicatble future, while others willingly spend money for their pleasure and enjoy life. There exists strong arguments for both sides, which implies it is worth examinig both sides of the view before reaching any conclusion.",
        "The main reason why people like to save money is to secure the future of their family from unseen events. Over the last decades, money has become an important part of everyone\u2019s life and it has become near to impossible to do any task without it. For instance: A person with good savings would be able to withstand any kind of expenses incurred in any unfortunate event on his family.",
        "On the other hand, many people belief that this is the only life they have got, and they should live it to the fullest, so they spend money for their pleasure and passion. This gives them happiness and ultimate satisfaction.  As an example: if they have a passion of travelling to different places, they spend money to explore the world.",
        "This essay discussed that some people like to save money to secure future, while others prefer to spend money for happiness and satisfaction. In my opinion, having a balance approach in between two of these is the essence of one\u2019s life.  As one needs to secure the future as well as need money to enjoy life and follow one\u2019s passion. This kind of approach will lead to secure, happy and satisfied life."
