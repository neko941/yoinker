        "Every employee receives  salary based on their skills and work experience which is the common procedure. In many countries, a fewer number of people earn extremely high salaries, some people believe that this good for the country whereas others think that government should fix a salary range above which the employee shouldn\u2019t get paid.",
        "Many people believe that a smaller group of people earning higher salaries can contribute to the country\u2019s development in form of taxes. These smaller group can help in maintaining the economical pyramid balanced. For example: if a company is in the process of hiring a candidate for the job, the company would definitely hire someone who has good level of experience in the field. Certain people demand higher salaries, while not only benefits the employee but as well as the employer in the long run. Hence it is necessary to give a higher amount of salary for deserving.",
        "There is always two sides to a coin, though the former statement clearly explains the need for higher salaries, there are people who wants equality in the salary range which is not practical. Not every fresher and manager are paid equally in any sector. For example: if a candidate is offered the work of managerial duties and was paid very low income, he wouldn\u2019t prefer to take the job, because there is a heavy demand in the work load. This would affect the company and it indirectly it affects nation as well.",
        "In conlusion, every employee regardless of their group, that is either smaller or larger should  be paid according to their ability and performance. In my opinion, it always good to get paid based on the performance."
