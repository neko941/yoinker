        "What could be the reasons behind the increasing number of families who use solar as a source of energy internationally? While there are economic reasons as well as reliability and increasing global temperatures, still, solar energy has its own drawbacks as compared to other sources of energy.",
        "To begin with, many families just love that self reliance and independent from the government supplied electricity, which can be erratic and unreliable at times, especially in less developed countries. By moving away from the national grid, families will be in total control of their energy needs , which allows them to plan with confidence. For instance, one would have planned a family function on a particular weekend only to be informed that there would be load shedding, thereby compelling one to postpone a vital family gathering.",
        "There are various merits of using solar as compared",
        "to other energy sources. Firstly, solar energy is free, hence it has lower running costs over the long run as compared to electricity, which can be costly in many countries. In addition, if one has a solar system, they can supply their excess energy to the main electricity grid ( local municipality or government) thereby earning some extra income.",
        "On the other hand, depending on sun as the source",
        "energy can be risky since it is easily affected by the very low temperatures or in times of rainfall. During low temperatures or rainy days, the system might fail to produce enough electricity to power up the household gadgets, which can result in lots of inconvinience especially of such a period is prolonged for long. Also, it is very costly and prohibitive in terms of initial set up costs for a solar powered system that can power all devices used in an average modern household. In addition, some countries hardly have the required temperatures required by a solar powered system, hence that option is not even possible.",
        "In conclusion, despite its drawbacks, solar is a smart, cheaper alternative especially where the electricity supply is unreliable and it is a renewable source of energy, as such governments should encourage more people to use it. Incentives must put foward by national authorities so as to encourage more households to use solar and leson",
        "the pressure on the national grid and reduce emmissions especially in the light of global warming."
