        "Every other person ought to have discipline in their life. Some People often tend to follow the same routine and are resist change while others believe that change brings out the best in them. Both the above mentioned view will be discussed below along with my opinion and finally, a conclusion is deduced.",
        "Many people like to do same things in their life to maintain discipline as the believe that repeating the same thing will make them perfect in their task and help them lead a healthy lifestyle. This also reduces the confusion or deciding the next task that needs to be done. For instance, if Ruskin Bond had not maintained a discipline in his life and always opted to try something new we might be deprived of his great works like \"The eyes are not here\" and \" The platform number 8\".",
        "On the other hand, a number of fellow people differ in their opinion and they think that trying new things is always good. Trying new things out of one's comfort zone helps a person to develop and grow. It also boosts confidence to try something new and take challenges. Some people think that this helps them to be ready for the changes and manage any situation.",
        "In my view, repeating the same thing and perfecting it is important however taking new tasks and trying to succeed in situations which are beyond one's expectation is necessary as it brings out the best in one self. This also prepares for anything that life has to offer."
