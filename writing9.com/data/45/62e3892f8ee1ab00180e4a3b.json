        "Language has become a very important aspect of people life. I feel learning a foreign language in the early days will help a pupil in many ways. Languages create a feeling of affinity in a person. It is a way of expressing your thoughts to someone.",
        "The more speech you speak the more diversified you are, you can talk to different types of people if you can speak a wide range of languages. English is one of the primary foreign languages that a child should learn. As it is the most spoken & understandable language in our globe. After their mother tongue & english I feel a child can learn many other languages like Spanish, French, Arabic,  Chinese & many more the list goes on.",
        "Discussing to our point about when is the right time for a child to learn a foreign language, I feel it depends upon how good the grasping power of the pupil is. As in ,schools there are many other activities which need to be done by the junior & there is a vast academics syllabus. So learning in primary school is not the ideal decision I feel. But some studies show that before 14 years of age a children ability to learn is much better therefore, they feel if students are introduced to foreign languages in the early stages of their life's it will be much easier for them to grasp it.",
        "But there is a whole group of people including me, who think pupil should be introduced to foreign languages in their secondary schools as the students have a much more thought process between 14-18 years of their life's this is the ideal moment for a parent to introduce them to foreign languages. By those ages they will have already learned their mother tongue & English. So there won't be a pressure of learning 3 languages at a time, they can focus on their selected foreign laguage. At those age a child builds some signs of maturity therefore, it will be easier for them to manage time for their whole day as they will be having other activities & studies also. Another benefit of introducing pupils to a foreign language in the secondary years of their schooling life is they will be introduced to socializing & they can socialize with students of similar interests. Specifically, a junior who has selected the same foreign language, although talking to a friend with the language you are learning helps to understand it easily. Having a conversation with someone of your age is the most interesting & happening practice a pupil can do to be much more precise in that particular speech or topic.",
        "As we summarize this essay, it feels introducing students to a foreign languages is much ideal in the secondary schooling years of a student lives."
