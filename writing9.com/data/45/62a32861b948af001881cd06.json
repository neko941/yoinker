        "It is considered that the experience that a child goes through before pre-school has a great influence on the future life of a child. Based on this experiences it has both psychological and physiological effect on the child. There are a lot of factors that influences the educational ability of a child, through the childhood upbringing and activities carried out during this space of year's. Speaking on teenage life experiences was said to have also a greater influence on the future expectations of the teen. The life style and experience that a teenager finds him self affects the future, it actually makes  or destroys the future. Knowing that the future is birthed by the school year's in this current generation and this educational centry.",
        "To begin with one is called a child from 6 years to 13 years of age . The future of a child goes down to his early or childhood upbringing, family relationships, (for illustration having parents that are separated), family activities. A child that knows how to read and write at the age of 9years to 10 years shows he had an early teaching and practice. Having abilities like critical thinkng increases intellectual level. They are experiences that affect the physiology of a child such as adults molestation, parents separation. lack of family care, negelation of child needs like, food, water, love and protection and encouragement, this are physical activities that can influence the future of a child.",
        "Furthermore from the other stand of the table, teenagers is said to have more experiences that may affect they future life. This experience can boil down to peer pressure, low self esteem, adult molestation, exposure to pornography that affect the dopamine in the brain marking the individual less active in his or her educational activity. A teen is one from the age of 13years to 18 year's of age.",
        "This also affects the individuals ability to understand, coordinate intellectual information, it reduces the IQ level, it was noted that the they is formation of black patches on the dopamine in the brain. This also affects critical thinking etc.",
        "This study was carried out at the university of Barnes in (2013) by a research student from a medical report of Doctor Ben lens. This is said to have played a great deal in the future life of the teens.",
        "In conclusion based on my opinion thur the teens have greater factors that influences their future life during they days of educational training, i will pin point that the experiences of a child before starting school can affect the childs future life the more."
