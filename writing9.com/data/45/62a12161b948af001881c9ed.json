The question is more in more the communities are working internet nowadays for their indiviual things such as shop and purchasing bills? In this, essay I am going to discuss my opinion.",
        "In terms of the positive side, we need the internet in lifetime without internet, we can not working. As well as several of societies can work without the internet even if the internet not work in one hour. The main reason given to support this claim is that my friend can not live witout network if the network has error, he can not comfort. To illustrate, the societies can not comfort at all.",
        ", However, me , and my brother, we can work without internet for half a day, as a result, we make this matter easy for us even though anyone ask me, and my brother how to stay have a day without the internet? the answer easy because make this  matter easy for us.",
        "To sum up, although some the communities can stay witout network, and some societies struggle with this situation. Therefore, I believe that as well as I can see this siutation are more complex and I hope this is not happend in the future if the network are closed it get a bing bang so I prefer this not happend in the future."
