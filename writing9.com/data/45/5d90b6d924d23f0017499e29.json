        "It is commonly seen that inhabitants have more medical issues because they adopting inhealthy living style which is happening due to plethora of reasons. This essay will ponder upon its responsible causes and further it will discuss some remedies to tackle this problem in detail.",
        "One of the significant reason of living an unhygenic lifestyle causes many health problems is tecnology. As, people are addicted to technical gadgets like mobiles or computers which restrict them to do physical work to some extent. Not only this but also these equipments take place in the workplace that make their job easy and convenient. Due to which, individuals tend to live a sedantary living style. For example, it is noticed that in homes, all work likewise cooking, washing, cleaning and so on done by machines; people do less physical activities which leads to health problems. Consequently, it is justified that advancement in technology is prime reason of more medical issues in the developed countries.",
        "Another contributing factor problems due to unhealthy lifestyle is pollution Because, with the development of the nation, many industries are established which create various types of pollution like water, air, noise and many more that effects the one's health and the number of vehicles is inclined than the past that emits carbon dioxide which is harmful for all living creatures. For instance, it is clearly seen that in the progressed cities, many trees are cut down to clear the land for various purposes. Therefore, it is proved that people's health problems are growing due to unhygenic environment.",
        "However, the solution to curb this problem to large extent such as, government should make strict rule to reduce the laval of pollution. To illustrate, factories should be built away from the residential areas as well as aware the people about the preventions of various medical issues. To better exemplify, in delhi the chief minister make an odd and even car scheme that help to control the pollution to some extent. Hence, the legal authoroties and individuals have to do equal efforts to solve this issue.",
        "In conclusion, although people faces more health problems in many countries because the want to live an unhealthy lifestyle has many causes like technology and pollution but it can be mitigated when government and individuals work altogether."
