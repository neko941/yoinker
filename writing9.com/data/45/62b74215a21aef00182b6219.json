        "Universities should take the same number of men and women in each major. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?",
        "Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.",
        "Some people argue that the number of students whether females or male should be equal in the universities admission, since an ancient till now some faculties have only male students.  However, my position is opposite of this idea. This essay I will look the reason behind my opinion.",
        "Firstly, our universities usually they don\u2019t post how much female or male they want per class or per year, but some occasions they may mention the total number of students they want to take instead of long waiting lists. So, if the all applicants who fulfill requirement of the university admission are all female or male they do not discriminate or prevent to sit their classes no matter what they are.",
        "Nevertheless some major have a small number or even no girls at all, I will referee this into cultural and environmental issues. For instance, our university has a class which has one girl, and that girl was first one and last one who study that subject during my whole period of study, I was student that university in 7years, and I never see before or after her. The subject was Electrical Engineering and our society misunderstand and misjudge that, I was listening her one day in the television and she was talking about her struggle for being an electric engineering student, she was a victim of the community, by the way the university gave that student an opportunity which they never gave before all the males who use to study from the opening up to now, to motivate girls. So, I would say schools have no impact the number of student who will apply every one of them is her pupil.",
        "Despite of this argument may be right universities should take a each parallel, and take part vital role for the encouragement of girls like our university done it, and give more priority to girls instead of equality, because of women\u2019s is the profile of the a population, if mother educated her children will benefit, and when young generation become productive the whole country will be successful.",
        "Over all universities have to have same number of applicants in spite of that I disagree with this statement, university has nothing to do with who will register her classes."
