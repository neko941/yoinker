        "There has been an ongoing debate regarding to industrial evolution. Some people believe that development of country is important for resolve poverty. While another group of thinkers support that  development of industries should be increased environment difficulty. This essay will not only discuss both the views, but my opinion will also be highlight while concluding this.",
        "In the inception, there are myriads benifits of incresing industrial development. One of them is industrial growth benefits nearly all citizens of country, even if not equally, and therefore reduce poverty. Fore example, in rural areas, most of the poor are engaged in agriculture. When such a country growth though agriculture exports, it benefits both pover farmers and even pover labourer they employ. Furthermore, rapid growth in manufacturing sector because of increase in demand create a lot of new job. Forthre reduce poverty.",
        "on the flip side with the development of industries should be harmful effect on environment. Increasing the industrialisation more harmful impact to the environment and also earth. For example, it increase global warming in atmosphere. For that increase earth temperature and damage ozane layer. Apart from this, another important factor to consider is industrial west contaminated to water, air and earth. Also, it should be cause more disease to human such as a asthma, obasity and cancer.",
        "To recapitulate, although both modes have their own pros and cons to the human, advocate that development of industry definitely reduce poverty due to the unequal distribution of weather in the initial stage of economic development."
