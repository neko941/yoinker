        "In developed nations like Europe and America, there is an emerging trend of husbands and wives reluctancy to conceive children and continue their lineage. This has brought about many benefits and drawbacks, which will be discussed in this essay, followed by a reasoned conclusion.",
        "There are numerous positives associated with couples relucatance to give birth. To begin with, the world has become difficult to live in, this is in the sense that everything arround us has become more expensive and inaccessible. Therefore, it is diffcult to fund and bring a baby into this world, as they are very demanding. Alternatively, couples can spend this money developing themselves and direct it into other ways such as, spending on their extended families or charities. In addition to this, in a more monetory centered world, young adults can focus on succeeding in and furthering their careers. For example, my cousin Anna, has been married for 12 years, and does not have any children, both her and her husband have thrived in their jobs and she is now the youngest billionaire in the world.",
        "Despite the many benefits, there are also grave consequences. Firstly, those that do not have any children feel like they live empty, unfulfilling lives, especially mothers. This is because women are psychologically constructed to be very maternal and crave kids at a certain age. Consequently, this may lead to depression. For instance, psychiatry studies have proven that, 40% of married women over the age of 30 are clinically depressed, the proportion that do not have any kids are 88%. This exhibits a very strong correlation between the lack of offspring and depression. Secondly, if every one where to stop having kids, the population on earth will begin to regress. Undoubtedly, this is a very negative repercussion, as it may lead to the extinction of the human race.",
        "In conclusion there are many pros and cons to the growing number of couples refusing to give birth."
