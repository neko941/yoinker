        "It has been observed worldwide that yougsters are reluctunt to follow latest news in newspapers or get informed by watching TV.I believe exploring the causes of this problem can assist in finding suitable solutions to resolve it.",
        "To embark, newspapers and TV programms have lost their position as dominant medias.For instance, 50 years ago, newespapers were only way for those who wanted to keep up-to-date.At that time, during rush hour ,it was a familiar picture to see people who were commuting to work holding a newspaper in their hand. Infact,since there was no rival for this written media ,newspapers were hugely popular and were accepted as the main rout for getting information by a vast majority of people including youths.",
        "quite the opposite, in the modern world as a consequent of advancement in technology people find it more convenient to go online for acquire any type of knowledge. Online medias not only are more impressive and can capture readrs' imagination instantly but also , are available throughout the day. Due to the fact that online informations are accessible and user-friendly , young people prefer to turn to them instead of traditional medias.",
        "to address this issue, governments shoud provide less popular medias with financial support in order to help them to compete with more powerful online medias. The raised money for this broadcasting companies could go for make them more attractive for young generation.",
        "In conclude , eventhough old -fashioned medias do not seem desirable to young people , goverments can remedy this situation. In my point of view providing economic support is a step in the right direction."
