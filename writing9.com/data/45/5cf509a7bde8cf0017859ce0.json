        "Educating people involves improving their ability to think, learn and to memorize certain information and data. Though memorization of information by rote learning is important, it isn't the most crucial part of education as learning by this method solely does not help much to solve problems. In this essay, the importance of memorizing information and why it isn't the most important part of education will be discussed.",
        "The rote learning of information is important as it can be recalled instantly. It's use is major for subjects where it mainly contains information that is to be remembered, for example subjects like biology, but even for subjects where problems are needed to be solved, like mathematics and physics, memorising is quite important part of learning as it helps in remembering the basic facts and formulas. For instance, if a person is given a question to which he needs to arrive at an answer, the formulas needed to solve it should be recalled by him or her as, they can not be derived because it would be a waste of time. Moreover, the ability to memorize can also be considered as a measure of the capacity of our minds.",
        "On contrary, the rote learning can help solve problems only to certain extent as remembering the formulas and basic facts alone can not make a person to arrive at the answer, but instead, the ability to think certainly helps the person to think of various ways to solve it.",
        "In conclusion, the rote learning and memorisation of information or data definatly plays an important role in education but it is only one of the characteristics required, which are the ability to think, to learn and memorize,  which play equally important roles to consider someone as competant and an educated person."
