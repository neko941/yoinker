        "The role of both mother and father has immense significance in nurture of children. Some people argue that women are better at parenting; however, in my perspective, I agree with those who opine that men are as efficient as women.",
        "To begin with, in many countries, women tend to spend more time at home with children because they are less engaged in jobs. It allows mothers to be involved with their off-springs in a more detailed manner, and this eventually develops a sensational bonding between mother and children as compared to a father who is busy in a job all day long. To illustrate, when a mother is present throughout the day with her children through thick and thin, and provide her children with every possible help, children become more attached emotionally to their mother; thus, it puts a mother in a better position to tackle and train her children.",
        "Nevertheless, men are equally effective in raising children because of numerous reasons. This is because they have more exposure of practical and professional world as they are more indulged in doing jobs and practically dealing with circumstances outside the home. This make it feasible for men to train their children to adapt and act accordingly in difficult situations. Furthermore, they are more aware of outer world which is a plus point for children who can learn from experiences of their father.",
        "To recapitulate, although women are more indulged in brought up of the children as they spend more time at home; nonetheless, men can equally contribute towards raising children as they have more experience and skills of professional life ."
