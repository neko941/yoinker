        "In the present era, in some cultures children are told that they can achieve any thing through hard work. This message has some pros and some cons. Here below in the following paragraph i will dicuss some reasons of this message advantages and disadvantages.",
        "Let us begin looking some beneficial effects of this message on young generation. Firstly, when children are taught that they can achieve any thing through hard working they start making some goals in life and work hard to achieve these goals without wastage of time. This thing keeps them motivated and positive throughout life. Even when they fail to get higher score in study they did not given up, rather they start from beginning with more passion to achieve the most expected results.",
        "In the latter age when they become adults this positive habit of hardworking help them a lot to become more successful in life.",
        "Turning to the other side of the argument it has some negative aspects. Firstly, from the beginning children make some goals which are not achievable. They try hard to gain these unnatural achievements but when they fail they become disappointed. For example, they dreamed to become millionaired at the age of 15 but that is impossible which makes them discouraged in coming days.",
        "Secondly, some children give up all other activities to get higher band score in school class. As a consequence, they hurt their health and face many health problems for example depression, anxiety, fair etc.",
        "All things considered, this message has some benefits like motivation and positivity in life but it also has some draw backs like depression and burouts."
