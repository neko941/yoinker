        "People have different approaches towards a happy life. According to a few people money is the key to happiness. A good financial status can make someone happy. However, there are other factors too, that are even more important in life as money cannot buy everything in this world.",
        "Admittedly, a wealthy person has easy access to all the facilities in life. Food, clothes and shelter are the basic necessities for the livelihood. An individual with higher income can avail all the benefits and luxaries of life. Furthermore, people can go to vacations, have good social status in the society and can easily go to the market to buy anything they like if they have money to spend, fulfilling all their wishes.now-a-days , money is also considered as power, as it makes easy access to most of the things.",
        "Even though being wealthy, brings happiness, it is not the only factor for leading a good life. The self content is majorly responsible for it. Every rich person or family is not happy. The other things that makes us happy is love, care, support, good health, self- respect and attention of loved ones. Money cannot get these things anywhere in this the world. These feelings only makes us a human being . the affection we get from our family and friends is incomparable to any amount of cash. For example, any woman in the world is the happiest when she holds her baby first time in her hands. The time we spend and bonds we have helps us in making memories which we can cherish forever in our lives.",
        "According to me, happiness is the by-product of self- content. It depends completely on the perspective and priorities of a person. Emotional and mental stability is crucial to enjoy everything in life. Therefore, we should make sure we are taking care of ourselves and our loved ones from every aspect to satisfied and happy in life."
