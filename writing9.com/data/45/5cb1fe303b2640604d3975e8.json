        "Almost all mobile phones now have social media applications. Through the recent years social media has become very popular among all age generations and like every technilogy it has a good and a bad side though in my opinion I believe that it's advantages outweigh it's disadvantages.",
        "Social media has several advantages including first, it facilitates communication for example it's much easier now to communicate with coallage and school friends than before when the only means to do so was through phone calls or mails. Second, sharing information and educational material for any subject is easier for example, on Facebook there are several educational groups where several constructive discusions and useful material can be found.",
        "Moreover, nowadays social media also has commercial uses, a varienty of products are being displayed on pages in social media where, in most pages, you can read user's reviews, ask about the product and even file a complaint if the product doesn't fit the desired specifications.",
        "However, social media have some disadvantages as well, as sharing private information on social media can be risky if accessed and used by undesirable individuales. For example, several criminal cases took place due to using the personal information published by social media users during the past few years. Another downside to social media is the lack of authentication, as several inaccurate information published on social media without references or prove and unfortunatlly this information are used sometimes by users without checking them first.",
        "Another social media disadavntage is time waste, people specialy the young generation spend hours glued to their phone instead of using that time in socializing , reading or working.",
        "In conclusion, social media is very improtant in our lives due to thier numerous advantages and for that the manufacturing companies are trying to over come the disadvantages by placing many ristrections so that people can use social media  safely and freely."
