        "Firstly, art gallery grip is getting weaker which resulted in decrease of visitation. New generation have different mindset as compared to old breed since this new era where adaption of alter ways have taken where artistic work does not holds stage. Even though versitile human's only bear fad of technology, trend and media they are pursuing it blindly. Further more, Because of this science actions which was a invasion on old traditions  that eliminated \"The Art\" which was once a prasing element. Simply I say technology is enjoying widespread fame on the other hand the talent of person art is being ignored.",
        "This matter of neglecting art is a issue which is hard to handle. This can solve by planting roots of  fine art in conscience of our descencants. We have to push them beyond the norm however it seems tough as thriving infatuation for something which is outdated thing in this universe. Representing epitomy saying, in order to accompolish the goal of rising art exibitions again is possible by it ruiner The Media. Media can aware them regarding art. When public will know how illusion speaks in the image if painting they will be dragged automatically to those empty hall's. In the end stablishing paint workshops frequently will make students ambitious in this particular criteria.",
        "In conclusion technology unknowingly excluded artistic workforce which was a aroma of life in this world. In order to make art galleries live agian conveyinf measage through main stream media of how unique and novel those colorly sheets are will be helping hand."
