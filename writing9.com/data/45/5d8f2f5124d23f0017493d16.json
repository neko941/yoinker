        "Many people argue that organisation should focus on hiring people with higher creative ability and are able to perform without supervision, while others advocate that nowadays team players who support decisions are more apt for any business. This essay will agrees to lateral statement as with new technological inventions we have all the creativity we need to run a company however we have fewer people left who are still motivated to work in a team and adheres to the process.",
        "Nowadays, we see majority of people generating new ideas to increase business in the organisation, this overall gives profit to the company however it takes a toil on that one person as he/she has to work extended hours to prove innovation worthiness. This is because these set of people are not open to share their success with anyone and are often individual player. For example, mostly creative designers would work individually, the whole project is totally depended on their availablity, such situations often have negative impacts aswell on the business like too much dependence on independent workers disappointment also, if the person is not able to understand the project or is on sick leave or having any extengency. Thus, working alone is better for an individual, however companies also should have varied set different people to perform a task.",
        "These different people includes team players  and the one who adhere to the rules to get the things done, which is overall beneficial for the organisation business acumen. This group often focuses on larger projects with assigned project manager to motivate them daily, also there are some auditors who review that things are going according to the rule book. Such people does not have any creative block, they are good in their montonous working style. For example, in factories we see many employees working on the converyer belt, most of them enjoy that type of working because it does not involve excessive thinking and is time bound job. It is evident that it is easy job, though we have now scarcity of team players. Now we have more self sorted creative who wants to do everything alone.",
        "In conclusion, Human have become workoholic and have forgotten how to work in groups with different ethnicity and that is reason we see economical crashes. To sustain a business, company needs team player, group people who follow the orders of the one in the senior chair."
