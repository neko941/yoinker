        "Electrical gadgets has made our lives easy these days, thanks to the technology. Television being of them, has become an integral part of the life. While it is said that television is good for us, this essay will discuss both pros and cons of watching a television.",
        "Two major disadvantages of watching television is the lack of time management and physical activity . Firstly, on an average a parson spends almost 4-5 hours of the day in front of the TV. For example, although school going children love watching this idiot box before and after school hours, this habit can affect their study time. As a consequence, since time goes by very easily watching TV, it can affect children's academic performance due to lack of studies. Secondly, not only studies, but also kids skip playing outside for TV. This can hamper their physical development as the sports activities help children grow well. Lack of physical activity can, in turn, result in child obesity, which has  a high rate in children today.",
        "On the other hand, live telecast of news and infotainment channels are few of the advantages of watching television. No matter which part of the world we live in, news has brought world closer, as one can have live, audio-visual experience of a far away place by just sitting at home, watching news channels. This can be exemplified by the fact that we can watch news about weather activities happening around the world such as cyclones, tornedos with weather channels. Furthermore, infotainment  channels provide us with enormous amounts of knowledge about different topics such as art, history, animals, science. For example, National Geographic  channel is capable of taking us to places and showing Information where we cannot go such as International  Space  Station or an active volcano.",
        "In conclusion, although television is good for us, it does come with certain disadvantages such as lack of time and physical activity. However, we cannot ignore some advantages namely live news and infotainment  channels."
