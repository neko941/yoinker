        "Present philosophy of architecture abide to the idea that form should follow function. Therefore, the most significant aspect of structures is functionality rather than aesthetics. To my mind, both design and function of  buildings are relevance nowadays so architects should achieve to maintain balance in engineering of construction.",
        "Firstly, by advancement of technology modern world require fresh views on visual appeal of structure. However, proper functions of erections should be harmonized with design, otherwise buildings can encounter with immense challenges. In the center of London, for example, master building projected and constructed skyscaper, which name is 20 Frenchurch Street. Aesthetics of this structure is amazing, however large windows on the west site of building have repulsed rays of the sun on the street that always overcrowded with automobiles. Architect missed the vital fact of functionality, as a result it had caused to road problems, especially traffic jams.",
        "Secondary, tourism landscapes in whatever country will thrive if buildings attract by function and aesthetics simultaneously. Take Thailand as an example, design of construction in traditional style, that represents culture of country has promoted the development of tourism sector via enhancing visitors. In addition, enlarging the functionality of structures, like modern villas, contemporary hotels, and other fascinating buildings for recreation, allows to tourists not only delight of aesthetics, but also obtain relish from multifunctionality of construction.",
        "Thereby, I strongly believe that in contemporary world architecture has to combine the visual purity and dependable functions in order to essential problems of erections that influence on environment, will be thwarted and as a result, tourism sectors will prosper."
