        "Alot of times people need  to complain about a product or poor service which is quite common nowadays. It is, therefore, important for one to identify the best medium for your complaints to have the desire effect. Rising  complaints both in person or in writing have their pros and cons, but i would prefer to lodge my complaints in writing.",
        "From the one side, complaining in writing brings many benefits. First of all, one does not have to spend his precious time on driving, waiting for his turn and  talking with a representative. He can just send mail or an email and get all explanations he needs. Second of all, I think it is the best way to avoid unpleasant conversation. Personally, I do not like to complain about anything especially, in person. Sometimes it is imposible to have a face-to-face conversation because a company which provides a product or service is too far away.",
        "From the other side, complaining in person has some benefits too. First, this type of complaining provides an immediate feedback. So, if i have any objections about company products I will recieve all information and explanation right away. However, sending a letter to the company and gettinga  feedback can take more than a month. Second, direct conversation is often more effective. People talk each other, see each other facial gesture and body movements, which can tell alot about a person. In adition to these practical benefits, in the case if one can not recieve creditable explanation from one representative he always required to talk to another person. For instance, my cousin recently had some extra withdraws from his account by his bank and he was not aware of it. So, he went to the bank and explained to the bank representative the situvation and they togeather found the solution and those money was given back to my cousin's account. I think face-to-face conversation is the best way to complain and get feed back fast.",
        "In conclusion, I think if i had to compling about a product or poor service I will do direct conversation is imposible I think I have nothing left but to send a letter or write an email there."
