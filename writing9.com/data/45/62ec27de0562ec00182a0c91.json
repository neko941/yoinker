        "Satisfaction or happiness is one of the most important aspects in human life that have always been discussed especially during recent years. In my opinion happiness is a personal possession that a person has to develop and flurish it in his personal life.",
        "Some people believe that happiness depends to outsources like money or social position. These people usually blieve that somthing like money or luxury life brings them happines. For example if you grow up in a rich family, you will have more access to uportunities that make your life easier and brings you happiness in your life. They also believe if you grown up in poor family you will lose a lot of opportuinities.",
        "On the other hand, some people believe that the happiness will show up when you follow your desires and what you feel pasionate about. All of us know that we need money to afford our expenses and have an acceptable life. But for the people don't see the money as a goal and followed their prefferences by doing their favorite career, although maybe they don't afford to drive a luxury car, some times they are more happy in their moderate vehicle compare a person who got the money as an aim and drive an expensive car. They believe the happiness is the life.",
        "In conculusion we could say although the outsources like money or facilities would help us to be successed, those sources would not garuntee our happiness. Enjoyment needs to be developed inside of our personality and depends to our vision to the life and philosophy."
