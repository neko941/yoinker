        "People often believe that there are someone need gifted talents at some fields, e.g. sport and music, to be able to succeed, or at least make a difference. Some others think that even in these cases practice makes perfect, and if you are taught in the right way and exercise something with enough determination, you can be good sooner or later. I believe that both views have their own points and logic.",
        "It\u2019s no coincidence that sport and music are attached to the word talent. Because the two fields are closely related to entertainment, your performance is within reach and demanded from many people. And because a lot of people care about your work and hence you\u2019ll have the chance to earn big bulks, audience of those two industry often only impress and remember the exceptional. As everyone can practice, what makes someone truly stand out from others often originates from their inborn talents, something that\u2019s given to them when each of them was still a child. From this perspective, there are two types of people: the ones with talents in sport and music, and the ones who\u2019re not.",
        "However, being good at something doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that you have to be really exceptional. There is a well-known quote \u201cYou just need 10,000 of work in any field just to be master in that field\u201d. Many people are in favor of this quote. Many people, solely with their passion, manage to be really good at the sport they play, or the music instrument they use. Many people even get to the stage when they\u2019re above all, and they\u2019re remembered not because of any natural abilities they possess, but mostly due to how hard they tried to get there. Take Cristiano Ronaldo and Rafael Nadal as examples. They might grow up with some kinds of characteristics that distinguish them from other normal children, but they have never been their talents that help them stand on the same level with Lionel Messi and Roger Federer. Nadal and Ronaldo have been working really hard, and they have been doing that consistently, continuously, never stop even at times they overcome their \u201cgifted\u201d rivals.",
        "In my opinion, I believe there should be a balance between both external and internal factors in this matter. Generally people like to do something that they\u2019re good at. That means whenever a child draws a painting and it\u2019s actually beautiful and she receives a lot of compliments, she might feel really good about it and wants to creat more and more paintings. In this situation, from the starting point of natural talents, the girl might become a really excellent painter if she continues to practice long enough. The other way around is also very possible. Without real talents? No problem, if you have the passion for the thing itself. Any type of passion that results in discipline and patience will do. For example, your desire to become the best at one field might be too huge that you devote all of your time and effort on it. Combined with, well, I would say a little bit of differentiator you inherently possess, that would be a good deal of information for me to predict that you\u2019ll succeed at it."
