This has led to  some grievous situations which can be alarming to children. This essay will buttress some of these problems and profess a suitable solutions after which a meaningful conclusion will be drawn.",
        "One of the issue to this is uncontrolled use and early exposure to devices such as phones, computers, laptops.  This will lead to low concentration in academic activities thereby resulting in low grades. For example, youngsters who were involved in a study which was carried out in a model school here in Nigeria, were shared into two groups, those using internet devices and the ones who do not have , children without phones perform better academically because their attention was not divided during studies. Secondly, cyber crime is an ugly condition perpetrated by children with free opportunity to the internet. They use this medium to advertise unverified jobs and when they are able to get a victim, they will ask for money before the work will be offered to them, as soon as the target pays, the amount agreed upon, that contact will be blocked permanently while they continue with their business.",
