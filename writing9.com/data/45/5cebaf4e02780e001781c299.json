        "It is undoubtedly true that we are becoming increasingly dependent on computers. It is one of the most inevitable solutions in modern days.  Its invaluable advantage is so evident and distinguished that deceiving it can be intimidating. There is a multitude of areas that computers are important in the day to day life that includes business sectors, hospitals, crime detection, research and developments, film industries and in airports.",
        "Use of computer has resulted in the betterment of people, thereby the individual's job has reduced by 40% over the past three decades with the substitution of computers. World are advancing day by day and computers are being updated with the latest technologies with respect to hardware and software.",
        "Computer programming is so sophisticated that it can be used to define anything the world is lacking in. The introduction of Artificial Intelligence is one of the foreseeable threat that humans are facing with the development of technology. Perhaps, it may override the contribution that humans are making to society at large. Researchers say that in the forthcoming years almost 80% of the jobs that people are doing gets computerized. Some of such major changes have already been incorporated in countries like China and America.",
        "To recapitulate, I would say, despite having a multitude of advantages in technological improvements, there are also possible threats that are existing. The question is how human will align with these developments. In fact, people have adjusted in the past, and hence adjusting in the future will not be much of a problem as there will be so many other ideas that human will bring on like always to survive in this world."
