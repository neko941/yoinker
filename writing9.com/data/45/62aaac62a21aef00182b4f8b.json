Many people debating on responsibility of doctors like they should teach their patients about how to improve their health. I am not complete agree with this statement.",
        "Firstly, no offence that some people are have different condition by birth or nature defect in their body. However, most common reason for human is getting sick are their habits and lifestyle. People are eating lots of junk food even they know it is not good for their health. Further more every one know exercise are off for heath but still most of the propel are ignoring it. For example, my friend eat to much chips. now he is overweight and it's related complication in his body. he know the reality and still eats chips and not doing any exercise",
        "Secondly, not only doctors but government also making efforts to bring awareness for health in people. For instant, many hospitals are holding the awareness for woman and children. Government also do camping in countries for heath and hygiene. However, very few doctors are just give the medicine when patient come and not explain why they get sick or how to prevent in feature. If they give bit information about patient's condition and explain how it happen, it will bring awareness in them.",
        "To be conclude, habits and lifestyle are plays vital role for our health. Government and doctors are helping us, how to become and live healthy life but it is individual's responsibility to follow the advice."
