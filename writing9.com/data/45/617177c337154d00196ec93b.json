        "These days, there is a significant difference between men and",

        "reasons in the following essay.",
        "To begin with, there are many reasons for the dominance of men",
        "sports programs on television(1). Due to a large proportion of sports viewers being male, television channels tend to broadcast mens sports programs to maximize their ratings and profits. Take football as an example. Inside a coffee shop, it is common to see a group of young men discussing a recent men\u2019s football match, while women show a greater preference for(2) discussing other topics like shopping or celebrity gossip. Additionally, because men are usually physically more stronger and faster than women, they tend to play at a much higher level(3) , which makes men\u2019s sports much more exciting to watch.",
        "However, I am of the opinion that it is necessary for television",
        "channels to provide equal sports coverage of both genders(4) . Firstly, it helps to create gender equality in society(5) and increases the participation rate of women in sport. Every time women go out onto the field, they give it their all knowing that their best will likely go unnoticed, and therefore just like men, female athletes should receive full recognition(6) for their effort. Secondly, better media coverage also enables women to make money from endorsements(7) which improves their income. That is to say, more television exposure for the female players will lead to major deals with endorsers and higher salaries in the future through advertising contracts.",
        "In conclusion, why women\u2019s sports shows do not receive enough",
        "coverage in this day and age results from the aforementioned reasons, and I truly believe that it is necessary to ensure equal coverage of women\u2019s sports."
