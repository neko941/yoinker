        "The enormous growth in the use of TV has radically change people\u2019s lives. Although, to some extent, I agree with the opinion that watching TV too much might be a waste of time, I wholeheartedly believe that TV makes our lives more enjoyable.",
        "Undoubtedly, there are a number of negative impacts from watching too much TV. Perhaps the first and foremost demerit is waste time.  A good example of this is that people watch series very night instead of hangout with friends or going to gym. The time they squandered in front of TV could be used to enjoy vivid life. Another harmful factor is lack of sleep. Nowadays, it is common that people watch TV till mid-night and they will feel tied next day, resulting that they cannot concentrate on work. This is a potential risk of their future career and in turn, it will badly affect their future lives.",
        "Others, however, myself included, advocate that TV is beneficial for individuals to live better.  One of the first advantages is that TV is the ease with which people can easily and fast receive latest affairs. Taking \u2018A Current Affair\u2019 as a notable example. This TV programme always updates people with latest breaking news including new policy changes, economy shifts and so on, and then people can quickly adjust their lives. In addition, some travel documentaries, for instance, provide people deep insights into many distinguishing landmarks, so that people can enjoy those without traveling overseas.",
        "To recapitulate, I claim that the merits of watching TV outweigh its demerits as long as people do not spare too much time on it, and numerous TV broadcasts can make our lives spectacular."
