        "fossil fuels such ad coal fuel and natural gas are used in several countries but in some countries the use of alternating sources of energy involve wind and solar pover has been stimulate",
        "in my view its a positive development for every country should use renewable energy soruces\u00a0 . because widely known all of fossil fuels have been running out so people had better discover a new source and use it the biggest positive development is switch to renewable sources such as wind solar power, and water Furthermore, there are lots of positive feedback such as preserving climate change and energy crisis. people have been adopting moderna age and reach economic sucesss \u0131 cant see any negative effect perhabs it would be hard to switch energy source at first",
        "the best ability is generate your own energy without using fossil fuels. Currently, certain countries have been conducting their own energy. we have to create our own clear energy",
        "admittedly ther are excelelnt alternatives for instance wind biomass hydropower solar energy",
        "People create their own facilities for collecting alternative energy sources indiscriminately. we have to avoid using all of the fossil fuels. we generate clean energy and countries take advantage of collecting renewable energy.",
        "As a result, there are several positive effects of switching energy sources and switch to renewable energy sources. Countries conserve energy and animals wouldnt be affected badly because renewable energy sources dont cause air pollution or climate change That would be an enormous improvement for all countries."
