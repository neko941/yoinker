        "Tourism allows people of different nationalities to be able to understand each other. In this essay,  I disagree that tourism is a gateway to understanding each other.",
        "On the one hand, travelling to another country with a different, unique culture than yours enables people from different backgrounds to experience different ways of living; thus, this allows room for one to have an open-mind, tolerance and understanding. Moreover, one of the many ways a diverse group of people to understand each other is through language. Language can pose as a gateway for learning the culture and the history of another country; in addition, it also allows different people from all walks of life to interact with one another, which creates a strong bond between people made from love and mutual respect.",
        "On the other hand, people do not necessary travel to another country in order to understand and appreciate another culture and lifestyle. Some people go abroad for time off from work or on a family vacation; thus, rarely for a learning experience. That being said, this does not serve as a means of gaining understanding for one another. Conversely, people do not always study the language of a different country, rather they see English as an international language, which would not enable them to speak to locals. As a result, tourism does not always serve people as a way to understand each other.",
        "In conclusion, I feel that although ideally tourism would serve as medium for tolerance, but without seeing the importance to make sure people who are going abroad have an open-mind to understand and accept each other despite our differences, tourism would not be this force of good as it was intended."
