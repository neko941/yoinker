        "A common opinion is that school subject such as is history is significant, whereas others assume that science and technology is of the utmost importance when compared to history this essay will discuss both views and give my own opinion",
        "",
        "On the one hand,  History is an important subject that should be taught at school because it helps the student to gain an in-depth knowledge of things of the past that they were not aware of. It helps them to understand some present trends,  and appreciate them the more when compared to the past.  For instance, when African student reads about the slave trade and what their predecessor went through, then it will enable them to know the value of independence and freedom. And this knowledge could only be gotten from subject like history.",
        "On the other hand, Science and technology in itself broaden the students knowledge on new findings,  encourages new discoveries,  allows the student to get involve in research  which enables them to provide answers to questions  thereby increasing there knowledge, which will enable them to enhance standard of living and provide better opportunities .for example, when student are vast in the field of science and technology, they can discover new drugs through scientific research, which can be used to improve health and maintain standard of living.",
        "In my opinion, both subjects are beneficial in enhancing the student's intellect just as science and technology can help to improve life and standards of living, so can history help the student to appreciate the past events and their importance to the future. both subjects are of utmost importance and as such should be taught at school.",
        "Conclusively, although the subject of science and technology is assumed to be of utmost importance to some people when compared to history,  l believe both subjects are beneficial and as such should be taught at school because they impact various useful knowledge to this pupil."
