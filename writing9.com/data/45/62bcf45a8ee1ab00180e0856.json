        "Today\u2019s world is filled with entertainment media and gaming websites, which allures toddlers to stay alone indoors and engage in gaming activities. Some individuals might propose that urging the youngsters to participate in activities performed in groups, while few others might counterargue that these youngsters must be given freedom to engage themselves on their own. My opinion is gravitated towards the viewpoint of the latter group. I shall elaborate on both the points and substantiate my grounds in the following paragraphs.",
        "Let us commence by looking into some of the benefits of the proposal to advice youth to be a part of group activities, which is improving interpersonal skills and collaborating with individuals of different backgrounds. These merits are, however, not suitable for all of the personalities. For example, individuals who are of introvert type do not perform well when they are with big crowd.",
        "The counter proposal of allowing the youth to cultivate the ability to engage on their own appears to be more appealing, as this is solution is not depending on the presence of others. In my opinion, individuals must not need other individuals to feel engaged and everybody should educate themselves to keep them engaged and happy for the greater good of their life.",
        "In conclusion, urging the the teenagers to get involved in activities performed in groups might not be suitable for all personalities. Although there is a possibility of these individuals tending towards wasting of their valuable time by engaging in gaming and entertainment activities if left alone, it is advisable to give them freedom and help them to cultivate the skills to engage themselves in fruitful way."
