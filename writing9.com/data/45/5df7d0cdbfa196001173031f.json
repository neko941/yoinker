        "Few administration lay out a huge amount of peoples tax  on coaching a single person to achieve in the world physical competitive game whereas a fair portion of citizens think that these amount must be paid out on the plan which are well being for the common people. I believe on expending the large amount of citizens toll on the projects that are useful for the public instead on coaching a single national sportsman .I will discuss this view point in the further paragraph.",
        "On the first hand, in  allocating the money on instructing a single sportsman can accomplish in the world level competitions and bring pride to the nation. This encouragement can be a motivation for the future generes to come forward in the competitive games and succeed in their life.",
        "On the other hand, laying out the capital on the scheme which are more advantage to the common people will lead to the development of the country. Investing on the infrastructure and contempory technology will improve the trades in the world, further, it provides job to the unemployment as well as decrease the poverty .For example, authorities issuing the fund on the construction of the several  hospitals and schools will be  generally convenient for the citizens as well as the unemployment is reduced.",
        "To sum up, I agree that the peoples tax must be invested on the beneficiary of public which  moves the country in developing path rather than expending on the sportsman to make the nation proud."
