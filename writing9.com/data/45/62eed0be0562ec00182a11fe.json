        "The pie chart depicts people's most favoured takeaways in Canada while the bar chart illustrates the number of Indian restaurants in the same country between 1960 and 2015.",
        "Overall, the largest proportion of Canadians prefers a Chinese takeaway, followed by Indian which is also significantly popular. Followed by Canada's least favourite options; Greek, Mexican, Japanese, Thai and others. There is a generally positive trend in the number of Indian restaurants over the period.",
        "More specifically, with over a third of Canadians opting for Chinese food, this is definitely the favoured option. Closely followed by Indian takeaways, which over one-quarter of the population preferred. On the other hand, Canada's least rated options included Greek, Japanese and Mexican, all earning only 1% of the country's vote.",
        "Moreover, with regards to the growth of Indian restaurants in Canada, there is an increasing trend. starting with more rapid growth in the 1990s, from 200 in 1960 to approximately 5000 by 1990. Here is shown the largest spike in an expansion of establishments, where the value jumps to just under 8000 by 1997. After this, only around 1200 more restaurants are built by 2015."
