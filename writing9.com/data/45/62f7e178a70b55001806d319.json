        "Nowadays, the society of some nations has been formed from younger people which outnumber than older ones. Although the Young population has many benefits, the drawbacks involved are  important to be scrutinized.",
        "On the plus side, it may appear that being young proves beneficial in the country.The first axiomatic reason is concerned with employability. Simply put, despite older people are experienced,but youthful adults have new and creative thoughts,also their physical power are higher.This in turn paves the way for the job opportunities in particular for young forces. An obvious example of this situation is China's country which has the most population over the worldwide and more than half percent of this public has been made up of junior individuals.And then because of the state's need they have lots of job vocancies.Furthermore, in terms of being active and a contended country is significant as well. In other words,youthful people has lots of energy compared with other ones.So, in this case the nation would be lively and joyful.",
        "Having said that, however, the downsides of the young population should not be underestimated.To begin with, the lack of experience which is the old people have.As a direct result, most of the careers might have downturn in their situation.Take a university which is constructed with adolecents as an example;because this public has not adequate background for teaching so, numerous students might tend to abandon the college or have not satisfied aim for continuing.Another disadvantage side is to accommodate the needs of the society.To put it another way, when the public is growing so,the government's efforts to cater the demands would have longer extended.",
        "On balance, the tendency of having younger country would be both rewarding and problematic.While the employability increases and having joyful country, the states are highly likely to unexperienced public and financial problems."
