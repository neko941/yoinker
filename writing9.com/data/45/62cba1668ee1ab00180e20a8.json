        "Firstly, it might be reasonable to assume that low-quality guidance exerted by parents is responsible for this behaviour.Limiting and cutting off unnecessary smartphone usage of the child could be done by parents from  a young age,but instead,some guardians let toddlers use mobile phones as an incentive.For example, when kids are left alone without a playmate,one way of keeping their state of mind in stability is to use thevariety of entertainment functions that a smartphone has to offer.Most parents take shortcuts and use this method due to the fact that they  would",
        "not have to rely on their physical involvement as the pacifier.Consequently,a child becomes accustomed to the smartphone and would demand  it more in the future.Hence, a gradual rise in screen time occurs.",
        "Moreover,several severe health issues stemming from the excessive usage of",
        "smartphones could possibly outweigh their potential benefits.Childs may experience",
