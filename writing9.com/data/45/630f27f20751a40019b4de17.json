        "Across the world, people are fan of sportsmen. They appreciate the sportsmen when they perform on a field but also some people are like paparazzi, they are also interested about the private life of these sports people. We will elaborate further on whether a professional sportsman's  behaviour on the field or out of it has an impact on society.",
        "My son is a fan of Christiano Ronaldo who is a famous footballer in the Manchester United team. He even has posters of him in his room and he often talks about him as an hero and often shows me his pictures on Instagram, either when he is on the field or with his family. Impressively, Christianio sets an example to young people when they learn about his life journey. He was a poor boy who with determination and perseverance has become rich. If Christiano misbehaves in society, fans specially little kids will be affected.",
        "On the contrary, some people are not interested about the private life of sportsmen, they are rather interested about the performance of the athlete on the field only. I agree somehow that the private life's of the athletes do not concern the public. However if athletes shows agressivity out of the field, it will definitely be the talk of the town.",
        "As a conclusion, I believe that the behaviour of an athlete outside his career path should not concern the public. I strongly believe that every individual should have his own privacy.In my opinion, the only thing which I will strongly disagree is if a sportman misbehaves with people because of his abusing power that he thinks he inherits as being famous."
