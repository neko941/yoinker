        "Certain individuals have opined that it is often better  to have one year off after secondary school  before  university either for travel or work. In my opinion,the benefits associated with this cannot be compared to any advantages it might bring.",
        "Admittedly, there are some drawbacks of having a year gap before tertiary education. One of these harmful effects is the possibility of more delay than the expected as most people may not achieve their aims within the stipulated time, thus, leaving the brain dormant,and such would lead to poor academic performance when they later start higher institution. Furthermore, some persons might use that period to get themselves involved in crimes and end up as far as going to jail. Lastly, for some females, whom if not careful,would become pregnant out of wedlock, thus destroying their plans of becoming a graduate. Over all, these affect only negligible number of individuals.",
        "Nevertheless, despite the demerits, most students use this time off to acquire some skills which would go a long way in helping them throughout their life time.  For example, I could remember that when I left college, I took about one year off to go to computer training after which I started higher education,and this helped me a lot. Also, for many that are from very poor background but aspire to become educated, it would give them opportunity to work and save some money in order to  support themselves in campus. For instance, one of my friends, Chike, narrated to me how he was able to support himself throughout university with savings he made while working with one of the telecommunication companies after secondary education.",
        "In conclusion, although  there are some undoubtable disadvantages of taking a year off after college,the benefits are numerous and far more important than the harmful effects."
