        "Advertising can be defined as the ways of communicating the users of a particular product or a servicve. It is paid by the party who wants to sell or influence the crowd to buy the said item.",
        "Ads are becoming popular tool of marketing day by day. Television channels, news papers, raiod FMs, social media and many more things have become the platform for advertisments. Eventhough some says that this may influence people's mindset, it depends on the person's need and the ability to affor for them. For an exaplme if you see a company promoting a chair that can be fold and used as a bed, still if you do not have a need of it, you will not buy it. Likewise, everything we see may not help our lives to become more easier.",
        "In contrast, this process supports us to get to know about different types of products and services. There are plenty of things that we did not know about, till we see them through an advertisment. This may changes our lives and make it improve by giving new solutions for our day to day problems. The things we saw as an issues may not be a burden anymore, after a solution identified by a company.",
        "Also, these new inventions have a big chance of saving our time. Everyone today is running an ongoing race, and all are busy with hundred of things. Becasue of that, both men and women tries to find out something which makes our lives easier and at saves time. Advertising will inform us about new eqipments which will make our lives more comfortable with saving time.",
        "Therefore, in conclusion I must say that even though ads influence people up to a certain extent, it helps us to become more successful with our day today activities."
