        "The question of what makes a person happy is always debatable. Some argue that money buys happiness and other argue it does not. I also believe that money does not provide happiness.",
        "Firstly, I believe that money is a materialistic gain and it does not five happiness to people. Materialistic can make people have a feeling of achievement for short span of time but its longevity is always a question. There have been many example where people have realized the gain of physical property as vein and started charity instead. For instance: Bill Gates one of the richest persons for several years took the path of social service one he realized that his capital only would not be sufficient for his happiness.",
        "Moreover, wealth is a root cause of many health problems in world. When a person is wealthy, there is a high chance that one lives a lavish life which result to health hazards. For example: a report by World Health Association shows that the chance of high cholesterol, sugar and blood pressure is directly proportional to people living a lavish life which the rich people are prone to.",
        "To conclude, even though wealth provides ephemeral happiness to people, the happiness it provides is not eternal. Furthermore, wealth has the bleak side in our personal life and health too. If one wants to be happy for a longer span of tome, learn to be live away from health and adopt spiritual life."
