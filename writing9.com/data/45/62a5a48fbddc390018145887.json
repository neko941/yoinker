        "In the salad days of the millennium, the society is polarized into two groups almost equally regarding the notion that some folks like to watch films in the comfort of their houses instead of in the theatre. Different people have  distinct mindsets. The following paragraphs would shed light on both the approaches before making a final note.",
        "To commence with the first notion, there are myriad things to be shared in its favor. First and foremost, while viewing movies on a massive screen in the cinemas, human beings feel like that as they are an actual part of the story. Secondly, there is a myriad of big speaker in the theatre which provides better sound quality to audiences. As a result, they enjoy more without any distraction during the film. Moreover, people are living in hustle and bustle lives these days. Thus, while watching the film at the cinema, they can spend some time with their near and dear ones, which will make them joyful.",
        "Shifting towards the second school of thought human beings save their time and money whilst viewing the film at their houses. Hence, they can spend saving money on their basic needs such as education. In addition, watching movies at home instead of going to the theatre feel more comfortable by masses since they can wear whatever they want. Furthermore, it is more convenient for them who are busy with their domestic chores, they can pause the film and watch it later.",
        "Having discussed the arguments and counter arguments, I would like to infer that people should watch movies at their houses rather than at the cinema. To justify my state of mind, there is an instance of my brother like to watch movies in the theatre and wasting huge amounts on tickets, but now he never goes to the cinema for watching movies and he saved a huge amount and purchased a computer.",
        "Hammering the last nail, I personally feel that people should watch picture sometimes in the movie house with their friends and relatives as it works as a stress buster.   However, watching picture at  home people do not only save their precious time but also make a strong bond with their family."
