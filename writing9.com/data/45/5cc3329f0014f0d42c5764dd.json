        "Many nations seeing displacement of people from the countryside to the cities. Increasing unemployement, decreasing farming and fast pace of city life are the main reasons behind such a development. In this essay, we will see how decreased job opportunity have caused people to relocate to the cities and how this will affect the economy of the country.",
        "The root cause behind such a momentum is the increased unemployment in the rural areas of the countries, caused mainly due the downfall of the agriculture. In most of the countries main occupation in the countryside is farming but, due to changing climate and weather conditions, it is badly affected and farmers are not even able to get the yield for the investement they made for corps. For example, Srilanka is seeing drought since last three consecutive years which has badly affected the farming in the villages due to lack of water for irrigation, and almost 10% of farmers has to moved to Colombo city to find out jobs.",
        "If people from the villages keep moving to the cities and farming becomes obsolete, the only option government is left with, is to import the grains from other nations, which in turn wiil incur huge cost, because, there are multiple taxes needs to be paid and currency conversion and transportation charges also needs to be paid for importing of grains or any other good from different countries. For example, China have inccured a loss of $8,000 Million due to increased import from India by 11%.",
        "To conclude, employement is the major cause behind the movement of people from the villages to the cities, however, this needs an attention from the government as such a development will endanger the economy of the country."
