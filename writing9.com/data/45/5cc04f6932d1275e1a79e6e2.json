        "Movie theatres are growing like mushrooms in every nook and corner of the world. It is considered by many that movies can be easily viewed on portable devices like tablets, or mobile thereby eliminating the need to travel to the nearest multiplex whereas others believe to be entertained by movies cinema is the best place. I shall discuss both the sides of the argument and state my own perspective.",
        "On the one hand, it is argued that watching films on handy devices saves cost. People no longer have to purchase tickets and travel to watch their desired movies on play. This can turn to be an expensive affair when there are large groups or families together for a show. Moreover, it is extremely convenient to view as it does not require following show times and managing work in the fast paced life. Furthermore, one has the flexibility to watch any season in breaks or at one go while travelling or at leisure time. For instance, mothers with babies prefer watching movies as per their comfortability and schedule.",
        "However, others argue, that movies are showcased in cinema houses to enjoy it completely since it\u2019s an experience to feel. This is to say one can be amused by the audio visual effects, intense drama and cinematography which can only be observed on a big screen.  To illustrate, films likes Avatar, Bhaubhali and  James bond movies have spectacular special effects which are a treat to eyes and people look forward to watch such movies in theatres. Additionally, it not only provides a break from hectic lifestyle but also gives people an opportunity to relax and watch some classic movies of their favourite actors on screen.",
        "To recapitulate, there are convincing  arguments on both the sides of the debate , viewing movies in theatre entertains  and relaxes , however, I think, watching it on mobile phones saves  money , adn it can  viewed as per our own ease as well as flexibility."
