        "Many people believe that women make better parents than men and that is why they have the greater role in raising children in most societies. Others claim that men are just as good as women at parenting.",
        "parents are the first human-being children have seen since they opened their eyes to life, they teach them how to walk, speak and other important things. Whether, women or men are more influential in the children raising process differ people opinions in favour and against.this essay will discuss the importance of cooperation between parents in order to build a well-rounded child character.",
        "To begin, women have a significant impact on their children for many reasons, but the main reason is that mothers are an affectionate and fragile creatures. moreover they will teach their children how to be kind and how to communicate correctly with people away from aggressiveness.",
        "To reflect from my personal experience, I can remember that day when my mum advised me that I should act more kindly in a particular situation. As a consequence this kind of wise orientation shaped my character and developed my thoughts.",
        "In contrast, figures in the society would never deny men role in this raising process. However, the father is the bread-maker and he has done many sacrifice to provide his family with this  convenient easy life. For instance his struggle and efforts are invaluable, because he works hard everyday just to pay his children school fees. in addition nobody  will do such a thing for them.",
        "in conclusion, women has a great role in raising children, its not more important than men contribution its equally the same.",
        "in my opinion, both parents are respected for accomplishing their parental duties and also for their sacrifices, efforts and the time they invest in education and raising children."
