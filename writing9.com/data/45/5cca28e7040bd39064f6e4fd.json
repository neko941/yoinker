        "Purchasing items  online for example, books, air tickets and   groceries are now widely used. In my opinion, while there are little benefits seen in  sourcing for goods from the web, the demerits extremely outweighs the merits as this method is prone to internet fraudsters and  the quality of the products being bought may not be original.",
        "Admittedly, there are minor benefits seen in online buying of items. Firstly, it is a convenient method. This means that one can order  for goods from the comfort of his or her home and the item would be delivered. Secondly, it reduces the risk of  losing money to pickpockets .This infers that when one requests for a good from the cyber space, he would not have any need of going to the market to get them.  As a result , it decreases the rate of losing money to these petty thieves. For example, the Principal of May Gold Academy Mr Martin Ono stated that ever since he was robbed of his phone unknowingly in the market, he now places orders for anything he wants on the web .",
        "However, despite the above merits,the negative  aspects of  internet purchasing  far outweighs the gains. One major drawback is that this is saddled with internet fraudsters..This implies that these set of people  could pose as normal traders just to swindle unsuspecting clients of their hard earned money .Another  crucial issue is that the goods being bought are most times not original. As a result,  customers end up with  inferior quality materials .For example, a survey conducted by the Bureau on  Online Marketing in Taraba State amongst   people who bought the latest Asoke material revealed that most of them got low quality materials from what they ordered on the web.",
        "In conclusion,  although online shopping may be advantageous ,the downsides of fraud and substandard goods greatly surpass any benefit associated with this mode of purchasing items.",
