        "Nowadays for many contemporary artists selling their artwork is the only way of generating revenue. Although lots of reputed artists attain a great deal of money in exchange of what they create, others hardly earn a sufficient amount to survive. It has triggered strong debates whether they should be funded by authorities. In my perspective government should provide financial support for some projects.",
        "In current situation mainstream artwork attracts significant attention thus this style is the one that generate highest amount of income for artists. These facts discourage artists from diverging conventional trends. Whereas financial support from government can boost practice of less popular styles and help development of new styles without the risk of financial stability. In film industry art movies which are produced specially for film festival are already sponsored by private organizations. That help filmmakers to emphsize on artistic elements of their work rather than focusing on commercial details. As a result an enourmous improvement can be seen in art movies compared to last decade.",
        "In popular culture art major is considered to be one of the riskiest career path for teenagers especially in countries where medicine, engineering and military industries are well developed. Main culprit here is obviously financial unstability. Gaining a reputation in art world can take years even for brightest talents which sometimes make new artist to work in several jobs to survive or even make them to choose another career path.",
        "In conculsion governmant can help new artist or artist who wants to try out differnet styles until they develop to their full potential and make a name for themselves in the sector."
