        "A few generation ago, we have lived in a place where all the natural resources are available. Now days due to the growth of the technology and the human culture most of the resources like water, air, etc.. are contaminated or polluted. In this essay i will look into the core level of the problem and solution to the problem.",
        "One of the main cause of the problem is that cutting of the trees. what i mean by this is, in some part of the world most of the trees were cutted, due to this rainfall may affect and there will be no source of the water.",
        "Due to no rainfall or short rainfall people in those cities were affected by deficit of fresh water supply. For example, in southern part of india, most of the cities were in trouble of getting fresh water due to short rainfall. It is very simple to over come this issue by planting numbre of tress in and aroung the city that make good amount of rainfall which acts as good and natural source of fresh water.",
        "Another problem is that due to the growth of the factories and the industries natural water source got polluted and the cities depend on the natural source could get contaminated water. To be more precise people who are living in and aroung the industrialized area might get the polluted water because of the industrial wasteage are dumped into the water source. For instance, textile city in southern part of india were completely polluted due to the Dyeing industry waste water are directly mixed into the natural water source. To tackle the issue Government should pass a strict rule to recycle waste water and to reuse again.",
        "To conclude, fresh water is always demad for the people in some places around the world due to the reasons like destroying the trees and industrial waste. My view is that the main responsibility to solve the problem lies with the Government to pass rule to control the pollution and the industries should implement recycle units and to reuse the waste water to prevent the contamination of the natural resource."
