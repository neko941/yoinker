        "I am writing this letter to inform you about some issues I had it in my trip. First of all, I took a trip from my location to airport with driver Jon the owner of the license number 110009 and it was a worse trip I had taken before. Secondly, the driver behaviors were not good specific with me such as slowdown in his speed, skip a traffic signal and spoke a bad words with me and other people. Which is cause me late on my fly trip and lose a big deal in my own business in addition to that, he asked me to get out from his cars in middle of the trip. If you want me to forget all these problems and I do not take a serious steep to go police station so, I am asking you for 5000$ as a compensation for what happened or I will contact with a relevant authorities to take an appropriate action"
