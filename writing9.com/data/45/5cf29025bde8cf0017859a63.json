        "Celebrities around the world has a lot of fans and followers which supports them in all their projects such as movies, endorsements, and to some extend - even political views. However, as the saying goes, \u201cyou cannot please everybody\u201d, celebrities also has their haters, bashed and paparazzi. Paparazzi can be a fan or a basher that has one thing in common, they breach the privacy of a celebrity - they went overboard.",
        "There is always good and bad in being famous and influential. Some people believe that once you enter the world of show business or even politics, you are opening you entire life to the public. Being a public figure, you are expected to be transparent - you are not suppose to hide anything. Pictures of you will be taken without permission any time of the day whenever they spotted you. These paparazzi will follow you everywhere you go in order to have a glimpse of your day. They will take photographs and videos then upload it in social media channels. The photographs and videos may either be an advantage to your career, an example is when you where seen doing act of kindness. On the other hand, it can be a scandal that can ruin your name and reputation. Paparazzi knows no limits as they think that celebrities owe their increasing prominence to them.",
        "On the contrary, there are still some who belive hat everyone needs a private space away from all the cameras and enjoy being a commenter.  Although it is difficult for celebrities to have a normal life but they also wished to have a lone time for themselves. Their job is to give entertainment in front of the camera and it should end there. Like an employee, their work should also end off-camera.",
        "In summary, paparazzi should know that celebrities are recognised because of their outstanding performances and they are being respected for a job well done. The price they receive is fame and respect however, the latter has always been forgotten."
