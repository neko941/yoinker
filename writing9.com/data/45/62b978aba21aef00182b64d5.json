        "Nowadays, people pay much attention to the external appearance of the body. In their daily lives, many people are dieting. Dieting can change a person\u2019s life for the better or ruin one\u2019s health completely. This essay will discuss this.",
        "To begin, dieting helps people have a balanced body by only eating foods full of essential nutrients. Scientists have created a balanced nutrition pyramid suitable for everyone, but only about 50% of the world\u2019s population uses it for their daily meals. It is the reason many people are obese or too thin. It is evident that dieting with plant-based foods also helps many people prevent physical diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and cancer.",
        "On the other hand, dieting also has consequences for people. Many people do not understand dieting. They stop eating normal foods or eating little, so the body does not have enough nutrients. This causes the body to gradually weaken and develop diseases such as bulimia and anorexia. And according to the University of Cincinnati\u2019s Eating Disorders program, unsuccessful dieters are more likely to develop depression, especially in adolescents.",
        "In conclusion, my take on this is to eat right - refer to the balanced nutrition pyramid - and exercise regularly. It is the best way to maintain a fit and healthy body."
