        "Different people have different preferences regards where to watch films. Some people prefer going to the cinemas while others prefer watching on their phones. From my perspective, I prefer going to the cinema.",
        "People prefer watching on their phones because mobile phones or tablets are portable so they can be carried around. They can start watching a movie, pause the movie to carry out other tasks and continue from they stopped later. Some people also don\u2019t feel the need to conclude watching movies on the spot. They can continue watching at their convenient time for days which could span into weeks and some times months depending on the individual.",
        "The mobile phones or tablets also have storage which can be used to store a large number of movies so they are at liberty to choose the movie they want to watch at any given time of the day.",
        "On another hand, some people are of the opinion that for movies to be maximally enjoyed, movies should be watched in the cinema because the cinema was built to create an enjoyable experience such the quality of the movies shown which is always crystal clear and shown on a very large screen, the sound system, the reclining chairs to make people relax. Most cinemas now employ state of the art technology such as the 3D googles to create an un-imaginable experience for the viewers, the adaptive technology of the cinemas to adapt to different weather conditions shown in the movie.",
        "I strongly believe movies should be seen in the cinema rather than on a mobile phone or a tablet as a result of the enjoyable experience created by the cinema."
