        "Quality of education provided by schools plays vital role in shaping up a person\u2019s  life. Some people suppose educational institutions select students on the basis of their academic merits. While, another set of people thinks, it should be done by looking into various unique talents. In my opinion, I believe students have often discovers their hidden talent by interacting different types of people with different qualities.",
        "On the one hand, the great talents born often come with the cut throat competition among the other brightest student. It is better to offer admission to on best academics scores students it makes them more competitive and sportive nature to work more harder. one of the example is, Scientist do research and do various experiments, by any chance, even it got fail again they will try to be succeed.",
        "On the other hand, one cannot deny that unique talent is a hidden talent which is often discovered randomly. Studying with different qualities of students will get to know once hidden talent and by working on that hidden talent can be more successful in life. Such as cricketer from India Sachin Tendulkar get to know his ability to bat by the help of this school friends.",
        "To conclude, I firmly believe, many people are not blessed with the academics knowledge but getting into the school of which got various talents discovers themselves and there are set of students gives them the opportunity to show case their academic and competitive qualities by getting enrolled on those kind of institutions."
