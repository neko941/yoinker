        "For majority of people, working traditional job under a big company or organization may be the most acceptable way of life. For others, having the right to be their own boss is their ultimate dream. Difficulties in getting employed also triggers people that it might be better to create their own opportunities. This is probably what caused the rise of entrepreneurship.",
        "These days, many people seem to enjoy being self-employed rather than working for a company.",
        "While there are many reasons to choose self-employment, autonomy and flexibility may be the main ones. Workers in corporate environments often must deal with rules and unbelievable demands from their bosses. Most of the time they are expected to give their best performance while working under harsh condition and even being underpaid. Being self-employed allows them to set their own rules and goals. Self-employment gives the autonomy and freedom to use their skills to the best of their ability without unnecessary restrictions given by company management.",
        "More comfortable working environment and flexible working hours can contribute to their performance as well.",
        "Most people believe that being self-employed may reduce their stress level, some studies in fact show that in some cases the stress level may be higher. Unlike regular jobs that pay consistent salary at specific intervals, self-employed people don\u2019t have guaranteed income. They must deal with this income inconsistency. In addition, starting a business and finding clients may not be as easy as it seems. Owning a business means giving extra effort to work your way up the ladder. It is time and energy consuming.",
        "While self-employment can bring certain advantages, it usually comes with its own costs. I think before choosing whether to be self-employed or working for a corporate, one must calculate the advantages and disadvantages thoroughly. Regardless of the kind of job they choose, they must be responsible and give the best they can."
