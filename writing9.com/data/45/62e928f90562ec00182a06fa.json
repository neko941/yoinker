        "Nowadays, in many ,states a number of people who want to become teachers are getting decrease, especially in high schools. The main reason is that young students are transforming to adolescents and lecturers can not put up with their inconvenient behaviours. To deal with this problem could be paid extra salary to teachers.",
        "To begin with, attitudes of young people have bothered the lecturers who are working in secondary schools. Nobody would dispute the fact that the most unbearable term of young people for teachers is the adolescent era when kids have been affected by diverse hormones associated with their process of getting older. For example, generally, young people have a tendency to do not obey the formal or informal rules due to hormones which are cited above and they have admitted the lecturer as a representer of authority that should be opposed.",
        "To solve this issue might be given to high school lecturers more money than other teachers. It seems to that giving exra payment to these people could be motivated them being lecturer. By this means, this job can gain its charming to back and lecturers might prefer to benefit from this opportunity. For instance, a young teacher candidate maybebe consider the money issue and he could be choose to be a lecturer in secondary school.",
        "To conclude, the problem is that in a number of countries many people do not want to be a lecturer in  secondary schools caused by the inappropriate behaviours of adolescents can be solved with extra payment to these lecturers."
