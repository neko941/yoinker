        "At the onset, it is a irrefutable that crime is a serious and growing problem in the most of the country.There are the reason to prove that a these days crime rate are dropping.first and foremost, due to the use of artificial Technologies suchas a fingerprint and the face recognisation system police can easily identified by Wanted criminal as result in arresting criminal faster than past.To better illustrate this according to a recent survey conducted by Times of India reveal that, China all the 80 % crime cases by using face recognisation system as result drop the crime rate in China.moreover, since use various safety sensors and camera in private shops and public area,People are  monitored  by owner of shops and security guard which eventually identify dangerous tools such as a knife and gun and uncommon activity which it can help to stop this.",
        "In accession to this the most influential point in support of my view is that, owing to advancement in Computer technology, cybercrime department monitors and analyse the cyber activity and they can track the hackers location and arresting them, which consequently reduce the same cybercrime  such aonline scam and so on.furthermore, government has  used to social media to spread the awareness about the cyber activity among society,So people avoid the installing hacking apps and do not support the personal information on websites which result in it can prevent the cyber crime.",
