        "The atmospheric issues, according to few people, should be solved nationally. Whereas, rest of the individuals believe, that is should be dealt with on a more larger, like global scale. In my opinion, a problem of such vast extent should be handled both, on a larger as well as on a smaller scale.",
        "Countries like United States, India, China, etc., should unite themselves to fight this issue by banning usage of certain hazardous materials. Infact, this is not the first time, when countries will have united to combat with a bigger problem. In the years between 1980 and 2000, the ozone layer started depleting due to few extremely fatal gases excreated from air-conditioners and refridgerators. This worldwide phenomenon lead to unifying of the nations showing that it definitely did wonders then, and it will not fail us this time.",
        "It is necessary to fight atmospheric issues nationally by imposing certain laws and encouraging environment-friendly adaptations. Laws for industries like paper and wooden furniture are already instilled, in which they have uprooted for the manufacturing of their products. This sort of nature-friendly law will bolster the recovery of our sick planet.",
        "In my opinion, an issue so big can only be eradicated if it is fought at a worldwide extent and also at a minute scale such as country-wide because if the world is not united or if a country does not cooperate then there will be no one who can save the planet Earth.",
        "In conclusion, people favoring globally scaled solutions and equally correct to ones who prefer country scaled solutions and unifying those people\u2019s opinions will boost the recovery of the climate."
