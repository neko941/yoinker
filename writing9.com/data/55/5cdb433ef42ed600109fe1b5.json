        "Children are indulging in playing video games more often than ever. Many people are concerned about their detrimental effects in the future. There adverse effects on children and community will be discussed and some possible solutions presented in this essay.",
        "Firstly, the negative effects of video games are experienced by children, first hand. As many of these games require a minimal level of intelligence and concentration to be enjoyed, the mental agility of children suffers. Moreover, their interest in education decreases in proportion to their hours of video game engagements. This is because video games are instantly rewarding as compared to homework, which is perceived by them as a waste of time. Secondly, society suffers in terms of increased crime rates and prevailing obesity. These are because most video games encourage violence and long periods of sitting. These children, inspired by the action in video games, try to replicate the violence in the real world. Also, the sedentary lifestyle culminates into obesity which puts a strain on the health system of a society.",
        "However, there are some solutions which can buffer these problems. For instance, the video games can be designed to be more informative and less violent. This can be in the form of introducing challenges on geography, biology, or historical events. This way, the child will be mentally engaged in addition to being more informed at the same time. Another solution to control the menacing effects of video games is that parents reward a child for abandoning computer games. For example, they can take him to his favourite park if he gives up playing video games and engage in competitive, physical sports.",
        "In conclusion, video games are detrimental for the child's education as well as health, but the situation can be mitigated by proper initiatives."
