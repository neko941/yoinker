        "Recently, many companies offer workers that they could work from home leading to several issues both advantages and disadvantages.  While some people think that only workers can benefit from this, I believe it has positive effects on both employees and employers.",
        "It is clear that working online could bring about several advantages. Firstly, people can control their life. In the other words, they have an amount of work they have to do and a deadline, and they could decide when and how they complete it. For those who are parents, they can have more time for their children which helps tightening their family. Moreover, home workers are not under pressure and seem to be work efficient. Simply because of a large amount of time each day going to work then come back home could be replaced for doing exercise or doing housework.",
        "Turning to another perspective, there are also many issues that both employers and employees must deal with. The first thing is the fact that those who work at home will lack interaction, thus feeling of loneliness and isolation. Another drawback is the managers and co-workers only communicate via email or social network. For instance, if there have any problem it will cause some misunderstanding. Therefore, it is often better to solve problems face-to-face, while working in an office can create a team atmosphere that is better for productivity.",
        "Overall, it seems that working from home can make life\u2019s worker easier and MORE  comfortable. Although, employees should consider carefully whether working from home or at the office is the appropriate choice."
