        "It is a debated issue whether exploring the space has made no impact in life or has been a positive change to humans. I agree that after the visit to the the moon, science and technology has taken a mammoth dimension with numerous inventions and also the moon and other planets may be the right place to live  in future. This reasons will be discussed further in the following paragraphs.",
        "Life has become lot easier and better with ideas and inventions from space science. Also, Technology has taken a new shape entirely. For instance, in medicine, the pace makers used for cardiac patients by doctors and the portable remote devices used in the ambulance are all products of space technology. Secondly, the helmets used by bikers which are usually lightweight is one of these inventions. Finally, communication today is of great importance to the world and was made possible through several mast mounted in the space. Likewise, the television and radio satelites which are all technological ideas of astronuts who have travelled to the space.",
        "In recent times, the world is faced with problems such as global warming and overpopulation. This visit to the moon and other planets is a necessary step in finding out if man can live and survive in these places when these issues gets out of hand. The space might eventually be useful in decongesting the worlds population.",
        "In conclusion, what is life without technological advancements?. Indeed, scientific research has been helpful to mankind. Also, if life is found in the space, it would be a big  jackpot to humans."
