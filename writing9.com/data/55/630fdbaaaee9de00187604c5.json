        "\u0130t is considered by people that long distant flights us more fuel than cars and brings pollution to the environment. We should discourage non-essential flight rather than limit the use of cars. I completely agree with the opinion . \u0130n my opinion , long distant flights affect environment badly due to use more fuel , and  therefore  flight limit can be discouraged by governments  or  limit that executed  cars  can be eliminated by governments   , afterwards  people will begin prefer cars rather than planes for long - distance flights.",
        "Firstly  , governments execute limit the use of cars  , and therefore many people who wanna go to far generally prefer to flights . Unfortunately , flights   cause  much trouble   such as enviromental problems  . \u0130n my opinion , we and governments discourage non-essential flights , and thus environmental problems  can decline .   A plane that prepare to fly  need to approximately 1500 liter fuel and this fuel  participant to air in a gas way  while the plane fly  in the air . Thus , this fuel that participated to air  takes place much trouble for our environment .  For instance , trees or flowers affect badly due to fuel that participates to air",
        "Another point to consider is that limit the use of cars can be eliminated by governments . Because cars save more fuel than planes in the best way ,  and thus pollution can decline in the world and also , these flights affect the economy of governments due to their  high-cost  and also , governments take fuel in an expensived way  from Arabican countries such as Abu Dhabi and Qatar . Thus ,  the economy of countries affect badly .  For instance , a man wanna go to anywhere for travel and the man prefer to plane . Because plane is less cost than cars , and thus air pollution takes place in the world .  Pollution can be eliminated if law will  eliminate maximum the use of cars  .",
        "\u0130n conclusion , long distance flights affect badly our environment and pollution takes place in the world .  \u0130n my opinion , corruption can be eliminated if governments will  eliminate limit the use of cars, and thus many people will begin prefer to cars for their job or their travel .  ."
