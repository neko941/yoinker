        "Sports play a crucial role in the development of the capital of the country. People in the sports sector should maintain their fitness and be strong but some other communities argue on this matter. In this essay, I will discuss both scenarios and then I will give my opinion on this matter.",
        "On the one side, It is important to be a strong individual and should maintain fitness to succeed in sports. Physical fitness is good for health and also has a great impact on performance. And in the selection process also some sports sectors also see whether performers are physically fit or not. By maintaining fitness an individual will become physically strong. For example, An athlete should maintain physical fitness and should be strong enough to win the competition.",
        "On the other side, It is also important to have the mental stability to succeed in the game. Even though, a person is looking great physically but not does  have great mental stability will impact their career in sports and this will lead to loose the game. For example,if  a sports person is having great fitness and he/she is thinking about his/her family problems then this will lead to loose the game.",
        "To sum up, In my ,view it is important to have both physical fitness and mental attitudes for a sports person to succeed in the game. Not having any one of  both qualities will affect the game."
