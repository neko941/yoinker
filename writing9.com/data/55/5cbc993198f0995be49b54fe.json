        "It is often argued that each individual should adopt vegetarian way of diet because meat consumption is associated with many health issues. I somehow agree with the given point of view as it has its merits as well as demerits. This essay will explicate the opinion as mentioned earlier.",
        "To begin with, adoption of vegetarian dietary regime can help in avoiding dangerous afflictions of consuming red and white meat. In other words, the undesirable entities that come along with eating meat in any form are prevented from entering one\u2019s body thereby ensuring good health. As evidenced in a recent article published in The New York Times, it has been revealed that consuming red meat in the long term is highly unfavourable for normal human digestive system and makes body prone to different forms of cancers. Therefore, vegetarianism does appear a more favourable way of living.",
        "On the contrary, one\u2019s dietary habits are one\u2019s individual choice and one cannot be dictated the food that needs to be eaten. Put differently, in a civil society, people enjoy absolute independence as far as the choice of the food is concerned. Take the case of an open society such as the USA; it is constituted of people of multiple nationalities with varied food preferences and they are allowed to practice their choice and faith. This is guaranteed to them by law of the country. Hence, it should be left to an individual, the type of food he or she prefers.",
        "In essence, it is not practical for everyone to turn vegetarian just based on the belief that non-vegetarian eatables have certain risk of health related to them. It is hoped people make wise decisions and adopt healthy eating habits that can suffice their overall health and development."
