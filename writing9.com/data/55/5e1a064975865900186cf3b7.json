        "Due to countries' development, human have different perspectives with whether keeping acient constructions or rebuliding modern skycrapers. However, while many consider that its should be kept for eductional purpose or travel landmarks, I personally believe that governemts outgh to demolish them instead of buidling high-rise apartment.",
        "Firstly, the main purpose to protect acient hertiage is that its still retain the possession of values for human history, which can be accessed to educate member of public. For instance, in western countries, some museums and castles have been almost renovated the inside of constructions and then exhibit some ancient tools, remarkable paintings or vivid scpltures adding descriptions in order to let children or tourists to comprehend historical stories and content or appreciate the beauty of the art. On the one hand, if governments organize these public hertiage properly, it can attract the number of foreign tourists to visit countries and doing so can help them to understand clearly about countries' culture.",
        "On the other hand, even though old contructions have their value, there is no doubt that if too many derelict buildings still keep in cities, it is hard to have many difinite positive impacts on  countries' development and this can not tackle the issue of over population. For an example of high populating area, governments should let construction firms have planning permission to run-down most of slums replacing them by high- rise apartment. This is because doing so is likely to help residents to live comfortable and support homeless to have rooms to stay. In addition, it can reduce a risky because of unstable structure that people who live in time- honored buildings suffer from natural disaster,such as earthquake.",
        "In conclusion, although for some historical buildings, its still have exist meanings, the concern of countries' progression and over- population issue, governments should take into account reorganizing those out- of-date  buildings. Therefore, on balance, I believe we should buildings up many high- rise apartment instead of reminding historical buildings."
