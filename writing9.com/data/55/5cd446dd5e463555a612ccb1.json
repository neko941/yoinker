        "Some argue that adolescent years are the best times in an individual\u2019s life, while others think that grown-ups are happier, despite more responsibility. While teenagers tend to be carefree and stress-free, I believe that being an adult is more satisfactory because of financial freedom.",
        "On the one hand, teenagers are less stressed and carefree than adults because they do not have any financial or social obligations. They have more time to pursue their hobbies and discover interests that can excite them. For example, according to the survey conducted by the American Youth Association, majority of the marathons in the country have teenage participants, since most of adults stated that they could not join due other obligations. However, I believe that teenagers can only be content to a certain extend because money is an important aspect for acquiring many things in life, and they do not have the financial freedom to get them yet.",
        "On the other hand, adults tend to be more satisfied because they have the financial freedom to choose what they like. Compared to children, adults do not need to ask permission from anyone on where to spend their money, and can buy things that comfort them. For instance, I am 34 years old working professional and I do not need to ask anybody if I want to take a quick vacation. I believe that adulthood is more desirable because financial freedom can help you to buy things that makes you happy.",
        "In conclusion, although teenage years are a careless and stress-free period, it can only make teenagers happy to a certain limit, as they require monetary assistance to buy things, and that is why adulthood is better because it offers financial freedom."
