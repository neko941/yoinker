        "Although there are developments in agriculture, many people around the world still suffer from the case that is not having enough food to eat.",
        "\u200bFirst of all, the main problem about this case is that some people are over-eating and purchase foods although they are unnecessary for them. And then, the foods that they bought will be the waste. To tackle this problem, there should be constraints in purchasing foods such as one sandwich for one person and ten eggs for one family. If it is restricted in the world, it will be justified for every people. When people are limited to eat or buy foods, they will know the value of the foodstuff. In this way, people can be protected from going hungry.",
        "\u200bSecondly, there are not enough areas to farm in the world. The higher the population, the more mouths to eat. Subsequently, there are more buildings to live so that the farms are replaced with people\u2019s shelters. To draw this problem, every people should have a small farm in their houses. If they are hungry and not convenient to buy foodstuff, they can pluck some vegetables such as lettuce, cabbage and cauliflowers from the small farm. Moreover, these are not only organic but also fresh for them. Consequently, they can be healthy and prevented from going hungry.",
        "\u200bIn conclusion, every problem has solutions to solve smoothly. However, people need to follow the steps that I mentioned above to avoid from a case that is not having enough food to eat."
