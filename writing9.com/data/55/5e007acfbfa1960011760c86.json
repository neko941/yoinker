        "In today's society, as technology has become increasingly prevalent, many believe that it is unnecessary to study traditional writing. In my opinion, I consider that handwriting ought not to be learnt, as electronic devices provide a new writing experience and can tremendously reduce tedious work.",
        "On the one hand, computers generally have built-in software that allows its users to type correctly faster than traditional writing, and I agree. This is because of the fact that such device contains advanced programs that are able to correct any incorrect sentences and search for new synonyms instantly. Due to this, people are able to learn grammar, spelling and new vocabularies quicker than through handwriting. For instance, in 2000, researchers discovered that many pupils in the UK were able to speak and write English fluently through the use of modern devices. Additionally, these technologies provide digital or physical keyboards in order to help the users type their ideas faster.",
        "On the other hand, it is significant to learn handwriting skill as it can help to increase memorisation. Since writing by hand generally are slower and monotonous, it can help the brain to process and retain the necessary information. In Japan, for example, they always force their students to learn the kanji words since their childhood, where people write traditional characters with brushes and tints, which has been proven to help the Japanese pupils to reach the highest score during their examination.",
        "",
        "In conclusion, although some people may have vary opinions, I think that society nowadays ought to learn how to type instead of studying the handwriting skill."
