        "Recycling is considered to be a necessity, for reducing waste generated by ever increasing population. Hence, many advocates that, in order to ensure recycling at every level, it should be made a compulsion under law . However I believe that along with law making there are other ways to promote reusability of garbage as discussed in ensuing paragraphs.",
        "To begin with , legalizing recycling will force people to follow it under threat of law.  It is evident from many surveys that , once rules are enacted  and declared compulsory  under people are more likely to follow them example traffic rules. If government declares guidelines stating mandatory penalising for non adherence to recycling guidelines ,this will compel more people to play active part in process. Moreover, results will be better when every individual takes personal accountability  . Thus, legalisation will act as a catalyst in increasing  waste product's reusabilty .",
        "However ,along with law,  programs promoting reusability of waste material  can also play vital part in process. Either government alone or with help of other organisations should design programs to encourage people towards a clean society. Sweden ,for instance, is a country where government has taken an initiative under which every resident get some credit point for every trash of can or bottle they put for recycling .This makes people to enjoy recycling as it brings them personal benefits.Hence,such Initiatives   ,acting equally efficiency as law can also be implemented  .",
        "In Conclusion, although legalization will compel more people to participate in recycling process. However   , encouraging people to take personal interest in it can bring success in getting rid of garbage problems and will help creation of clean world."
