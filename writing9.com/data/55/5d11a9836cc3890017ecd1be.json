        "In the United States, there is a prevalent system in some regions under which youngsters are prohibited from being outside alone at night without any adult escorting them. In my opinion, this is beneficial for the children and their parents as it protects them from any harm and also teaches them to be responsible.",
        "Youngsters are vulnerable and being alone during late hours can put them in danger. These time restrictions enforced on the young kids prevent them from experiencing any traumatic instance or crime which is more likely to happen during late hours in the night. This ensures their safety and reduces the concerns of parents. This is also supported by a study conducted by Cornell Medical school which suggested that time restrictions have contributed to safety and well being of adolescents.",
        "Youngsters are also adventurous and distracted. Permitting them to be outside for only upto certain hours teaches them to be discipline and more responsible. This provides them with an opportunity to learn and understand the need and importance of why systems are in place. A study which compared adolescents who experienced curfew with those who didn\u2019t, found out that the teenagers in the former category demonstrated mature behaviour as compared to the latter.",
        "In conclusion, implementing outdoor time limitations on the teenagers is a positive practice which keeps them from any potential risk or harm. This helps in maintaining their safety and well being which a prime concern for any parent. Additionally, it also helps in building important characteristics like discipline and sensibility which are critical for character development of a youngster."
