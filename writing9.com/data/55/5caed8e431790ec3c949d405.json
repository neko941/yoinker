        "It is a common belief that villagers seemed to be more friendly and neighborly their counterparts who lived in big, modern cities in the old days. There are undoubtedly potential pros and cons of settling in rural areas, which we will discuss here.",
        "There were a variety of benefits that small-town life could offer to our past generations. Foremost among these was perhaps living space in rural areas which apparently were much slower and more relaxed than that of urban areas. People always spared their precious time to chat and share life stories with each other on their way to work or simply heading to a local market. As a result of this, country-dwellers were often regarded as friendly inhabitants who would be willing to give a helping hand to others without hesitation. Another robust reason to propose rural life was the element of less traffic on the road, which allowed drivers to commute more comfortably and less stressful. Again, we can see that this would greatly help to create a friendly and welcoming living space for many people of older generation.",
        "Despite the positives mentioned above, people living in small villages had to face a range of other factors that might urge them to migrate to bigger cities. These range from limited industry, lack of job opportunities to less access to qualified education. For example, my father in his younger years had to travel hundreds of kilometers to get to college on the grounds of the absence of such schools in his neighborhood. From the recreational perspective, countryside residents seemed not to have enough entertaining choices to enjoy the artistic and cultural life with very few museums or theaters in town, which in turn caused a great sense of boredom and tediousness.",
        "In conclusion, it appears to me that there was a strong spirit of neighborliness and community in small villages, and that there were both merits and drawbacks of living in these areas."
