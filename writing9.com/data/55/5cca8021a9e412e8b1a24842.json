        "Careers can be flourished if someone is getting a good job by influencing interviewer in first place. Most of the people believe that by performing well in interviews is the turning point in order to secure an employment. In my opinion, facing an interview with great confidence and giving best can lead to secure the job. However, there are other important aspects which really matter such as an educational background, work experience and skills etc.",
        "It is commonly believed that, first impression really matters while facing an interview then; conversing with an interviewer decides why someone will get job? Interview is mode of an evaluation of candidate\u2019s credentials and how he or she reacts to the questions. For example, in an interview most of the times candidates might ask to solve any task related to their field, and if they failed to provide solutions or explanation they might rejected. That\u2019s why performance in interview really plays vital role in getting the job.",
        "However, this is partially true; sometimes an interviewer may interested in candidate\u2019s potential and how they can be useful as an employee in order to join an organization. Candidate\u2019s education, soft skills, certification and work experience are also considered instead of performance in interview. For example, Japanese all organizations hire employee on basis of their potential, educational credentials, work history and skills rather than just an interview performance. Otherwise, it will be can of worms for employer while getting work from new employee.",
        "To conclude, in my opinion, first impressions and giving your best in interviews is very important but at the end of the day, education, work history and skills really considered as key facts during recruitment process."
