        "There has been a long standing debate regarding the role of the men and women in our society and, some are advocates of differentiating these duties on the basis of diverse qualities possessed by both. I personally believe that recognizing these qualities, which encourage men to perform intense jobs, requiring them to work in a harsh weather and women to perform and excel in a field which is more suitable for their respective nature, can be more fruitful than trying to achieve goals which are not best suited for their natural tendencies.",
        "Men have always been known to be the breadwinners for the family, and they have always been portrayed as the stronger part of the family. Therefore,a type of work involving heavy loads, harsh working conditions and demanding stamina to tolerate the extra efforts, is considered to be better suited for men. Additionally, the construction work, the operation of heavy machinery and the maintenance of different civil structures are few areas where men can perform a better job because of their natural capabilities. For example, it would be very odd and a difficult job for a lady to perform the maintenance of a sewerage system while, it is considered to be a normal job for a man.",
        "Similarly, women are always known to be the queens of their home and they beautify things around them in such a way that even if they want to, men can never receive the same level of praise for their work, because of a little to none presence of the aesthetic sense in them. In other words, the performance of women in a type of work involving art, d\u00e9cor, interior designing and fashion designing would always be exemplary and their natural abilities enable them to outclass men in these fields. As an example, the industry of fashion designing is filled with a number of successful women who reached the epitome of success only because of the abilities incurred naturally in them.",
        "To conclude, I am in complete agreement that the professions opted by men and women according to their inbuilt characteristics, will enable them to succeed and hence, they should put their utmost efforts to make a name for themselves in their relevant fields."
