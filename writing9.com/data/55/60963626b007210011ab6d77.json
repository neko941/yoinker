        "The amount of crime rates are increasing dramatically in many regions these days. I strongly believe that one of the factors is that violence caused by the internet. In this essay, I will be exploring my statements and the solutions.",
        "First of all, the spread of social media such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram caused the main problems. Most of the problems are due to the children misunderstanding social media. For example, they are often troubled by chatting on social networks and conflict of communication will connect to real violence. Moreover, identification of personal information is a heavy crime that not only the specific person gets damaged but people around them also involved in it. Secondly, advancement of video streams such as Youtube and Tiktok are big factors. The reason is that many videos are illegally uploaded and obtain profits. Therefore, most of the people do not understand how to use social networks.",
        "In order to solve those issues, I think that the government and school should handle the problems. For  the government, they need to make the law that criminals who are involved in internet violence must be given heavy punishment. Furthermore they can make the posters that prevent crime. However, the way of education is much more effective. School should teach the scary of the internet which gives extra classes. In addition, teaching by educational TV program is one way to prevent law-breaking. As a result, the government or education facilities should provide solutions.",
        "In conclusion, I personally think that gaining the number of people who use the internet leads to many issues. If it is possible to solve these factors, the number of criminals will decrease."
