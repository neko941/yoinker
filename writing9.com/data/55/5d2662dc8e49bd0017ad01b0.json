        "Television are being used today increasingly to help children acquire knowledge and they are persuaded to use it not only at their home but also at their school. However, I strongly disagree with this and suggest that the children should not be allowed to watch it regularly. This essay provides various reasons regarding its disapproval.",
        "The primary reason that the children should not be allowed to watch television daily is that this deteriorates their health. The practice of youngsters viewing television repeatedly makes them passive and lazy. As a result, their physical activities would be reduced and it in turn lead them toward unhealthy lifestyle such as obesity which hampers their health. In addition, it has been proven that excessive concentration in a television screen eventually could induce discomforts such as headache and eye strain.",
        "Also, if younger population are habituated to viewing television in a recurring basis then they may familiarize themselves to negative activities. This is because many of the programs that is depicted in TV are not youngsters friendly and it also shows programs those are violent and unethical such as show related to robbery. This could have a negative impact in the mind of young ones which is very vulnerable at that age and it also might encourage them imitate those unwanted things shown in TV.",
        "In conclusion, this essay suggests that the young students should not be motivated to view television very often due to the negative impact it creates in their health and mind."
