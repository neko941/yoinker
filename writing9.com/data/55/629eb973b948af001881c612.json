        "The making development of children is one of the important things that parents and teachers should concernabout . It along with a behaviour of a child are a key to predict in the near future . Therefore , some proponent points out that something that attracts  a kid can potentially contact to their mind and what they are thinking about . Whereas others argue that television is the most influential device for people , especially for kids . Both of opinions will be cleared in this case.",
        "Almost children are keep an eyes on something like mainstream on their activity that makes them  be appetited . Even they can do an impression of somebody have inspired them . Many things can make them excited such as an impressive character in a film or a video game, also a politician , one of a powerful person along with talent for conducting countries . Adolf Hitler is most famous political person also the most famous predator in human history . he controlled his country and militaries by his silly strategy or crazy think that the people such as a kid supposed that he was a man whose civilians in Germany at that time were proud of his career and believed that he was a god on German history . He created a trend by his sign that children do an impression of his gesture once he greeted a people and stood on his automatic with unique behaviour that was followed by children . What a silly propagandas in that time that Hitler had influenced to their mind .",
        "Besides , television also a unit can involves directly to behaviours on kids . For exmaple , children usually appeals on a powerful character on a catoon such as a spiderman or Joker , each of who makes the audience like children more impressed by active heroes that they will buy a likewise of their clothes to turn into a character on film . The main problem is children can be influenced easily by a film on television .",
        "In conclusion , a kid can be contacted to their think because of a small age . I'm sure that TV is not a unique thing on most things influence them . There are many things outside will create a lot of trends make children will do their behaviour ."
