        "Some people believe that not sufficient of the waste is recycled from the households. They want the government to make it mandatory to recycle the waste from homes by making certain laws. I completely agree with the given statement therefore I will discuss about the legal requirements and the other ways to encourage people recycle more of the household waste.",
        "In recent years, the household wastes are considerably increasing. People who are responsible in harming the environment are not much aware about the recycling process. Firstly, they should be made aware about this process by organizing campaigns in which the public should be made understood about the benefits of recycling. Secondly, the government should give rewards or some cash backs to the people who recycle their waste instead of charging them.",
        "People only follow the rules when there is some strict action taken towards it. The government should make several laws so that the recycling of the waste increases. The environmental studies should be made mandatory for the students of every school so that they are able to understand the harms they are causing to their environment. There are other ways such as by giving rewards to every person who recycles waste each and every time, which in result would lead to increase in recycling of waste from the households as it make the people more excited and which will in return  automatically benefit the environment.",
        "In conclusion, introducing laws will help in recycling more wastes by the public but rewarding or educating them can become better ways. So the government should make laws and help the public to contribute towards the environment."
