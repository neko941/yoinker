        "Seeing a movie is a fantastic way to relax and whether one does that on the phone or in a cinema, is up to the individual. While some are of the opinion that, films are better watched on the phones, others believe cinemas offer more exciteful movie experience. This essay, will discuss these views and give reasons why people perceive either of them as best.",
        "Some people say that, watching a movie on your phone or tablet saves one the unnecessary expenses associated with doing same, in a cinema. For example, to see a film in a cinema may cost about 15 GBP while you could download and watch same movie on your phone at a very minimal cost of less than 5 GBP. Also, watching a movie at the comfort of your home offers more relaxation, as well as flexibility. One could lay on the bed, while watching a movie or even walk around the house but in a cinema, one has to quietly sit in one position, to see a movie. Furthermore, seeing a movie on a tablet gives one more control, as the individual can play and pause the movie at will unlike in the cinema.",
        "As true as the above reasons are, a number of persons prefer to watch movies in cinemas. They argue that, there are some blockbuster movies that are available, only in cinemas and by the time such movies are publicly available, the hype and the vibe is gone. Also, going to the cinema with family or friends is a good way to bond and have a great time together, as well as create lasting memories. For example, my romantic life with my ex, kicked off at the cinema while we watched the film, \"50 shades of grey\".",
        "In my opinion, cinemas are the best places to see a film, especially if the movie is a blockbuster and as such, not readily available on the internet."
