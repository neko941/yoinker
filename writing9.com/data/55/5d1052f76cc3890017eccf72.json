        "Globalization is inevitable these days. The boundary of countries is disappearing so customers can easily purchase foreign produces in their own countries. Although this trend could be detrimental to some local brands' development especially in some developing countries, it can significantly help people to reduce their living costs and improve their life quality. In my opinion, the positive points of this surpass the negative aspects.",
        "The crucial beneficial factor of globalization is that consumers have more varied options to choose the most suitable item in the same market. Compared to domestic products, foreign goods can be more attractive and durable. A good illustration of this is that an investigation shows 80% of people tend to buy foreign products due to it costs less and has better quality. As can be seen, this tendency has a profound impact on the life quality of people.",
        "However, every coin has two sides. The main challenge of globalization is that some national companies can\u2019t compete with foreign monopolies with advanced technology especially in some developing countries. For example, it has been found in a research that the majority of enterprises in Vietnam often struggle to survive in this severe competition due to insufficient revenues. Therefore, a significant number of local companies will disappear eventually",
        "To sum up, the trend of globalization is currently increase nowadays. While this can bring some challenges for the local brands, it can also bring additional advantages for the customer. I am inclinedto believe that the overall benefits of this are superior."
