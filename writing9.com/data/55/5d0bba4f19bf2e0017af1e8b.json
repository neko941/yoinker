While proponents of GM crops ensure that these foods are safe for human consumption and help to increase food supplies, others argue that their effects on health have not been studied long enough.\nDescribe pros and cons of genetically modified foods.",

        "Genetically modified item's availability is increasing day by day, across the globe. Some take the side and other oppose it. We will discuss few points on both sides, below.",
        "Coming to the advantages, It is really needed, at the present situation, to meet the demand of food. GM, not only provides the solution for the problem but also shows the path for meeting future demand. For example, In most of the backward countries, deaths are reported due to starvation. To aviod these, we have need to go for the above solution. Not only the mentioned problem can be resolved, but some of the bi-products created, provide's healthy and safety meal for us. Crops that are grown with this, can sustain in odd condition's and can yeild good quantity, which can meet the requirement's.",
        "Considering the other side of the coin, It also has it's own disadvantages. One of them is, related to nutrition value of the products that got produced with these. There are argument that it may got compromised with the original value and combination with other, may lead to adverse impact on human race, in future. For example, Meat that has it's potential may not be carried with modifying product. Moreover, it may create new problem's, which are unknown as of now.",
        "In conclusion, As every research has its own pros and cons, we should be careful before using them and should have thorough check for ample of time, before released to market or make available for consumption."
