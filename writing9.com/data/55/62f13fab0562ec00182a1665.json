        "In this competitive world, it is not possible for any person to survive without foodstuff and a clean climate. Some schools of thought presume that having junk and fast meal impact and harm the environment as well as disturb the eating habits of families in a certain way. Here, I coincide that due to fast-food plethora of people can face severe diseases and other health problems. Also, the chief reason is it negatively affects the habitat and its beauty which is even detrimental to the animals.",
        "To begin with, it is irrefutable that a lot of folks nowadays use online applications to order snacks to save time. However, working professionals indirectly invite severe diseases and obesity to themselves. A recent analysis revealed that, 90 out of 100 corporate workers avoid homemade cuisine to get fast food which results in gaining weight and viral infections after several intakes.",
        "In addition to this, a vast community and shopkeepers have a clear mindset and goal to clean the environment by using recyclable and renewable food packaging and wrappers. However, society sometimes uses plastic bags and even habitats by throwing them on the roads and in public places which interrupts the beauty of nature. Additionally, the most important factor is that animals which rely on the food from the roads can be impacted by having plastic bags. Most of the shopkeepers in urban areas now turned to do business with renewable covers but customers use plastics over that products.",
        "To agglomerate, undoubtedly fast food helps people to save time but the negative impact to harm surroundings and people by problems at the physical level plays a vital role with bad habits."
