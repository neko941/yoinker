        "The traditional and religious festivals are made for remembering someone who died with honor and culture which is precious from time to time. Yet, nowadays, these events are disappearing; people want to spend their time at other things. This essay will discuss that these should completely exist and inherit for our future children.",
        "People think that the religious festivals are boring and they do not know why they have to join, so, people usually ignore these days and just enjoy with their friends or family. Because, activities in that time is quietly dull and it is not important in their lives. For example, my friends usually go to a singing room or a PC room instead of entering activities. These are reasons why people seldom celebrate that day.",
        "On the other hand, our own culture can be existed by traditional events. Because, we always remember and celebrate some people that day and we can save the meaning of it. For instance, in the Korea's special day, Chusuk, people wear our Hanbok which is our traditional cloth and bow to all of the older family members. After bowing, we get some rewards like money and comments how to live properly and wisely from them. From this example, we can learn the way how to behave to elders and foundation moral, also, we can save our own culture.",
        "In conclusion, the religious days have to be saved as a convention for our future children, also, our characteristic can be saved. In my view, we need to attend these events, so, these can be alive. Also, we should not ignore it and ancestor's spirits."
