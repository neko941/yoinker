        "Today there are so many advanced technologies available for farming . with that technology you can easily achieve the expected harvest . but still there is so many people who do not have anything to eat . they are a can be various reasons for that , like poor countries do not have access to them and they do not have enough money to buy them. Anyhow these problems can be sold with some steps. I am going to explain the rest below.",
        "On the one hand, only developed countries have access to the new technologies because poor status don't have enough knowledge to operate them . 90% of hungry people live in poor states they do not have new technology or good education so they cannot advantage from new things.  For example, according to the new research, 25% of the people in Kenya died due to the food store shortage . other things is they do not have enough money to buy advanced things. They cannot afford that kind of things. furthermore, they need sufficient amount of money to buy things . other countries not going to sell their technologies free. thus, poor countries do not have access or enaugh money to develop their agriculture.",
        "on the other hand , however governments can help to solve this problem. they can reduce prices on agricultural items, so even poor people can buy them. For instance, cut taxes or introduce new payment methods. they can open some institute/educational centers for famers,  so they can study new methods and technologies. When, they well educated about that agriculture,  they can easily get good harvest. so, they can solve this problem by giving good education and reducing prices.",
        "In conclusion, most of people in the world still suffer from starving. The reasons can be,  limited access and insufficient amount of money . moreover, it can be sold by educating people and reducing prices."
