        "While some people think that unsalaried work should be taken as an obligation for high school students, I completely agree with the fact that they are free to choose how they want to spend time out of classes.",
        "There are several reasons why students should be able to choose how to manage their free time. Firstly, it is extremely vital for them to have an additional hours in their schedule to have a hobby. Secondly, as they are going to graduate from school, they would have to prepare for admission exams in order to get in a university. Finally, their effort for mandatory tasks could be destructive or even harmful due to students\u2019 ignorance and low motivation to do it properly. A lot of students struggle from lacking in additional time which can help them to figure out their future goals to succeed in life.",
        "I believe that effectiveness of deliberate approach to understand importance of commitment for obligatory services is even more trustworthy. It is much healthier to attract students who are interested in community services because of natural desire to help people via completing socially-valued tasks. Furthermore, these encouraged people will be responsible to impact positively everything which is related to extra service. For example, the vast majority of disabled and low-mobile people are in demand of special services which can be provided by students. If students can support these type of individuals in their requests, they would be more than grateful for their willingness to help.",
        "In my conclusion, my view is that high school students should be able to prioritise their tasks in any order they want, and it is completely unfair to force them for doing obligatory tasks which they are not interested in."
