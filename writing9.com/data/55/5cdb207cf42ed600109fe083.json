        "Many youths nowadays are opting to attend university more than ever before, with hindsight that they will be able to secure employment afterwards. Whilst, on the other hand, others believe that hands-on experience is highly necessary and of a higher importance. In my opinion, attaining a degree is crucial for academic jobs, whereas skills gained from experience is necessary for careers which are more physically laborious.",
        "With regards to university degrees, more and more people are required to obtain these in order to have a chance of gaining a valuable job. Companies are expecting candidates to have one university degree, at the minimum, when applying for a position, therefore academic education has become an essential criteria for many jobs. Similarly as higher studies become a basic requirement, many employees are unable to climb their career ladders or get promoted to better positions without one.",
        "On the other hand, having work experience or other skills such as leadership or interpersonal skills can be far more beneficial in securing a job.  Certain job sectors, such as an electrician or mechanic require more physical experience and despite them needing theoretical knowledge, practical skills are of a higher importance within their jobs. In addition, with more people gaining degrees, large organisations have started to look at valuable experience that prospective employees may have to help whittle down candidates to the most suitable and thus those with relevant skills in that line of work will be more appealing to employers.",
        "In conclusion, although there are many reasons why experience and soft skills can never replace academic knowledge, I believe that in order to have a good job, one must have both of these qualities. An example would be careers such as medicine, law or engineering where attending higher education is vital, however to be the best at your career, experience and skills learnt on the jobs will make you must more sufficient and more likely to get a fulfilling job."
