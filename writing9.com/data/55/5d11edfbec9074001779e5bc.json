        "There is no doubt that young generation needs to learn working with each other in addition to relentlessly pursuing their goals. People who believe in goal setting and fulfillment argue that competition is an indispensable quality. However, I tend not to agree with this concept as I find team work more useful and effective.",
        "On the one hand, there is a line of thought that learning to compete at an early age develops various abilities in an individual which can be quite useful in the education and the work place. Practices such as working harder by comparing oneself with others are usually learnt at an early age. For example, a child participating in a sport judges his performance after comparing it with the other children. This makes his game better and gives him confidence of performing at a higher level of sport.",
        "Despite the advantages of competition, we must take into consideration its various drawbacks. I believe that competition is addictive, and it makes a person compare himself with his teammates. Moreover, as most businesses and real-life work is accomplished by teams, it becomes a serious limitation as one grows and takes on more responsibility. To illustrate, we can visualize picture of an organization in which departments fight among each other and thereby, fail to meet overall strategic objectives. Alternatively, if children are taught to work with others, they can develop qualities like mutual respect, helpfulness and kindness. Such abilities would serve them once they take on challenges of real life.",
        "To summarize, cooperation and team work is the basis of successful work and relationships, which obviously is vital for individual well-being. Giving more precedence to the competition may look like a natural choice, but it can result in ineffectiveness and short-sightedness in later stages of one\u2019s life."
