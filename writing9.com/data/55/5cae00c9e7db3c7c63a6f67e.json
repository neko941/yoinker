        "In countries such as USA obesity is a very common issue and because of that government charges higher taxes to the companies who produces foods which causes such diseases. In my opinion, this way of preventing the unhealthy food to spread is very effective.",
        "Most of the unhealthy foods are tasty which is why they are so popular yet dangerous. For companies it is easy to make more money by produce such food. So charging them with high taxes is good way to reduce the amount of unhealthy food but there are also another ways too. For example promoting healthy foods, making healthy foods abundant and available for everyone. I think it is better to give the healthy alternative for unhealthy food before restricting it or charging higher taxes.",
        "Increasing the taxes for such companies might have bad consequences. One of them is increase of tax fraud among them and illegal selling. These crimes may happen due the fact that higher taxes will make it harder to gain profit so they will have to commit crime action. So the chance that this method could be effective or not which cause only aggravating the situation are equal. So to stop them without making it worst they need to use other ways which are more effective and will not cause any more danger.",
        "In conclusion, I believe that charging extra money is good to reduce those companies but it is not the only possible way and we should use more methods to stop it."
