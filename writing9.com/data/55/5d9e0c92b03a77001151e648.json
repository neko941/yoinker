        "In today\u2019s world sharing information has greatest impact on other\u2019s life. Some people think it is necessary to share the information which they know while others do not. This essay will discuss both the views in detail.",
        "Foe example, some scientists believe that in this technologically advancing world, it is necessary for them to share their research to the outside world so that some other researcher\u2019s use their research and develop new ideas based on their thesis. This leads to the development of their basic idea of their research into various other fields apart from their basic field of research.",
        "For instance, the technologically giant company tesla released all their patents to the public for free of cost so that it could help other people to carryon further research from what they had stopped.",
        "Another such example is the inventor of X Rays Wilhelen Rountgen who released all his inventions to the public for free of cost so that normal people can make use of it.",
        "On the other hand, some people think it is necessary to limit their flow. Foe example, if a person has more knowledge in computers, instead of sharing his knowledge with others for free of cost, he can start an institution where he can earn some money by sharing what he knows. Sharing the knowledge has now become a market where many people tend to make a lot of money.",
        "To sum up the above essay, there are some spheres where sharing the information is a good practice while others restrict them to gain benefit from that."
