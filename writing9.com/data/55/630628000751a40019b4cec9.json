        "Schools are more and more essential nowaday with people around the world, especially  with children. Some people belive that the main task of education systems is to transform children into well-educated citizens and employers, rather than to benifit them as individuals. It is disasgreed that this is the main target of shool for children. Analysing the self development of graduates for both their financial abilities and their mental knowledges will prove this.",
        "Firstly, school will give their learnes about khowledges and skills to meet their job requirements so that they could get job easier. For instance, people who are fresh gradutes could be apply for jobs which has job descriptions same as their khowledges sector at universities, so  they have more chance to be accepted by the company. If they get the jobs, they will have ability to afford their cost of living, then pay taxes for social. Therefore, this make it clear that they are people who take more benifits.",
        "Secondly, school will give their learnes khowledges to develop the mental health on themselve. For example, kids will be taught ethical lession to become a better children in their families. Moreover, kids also learn survial skills that extremely essential in their life such as swimming, cooking..etc.Thus, it becomes appearant that learnes get more valueable from school than social.",
        "To summarise, the learners are people who are received more benefit from school than companies or social. So, it clear that the ideal of the main purpose of schools is to turn children into good citizens and workers, rather than to benefit them as individuals cannot be supported."
