        "It is noticed that there is  a reduction in the number of individuals visiting art galleries in certain nations. This essay will discuss numerous reasons for the decline and various solutions to overcome these problem.",
        "One of the prominent reason is that art is not exclusive any longer. In other words, during earlier time art galleries is the only mediun through which artist can publish their work. But now with the advancement in technology offers a social media platform to the artist through which they can show their talent. Another reason is the high prices charged by art galleries from the individuals. It is really hard for the beginners to arrange such a huge amount to present their work. So most of the art work is exhibited through private exhibition. Moreover, due to hectic life many pupil do not have enough time to visit art galleries and others loss interest and find it as wastage of time.",
        "One of the viable solution is to develop synergy between artist and art galleries. Artist should be allowed to demonstrate his work in art galleries by organizing exhibitions at low price rates. So that it offers a stage to show their talents. In addition, government should also have to create various job opportunities in this field. By doing so large number of people get employment and this will attract them towards art galleries.",
        "In conclusion, lack of interest and availibility of social media source create a decline in population visiting art galleries however by developing synchronization between artist and art galleries one can remedify the difficulties."
