        "There is no denying that since the pandemic started, work conditions change all around the world. Many people can be in favour or against  working from home. Furthermore, the advantages of working from home have far outweigh the disadvantages, and in this ,essay I will support this view with arguments in the following paragraphs.",
        "To start with the advantages of working from home there are infinite reasons why this is an effective way of working. First of all, you don't have to commute because this is an incredible waste of time and money. Second of all, you can create an enjoy full environment from your own house. For example, setting up some candles, some relaxing music, and  is the perfect time to spend out with your pet. Third of all, your schedule can be even more flexible than it was before. From my perspective, working from home is an excellent alternative to being more focused on the job that you are working on.",
        "On the other hand, some people claim that working from home has huge disadvantages in their lives. Not only the feeling of being lonely is the first reason but also the feeling of being trapped in their apartment or house. Which eventually can cause depression in these individuals. Clearly for them, going out and spending time with their peers is key in their lives.",
        "In this essay I argued that working from home has many benefits in people's lives, that is an incredible way of being more efficient and focused on your work. Personally, working from home has more advantages than disadvantages."
