        "In recent times, more and more people are getting involved in free community services. It has been suggested that such services, including working in a charity, improving the environment or educating younger children on sports, should be made a compulsory part of high school. This essay will argue why such programs should be encouraged, but not made compulsory.",
        "Proponents of making unpaid community services compulsory argue that it compels people to give back to the society. They think enforcement of such will help cultivate responsibility in students, who are the leaders of tomorrow. I think that the fact that this is not a voluntary service will make it less effective. For instance, a lot of high school students feel they are being are being maltreated when coerced into social services, like cleaning the environment. Thus, the hesitancy and complaints accompanying these activities are not likely to perpetuate thee virtues intended to be learnt. Hence, the hope of instilling responsibility is being put forward in support of compelling students.",
        "However, I strongly recommend the rendition of voluntary unpaid services to the individuals in the society as part of high school due to the following reasons. Firstly, it is more effective. Generally, people do things better when it emanates from their will, because it brings satisfaction after completion. For example, when children are allowed to do their assignments by motivation rather than coercion, they complete it faster and are happier afterwards. Secondly, the virtues learnt are going to stay with the individual. It thus cultivates a commitment to their environment, more so, because it was a product of their choice. So, rather than force it on them, they should be made to see reasons for participation. I like going for medical outreaches to villages, for example, because I developed the attribute in high school encouraged by my teachers\u2019 advice. Thus, community services should be encouraged to allow for more effectiveness and perpetuality.",
        "In conclusion, this essay argued that high school programs like unpaid community services should not be made compulsory. In my opinion, while encouraging such programs, motivating the students will have a lasting effect."
