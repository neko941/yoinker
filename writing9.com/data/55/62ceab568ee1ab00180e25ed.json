        "Schools and universities offer a variety of courses to the students. According, to the statement ,girls are inclined towards choosing arts while boys science. In this ,essay we will discuss the reasons for this trend and my opinion regarding this phenomenon.",
        "Choosing arts by girls and science by boys may have many reasons and  I don't completely agree with the statement rather the statement must have been more girls choose art rather than generalising. I have seen many girls as doctors or in the other dominions in the fraternity of science. But as of now, let's see the reasons behind girls choosing art. one of the reasons may be  because women naturally are inclined towards arts, crafts, cooking and beautification kind of things.  And, another reason may be because it will take quite a time to get settled professionally in the field of science. Boys by their innate nature are more inclined toward science from their childhood. For example, girls during childhood pretend play and boys are more interested in the mechanics of a toy.",
        "In my ,opinion this tendency need not be changed because it is their personal choice and it is according to their taste. If the student chooses of his/her free will it need not be changed. But, the sad part is sometimes girls choose the courses according to their parent's wish because of their financial ability and they want girls to settle down faster. This is what I disagree with and then, Yes, the trend should be changed.",
        "In conclusion, though I don't agree with the statement totally, the picking of courses by girls and boys need not be changed if it is their personal choice and until they are under some pressure."
