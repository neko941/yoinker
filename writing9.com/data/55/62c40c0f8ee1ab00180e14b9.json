        "The number of people migrating from rural areas to cities could look for high-salary jobs however the impacts of local migration are both good and bad points. My standpoint on this issue is more disadvantages than advantages.",
        "One of the most common advantages of settling down in urban areas from the countryside is a lot of types of job requirements. As far as the number of job opportunities, people who live in cities can easily find gainful employment compared to rural areas. Take for example Tokyo, the capital of Japan, the population has increased over 50 years because there are a variety of job descriptions. The increasing trends in population in Tokyo since the 1970s could result in the recent economic growth of Tokyo.",
        "On the other hand, this trend would lead to a more advanced aging society in rural areas. As far as the Japanese countryside, it is common younger generation moves to metropolitan areas to start their job after graduation from high schools or universities. Once younger people could play a valuable key role in local communities such as leaders of manual labour and traditional festivals, but nowadays lack of manpower could cause a diminished local society.",
        "Hence, the disadvantages of migration into urban cities outweigh than advantages, because small villages would die in the future caused to increasing population outflow. These kinds of unbalanced population problems are getting a recent global issue. Not only local residents but also the government should solve this problem together and take an action immediately."
