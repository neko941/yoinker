Some people claim that humans should stop burning fossil fuels and use only alternative energy resources, such as wind and solar power. Others say that oil, gas and coal are essential for many industries, and not using them will lead to economic collapse.\nWhat is your opinion?\nSupport your point of view with relevant examples.",

        "Last couple of decades, climate change is the biggest issue. In my opinion, problem arises because of burning of the fossil fuel. We discuss in detail, in the later part.",
        "Coming to usage of Coal. They are the primary source of power to the industries. In this case replacement of them, may not be an easier process. This process involved lot of investment and time. For example, Industrial machines runs on it and need to replace them if we are going to stop the usage, which is highly impossible. Regarding the gas, Most of the families, across the globe, use it for their cooking. Shifting from it may not be possible. For instance, We can use alternate source for cooking, but replacement material can't be provided to all of them.",
        "Let's see the alternative for the above. Firstly, Wind Power, The source of energy is air and mountains or hilly area's are rich in that. For example, if we use this as a alternative source in those places, then amount of power generated not only sufficient for household but also for public usage like street lights. Another is solar power, we can use this, in high temperature areas.  For a sample, if we are going to invest in India, which is rich in sun light, then it can fullfil the energy requirement for daily need and to most of the factories.",
        "In Conclusion, Each has it's own advantages and disadvantages. Considering the environment, it's better for us and next generation, to go for free source of energy."
