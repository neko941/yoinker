        "Nowadays, we live in a world where crimes are rampant. It is so common that some people are not surprised anymore. The moment we turn on our TVs, we are greeted by the news saying that juvenile delinquency is happening throughout the world. As painful as it sounds, it is a truth that we could not easily disregard.",
        "People are argued to have divided opinions on this subject matter. Some would say that these teenagers deserve a second chance in life and instead of punishing them, it is better to show them compassion so they could learn from their mistakes. Meanwhile, other people would say that they deserve to receive adult punishment as long as they are proven to be guilty so they could reflect on how horrendous their committed acts are.",
        "In my honest opinion, minors who commit crimes should be punished as what would an adult receive. Even though they are under age, they are still capable of committing major crimes such as murder, kidnapping and arson. For me, my sympathy goes to the victims of their vicious acts and that is why I fully support giving them the rightful retribution. A crime is a crime and no one would ever understand the pain of the offended. It could be so huge that would even change their lives entirely and some people will take a lifetime to recover. Minor offenders should learn their lessons the hard way and repent for their sins."
