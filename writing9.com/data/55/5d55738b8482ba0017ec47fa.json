        "here is no doubt that there are people who are born with natural talents, whether the ability is in fields of science, art or their interests. This makes us think that having an inborn ability is the most vital factor in fulfilling one\u2019s dream. In the meantime, some people assert that success is derived from working up to their best. In my opinion, acquired effort is more essential when it comes to one\u2019s success for various reasons.",
        "First and foremost, gifts could be ruthlessly wasted without hard work. It is clear that people with these abilities have more benefits than those not. Accomplishing a task or a mission is much easier for them because they have an inherited ability. However, if the gifted do not exert strenuous effort to develop their ability, they will become like ust, being useless. To elaborate, people who have excellent skills to play the violin not be able to enhance their skills if they don\u2019t practice. The violinist ultimately lost her talent, leaving her no choice but to give up playing it. Thus, the talent itself will become meaningless, declining endlessly.",
        "In addition, pouring hard effort allows people to reach a new summit of success. In other words one who train and practice hard will definitely be more successful than those who don\u2019t. Also, people can possess an expedient status with hard work despite the lack of natural capability. It is reflected to a more prestigious fulfillment and recognition for people who have passion, patience, and endurance, creating a synergy effect. Ultimately, people with both natural ability and strenuous efforts can become the most influential personalities.",
        "To summarize, there are numerous factors we must consider to obtain the most desirable achievement. However, I believe that what truly determines the reason of our favourable outcome is the persistent hard efforts. Without it, natural talent just vanishes into the air. Hence, the gifted should really endeavor to perfect their ability, but people with less talents should not be discouraged and feel less confident because anyone who put in all their efforts can reach the peak."
