        "To overcome the problems associated with the railways, It is suggested that the Governments should all allocate more budget for developing rail lines  compared to roads, and  I completely agree with this idea for some reasons.",
        "I believe that investing more on railways is beneficial in several ways. Firstly, travelling by train is much safer, less time consuming, cheaper and over all environments friendly. For example, my country  India, having a huge  population  of poor and middle class  people, and massive traffic congestion problems, highly rely on its  railway system to facilitate its dwellers .However , if the same proportion of people had  travelled  by roads , governments would  need approximately  five times  wider roads.",
        "Secondly, in developing countries like India ,where railways are entirely government undertaking, spending higher in this sector will not only generate more revenue, but also help  the state  to facilitate more people by expanding the  rail networks . Lastly , the cost of developing railway tracks is quite high, and this is even higher for making special tracks for bullet trains.These tracks help in making rail travelling safer, faster and reliable.  However, overlooking them could be a big hindrance in developing the most efficient railway transport system.",
        "To conclude, I believe that investing higher does not mean that the government is going to neglect the progress of roads.  Keeping in view the vast benefits, I believe that  government should  assign more funds for  the proper functions of railways."
