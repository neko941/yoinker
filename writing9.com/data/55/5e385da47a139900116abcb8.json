        "Some persons believe that only a big amount of money can bring happiness in life. This essay will first discuss that a huge capital makes human happy by freeing them, followed with a discussion that doing a person's favorite job makes him joyful also.",
        "It is used to say that a cash makes man over the moon and this essay will show that a source of this joyfulness is a fund's provided freedom. Huge capital can help a person to drop bounds of necessity of a work and a daily home routine, because you don't need a job if you have money to pay personal to maintain your household tidy. As a result, a cash hugely increase an amount of time that a person can use how he would consider right. For example, The Oxford University's recent research showed that a human spends at least a half of his life doing his job and daily house chores.",
        "Not only a capital provided happiness can bring you on cloud nine, but also doing a job you like will make a man happy in the way of realising his importance to society and his family. Almost all human feel joyful when they have notable achievements in their work or research project and what is more, a huge amount of scientists work all their life just for an approval of their deeds in science. For instance, recent research of the Cambridge University showed that almost a half of their scientists dream not about money, but about receiving the Noble Prize Award for their accomplishments.",
        "In conclusion, some would say that to be over the moon you must have a huge load of money. This essay first discussed that cash can give happiness to a person with providing extra free time, followed with discussion that a person could become happy just by recognition of their deeds in various fields."
