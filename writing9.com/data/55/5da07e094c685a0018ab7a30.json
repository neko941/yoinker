        "Climate change has become a worrisome aspect of everyone present in the earth. We cannot remain complicit with the drastic change of climate, as it would lead to unimaginable repercussions. Therefore, I certainly disagree with the notion that one should care less about the worsening trend of climate change. This essay will discuss about the various ideas by which climate change can be impeded, thereby saving this earth.",
        "To begin with, the heat sinks of the earth which are Arctic and Antarctic regions have already sounded alarm bells 4 decades ago, by massive melting of ice caps. The reasons are simple, the temperature of the earth has been risen beyond 4 degrees, resulting in the increase of ocean level as well as the decline in the level of ice sheets. It is definitely possible to undo this damage by reducing the emission of carbon footprint in the atmosphere. Furthermore, this hegemonic carbon comes majorly from the fossil fuels which constitute a lion\u2019s share in heating the surface temperature of the earth. If we move towards using bio fuel sources like bio plants or Jetropa there would not be much carbon content in our atmosphere, thereby the surface temperature of the earth begins to reduce and so the heat sink regions can be protected from the global warming meltdown.",
        "It is definitely not a Sisyphean task to accomplish, as one of the country has already commenced an approach on carbon sequestration. Nevertheless, the industries in France have begun to collect their emitted carbon gases and arrest them beneath the surface of the earth to convert the gases into diamonds. However, it takes several years to convert the carbon content to diamond. In addition to that, nuclear power plants constitute the next higher emission of carbon to our environment. The harmful isotopes increase the global heat multi-fold than the fossil fuels. Therefore, we need to put a solid full stop to nuclear power plants and their submarines which emit an immeasurable amount of carbon to our environment and to our oceans. Finally, our trees are the natural saviour in preserving the earth\u2019s temperature. Had there been no massive felling of trees, there would be no global warming.",
        "To recapitulate, our earth is the only wonderful planet in our universe that supports human, animal and aquatic life to live in harmony. Instead of exploring various planetary missions across the universe to determine whether human life is possible, it would be better if we preserve this earth from falling into a trap of global warming and an irrevocable climate change."
