        "it us true that exrcice is the key to health but mean while some people feel that having a balanced diet is more important . As per my opinion both are equally important in our daily life .",
        "In this morder era people are becoming more lazier beacause most of time people are sitting and not doing much of phycial work so  people are becoming phycialy unhealtier  . An indivial should inculde exercice  in their day to day life to keep them phycially and mentally strong  . The person who do exercice  has a different personality  as compared to the one who does  not do any activity . Thier are variour exercice which an individual   can perform to keep them fit for example morning walk , yoga , meditation. By performing execice regurlary   our blood pressure , body weight remains balanced    and  it also  refreshes our mind .",
        "Probing ahead ,    by doing exercice  it is very important to take a balanced diet also then only exercice will work properly and will effect our body . For instance if an individual  is doing exercice to  loss  his or her weight  then the person should also include a proper amount of  balanced food   in daily routine then only exercice will work on thier body  . Further more , the person should take proper number of calories and should burn the extra calories   depending on the height and weight .",
        "To sum up ,it can be said that both balance diet and exercice is important in  daily life to have a healty body ."
