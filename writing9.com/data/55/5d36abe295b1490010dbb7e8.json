        "Smoking is prohibited in most areas of the nation,because it affect public which lead to  cancer.If smokers want to smoke have to leave building premises due to environmental issues.I firmly agree with both the statement .",
        "Many countries have started banning public smoking.When an individual smoke in a public place ,it is widely affecting the smoker as well as the individual who is near to that person.This cause serious issue on the person's breathing system .Eventhough the person near to the smoker do not smoke when they try to breath the oxygen ,the smoke get into his lungs and cause serious health problems  which ends up in cancer.For example,as per the report of leicester university,Non-smokers are dying more than the smokers in most part of the countries.",
        "Building authorities have started prohibiting the smokers in thier areas due to pollution.when an individual smoke ,large amount of stag is been formed  which condaminating the fresh air and lead to pollution.And this compleltly affect on theenvironment.As a result ,this pollution tune the climate change and ends up in disaster.For instance, In Ontario most condominiums  have been strictly enforcing on people who smoke within the building becuase it is widely effecting the weather. so condominiums have a smoking zone .if anyone tried to smoke outside the smoking zone or within 500 meters to the building will be fined  $4000.",
        "To sum up,I firmly accept the statement that most countries have prohibited smoking in common places because of human health.As well as it is completly right to those people who want to smoke have to leave the premises.However,If someone tried to do so,will be penalised."
