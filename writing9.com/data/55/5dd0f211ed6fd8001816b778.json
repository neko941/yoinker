        "Most people argue that leisure time of children should be only spent with their parents, others advocate that this situation brings negative influence on children and is not necessary. This essay will discuss why spending more time with family has a negative impact on children and also discuss the benefits of spending free time with parents helps to become a better person.",
        "Spending free hours with parents often gives children an opportunity to seek answers to the questions that they are affraid to ask their teachers. This bonding allows them to free learn everything from decision making to empanthy their family has to offer, such times charges them with love and effection received from their mother and father and prepares them for the world. However, if the family is itself a disturb one, it becomes detrimental for a child. For example, lately there has been a rise in divorce rate and due to this many children are juggling their life through abuses and disappointment. Thus, witnessing the trend children should not spend most of their time with their parents.",
        "Time spend with parents often is knowledgable however it has its own side effects. This is because children become too much depended on their parents, they tend to become indecisive in most of the other matters in their life. This situation is not harmful while they are young, it gets damaging when they grow up. Secondly, living the leisure time with family led children to supress their feelings and they tend to cause harm other, for instances, we see many cases of gun shooting in school from children coming from a very prestigious family because they have supression. Therefore, I firmly believe that children should spend their quality time with their friends, or in the activity they love doing rather than spending it with family.",
        "In conclusion, It is believed by many that child should spend their most time with their mom and dad thought others feel that it is unrequired. In my opinion, I believe that free time of child is for their own growth and they should spend it with their peer, friends or they should do some extra activity, rather than spending it with parents which would given them some ill effect on their brain."
