        "Peope have different ideas about how salaries should be paid. Some people believe that salaries should be paid significantly high, while some may argue that government shoud create a certain level for salaries which I think I would agree with to balance society and lives.",
        "There are several reasons for people who support to pay extremely high salary. Firstly by paying high salary, the workers would work dramatically hard. They may put all of their effort at work as they belive all of their hard work will be paid off. Those emplyees have more money to support their families, such as improve their children education or treat illness in the good hospitals. Secondly, the government will have benefit from taxes that contributed from those high incomes. Taxes from these workers would be invested back in some public needs such as infrastructure or hospital improvement. As as result, both the workers and governments are benefited.",
        "However, some people may argue that a certain level of salary payment should be required for the aim of social and private balances. If people put all of their energy at work they can not balane their work and live effectively. They therefore can not work productively when they usally have to overwork to get higher salaries. In addition, people who are usually working hard, they normally have very little time for their families. Many couples have to divorde as they have not enough time to care about each other. The childrent of these workers may not meet their parents frequently and thus they lose their communicate with family and start to be addicted to some drugs or game online. If it occurs, it will be a threat to our society. Therefore, a certain amount of money payment needs to be examined seriously to protect our society.",
        "In conclusion, very high salaries can help encourage people to work harder to support their families and contribute to national budget. However, a centain level of payment needs to be set up to ensure people banlance their work and live effectively."
