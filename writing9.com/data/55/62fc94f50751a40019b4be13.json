        "Nowadays, English is widely used to communicate and share information. There are many institutes teaching the language around the world. Studying English with native speakers is often preferable.",
        "The advantage of learning with a native is the mother-tongue. The English native educators have been living in their own country for a period of time; they have developed their abilities using their language as well as natural speaking. Generally, many sentences are grammatically correct, but they are ambiguous in meaning and sound abnormal. Thus, native speakers try to avoid using them. Furthermore, language is essentially related to culture. The English people understand the language effectively and know it like the back of their hand with their literature and society. They can use idioms, phrasal verbs, and expressions correctly and properly.",
        "On the other hand, the instructors who are non-native English speakers occasionally acknowledge the specific difficulty, and have experienced the challenges of learning English.",
        "Therefore, they can interpret and express the meaning of the language clearly and proficiently. In addition, some students, especially at the beginner level, become more confident and comfortable when they study with teachers who are in the same country and culture. Besides, hiring native speakers as educators is more expensive than employing non-native; If students are in developing countries, only the tycoons can study with people who use English as their primary language.",
        "In conclusion, learning English with native speakers frequently proves to be superior. However, They probably do not understand their students due to the difference in cultures. It also consumes more funds than learning with non-native."
