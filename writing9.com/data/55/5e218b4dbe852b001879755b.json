        "Authorities of several nations are of the opinion that economic advancement should be their most crucial objective, while some opine that progress in other sectors are also of utmost necessity. In my opinion, economic improvement is of vital importance and more crucial than other sectors as it is the foundation and bed rock of every country.",
        "On the one hand, advancement in the economic sector translates to a proportionate improvement in finances and per capital income. This literarily means that, there will be more money in circulation and hence people can afford to pay for their basic needs. For  instance, the Chinese\u2019s government decision to strengthen their finance sector had an immediate effect on the populace as more billionaire were produced in a short time interval than ever recorded in history. This show how vital the economic sector is if supported by the government.",
        "On the other hand, the improvements of other sectors of a nation can improve the life expectancy of the citizens. This is also vital as the general medical condition of the country is a major determinant of the active workforce hence her entire strength. An article published by the International Medical Council clearly noted that the well-being of a nation is more important than money. This clearly indicated that, the health of a country should be prioritised. Furthermore, the improvement of the agricultural sector can provide food, clothing and even jobs for the teeming youth.",
        "In conclusion, although other sectors of a nation should not be completely neglected, I am of the opinion that economic progress of a country is of utmost necessity and should be given priority as it indirectly affects other areas of the nation."
