        "As the development of commercial, more and more small regional shops have to \"quit stage\" because the preference of customers is changing: buy foods and other items on large shopping malls. I believe that there will have a different impact on a different subject which are shopping centres and small shops.",
        "The small stores usually provide a convenient avenue for those who intend to save their time because it is located the centre or outside of community at most. While the price, which might be a significant factor affecting customers, is relatively higher than that of a supermarket. For those running a small shop, it does not have any advantages because their market share is depleting and the decreasing amount of shops is not friendly to those want to save their time and inconvenient to move, including senior people.",
        "By contrast, as the construction of a series of shopping malls, it is likely to provide us with a lower price, fresh items such as fruits and higher quality. Big grocery often has a preferable contract with a supplier at a low price because of the massive amount of purchasing. A fresh chain also usually is used for transmission and storage. For example, they keep their vegetables at a low temperature and optimal humidity. They often have more harsh regulations and rules to supervisor their products to maintain their quality. It provides us with more choice and a product with lower price and acceptable quality. This is not only good news for the customer who wants to seek a high-grade product, but also promote the economical between the manufacturers and customers. They are also able to analyse the data obtained from customers to resolve the trend of each product.",
        "In conclusion, these advantages of the phenomenon are outweighed than that of short-comings. This exerts a positive social impact to increase GDP although there is some negative influence on shop owner."
