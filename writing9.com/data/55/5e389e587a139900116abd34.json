        "In our modern time vehicles are considered the most used method of going from one place to the other, whether to travel, go to work or go to school, but using this method could be dangerous, accidents are prone to occur if safety measures are not taken into consideration, speed limits could be one of those measures, but other regulations and procedures should be taken into consideration to limit or prevent accidents to happen at all.",
        "Speed limit could be one of the most effective ways to reduce accident rates, since it would be much easier to stop the car in case of any plausible emergencies, such as a deer suddenly crossing the road or a preceding vehicle that might unanticipatedly stop because of a flat tire or a malfunction, however using speed limits could lead to minor traffic jams, especially in case speed limit rules are enacted in areas which do not require such relatively low limits, as in highways for example. Moreover, using those type of measures, could not be sufficient to reduce accidents, other factors should be taken into account to improve road safety.",
        "Training drivers, ensuring that they are that their driving skills is up to par, as well as testing their road signage knowledge levels, before any of them could receive his driver\u2019s license, also the government should make sure that all road signage are allocated in their designated locations and supervise the roads condition, in order to diminish accidents because of poor streets conditions, because road safety could be compromised because of various factors that are out of control of the driver, such as an unnotified ramp or a deep crack in the asphalt, even if the vehicle is within the speed limit accident could occur because of below par road conditions.",
        "To conclude, I would consider setting speed limits as one of the methods that could be used to maintain road safety, but other aspects should be accounted for."
