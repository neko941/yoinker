        "The hardest truth to accept is the fact that \u2018as we age, life becomes more difficult\u2019. When we\u2019re young, we often live in an illusion that we can easily control everything. But the reality is that everything has its limit, including life.",
        "Sooner or later, in life, we reach a point where we have to learn to accept things as they are - instead of controlling or trying to manipulate them in our favour. It\u2019s a \u2018wake up call\u2019 to remind us that life is not pre-planned.",
        "As we get older, probably the very first thing that we learn is to let go of some of our dearest friends or loved ones. Some get married, some get busy with work, or some move away. No matter what the situation is, some people in our life do drift apart as time goes by.",
        "Aging is another big factor that somehow makes our life even more difficult. While aging is inevitable, most of us somewhere believe that we still have not lived enough or have not gained enough experiences as per our rapidly increasing age. Some of us even regret going through a wrong career path or taking the wrong decision that impacted their entire life because of that single decision.",
        "We often get caught up in work and other life situations to the extent that we even forget about our parents. But life hits us hard when we realize that our parents are also aging like us. Watching them get older or dying in front of your eyes due to a certain medical condition is indeed one of the most difficult situations in life.",
        "At a certain phase of our life, we\u2019ll even start facing different body-related issues like lack of energy and less enthusiasm at work. Moreover, our health graph begins to drop with age. While there are many advanced technologies and devices to help us upkeep our healthy lifestyle, there comes a time when we do have to rely on others for medical attention or care.",
        "This means no matter how hard we try to achieve everything in life, there will be some things or desires that will remain as dreams or even fade away with age. All we can do is just to learn to live our life to the fullest with whatever we already have - since we are always unaware of what\u2019s in store for us at every turn of life."
