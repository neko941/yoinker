        "Recently, electronic books are being chosen over ordinary books. However, while some presume it has many demerits, from my perspective, it would be overtaken by a greater number of merits. The following lines will discuss both views with regard to libraries as well as both kinds reach.",
        "First and foremost, one of the greatest drawbacks of preferring e-books over physical form of books is the abandonment of libraries. To illustrate, opting e-books would cause people to abandon libraries which could force it to vanish ultimately. Consequently, ordinary book stores have suffered majorly in the recent few years as they no longer achieve the number of sales required to stay operational. For example, nearly 40 percent of book stores in London were forced out of business in the last five years, according to The Time magazine, contributed to the widespread of e-books. Thus, a decrease in the number of readers would appear in the horizon.",
        "On the other hand, I believe that the widespread of e-books is extremely beneficial. To clarify, with the increasing number of people holding smart phones and the exotic world wide web, it became intensely easier for people to have e-books on their mobile phones that they carry all the time, everywhere, rather than holding heavy books as they move around which would exaggerate the number of readers in particular. For instance, a statistical report regarding Harry Potter book series has indicated that the series were downloaded more than ten million times which is an immense number that no hard-copy book has ever sold. Hence, the influence of e-books could tremendously exceed traditional form of books as well as the number of readers.",
        "By way of conclusion, if the side-effects of opting e-books over ordinary books may affect book stores negatively, the spread of e-books is considered to be revolutionary because of its benefits and advantages."
