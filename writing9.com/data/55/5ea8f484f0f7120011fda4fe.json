        "It has been observed that there is a significant decline in the health of people as compared to past. This is mainly because people are unable to perform physical activities. There are number of solutions that should be implemented by the government to improve the health and fitness of people.",
        "The reason why most of the people are not fit as they use to be in the past is due to their inability to perform physical activities. That is to say, nowadays, people do not have enough time to take care of their physical health because they work longer hours to support the basic needs of their family. On the top of that, they work in a pressure environment, which makes them tired and inactive. As a result, upon returning home, they prefer watching television to relax themselves, instead of playing actual outdoor games.",
        "The most effective solution to unhealthy lifestyle is raising awareness among the people. One way to tackle this is that government should organise health awareness campaigns whose main aim is to educate people about the health issues faced by unwell people. This solution would hopefully encourage people to stay away from health diseases by opting the habit of healthy eating along with performing outdoor activities such as running, jogging and yoga.",
        "To conclude, I agree that in the modern world people are not active as they were in the past due to their busy work schedule. However, government efforts, such as, raising awareness about the health issues can encourage people to follow healthy lifestyle."
