        "It is essential for children to distinguish the difference between right and wrong. Although physical punishment may influence their behavior, I believe that parenting and schooling are more important and effective.",
        "Harsh punishment may be helpful in a short period, but it will exert negative impact on children\u2019s mind. For example, corporal punishment may deter children when they behave wrongly or badly right away, it also creates fear and makes the learning environment scared. This will lead to distraction of children\u2019s study and a bad academic performance. Children may lack confidence in themselves because they may feel interior than others, which will negatively influence not only their interpersonal skills but also their social skills. Due to these disadvantages, children are likely to find it to develop their career and achieve their possible potential in their later life.",
        "However, with well-organized education and appropriate punishment that are provided by parents and teachers, children may learn their lessons more effectively. Firstly, teachers can shorten students\u2019 breaktime and broadcast some educational documentaries and films in class, as children may be interested in watching movies than having a lecture. Secondly, parents can also teach their children how to tell right from wrong through playing games or taking part in numerous afterschool activities. For instance, there are several campaigns about how to become a good member of society on weekends, which will be beneficial to their development of body and mind. Moreover, they can also meet new friends who will become their mirror and they can learn from each other.",
        "In my opinion, physical punishment is not necessary to help children learn the difference between right and wrong, while other alternative punishment and education should be promoted to combine with their study at an early age."
