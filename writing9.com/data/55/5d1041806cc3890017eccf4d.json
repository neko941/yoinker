        "Many environmental issues associated with petrol including pollution and traffic congestion are increasingly being witnessed these days. Whether or not increasing the price of petrol is the most effective method to tackle those problems has become a hot topic of discussion in the society. Personally, I slightly disagree with this because I perceive there are more various methods could be implemented which would have huge effects on these problems.",
        "Manipulating the cost of fuel plays a crucial role in fighting against pollution and growing traffic as more people will be encouraged to take the public transportation to commute which can lead to less vehicles on the street and less gas emission. For example, a recent research conducted in Brazil has revealed that their capital city have better air quality now due to the amount of vehicles has been controlled by the authority. As can be seen, it is significant to raise the price of fuel to control the growing amount of vehicles.",
        "Additionally, there are a wide range of effective ways to cope with these problems. To illustrate, traditional fossil fuels need to be replaced by renewable resources gradually such as solar power and wind power. In addition, the government can invest more funds to upgrade the infrastructure such as metros and buses because people tend to opt public transportations if it\u2019s affordable and punctual. Along with this, people need to be more aware of eco-friendly so it is necessary to raise public awareness of environmental protection.",
        "To sum up, increasing the price of petrol is not the only way to tackle these problems and I\u2019m inclined to say that all those methods are critical to maintain sustainable development in the future"
