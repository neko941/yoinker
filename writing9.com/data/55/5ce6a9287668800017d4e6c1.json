        "In many nations, both developed and developing countries, marriages are pivotal moments for individuals and societies. Therefore, it is worthy to question whether financial or sentimental reasons should lead the nuptial choice. In the following essay, I will consider both sides of this issue as well as give my opinion.",
        "On the one hand, it is considered by some that money-based unions benefit new couples since many communities are experiencing welfare uncertainty. In other words, the incumbencies of newly married people are greatly reduced when they can rely on solid founds. By instance, buying or renting an house and paying taxes or school fees for children are much less a burden for husband and wifes with secure assets. Taking Italy as an example, most recent research shows that in the last few decades nearly all Italians have married for love. As a result, most Italian families struggle to make a living and are overwhelmed by wealth problems.",
        "On the other hand, I would argue that love should be the only leading force for legal joinings. As described by writers and poets and experienced by many, it goes without saying that living with the beloved one brings happiness. By way of illustration, several serum hormonal analysis have demonstrated that couple in love have higher level of prolactin hormone if compared with the avarage of the population. Defined by scientists as the \"chemical of joy\", prolactin inhibits the level of cortisol also called \"the stress hormone\". This means that marring for love not only gives joy, but also reduce the stress and, consequently, might help to face the daily life challenges.",
        "In summary, both sides seem to have sound arguments. However, I am of the opinion that people should always marry for love."
