        "Having a big factory near the community area will have both  advantages and disadvantages, which also influence the environment of the community accordingly. Some people will favour the idea of having a large factory near the community while some will oppose this. As far as I am concerned, I will oppose this idea and I think this way for two reasons, which I will explore in this essay.",
        "As an initial point, I would like to say that, if there is any factory whether large or small, it will always create pollution both  air pollution and noise pollution. Pollution near the community area will put adverse effects on people's health as well. As a result,  various diseases can thrive in the society, such as, asthma, cough, nausea, skin disease and many more pollution-related diseases. I believe that, pollution is the biggest disadvantage of having a factory near the community area.  Secondly, there will be less availability of land near society, which can be utilised for parks or for the children playing ground. That land will now be used for factory purposes.",
        "Subsequently, while considering the advantages, I think the number of vacancies will increase for the people. Those who are living near to industry area, they can commute very easily to their office and will also save their time. Some people who are living very far from their work, they have to spend hours only in reaching to the office everyday. Such type of situation makes a person tired very easily. Hence, one can not easily give a hundred per cent time to their work and therefore, having an office near to living area is time-saving and  relaxing.",
        "In conclusion, I believe that building a large factory near the community is not a very great idea, as in my point of view it has more disadvantages than benefits. I prefer to have factories outside the community area because of the clean atmosphere  and the availability of more outer space for children to play."
