        "Nowadays, public libraries are loosing the popularity it had years ago due to the wide spread technology advancements. Easily available e-books and online reading material has completely minimized the need of having a public library. This essay will argue why spending time in the improvement of public library is a complete waste, with the booming internet technologies.",
        "Public Libraries are not easily replaceable as they keep are our heritage and culture alive. This is because these libraries are running from the ancient times and its also a good source for lending books for free. In addition to this, physical books keeps the reader engrossed and completely involved in reading without any distractions. Moreover, it does not affect the eye sight even after longer hours of reading. For example, according to a survey held in 2012, in India, 65% people prefer reading from physical books in comparison to e-books. Therefore, spending time on maintenance of public libraries is worth it.",
        "Despite, the few benefits that public libraries offer, the idea that the money and time should be spent on the maintenance of libraries is completely preposterous. In today's fast paced technology world, everything is available at the click of buttons. In other words, there's a wide range of e-books available on a variety of genres. Moreover, kindle device makes it even more easier for users to read books online without straining eyes and even at a cheaper rate. Furthermore, it is environment friendly too as it reduces paper wastage. For instance, in a recent survey, in Canada, it was found that for every 10 books replaced by e-books, one tree is saved. So, it is evident that internet and high-tech devices can substitute for the features available at a library that earlier looked irreplaceable.",
        "This essay argued that improvement in public libraries is unnecessary and its job is easily replaceable by the latest internet driven gadgets. In my opinion, latest cutting-edge technologies can completely replace the needs that were otherwise fulfilled by a public library."
