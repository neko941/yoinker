        "In the past decade, tourism has become increasingly popuplar among all countries, however many are of opinion that in order to protect indigenous culture, tourism should be forbidden. While other school of thought believes that, banning sightseer will have a profound impact and this cannot be avoided. This essay will discuss both sides of the argument and will draw a plausible conclusion.",
        "On the one hand, many tourists are influencing local communities when they visit their places. People from different countries wear their clothing as they normally do in their home country. In addition to that, they behave intimately in public places which has a negative impact on local communities. This not only, effecting their culture, but also influencing teenagers to behave that way. For example, individuals in Pondicherry, India is deeply influenced by French culture as many tourists visit this place every year. Therefore, these are the reasons why these sections of people want tourism to be banned.",
        "On the flip side, many are of opinion that banning tourism will have no advantages, because this will impact",
        "Gross Domestic Product of one's own country. If they implement ban on sightseer, many jobs will be lost in a country where the primary source of income is through tourism. For example, countries such as Srilanka, Indonesia, Thailand are dependant on tourism, if they are forbidden tourists, it will significantly impact their economy. In addition to that, one's own country's culture greatness, heritage and history cannot be known by other countries if they ban tourism.",
        "To conclude, many indigenous people are deeply influenced by tourists and it has adverse effects on local",
        "culture whereas banning them will have a profound impact on the economy. I personally believe that, the government should implement strict rules for people to protect local culture rather than completely banning them."
