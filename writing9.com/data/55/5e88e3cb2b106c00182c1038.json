        "The media has turned today\u2019s sportspeople into celebrities. As a result of this, nearly all companies producing sports goods have signed top athletes to promote their products. While athlete endorsements bring about a number of benefits to businesses, these can easily be offset by possible drawbacks.",
        "One of the biggest advantages of using top athletes to endorse sports products is that it helps businesses to build brand equity. When a company has positive brand equity, customers willingly pay a high price for its products, even though they can get the same quality from a brand for less. When Nike sponsored a basketball legend Michael Jordan, introducing Air-Jorden, not many had expected it would become a multi-billion dollar project. In addition, yet another benefit of celebrity endorsements is what is known as \u2018ad recall\u2019. That is, when people see their favorite player in an advertisement, it tends to stick in their memory for long.",
        "Having said that, there are certain risks associated with celebrity endorsements. One such danger is when sometimes famous athletes can overshadow the products that are being promoted. Consumers may focus on the celebrity, paying almost no attention to the product itself. This can particularly be unavoidable when these celebrities are overexposed, meaning the same athlete promoting a similar line of products. But the most damaging blow can occur when these top athletes make morally wrong choices, hurting their own public image. A clear illustration of this is Tiger Woods, a famous golf player. His infidelity with a number of women adversely affected the sales of Nike products he was promoting at the time.",
        "In conclusion, while most athletes can help businesses build strong brand awareness, there is a danger of taking the focus away from the product itself. Even worse, socially unacceptable behavior from these sportspeople could do serious financial damage to the company. In my opinion, given the sheer magnitude of these risks, athlete endorsements can rarely be justified."
