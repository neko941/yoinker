        "Many students fail in exams during their school days but they become successful in their career and other aspects of life. The fundamental cause of this situation is their lack of interest in some subjects. However, achieving academic goal is not the only step to success. One has to be hardworking in any field they choose and also should have a motivating factor to achieve an aim.",
        "Firstly, pupils are distracted to watch cartoons or play games while studying at home. Hence, co-curricular activities amuse them more than that of studying educational subjects. Also, many of them fantasize to be an artist or tend to fall for other creative jobs and dream it as a career option. For instance, I was poor in mathematics and science. Repeatedly, I scored below average marks, shaming myself and my family. However, I am a successful music teacher as singing and playing piano was my forte since I was a child. This makes it clear that boredom in relation to studies often lead some students to opt for other ambition.",
        "Secondly, family members cannot impose education on any children. Youngsters have a right to desire something that is admirable to them. Therefore, elders should guide and inspire juveniles in every decision they make. Finally, it is the duty of the students to be diligent and enthusiastic about achieving their target. Thus, hard work is the most salient component which is required to be a successful person.",
        "To conclude, failure is the stepping stone to victory and ergo, should be taken as a stimulation to reach the goal. Furthermore, one should chase for excellence by making all the possible efforts to be prosperous."
