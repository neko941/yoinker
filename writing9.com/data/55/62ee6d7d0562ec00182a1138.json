        "The role of medical care has become a major discussion in today's world as people's life has increased.Although some think that it is the responsibility of the government to improve the health of its citizens,others think that the individuals should take control of their physical conditions.This essay will discuss both the two sides and explain why I think it should be the individual liability to maintain one's health.",
        "The governments should display himself/herself actively the knowledge of health and how to take good care of healthiness throughout the remote areas where there is no health .For example, special tax incentives could be provided for people who meet the development goal set by them.Furthermore, the resource needed to implement its policy is already available to them. Another reason is that the heads of state should establish accurate rules and regulations about the improvement of good health through internet aircrafts like various websites.For instance,there are not many patients anymore because of the health information posts that appear online.And it's country can convert into a beautiful and developed one among the national enrollment lists.",
        "Eventhough the governments could offer encouraging plans ,the responsibility entirely lies with the indivituals.It must be more effective only if the indivituals can pay attention themselves with their interest to the governments' policies.It is their body and it\u2019s the best interest for them to improve the health.Individual\u2019s health requirement and preference are best known to them and cannot be categorized as a standard plan by any organization.For instance, people\u2019s preference and priority vary, some would need a strict diet control, whereas others might need physical activity or a nice place to walk.Since individual requirement and preferences varies it should be their responsibility to develop a healthy lifestyle.",
        "To conclude,in my opinion, the government can offer incentives, but cannot strictly enforce plans to improve everyone\u2019s health.It should completely be the individual\u2019s responsibility to improve their health.Moreover,the need and preference are best known only to them."
