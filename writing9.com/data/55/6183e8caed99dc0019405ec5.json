        "It is undeniable that entertainment and media have been an integral part of modern culture. People's lives are under the influence of news channels and social platforms. For example celebrities are closely monitored on a global platform. Criticisms have increased over the recent years. Consequently, this is development is detrimental to humans.",
        "The impact of broadcasts and social media including online platforms such as Facebook or Reddit can cause more harm than good. In some countries governments use these platforms to spread propaganda and gain votes during electoral campaigns. This is morally wrong, as no one should be deprived of access to correct, scientific facts. While it is true that such a scenario is considered extreme, it has already happened in modern China. Due to the funding of the central government into broadcasting companies and stations, the ruling party can spread misinformation by shedding light only on the topics of interest to the vast majority.",
        "Moreover, the daily life of citizens can also be affected through  misinformation about health and science. For example Americans can freely search for anything ranging from vaccines to essential oils.",
        "There is no restriction whatsoever and the non-filtered sources may cause casualties in the case of emergencies, where factual knowledge is required and not mere experiences that people post on Google or Facebook.",
        "Interestingly ,on the other hand, many would argue that news channels in this day and age as well as social media can provide people with educational knowledge and save many possible tragedies. The availability of the World Wide Web , also known as the 'Internet' has made a tremendous impact on a global platform. The accessibility of resources is now just a click away. The topics have no bounds and can be anything from biology to art, to astronomy!",
        "The vast quantity of resources that are available on the internet helps improve the quality of one's life. Employees can undergo online training and this is a major cost reduction for companies.  As companies continue to grow and expand, the need for highly skilled labour and expertise becomes crucial. In this context, news channels, as well as the Internet, can be advantageous as they provide unlimited and wide ranges of useful knowledge with credible sources.",
        "Personally, I firmly believe that while modern informatory outlets can provide useful resources and guidance, to millions of communities around the globe, they are also media for misinformation and political purposes. The importance of free speech is undeniably essential, the possibility of spreading false information cannot be forgotten and should be judged correctly."
