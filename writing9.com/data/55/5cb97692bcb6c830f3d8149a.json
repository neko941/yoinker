A significant amount of people think that in order to become a complete modern men academic studies has to be mandatory, excluding all other extra curricular activities. While others opine that they should have other things as well, such as  sport and exercise.",

Firstly, parents are the first persons to instill morals and ethics in younger lad's. Additionally,  by studying various subjects offers opportunity not only to learn various things that they enjoy or excel in but also thay can choose subjects which helps in their future aspects. Secondly, a wide range of people think that other activities should be removed from the day-to- day schedule. Consequently, students have ample amount of time to concentrate on trending subjects such as information technology. For instance, APJ Abdul kalam never wasted his time, instead he used that on performing research on missile technology.",
        "On the other hand, there are quiet a long people who think that spending some time on recreational activities will boost one's brain. Therefore, performance of the kids will be improved .For example, I used to read continuously with out taking any break, as a result frequently I fell sick  and after utilizing some time in jogging, my mind started feeling little relaxed which made me to concentrate well on my academics. Lastly, working through out the day on a single thing no matter what ever it is, will always bring the stress.",
        "To conclude,  education is the major thing that prepare children for the modern era and this can be acheived by managing the schedule, sport and exercises should also be included which keeps the lad's fit and help in bringing out the best from them."
