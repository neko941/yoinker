        "Dear Amy,",
        "I hope this letter finds you well. I am so incredibly sorry for not having been in touch recently. Life has been a bit hectic. I am writing this letter in reply to your previous letter asking for my ideas about the electric gadget.",
        "As you may still remember, I said that I was fascinated by the latest Sony speaker when it was released. Finally, after getting this year\u2019s bonus, I went to David Jones to purchase it. You can imagine how thrilled I am now.",
        "The Sony speaker really needs to buy. First of all, it can connect with two devices at the same time through BlueTooth, which is extremely convenient, so you don\u2019t need to switch manually when you would like to play via different devices. In addition, as the creators used the new technology to minimize the noise, the sound they play is quite clear and natural.",
        "I always browse and do research about electric gadgets. I believe that it is genuinely wealth to buy the new headphones which were produced by Sony as well. It has a noise cancelling function, which not only increases your concentration skills  but also helps you to keep a clear mind. As the Sony speaker is a little bit expensive, I think the Google speaker is another option for you.",
        "I hope my suggestions are useful for you. Drop me a line to tell me your ideas about several electric devices.",
        "Best wishes,",
