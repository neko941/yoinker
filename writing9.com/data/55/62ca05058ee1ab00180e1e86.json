        "Education plays a significant role in securing employment. Of the best ways to get a job, one should have completed a degree,  while others are of the view that experience and skills is more beneficial.",
        "On the one hand, completing college education will enhance an individual's obtaining a job in the future. This is due to the fact that, presenting a diploma or even a masters degree certificate  would considerably increase the chances of getting hired by gigantic companies . For example, applying for job requires the submission of curriculum vitaeor a resume, wherein qualifications and certifications are stated in that piece of paper. This would further help an employer decide that the applicant is best suited for the needed position. As a result, an employee would land a much rewarding job.",
        "On the other hand, some are of the belief that certain skills and experience is more important than getting a good job. This is because, experience will eventually take them success. In addition, with the proper amount of expertise in a certain aspect of life, one can see a brighter future. Furthermore, the acquisition of training and the keen interest to improve particular skills will substantially improve life. Celebrities, for instance, have become well-known due to their strategic expertise in their chosen fields. Much of them have not finalized their university education. However, they have been so adept , on improving their skills which has immensely affected their life.",
        "In conclusion, it is indeed of great significance to get a rewarding job by having a diploma.  However, I believe that, expertise and experience are also advantageous."
