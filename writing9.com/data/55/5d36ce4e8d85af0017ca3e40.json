        "In the current era, where majority of parents spare limited time for their pupil, consequently, effects the holistic development of youngminds as compared to the childrens of previous years. I vehemently agree with this statement as inadequate surveillance by parents towards their children education is the primary reason and lack of nutrients in diet, because of junk food is the secondary reason.",
        "The reasons behind this negative phenomenon is firstly, negligence in tracking the academic performance of the school goer by their guardians. It is because of the busy regime of the parents in respect to their occupation, it takes a large chunk of time away from children, consequently, no check is kept of the educational record of the youngster, thus, hampers their intellect. To exemplify, as per the survey conducted by Education department of Sydney, states that 73% of parents of Australia, barely get adeqaute amount of time to scrutinise the academic report of their children, which eventually, proves detrimental towards the education of children.",
        "In addition to this, imperfect diet given to children is another reason. As parents of recent time, have a lust for prepared meals from renonwed restaurants.Thus, because of which  ready made cuisines are served to children. Whereas, the food does not attain requisite amount of vitamins and minerals for holistic development of children. For example, an article published in CNX news, there is 67% of inclination towards junk food by masses as compared to a decade ago, because of which children of recent times are getting unhealthy.",
        "To conclude, it is to adhere with,  parents of current times are less concerned about their children as compared to the parents of the earlier periods."
