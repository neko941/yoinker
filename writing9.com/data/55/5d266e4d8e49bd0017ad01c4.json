        "Transporting fruits and vegetable using aeroplanes, in the countries where it is unavailable is very frequent in present context. This essay suggests that the primary benefits of this is that it is the fastest way available to transport those things, however, many developing countries could not afford this means of transportation and the people over there could not even get the required diet.",
        "The main advantages of using airplanes as a means of exporting fruits and vegetables is that it is the fastest medium present. The fruits and vegetables are usually perishable in nature and they have very short life, therefore it should be transported very quickly. Furthermore, the people in countries could enjoy these fruits as fresh as they can if they are transported before they get damaged. For instance, the climate of Canada is not suitable to grow many crops and it is very necessary for it to import those crops as fresh as they can.",
        "Despite this benefit, some countries in the world are even not able to get proper food due to their incapability to afford this transportation medium. Many developing nations nowadays rely upon these vegetables and fruits upon other countries and because they are not able to afford many planes and airports, they do not get the opportunity as their wealthy counterparts. For example, people in Sudan are even dying because they could not get proper food at the right time and the reason behind this is their helplessness to afford those air transport.",
        "In conclusion, it is very beneficial for the countries to use air traffic for the transportation of food from other nations, which they are unable to supply to their people. However, people of poor countries even die with malnutrition because of their inability to finance those mode of transportation."
