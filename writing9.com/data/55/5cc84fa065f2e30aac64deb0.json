        "In recent years, the proportion of senior citizens has been growing rapidly. While many people believe that this brings a positive effect, whilst others believe that it is a negative occurrence.  In this essay I will discuss both sides to the topic.",
        "Through senior citizens, society is able to hold on to the connections they had with the past. It is through them that we are able to learn, in detail, first hand accounts of past situations. As the population of elderly increase, then the younger generation will able to hold onto their links to the past. Through their grandparents, they have the ability to learn about their personal history rather then learning through textbooks. In short, society will be able to hold onto and form greater connections with the history of their ancestors.",
        "The rise of increasing lifespans have had negative effects on countries where this is happening. This is because, as people age they slowly loose the ability to earn a salary and instead depend on the government for pensions. As the percentage increases over the years, the dependency on tax payers increases simultaneously. This leads to higher tax rates, and shifts the money that could be used for education and infrastructure to providing pensions for the senior citizens. Hence why many people believe that the increasing percentage of old people as a negative.",
        "In conclusion, although people believe that through the elderly we can hold onto our links from the past, the financial aid they require could be better used for other things. Therefore, I believe that the growing elderly population has more negative effects on society."
