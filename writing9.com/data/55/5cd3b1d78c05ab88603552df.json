        "Although it is smetimes thought that countries benefit from few people who are paid wages in excess amount, some people believe monthly earnings should be regulated by the government and a minimum wage should be fixed. In my opinion, I consider that a country stands to gain a lot from the few individuals who earnn very huge salaries.",
        "On the one hand, those who are paid high amount of salaries are specialist of their different fields and contribute immersely to the economy of a country. This is to say that, they are well grounded with years of experience and deserve every ounce of money paid to them, of which the government eventually gains through the tax they pay.For instance, neurologist are quite few in each country, these sets of workers are paid large income on monthly basis, but at the country gains economically through the large percentage of tax they pay. In addition, high salary earners contribute intellectually to their country by educating the younger ones and giving advise to the leadership of their country.",
        "On the other hand,it is believed all workers the system should regulate salaries earned by it's people. Many workers earn very low income which can  barely sustain them and their families. If the top earners are placed on the same reange of in come with the common people, there will be a quick drive and response to minimum wage increase so it could benefit them as well. Furthermore, the huge salaries paid can be used to employ more workers and consequently there will be an increase in the tax. Increase in he numbers of employees for example,will mean more people paying tax and eventually an improvement in the economy of the country.",
        "In conclusion, although many people share different opinions, I think that the government should give people the liberty to earn what they deserve and have toiled for over the years."
