        "It is debatable whether individual people have any specific role in betterment of the environment, alongside with the large scale contributions from government and corporates. Some poeple say that a citizen alone cannot make a difference in entire ecology system where others opine that it is a combined effort from individuals, organizations, and government. This essay disagrees with the given statement by focusing on options how individuals can make a positive change in environment.",
        "It is true that government, along with big companies, play the major role in bringing out improvements of our environment. This is because they can afford the large scale investment which is essential in refinement of ecosystem. Most of the pollution to nurture have also occurred due to unplanned activities from government and industries as well. Therefore, they take it as part of corporate social responsibility to participate in environment projects. For example, a recent survey by Queen's University in early 2019 revealed that XYZ Tobacco Industry planted around 1 million  trees throughout the 96 countries in which they operate. Thus, the significant role of corporates and government in this regard is easily understood.",
        "Conversely, each individual has equally important role to carry out in order to protect the environment. Although we have limited resource to participate in this noble task accumulation of tiny efforts result in milestones. If we all are more conscious from our respective position, then hazardous events taking placing in our nature will fall to a great extent. For instancem a survey conducted by Indian government during July 2018 shows that air pollution in Delhi dropped down by 5% due to people's using environmentally friednly alternative fuel in their vehicle.",
        "In conclusion, both individuals and government as well as companies have supportive role to play in nurturing envionment. But it is the individual person who can change this world."
