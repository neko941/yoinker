        "In many countries, there is a large amount of difference between the people who earn the highest salary and the lowest salary in works these days. There are many public debates about that these pay gaps between the highest and lowest paid jobs should be reduced to have social balance among society.",
        "On the one hand, people who are highly skilled and talented in their professional workings should be rewarded with the highest amount of salary. Unless they get enough salary they deserve it will be more difficult to remain at the same job. High salaries are an incentive for the employees to work harder and attract to work under an unpleasant and dangerous situation. For instance, the Japanese electrical power company paid a significant amount of salaries to the employees working under dangerous conditions of nuclear radiation which can cause serious health.",
        "On the other hand, there are many people who earn the lowest wages because they have a lack of professional skills and experience. There is no way to improve their salaries without they upgrade their ability in their works. Most of the low paid jobs could be harder and the most unpleasant jobs which are no one interested to do. For example, daily earn workers from a construction site usually earn a very low amount of money although they are working in a tough situation.",
        "In conclusion, the pay rates to the employees should be considered based on their skills and experiences in their professionals. Paying high salaries can encourage all the workers but there is no certain way to reduce gaps between the lowest and highest paid jobs."
