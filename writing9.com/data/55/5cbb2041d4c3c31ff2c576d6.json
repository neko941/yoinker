        "It is undeniable that, people in our fast-developing world, confronted with myriad of situtaions that arouse a sense as there are so many decisions which should be made on selection in their everday life. I strongly concur with that statement and would put forward an idea in which the reasons of that rest on our tremendously advanced life.",
        "The first and crucial factor of that hertbreaking advance is manifestation of manufacturers. They have flourished and been making effort to carry on that via not only enhancing their outputs' quality but also via diversification of sorts of their products, as well. For instance, when one goliath like Apple or Nike produce brand new product, other manufacturers in black market will plagiarit the idea and fabricate its own products which are splitting image of the original one or with slightly different feature and with new brand. As a result, customer will be baffled by numerous of alternatives.",
        "Second factor, that the condition stems from, is the attratctive embellishment of the product that cajoles consumer to purchase it, regardless if it is vital or not. Consequently, the person encounters with large amount of versions of the output that may put him in dilemma. To illustrate that botiques can be perfect example, in which clothes are decorated so adorabally that catch a person's eyes smoothly. The person, that conjured up by the captivating picture of the outfit, enters inside where he will be faced with manifold of them.",
        "The conclusion to be drawn is that, perhaps, people cannot recognise their choice-making progress that happens without careful consideration, but our life is abound with choices."
