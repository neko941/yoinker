        "Many people argue that historical events have noting or small parts that can be useful to us, however, others believe that learning from past history can help us better understand the recent situation or future. I completely agree with history can tell us much more things about past events that could lead to a better stand-in the present time and  help future movements. In this essay will argues why historical event can bring better situation for the present time.",
        "Some people may say that past historical event events cannot tell us much information. Perhaps, they think that past events have already gone and people need to focus on the present time, so should be moving forward.",
        "Also, If they might think about past events, they could be getting regret or afraid judged by others which might lead to  hard times.",
        "However, there is a lot of knowledge humans can gain from history. People learning about their history is entirely necessary for their life which could help avoid big risks or mistakes. For example, if we look at our personal lives, we could learn many things obtained from life experiences in our past time. That is quite similar to a nation or society. Another example is that the Covid pandemic has been thought us many lessons about how to prevent widespread pandemics and how to tackle that epidemic around the world together. Therefore, it is essential for humans willing to learn and gain experience from the last time.",
        "In conclusion, there are many different opinions about history at the present time. I think, a minority of people ignore past history and the majority of people believe that there is so much knowledge we could gain from our history."
