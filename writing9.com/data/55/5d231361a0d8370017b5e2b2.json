        "It is often argued that the booming of online shopping will lead to the closure of all urban shops in future.I totally disagree with this statement and think that shops will always have its place in our economy as people pursue an interest for shopping certain things directly from outlets.",
        "First of all , I believe that direct shopping gives people a sense of fulfillment that no online sites can give.With online sites there can be trust issues.On the other hand,while purchasing directly issues of quality,colour,brand,size and all can be ruled out to a vast extent.For example,while buying clothes from shops we can trial it before we buy,so that we will get to know if it fits perfectly or whether the colour is good on us,which cannot be assured through online shopping.Thus purchasing directly from shops gives a feeling of satisfaction.",
        "Secondly,For the products which we need daily,adjacent shops are the best source.Because online shopping takes some time and there might be delivery charges as well.sometimes the service charges will be more than the product value while buying some less-valued items.Also there will be a minimum amount to be purchased in each transaction which is not possible to do daily.For instance,to buy milk or vegetables it is easier to go to nearby shop than doing online purchase.So shops are the only reliable source for urgently needed items.",
        "To conclude,I strongly believe that shops will always be there in future as it gives satisfaction to people,timely availability,customer care service and customisations."
