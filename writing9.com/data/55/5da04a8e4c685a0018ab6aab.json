        "A number of countries tend to make usage of bicycles much convenient by spending large sums of money on them. The main reasons for this  development would be mainly, the Eco friendly transportation and helps to maintain good health of the riders. This essay will discuss the main reasons for the entities to spend more money on a more convenient usage of bicycles and analyse the reasons which supports this as the best solution for traffic congestion.",
        "To begin with, there are two main reasons for countries to invest in bicycles. Firstly, the eco friendly transportaion mode which releases zero carbon emssioned gases to the atmosphere. For instance, countries like Singapore have promoted bicycles and recorded positive change in the quality of the air. Secondly, health benefits of riding bicycles are plenty. Physical strength and stamina required to ride bicycles are much higher than any other automobile.  Many studies have proven that riding bicycles provides a full body workout for a individual. Increase in usage of bicycles can overcome obesity which is a triggering issue in the socitey. This can be identified as the main reasons for the countries to promote bicycles.",
        "Furthermore, in my opinion this is the best solution for the growing traffic congestion globally. As bicycles are smaller in size much less space is taken on the roads unlike other automobiles.In addition to that there will less dangerous accidents occuring with bicycles. A pratical example would be in Montreal many individuals uses bicycles by which the traffic situtaion of the city has got much better. However, there can some practical issues when using bicycles to travel to work or for an occasion as it can be difficult to maintain the required apperance.",
        "To recapitulate, some countries do spend large amounts of sums inorder to promote the bicycle usage. This improvement is manily because the bicycles are much more Eco friendly by which releases very less amount of harmful gases to the atmosphere and the health benefits which cycling offers. In my opinion bicycles can be considered as the best method to anwer the increasing traffic congestion worldwide."
