        "At present, many ocean animals are taken from their sea environment and shifted them to wildlife parks for the way of entertainment for the people. In my perspective, it will not be a logical move, as then not only the natural ecosystem of oceans will be disturbed, but also it will be cruel to these organisms.",
        "On the one hand, it is unfortunate if a creature is separated from its family to keep in the parks for the way of earning money. Many babies have been removed from their mothers at an early age to train them so they can learn the special tricks. Secondly, relocating these sea habitats creates a negative impact on their personal growth. They are not able to indulge in another environment as they loved to live their lives in the ocean. They are treated as prisoners and kept them in the captive. They need a bigger space where they free enjoy and spent time with their loved ones. For example, from the recent survey, the captive dolphins lived half of the life span of those dolphins who lived in the sea.",
        "On the other hand, keeping these creatures in amusement parks help tourism to grow because people want to see different sea mammals like dolphins, sharks and would like to know about their growth. Furthermore, it plays a significant role in the development of a country. More parks in a country would increase the number of international tourists, which will be fruitful to the economic growth of the country.",
        "To conclude, although there are pros and cons to removing the sea creatures from their natural habitat and the drawbacks outweigh the benefits because they need to be with their family and thrive in their environment."
