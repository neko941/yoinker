        "There has been an increasing trend in the number of crimes each day for the last few years.This has resulted in the adoption of the capital penalty as a control measure in our society.I do agree with the fact that this is necessary to control the spread of violence in society.In the absence of this,there would be widespread terror and people won't be able to lead normal lives.",
        "Capital infliction refers to extreme measures taken by the countries towards terrorists and criminals.For example,Death by hanging for a person committing murder or Castration of a person committing rape would come under this act.Such acts by the law enforcing agencies to strike fear in the minds of the criminal and he is thereby discouraged from doing any act of crime.The countries adopting this method are Saudi Arabia,China,Qatar,Iraq and many more.These countries have way lesser rates of criminal activity compared to the countries who do not adopt this policy.Due to the reduced violence and fear in the community,there is increased productivity leading to the country's growth.In fact,statistics showed that countries with happier citizens have good economic growth compared to those living in fear.",
        "Human rights activists differ with this opinion.They say that criminals should also be looked upon as normal individuals derailed by brainwashing or circumstances.Instead of this,they should be provided asylum and psychological counselling.In my view,this may be helpful,but it does not prevent the incidence of crimes.For example,A criminal is only identified as one after he has done it,so all the above interventions apply at this stage.Whereas capital punishment is useful to prevent crimes beforehand.",
        "To conclude,Capital punishment serves as an effective means of maintaining peace in the society.Provided that it is enforced by the government only after sufficient evidence in a transparent manner."
