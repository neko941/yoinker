        "Tradition is soul of a nation. It attracts tourism and businesses to the country. But with development of technology, traditional skills and ways of life are dying out. Some people believe that it is pointless to try and keep them alive. Well, I totally disagree to this belief. This essay will contradict the above point of view and will provide supporting points for the same.",
        "Some people believe that the old ways of life and traditions are outdated and needs to be changed. According to them, the authentic methods are not being able to cope up with the new fast moving life because the latest technologies are far more convenient and fast. For example, older techniques of agriculture required more patience and man force, these might not be able to fulfill the needs of today's large population. Nowadays most of the agriculture tasks like cultivation, irrigation, sowing are all done with the help of machines. This is more quick than the prior ones. So, technology gives more convenience and also faster results which is making people think that it is pointless to keep the previous methods.",
        "Although, automation is helping in advanced lifestyles but keeping one's traditional ways of life is also important. All the previous techniques had their own significance and maximum times there is some science involved in the background for these. For instance, in farming there are natural ways of controlling pests on crops but at present farmers only use insecticides and pesticides. These include a lot of chemicals which in turn are consumed by us. Indeed, in a recent survey by Times of India newspaper, 80% of farmers rely completely on these chemicals instead of trying different natural ways, like old days. Hence, technology in turn is indirectly impacting our lives and making us forget the natural and healthier ways.",
        "This essay argued that it is not pointless to value the traditional skills and ways of life. And how important it is to respect the earlier methods of living. In conclusion, people should not completely depend on technology for a brighter future instead the older already tested techniques should also be taken into account."
