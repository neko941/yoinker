        "who does not love reading books ? It is considered by some people that individuals will lose their interest in printed newspapers and books as they will more into online reading methods where everything is available  at no cost. In my opinion , printed media will be disappeared because it is expensive and requires a huge amount of paper.",
        "Unarguably, for the masses, books are costly which  will affect  them significantly to buy them. Precisely, when they will find the books online they tend to purchase them as soft copies are relatively cheaper than printed ones. Consequently , they will save their money and utilise it  on other expenses. That  is the reason  why printed media will be useless in future.",
        "Besides this,  a requirement of  paper is  another thing to either print the books or newspapers .That is to say, paper production companies chopped- down plenty of trees in order  to form  the papers which will  pose a detrimental effect on biodiversity , particularly on extinct species. Consequently, the problem of pollution will arise. for example, Had the people of America refused to buy books, deforestation will not be stopped.",
        "To conclude, everyone likes reading books and newspapers, and this will be disappeared  for some people because offline books are extravagant and demand a hefty amount of paper."
