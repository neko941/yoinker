        "Leadership quality is the important factor in society to be a successful person. There is group which believe that leading ability is the talent that exist in a person by birth, on the other hand there is another segment of people who are confident that leadership quality can be adopt by hard work, skills and passion. However in my opinion leadership quality could be by birth and could be developed by hard work.",
        "Firstly, it is obvious in mind of some people that good leader around the world are born with leadership quality, in their opinion, it is a God gifted talent that is being carried by the person. Having said that leadership quality could be by birth, though hard work is important factor in success of any person but, there are some people who have extraordinary, leading, critical thinking, decision making skill. These people can learn quickly anything and can play important roles in organizations and daily life. But born abilities are not enough if they are not organized and brought up",
        "On the other hand there is a second view of people, that is, leadership quality can be developed. It is the fact that hard work, passion, achievement of goals, plays vital role in the success of a person. According to this opinion, it is the determination of the person that how he takes his professional or personal life. A good leader is the one who learn from his mistakes and his sub ordinates. Moreover leadership skill can be developed by polishing skills, there are many examples of great leaders who had nothing in their early life but their hard work and their self believe helped them to become the leaders.",
        "In conclusion, I belied that leadership quality is the combinatio of both, born quality and the hard work. Without hard work nobody can utilize his abilities. While hard work and skill set can change the way of thinking and working."
