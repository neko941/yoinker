        "In order to choose a candidate during a job interview is required to render major preference to their personal abilities instead of qualification and experience by chief executive. In my opinion, I completely disagree with this notion because of  two reasons which are verbal communication skills and leadership skills. This essay will explain why such causes are crucial.",
        "To embark with, the person should be elected on the basis of education  because well educated employee is more likely to has superior language proficiency. The worker who has effective verbal skills, can convey his or her message clearly to other members of staff resulting in increased understanding on concepts for development of enterprise. Take meetings are one of the most common types of oral communication examples in the workplace to discuss the projects so in this case these skills are important to present a presentation effectively. Moreover, if the subordinate person does conversations adequately, his or her confidence level will escalate definitely. Owing to this the performance will be enhanced as well as growth of an organisation will also be effected.",
        "Furthermore, the selection of the staff member should be based on work experience as experienced person is tend to has enough directorship talent. Having supervisory power is considered that to be better understanding of the nature of the work, which allow others to learn from him. For instance, a survey conducted by the government has shown that job holders who have relevant job experience proves to be not only a motivation, but also a source of inspiration to other employees. Eventually, these skills enable in setting up a healthy working environment for efficient progress of the company.",
        "In conclusion, while conducting an interview, senior officer should not put more emphasis on representative's personal features since qualified and expertise man or woman has better ability to communicate and supervise as compared to other who has personal characteristics exclusively. I believe, regardless of own attributes but without academic degrees and appropriate knowledge of field, he or she can not execute in the industry, So that's why I agree with this approach."
