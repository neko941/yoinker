        "In a lot of states, owing to being located numerous advanced centres of educations and treatments, a number of people argue that teachers and doctors who are new started their jobs should go country-side for work, whereas others think that nobody force where they work. In this essay, will be discussed each side of the topic and will be suggested  a idea.",
        "On the one hand, no one would dispute the fact that large cities supplies more opportunities than villages such as cultural activities, education locations, and medical facilities. Therefore, one can conclude that, a lot of people have a tendency to live in big metropoles as well teachers and doctors in order to benefit it's opportunities. For instance, a young lecturer can visit museums in big city in order to enhance his level of information. There is no doubt that every person can choose a place where do you want to work and live. Thus, doctors or lecturers can prefer to live in cities.",
        "On the other hand, in many nations new doctors and teachers are employed by the government instead of working private sector due to conditions which are submitted by the government. For example, if a new teacher found a job in private sector, he would work much more than teachers who work for the state and would earn less than a public lecturer as well as doctors. Hence, demanding work for state brings some obligations like working in rural areas because of governmental policy that it wants to boot degree of countryside. Briefly, the public desires from it's own workers to execute some duties.",
        "To conclude, because of having acceptable causes, both arguments seem to me logical. In my opinion, teachers or doctors who  want to work in cities with good opportunities should  choose find a job in private sectors. If they do not desire  to live in country-sides, they would not apply to public jobs."
