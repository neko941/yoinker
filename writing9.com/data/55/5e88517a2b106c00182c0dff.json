        "Despite of being absent from the job, I will be available for taking emergency phone calls and to attend client meetings. Besides, I endeavour to perform on weekends and extend my weekday working hours to compensate the same. I have also talked to Sim and Joe, my colleagues, who have agreed to undertake a part of my work in the meantime.",
        "In this way, my absence would not impact the work negatively but, would be beneficial for the company in terms that I would be another Oracle certified employee. Also, the fusion training which our team was recently discussing about, I can be a perfect volunteer to lead here as I believe by the time I should be capable of.",
