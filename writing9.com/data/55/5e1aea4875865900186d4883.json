        "Most of the high school graduating students have dilemma whether they should apply for a university or gaining some work experience before next level of education will be better. In my opinion, doing a job before university could prove more fruitfull in long term as it can teach us about the real market scenario of skills required and we get to learn to respect money before spending.",
        "Main purpose of any student, studying in an university, is to land a good job. However, they never know which course is going to be best for them as per future job requirements. Therefore, if they can do a job and learn that towards which direction the world is moving forward, they will always be at a winning side. For example, over the last decade, how many bachelors degree courses are focused on artificial intelligence. I will say very few, even though the artificial intelligence is considered as the hottest commodity in the job portals. Resultantly, students choosing job first will have better idea of such market trends.",
        "Moreover, 9 to 5 jobs can help teenagers to be more desciplined and value the money because youngsters do not value money and time. Hence, learning these aspects of life at early age will surely boost their grades in higher education. Furthermore, they would not waste their money on random courses but wisely choose one as per their work experience.",
        "In conclusion, university education has been proving its worth for so long but if students with job exposure enters the foray, they tend to shine more in their respective careers for all the reasons discussed in this essay."
