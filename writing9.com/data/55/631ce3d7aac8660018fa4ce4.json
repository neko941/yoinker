        "Construction and Industries now have become the major part of developed country. Countries are trying to open various industries in their neighborhood so that their country can become more developed. But with this rise in industry and construction over the decade have caused the reduce in the air and water quality of the country.",
        "The one main problem of reduce in air quality is because of harmful gases used by these industries. These industries uses gases like Carbon monoxide, Sulphur and other highly dangerous chemicals for constructing things. Due to which when these gases got release into air as smoke, they form highly substantiate substance which reduces the quality of air. Apart from reducing air quality, it has also lead to decrease in water quality. The reason behind this problem is the waste which got thrown in water by the companies. Due to which, this water get transferred into our home through internal water lines and we don\u2019t get the fresh water as we used to get before.",
        "Government can take various initiatives to stop this reduction of air and water quality. First, they can force industries to use resources which are not harmful to our environment such as green houses and renewable resources so that there will be no harmful released in our atmosphere. In addition to this, they can also impose industrial laws for industrial waste such that if anyone tries to throw industrial waste then will face heavy fines.",
        "In conclusion, Both industries and construction have caused reduction in air and water quality of the cities. There are some possible ways which countries can took stop these damages such as forcing industries to use renewable and eco friendly resources and imposing heavy fines on disposing waste into water. These changes will help in improving both air and water quality."
