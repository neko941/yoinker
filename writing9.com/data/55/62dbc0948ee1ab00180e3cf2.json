        "Every person has different levels of taking negative situations. Some individuals tend to reduce the negative situations that they take, while some people may prefer to accept them. Although both statements will be mentioned later, personally, I am willing to encounter undesired situations.",
        "People who would like to limit the number of times suffering undesired situations are usually not risk takers, which results in living  a safer lifestyle. The characteristics of these individuals are likely well-organised, logical and having a higher quality of life. This is because they can predict the problem and manage a solution to address it; then only need to concentrate on their desired lives.",
        "On the other hand, some people and I regard these negative situations as \u201cchallenges\u201d, which enhance people\u2019s skills in three aspects,  potential capability, motivation and  problem-solving ability. The potential capability is usually stimulated when people are  downhill, and the bad situations will be an opportunity to trigger it thereby unlimited the capability in the future. Meanwhile, negative situations may enhance the motivation of individuals due to a strong desire of escaping from the situation. Therefore, it may be recorded by our muscles and be recalled in the future if having  similar issues. Additionally, the ability to problem-solving may be trained. It is always a process to build up an ability. People can acquire  problem-solving ability by practising it regularly from suffering undesired situations.",
        "Consequently, depending on the preference and the characteristics, both two views have their own supporters, considering  aspects of organized ability, logical thinking and life quality for non-undertaking-bad-situation individuals, or the potential capability, motivation and  problem-solving skills for undertaking-negative-situation supporters. However, no matter which option people take, these are all experiences in our lives."
