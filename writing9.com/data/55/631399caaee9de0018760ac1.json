        "Education is the fundamental building block for children\u2019s development. However, the growth of students is very much dependent on the way of coaching. Some parents or guardians prefer educating students at home while others think it is necessary for children to attend school. In this essay, I will analyze both viewpoints before reaching a reasonable conclusion.",
        "To begin with, it is very clear that home is the first place where the child\u2019s development starts. This fact can\u2019t be denied and should not be obviated, but it can not replace the school setup. There are numerous advantages for children who study at home. Firstly, they get sufficient time to focus on their areas of interests, then, they develop self-learning skills, moreover, they learn how to manage and organize their schedule. For instance, a millionaire has dropped out of high school in order to focus on his/her area of interests and has successfully built empires in his/her field.",
        "Conversely, schools promote both academic and personal development skills of the children. A child who goes to school has more advantages over those who do not in terms of developing communication and teamwork. Group schooling systems make the arrangements of special practical equipment feasible, which would ultimately enhance the learning experience of all the students. In school, a child has to spend his/her time in class with other children their age, they start making friends. Other benefits, they learn to be more efficient and disciplined, then following certain rules and regulations in the school develops law-abiding habits in children. School children are always involved in extra carricular activities that lead to development in a wide variety of skills. Children should always learn how to interact with each other.",
        "In summary, I promote that children should be sent to school for their better grooming. I tend to believe that in order to sustain in the actual world, students should be motivated to get educated in institutions rather than learning alone at home."
