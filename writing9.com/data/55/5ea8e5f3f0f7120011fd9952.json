        "In this modern era, all are working extra miles to get handsome salary and higher designation. Getting promotion has been became controversial issue in professional life. A school of thoughts believe that company should promote their employees for higher designation rather than hiring a candidate form another organisation. In my point of view, I fully agree with given statement that companies should consider their employees for higher position. My inclination is strengthen by various arguments and supportive examples.",
        "To begin with, there is a plethora of reasons to prove as to why the firm should give first choice to their workers. First and foremost, they are well trained with basic rules and regulation of the company, system within organisation and know all ins and outs of organisation. Apart from this, they have good rapport with other departments which enable them to complete the given task at a twice. For instance, there are various departments in clinical research organisation such as project coordinator and project management. IF any project is pending from project coordinator, project management team head immediately contact to team leader of project coordinator and project will be tracked and will find out any loophole together. After resolving the issue, project can be submitted further.",
        "Furthermore, working for a longer time with the same organisation, employees also want reworded in term of handsome salary and higher designation. Appointing the employee within the organisation will not only motivate to the appointed candidate but also other colleagues. In this way trust and loyalty toward the employer will be accompanied. For example, a survey conducted in 2017 by Times of India, it has been reported that employers who have selected their staff to promote at high position, employee\u2019s retention rate is higher in those organisation.",
        "Agglomerating, penning down my thoughts, I firmly opine that company should identify the skilled and experienced candidate within organisation to promote for higher post. This is not only beneficial to employee but also for employer."
