        "Shopping is a fundamental activity of modern society, and merchandise companies have always been competing with each other to make shopping expererience more enjoyable to their customers. One trend is becoming popular recently, where small local stores are being replaced by enormous shopping malls. Below I will discuss both sides of the story, and argue that overall, this trend is beneficial to society as a whole.",
        "Despite their size, local small shops are genereally convenient. There is possibly at least one store in every neighborhood, normally ran by someone who live closely or is your neighbor himself. This proximity allows people to purchase their goods fast, whenever they need, without having to plan ahead. However, due to their size and financial model, local shops can not store a large amount of stock, nor can they raise service quality in today rapidly changing business environment. For example, it would be impossible for customers to buy online and have the products shipped to their doors by these small stores.",
        "On the other hand, larger shopping malls have strengths that allow them to remain relevant in the future. These malls have huge spaces to store the inventories, provide almost anything a customer can ask for. Shopping is becoming an experience rather than one of your everyday chores. Not only can people go shopping at malls, but they can also bring their children to play, or enjoy a nice meal at a restaurant, all in the same place. Furthermore, lots of big shopping malls now take advantage of technology and the Internet to assure customer satisfaction. People can stay at their home, purchase and pay for groceries through application, and their shipment would arrive in a few hours.",
        "To conclude, although small stores have their advantages, from the customer perspective, large shopping centers are providing more value. Perhaps both would continue to stay in business, but it is more beneficial to focus on developing the latter."
