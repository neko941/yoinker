        "The map shows how a village called Ryemouth has developed over the last twenty-five years. There have been several changes, the most noticeable being the increases in accommodation, the elimination of the fishing industry, and the introduction of sports facilities.",
        "In 1995, to the south of the village where the sea is there was previously a fishing industry, with a fishing port and quite a large fish market as well. Next to this was a small cafe. On the other side of the road running by the sea, stood a line of five shops and a hotel, while situated in the north east part of the village was farmland and a park with trees. The main house of the village was located in the northwest around a main road that runs from the coastal road, with twelve houses, four of them encircled by a small side-street.",
        "Turning to the present day map, it can be seen that the fishing facilities have all gone, being replaced by four apartments, and the shops have become restaurants. The cafe remains, as does the hotel, albeit with parking facilities which it did not have before. Having been converted into a golf course, the farmland has now gone, while the forest park has been removed to make way for tennis courts. Although the old houses remain, new ones have been built, along with a new road with two new houses beside it."
