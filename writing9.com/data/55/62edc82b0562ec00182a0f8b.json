        "In this contemporary era , living standards of human beings have significantly impacted their life . A school  of thought believes that using cycle instead of other modes of transportation is tremendously beneficial , however some opponents argue that there are numerous negative ramifications of this strategy.  This discourse delves into both views of  arguments  in the subsequent paragraphs.",
        "To commence with ,  various vehicles   types lead   to  escalate the level  of the pollution ,prompting  to generate a number of health disorders  but if an individual is tend to use bicycle for short distances there will be reduction of toxin gases in environment, attributing to protect  the physical well being  of earth creatures.  Moreover health is the   treasury of a person because  whole life cycle relies on the body  strength in order to remain fit, despite paying large amount of gym fess  an inexpensive exercise  of bicycle should preffered   for maintaining the tone and shape of the body . To cite an example,  in India there is organization of bicycle competition  on which influences persons to stay healthy ,although using cycle plungged the   harmful  releases of carbon dioxide from surroundings .",
        "On the counterparts,if there is declination in  the usage of other vehicles production units have to bear the heavy loss beacuse majority of people will get more driven towards using bicycle and it will automatically effect the economy of the nation as the cost of another transports is relatively higher then two wheel cycle .For instance,  there will be more wastage of time by using the cycle beacuse there will be a lot of time consumption if a work has to accomplished by using the cycle.",
        "To conclude,  beyond doubt there are countless merits of this practice beacuse it is helpful in decreasing pollution and enhancing the ability of body in long terms ,whereas the manufacturers have to face the stage of uncertainty in business by this phenomenon."
