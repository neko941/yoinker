        "It is thought by some students that taking a year off between finishing their school and going to university is important. This notion has both its advantages and disadvantages for the students.",
        "Taking a year off, will give students some time to think about their career. They will have time to explore themselves, to know what they really want to do in life and accordingly they can make choices for their future. Secondly, this will also give them more time to explore the universities they want to study in, and will give them an option to look for alternatives. This way they will be more clear about their choices and more confident in what they are going to do. It will also give them some time to take off the academic pressure and refresh their minds for the next chapter of their lives.",
        "On the other hand, taking a year off means taking time of their studies, this will lead them to loose concentration and they might not be able to catchup when they join the university. Some of them might have already started doing a job, which may impact the next choices they make. They would want to continue doing the same job and leave their education at university or get more education related to that particular job. For example, as a student we may have different dreams to what we want to do in life, but once we start earning money, we forget our dreams and set our minds to the jobs that exist around us and hence we loose the dreams and innovation to do something different, which is a large disadvantage to ourselves and to the society.",
        "In conclusion, taking a year off has its advantages and disadvantages, and it depends on person to person how they are going to utilize this. If one is not clear about the decision, he/she can go for proper career counselling to decide the same."
