        "History is a mandatory subject in primary school for students and exam of the same should be passed to get promoted to the next grade. Some people believe that learning history is meaningless while others consider it is important to study. This essay will argue in coming paragraphs that studying history is essential.",
        "It is worth mentioning that several important events have happened in past when present in past when this generation was not in existence.  The study of history make sense of understanding the historic facts and culture of a different era in detail. Moreover, a study of history explains the lifestyle, struggles, social system, etc. of our forefathers. Considering these important aspects, the government has made history subject as compulsory in primary and secondary education in India. As per my point of view, the advantages of learning history outweigh the disadvantages.",
        "Education of other fundamental subjects; for instance, mathematics, science, arts and languages are equally important. One should not forget that study of history may not improve technical knowledge, and information may not be implemented to solve recent problems. For example, arithmetic or scientific simulation cannot be solved with the help of historical data. Overall, the conceptual learning can be useful to appreciate the hardships of that time.",
        "To sum up, knowledge of variety of subjects is essential in modern time to understand different era and hence all the subjects should be emphasized equally during the study. The history provides details of olden cultures and hardships of a particular times."
