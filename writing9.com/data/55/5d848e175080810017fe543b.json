        "The exhibition of wildlife animal\u2019s is a tradition in this era. Animals catch and they are kept in cages. While some people  think that it is better for the entertainment and education purpose. Other folk believe that it is harmful for them. We will discuss animals in the zoo and it\u2019s positive and negative things.",
        "On the one hand, the development of zoo has several benefits for the current generation. People who find all types of animals, birds, insects in one served area. So people get entertainment  and they can see them life style. Add on to this some excellent scientists  do research and find prominent results. To cite an example the Kankariya zoo where people can see African lion. Although zoological garden plays an indispensable role in a science way. Such as scientist makes vaccine from the animal\u2019s blood.",
        "On the negative side of the zoo, a freedom of creature\u2019s has left when they are in the vivarium. So some social persons claimed that we destroy  the natural chain of environment. Hence some time animal dies during cure time. Additionally  the maintenance cost of vivarium higher  than government should to take extra charge on per visitor. Some animals do not settle in another location .To exemplify, lion\u2019s need huge space and natural scenery .Hence lion feels unsatisfied  in the zoo. So lion decreases it\u2019s strong energy comparable to forest life style.",
        "This essay discussed the reasons why zoo culture plays effective and less effective role.I partially  agree with the writer\u2019s notion that the zoo has some merits and demerits."
