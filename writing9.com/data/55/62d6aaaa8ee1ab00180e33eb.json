        "In our modern day, there are a lot of people debating whether they should or shouldn't learn new languages such as french, Spanish and Japanese. I personally disagree with this as many of us love to travel the world and explore new places and cultures. So why not learn the languages of some countries that might help you in the future. I will continue to explain everything needed to support my opinion in this essay.",
        "Firstly, a lot of kids would rather not waste time on learning hard words that are not English or what they speak but this could teach children many new topics. secondly, it could help them realize their  new potential that they never knew they had. Lastly, this could make children interested in learning more ways to speak a different tongue.",
        "Moreover, children learning a new language could help the find their careers as many humans have taken an interest in jobs involving others with different speaking tounges. In addition, having to know to speak in multiple ways could help you in some situations that are difficult for example, you would like to ask about a certain dish that can only be found in a place like no other.",
        "Furthermore, as learning to speak in other languages can be a a bit difficult, it can still help you in good ways.  it will be a long run to understand people you thought you could never but at the end of the finishing line, it will be worth it."
