        "Child labor is a controversial topic. People\u2019s opinions range from categorizing it as completely immoral to encouraging such labor since children receive the opportunity to grow and become responsible themselves. In the following this essay will elaborate both sides. In my opinion, child labor should be prohibited since the risks children have to bear with at such a young age are unacceptable.",
        "On the one hand, child labor can be beneficial because it gives them first insights into working life and could therefore help them in finding the right career or the right school to go to. For example, children working in a shop selling groceries learn how to treat clients well and how to negotiate. So, child labor can be valuable for the small ones.",
        "On the other hand, most countries which employ child labor have weak human and labor standards. For instance, children are misused as mine workers in Kongo, exploited, not paid well and treated badly. Since the danger of exploiting a child\u2019s work force is very high and hard to control, such labor should be forbidden.",
        "Furthermore, if children had to work, they wouldn\u2019t have time to go to school and lose the chance to get higher education and a better job. This results in a malicious circle with people getting suck in low-paid, unrewarding jobs. For this reasons, child labor is a wrong.",
        "In conclusion, child labor is a serious threat to the wellbeing and the future of every child and the potential advantages are minimal in comparison to the disadvantages. Consequently, I think that child labor should be prohibited."
