        "The booming development of internet and TV is increasingly being witnessed these days. Because of this trend, individuals can have more opportunities to step into the entertainment industry compared to the last generation. This essay will discuss the reason why I believe the negative points of this trend surpass the positive aspects.",
        "There are various compelling reasons why our society can be affected by this trend negatively and the prominent reason is that the youth can be easily swayed by this. Children tend to have this unrealistic fantasy to be famous and wealthy celebrities rather than doctors or scientists which plays a crucial role in our life and make meaningful contributions to the society. To illustrate, a recent survey conducted in Japan has revealed that nearly 80% of high school students will choose the show business as their future career due to the financial rewards and fancy life style. For this reason, I believe that this trend could be detrimental to our society.",
        "However, some oppose this notion and says that this development enables normal people to change their life as it provides more chances for ordinary but talented person to be noticed in the public. For example, Justin Bibber started his early career when he posted his singing videos on Youtube then he  gained huge public attention from these videos and opened an door for his future. As can be seen, ordinary people have more opportunities to be famous now with the development of internet and satellite television as they have a wide range of options to show their talents to the public.",
        "To sum up, internet and TV are widely used nowadays. This trend has created more chances for individuals to show themselves to the audience. Taking everything into consideration, I\u2019m inclined to say that the development can impact us negatively even though there are some benefits associated with this."
