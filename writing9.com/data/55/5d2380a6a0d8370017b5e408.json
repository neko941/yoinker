        "There is no doubt that the average health of the people are declining day by day. Some people believe that it would be below par in coming years as compared to today. In this essay, I will show my agreement to this view because of people's imbalance life style and increase in pollution level.",
        "To embark on, these days, the people do not have proper life-style and it is not at all balanced like we have earlier. This is because, as time is progressing, most of the people become more and more busy in their work and have no time to exercise, which tends to decline in their health standards and leads to many disease. For example, in my company, employees are working more than 9 hours hence not having proper time for exercise because of this they are suffering from many illnesses.",
        "Furthermore, the pollution level goes very high as compare to past. This is the reason why we are losing our health needs as due to the pollution we are not getting required components from the environment and all the natural resources are polluted. For instance, to keep themselves fit earlier the people tends to go to the open area for fresh air, which is not possible now as air is more polluted now and the level is going high in future. If we get these resources pollution free, we would get better health. In short pollution is one the major factor in this.",
        "In conclusion, the main reasons for falling health standards with time are poor living condition and impure natural resources. These factors are increasing by time and hampering fitness level in paramount way."
