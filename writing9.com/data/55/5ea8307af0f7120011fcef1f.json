        "Some may argue that the older generation has more value in some countries, other may argue that youth people have more valuable than old people. I extremely agree that youth people have more active and value than the old generationgeneration. In this essay, I will support both points of views and provide my arguments.",
        "On the one hand, it is clear that the youthful generationgeneration has more active and happier. This may be because they have less old age associated illness led to people keep themselves more active. The fact that healthy people can work more effectively, with this they can contribute to the economy of the society. For example, in my country, our young generation provides more than seventy % of the workforce to our labour industries. Therefore, healthy people enhance the output of industries, which mean that youth people are enabled to create a more gross domestic product in the society.",
        "On the other hand, senior generation has more experience and wide knowledge as they have come across many situations throughout their life. For instant, old people deal with the condition about relationship with employees that they do not too direct to hurt people mental. Furthermore, they are capable of taking care about whole atmosphere. In addition to this, old people spent most of their life while working for fulfilling the responsibilities toward their family.",
        "In conclusion, with arguments given above, I strongly believe that the young generationgeneration has more energy and more active in our society. this is why it is more beneficial for a country to have an active workforce than a dependent senior generationgeneration."
