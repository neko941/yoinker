        "Media plays a vital role in delivering happenings around the world to our convenience. There is a widespread trend that media telecasts problems and emergencies over the positive developments happening around individuals and society. I partially agree with the statement. Firstly, let us discuss the negativity and will move on to the positive impacts it may create.",
        "In general, People from any part of the world would love to listen to gossips and the darker side of an individual \u2013 be it a celebrity or a politician. Media uses this as a key and attracting viewers by telecasting more related content rather than the good deeds of the same as a citizen. There is a weightage awarded to every channel, which is termed as \u201cTRP rating\u201d. To hit this leaderboard with higher TRP, media often gets involved in such activities, which includes telecasting news in favor of a particular politician or race or by conducting reality shows with unwanted content to the society. This gives a very bad impression on the people.",
        "Now we shall discuss on the advantages that we reap from the negative contents which they telecast. The viewers will be having recorded or live proof that something is lacking in their society or someone is misusing the public property through related telecast contents. People can use this opportunity to raise voice against such activities and can get justice, they will be able to question the authorities and demand improvement. After all, we dwell in a democratic country!",
        "To conclude, It depends on an individual to consider the way the media delivers. According to me, we will have a chance to act over negativity at the same time, the confidence of people can be deprived. To have a healthy society, I would suggest that the media should stop emphasizing evil over good."
