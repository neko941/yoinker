        "Multifarious important position in companies is male dominated rather then more then half percentage of women in superpower countries required jobs in that field. I agree that  enterprise should distribute certain position to female as well.",
        "Firstly, most employers prefers man when they have to promote people even though both men and women have equal experience and qualification. But I believe that both genders should be  given equal opportunity for higher position.In developed countries we will often see that companies are run by man administrator and female workers will be on lower job levels. For example, in the hospitals, we will see that all nurses will be female and doctors will be male.moreover, female, jobs will be  fixed at  a lower level of a company.For an instance, assistant jobs and call attendant. Most employers think that female are not flexible as male to work in a primary position in a company.",
        "secondly, In order to eradicate companies from being male oriented, mindset of the employer needs to be changed. Employer presumed that the female is less productive at work so when times comes to promote, a male employee is their top priority.The Government can imply policies to preserve some important position at work to female employees.By this, an employer would not be able to act biased towards one gender group and will promote people who truthfully deserved the important position.If females are stuck at lower job level position balance of society will be deteriorated.",
        "To put in a nutshell, both genders should have equal opportunities.however, when it comes to female workforce, they need equal appreciation and motivation as male.In order to come forward in a male dominate society they need equal job opportunities to come forward in professional level."
