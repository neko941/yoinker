        "Maintaing discipline in children  by corporal punishment is increasing with the passage of time.Some people believe that physical punishment is the most finest way to keep children in order.This essay will argue that smacking children for maintaining discipline is absolutely wrong.",
        "Smacking Children by parents, has become one of a ritual in our society.Some children behave mannerless and stubborn in front of guests, as a result parents hit them to keep them in order.Children usually have a tendency that when they are dealt with care,they tend to become more mischievious,to a level that parents are compelled to use Physical Punishment.For instance,studies have shown that children coming out of Cadet schools,Strick conservative convent schools and conservative well disciplened familes, are well-mannered  and disciplined.As a result some parents beleive that Smacking children physically is the best way to keep children Discipline",
        "However,in a broader perspective,the use of Physical punishment to keep  children in check, has many negative imapacts on their mental health.I Believe that this concept is compeletely preposterous because it puts children under extreme mental stress due to which they can't flourish to their maximum abilities.In addition,it destroys the self-esteem,confidence and creativity of children which puts a significant negatve impact on their personality.One study for example in india showed that ninty percent of children are under severe mental stress due to corporal punishment in schools,fear of being beaten by parents upon commiting minor mistakes.Finally,owing to above reasons i strongly believe that this is absolutely unacceptable way to maintain discipline in children.",
        "In conclusion,this essay argued that parents who believe in physical punishment for keeping children in order, have flawed understanding about children' psycology.In my opinion,i totally disagree with the idea of physical torture to maintain discipline in children,rather children should be dealt with care, love and affection.They should be allowed to make mistakes, as we all learn from our mistakes."
