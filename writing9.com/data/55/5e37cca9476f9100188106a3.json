        "Additionally, it is a very significant place for these people, because many of the local festivals are celebrated together by them here. There is a big open ground inside, which is used for open air functions. This ground is also used for cricket and football training sessions to promote the in house talent.",
        "Unfortunately, if the centre closes, there will a major loss to the society. As the swimming pool and ground will not be there, many children who wish to succeed in the field of sports will suffer. In addition, there won't be any festival programmes taking place which binds the community together.",
        "We hope you will consider our points prior to taking any final decision.",
