        "Recently, there has been an ongoing controversy that has given rise to the question which says, \u201cIs money the major way to staying happy?\u201d. Possessing enough funds has made individuals very excited, because all their basic needs and wants can be catered to by this, however, happiness can be generated if one has a  united family. This essay will highlight these at length.",
        "To begin with, as the saying goes, \u201c human wants are insatiable \u201c, but these desirables cannot be gotten by anyone if the cash to accomplish them are unavailable. For instance, a man who lives in a one-room apartment but wishes to move houses can achieve this if he has enough capital on him. In addition, when people want to go on vacation to rest their heads from our day to day activities and be happy, a lot of money will be involved, hence it is still money to the rescue.Else depression will set in and can lead to death by the unavailability of funds to carry out these needs.",
        "Notwithstanding, a united family to run to by any individual cannot be overemphasized because no man is an island ,hence, a family to be with and ease off stress or speak to when frustration rears  it\u2019s head is key. A good family is another source of generating happiness by anyone as this will be our go-to- persons when a head to lean on is desired by people. This will lighten ones heavy heart and does not lead to one losing his mind. A research was conducted by five students in the northern part of Nigeria, they discovered that people who had good grades in school were the ones who came from happy homes.",
        "In conclusion, the key role money plays in the lives of human beings cannot be overemphasized, as this has seen to peoples desirables though their having companions is another source of achieving happiness by any individual."
