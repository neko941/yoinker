        "Nowadays, a large number of people tend to go to foreign countries; some of them are not familiar with the circumstances. Although they can speak a foreign language, it does not mean that they will not make any mistake, and some of the social e=\" background: #94c9ff;\">problens, as well as the practical problems, cannot be ignored.",
        "It is no denying that we are living in a global village now, people can quickly get a chance to learn a foreign language. For instance, by attending the summer camping or go abroad for further study. But it is such a short time people can live in other countries so that it might cause serious social problems. Take the word thirteen, for example, it is a sort of lucky number in the Asian countries, but it means bad luck in the Europe countries. It might be a misunderstanding between people from different areas of the world. Also, when a person starts learning a new language, the accent might be challenging to recognized by the others, and some people will laugh at the new beginners, or even look down on them.",
        "Although speaking the foreign language may cause social and practical problems, I still believe that it is not so serious as some people said. People who learning the second language is like an infant, they can easily use some worng words in the inappropriate situation, and they even do not realize that they are using it in a wrong way.So some of the mistakes can be ignored because everyone would make some errors when learning a new language.",
        "To sum up, problems can be caused by the foreign learnersm, but it is not serious."
