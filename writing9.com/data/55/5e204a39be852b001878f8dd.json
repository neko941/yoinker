        "It is considered by some that teaching social rules for children in school to have a more beneficial effect to make an obligate person in society, while there are others who think that parents can teach social criteria to children making better members of society. In my opinion, I believe that school as an effective subsocial section of society can persuade children to become good members of society.",
        "On the one hand, many think that learning social rules in the home by children through the parent\u2019s supervision could make a better society member. In other words, children from early edge start to learn environmental laws spontaneously and familiarization with basic principles leads to children have a deep understanding of social values. Also, parents individually have been got acquainted with a child in terms of personality and, therefore, behaviors of them could be more impressed children to internalize worthful things.",
        "On the other hand, teaching valuable social rules by the school in order to make a good member of society has an appropriate result, according to some. School as a part of society with similar aspect from point of a management system that children from all walks of life come there to pursue their education goals need to behave according to some criteria in same the society. Accordingly, determine some principals besides teaching corresponded law in this circumstance could be considered as a great commence to use of practical social rules in a similar society. For example, when children learn to set their time in keeping with school disciplines, practically they learn how they should carry out their obligations in society.",
        "Finally, in my opinion, I believe that teaching social rules that one may make enough compatibility of child behavior in society have sufficient impression on child preparing them to get better homogeneity as a member of society."
