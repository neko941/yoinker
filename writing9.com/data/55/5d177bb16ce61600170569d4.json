        "There is a common belief that international student exchange programs would bring benefits to all participants. Despite those programs\u2019 disadvantages, I believe that they cannot undermine the advantages.",
        "On the one hand, there are several major drawbacks when teenagers go overseas. Firstly, the expensiveness of various exchange programs makes them inaccessible to many students. For example, students who come from developing countries would find difficult to apply student exchange programs in industrial nations because of the difference in living standards between nations. Secondly, even with preparation and knowledge about the new environment, adolescents could still experience culture shock, which can affect them in some certain situations . This can be elaborated by the fact that students from Asian countries seem unable to be in harmony with codes of behaviour set by Europeans and vice versa. Health issues occuring during the stay in a foreign country is another common problem among this program",
        "On the other hand, I believe that the benefits are more significant than aforementioned disadvantages. One reason for this notion is that international students would have an attractive resume which is valuable for them in the years to come. To be more specific. By working in foreign organizations, they will gain practical experience that makes their profile more competitive. Another reason is that teenagers would have a chance to experience cultural diversity. This broadens their mind and also helps them make new friends. Additionally, after finishing the program, overseas students tend to obtain more opportunities to land well-paid jobs because they have a wide social circle.",
        "In light of aforesaid reasons, I am convinced that the advantages of international student exchange programs are more significant than the disadvantages in terms of culture and occupation opportunities."
