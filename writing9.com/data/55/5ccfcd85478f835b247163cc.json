Moreover, reformed offers can tell young people how they became involved in crime, the dangers of a criminal Lifestyle. furthermore, can also tell what life in prison is really like. Thus, they would help youngster stay away from crime. In addition, while adolescent are indifferent to the guidance given by old people.
