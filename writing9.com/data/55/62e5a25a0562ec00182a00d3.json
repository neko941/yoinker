        "In the cutting-edge era, workforce became a competitive domain which is very hard to get. In the field of workings, older employer have to work with youngster equally. This situation can create some problems including reducing work sprit and this problem can be solved by separating their duty.",
        "To begin with, working two generations together can decrease working sprit. Youngster are more fit to work speedily than old tribe. Moreover, older citizen who need employment have not ability as much as younger have which can make a barrier to work togther as a result it can effect badly on companies progress. This may lead to a company to reduce their profit. For example, people who are elder have less physical power than younger. Medical practitioner said that at the later age peoples lose their 60% health strength. By which I mean that an older citizen can not work like a younger pupil. Because of this, a company get little working hour to an older man which can curtail company development. Therefore, for this reason, working two genesis together can detrimental for company.",
        "This problem can be solved by separating their duty regards to their age and capacity. Younger blood who are more powerful can work where the company needs a more capable person; on the other hand, older people whose worked are more experienced and can work where the company requires a more skilled person. This may help to maintain working balance resulting in enlarged people who need to work can worked freely with youth and also company have bo possibility to face deleterious condition. For instance, in the transportation sector of a company can be maintained by youngsters and older people can be responsible for financial management departments. By doing these, company will get same working hours from two genesis as well as older people who need work can meet their demand.",
        "In conclusion, old peoples whom need employment can find energy variation by working with old people. But this problem can be solved by dividing their responsibilities. In last,  working with old and young people simultaneously can diminish the number of unemployment."
