        "The question of whether or not a university or similar schools such as technical institutions could provide the relevant qualities needed for true success in present day life  is often debatable. In my own view, both institutions aid success by equipping students with the required skills and the needed qualities.",
        "To begin with, the university is a carefully designed institution that creates an enabling environment, where students  could receive knowledge, trainings as well as sound character building. All these translate as a matter of fact into making them better poised for success in life. Based on my knowledge, I can safely concluded that most successful individuals in my country, Nigeria, for example are people who attended one institution of higher learning or the other, where they are able to garner skills and qualities required to clinch success in their different endeavours. An online study I came across recently also buttresses this point after concluding that a person's success is directly related to his or her level of education.",
        "Another compelling reason I believe that similar institutions such as a Technical university for example might be able to position one for success is that, many of the these schools have  recently been able to incorporate entrepreneurship into their curriculum. This compulsory aspect of learning in such schools ensures that the graduates learn a lot about how to create businesses and run it profitably independent of government. As an example, the oldest technical university located in my home town is reputed for churning out graduates who do not depend  on the government for employment, but are rather employers of labour themselves, owing to the crucial entrepreneurial qualities inculcated into them, whileat the school. This has, in no small measure, facilitated their success in my opinion.",
        "In conclusion,I would state that citadels of higher education are vitally important in positioning graduates for a successful life, in my view, especially when they also gain knowledge on how to become employers of labour. Therefore, it is imperative that government at all levels should support these schools."
