        "Nowadays tTo succeed, nowadays, requires a plenty of traits which include sharp technical skills, soft skills, multitasking, pressure management and a positive attitude. Although Whereas, universities and colleges are the main source to equip oneself with all the characteristics to become successful, it is also believed that academic institutes cannot help a person in this regard. IfullyI fully disagree with the view that a person cannot develop those qualities that which are required to succeed in today's world from educational institutes.",
        "According to a school of thought, universities and academic institutes are not the place from where a person can learn those soft skill attributes which are now necessary to become successful. For instance, huge technology companies like Google, Apple and Facebook are now focusing on recruiting those candidates who are street smart and are able to present out of the box solutions for complex modern problems, even if a candidate does not have a formal university education. Therefore, in contemporary times, academic institutes may not be able to help a person to develop those traits which are essential to prosper in competitive environment.",
        "On the other hand, universities and other academic institutes provide a lot of opportunities to learn and develop those qualities which are vital to succeed in today's time, because now academic institutes are working parallel with industriesy. For example, every renowned university in the world is offering a plethora of personality development courses, workshops and real life research projects related to industry and market. Apart from that, almost all famous and big firms arrange their job fairs at universities. Thus, academic institutes are the finest places from where one can easily develop skills, pPositive attitude and personality according to the requirements of market to become successful.",
        "Educational institutes are the place from where one can learn almost every aspect of knowledge, trait and skill to become successful. Although there is a thought that a person cannot acquire those qualities which are required to become successful from academic institutes, to conclude, I completely disagree with this thought."
