        "Green space is currently one the most popular trends among the world. Therefore, the idea of planting more trees in urban areas instead of building residences is introduced by some people. I totally agree with aforementioned idea that we should have more green spaces rather than having more houses in cities and town. The following paragraphs will provide some cases and examples to support my point of view.",
        "Planting more trees in cities provides us many benefits, both to the environment and to the people living in those areas. Initially, it is disputable that the pollutions in many big cities, like New York, London, Paris, have been significantly increased in the past few decades, resulted from a growing number of cars and constructions. Hence, it is important to grow more trees to purify the air and filter the dust in those areas to create a better environment. Moreover, creating more green spaces can greatly benefit people\u2019s mental health. For example, countries having the high rates of suicide and depression, like South Korea, should plant more trees, since many researches claimed that the green color of a tree can surprisingly ease people\u2019s mind and reduce level of stress.",
        "The reasons that make building more houses in cities seems to be secondary priority are its damages on the environment and drawbacks in economic terms. To elaborate, expanding residential area means more of trees and lands will be destroyed to build houses, not to mention pollutions, chemicals, dust from the constructions that will adversely affect both people in community and environment in the long run. Moreover, in some cities like Taiwan or Tokyo are already packed up by houses and apartments, resulting in huge increase of lands price. Consequently, people in those countries will not be able to afford a house, and problems like crime and homeless will be more and more.",
        "To conclude, even though some people might hold the view that we should build more houses to facilitate people, I am still convinced that the human activity like construction will cause us the problems in the long terms. In the other hand, expanding green spaces seems to be more environment-friendly and can make our world a better place to live."
