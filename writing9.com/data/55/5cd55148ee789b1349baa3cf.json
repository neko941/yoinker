        "People are reluctant to try novice things in their lives. This essay will discuss that this creates a hindrance to their progress and the problem can be resolved by creating awareness among individuals.",
        "The primary problem that men and women face by avoiding changes is the lack of progress in their lives. It could be seen that those who do not embrace changes outside of their comfort zone are not able to   achieve anything big in their lives. This tendency of risk aversion often hinders their growth both personally and professionally as they are unable to realize their full potential. For example no new inventions can be invented if people are unwilling to change the usual manner in which things are done.",
        "The solution to this problem is to create awareness by use of social media. People are highly influenced by social media campaign which has large following and they believe that by being a part of such campaign they are making a massive difference. Such campaigns which will ask people to try something new in their daily lives will definitely attract millions of followers and by seeing each other activities will persuade them to follow it .For example recently a \u201cwater campaign\u201d in Rajasthan India in which people were asked to conserve water in their day to day activities was a massive success and resulted in huge conservation of water.",
        "In conclusion, while it might not be very tempting to try something new, it might hamper the growth of an individual and creating online awareness could solve this problem to a great extent. It is predicted that such a search campaign might start in the near future."
