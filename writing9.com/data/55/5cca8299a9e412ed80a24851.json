        "Majority of population is moving in metro cities, small towns and other industrial area in order to get jobs, instead of farming. It will definitely result in severe effects on farming such as, land loss due to salt formation, food shortage etc. However, by educating people about new agricultural techniques, its financial aspects and career prospects will be the best resolution to divert people to start farming again.",
        "Nowadays, agriculture importance in young youth is reducing day by day due to its less income as well as it demands extra efforts to cultivate land. As a result, lands which are not utilized for agricultural purpose are started forming salt on upper layer. In addition to this, people are moving away from agriculture causing huge amount of food shortage. For example, in reference to annual agricultural report 2015, published by Government of Maharashtra clearly expounds that, 15% food shortage had registered and imported foodstuff from outside countries to compensate public needs.",
        "Nevertheless, this problem will be resolved by educating people about new techniques, new hybrid crops which are able to produce more food and its economic importance in accordance with career growth as well. These all solutions will definitely convince most of the population in order to initiate their land irrigation. For example, The Gujrath University had taken initiative to teach people about new types of crops, its economic facts and long run benefits that will stabilize their life. This helped around 5 million people around the country.",
        "To conclude, most people thinks getting job by relocating in cities is piece of cake as compare to farming but it has its own disadvantages too. However, this problem has a solution to deal with and divert people to start land irrigation."
