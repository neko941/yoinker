        "It is thought by many people that relocating bigger companies and industry from large cities to countryside would be a better plan. In my opinion, I completely agree that the positive effects of this action outweigh the negative effects.",
        "On the one hand, the benefits of this decision are noteworthy. One of these main evident advantages is that it will solve the problem of  inadequate housing in urban areas. Due to limited accommodations in large cities, which most of the apartments are occupied by employees of this industries. Therefore, having larger companies moved to rural areas will significantly address the issue of lack of housing in urban areas. For instance, a 2018 special survey by the West African bureau of statistics uncovered  that there is a 60 percent increase in no of accommodations in the region due to this plan. Another notable benefit is that this would address the issue of traffic congestion especially during close of work. This reveals the extent to which relocating larger companies to regional areas would be beneficial.",
        "On the other hand, the deleterious effects are abound. One of this pitfall is that the level of crime will increase in countryside. This means there would be high rate of robbery in the area because of the high paid workers. This trend will continue if nothing urgently is done. This notion is supported by 2018 report by the New York times that the level of  robbery increased in rural areas in the past 5 years and most of it attributed to larger companies moving into regional areas.",
        "In conclusion, it is obvious that the advantages of relocating larger companies from cities to rural areas outweigh the disadvantages in my opinion. This is because the challenges of insufficient housing and traffic congestion would be solved, as a result, it would improve the standard of living in urban areas."
