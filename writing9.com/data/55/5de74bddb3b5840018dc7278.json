        "Among the disadvantages, firstly it is really difficult for employees to wear one kind of dress over and over again.Moreover,it is quite tiring as well as boring.Furthermore,from staff, who has allergy always attempt to avoid it.A survey showed that,most of the staff prefer to various dress at the workplace.For instance,my cousin he works at garments he has to wear a uniform at work,he could not accept it in any way.As a result he request to employer to alter this rule.",
        "In spite of some disadvantages there are many merits,Firstly dressing a prescribed uniform in the work that look eye-catching.Moreover, whenever client comes to the office, he will treat them with due respect despite the success and failure in their duty.For example most of the young generation prefer to select their job as a nurse. a Not only they always wear white uniforms but also they always care patients in daily basis.they seem,to sustain a good environment of the hospital it is really needed.Hence,they display the discipline and uniqueness.Secondly, when workers are professionally dressed they feel confident and their behaviour more formal in the work.",
        "to conclude, although There are several drawbacks but the advantages is far away.However,However,if the company issues new roles of uniform employees should need to avoid by."
