        "Learning is inevitable and is considered a necessity for growth and development. It is often argued that taking previous accounts and experiences into consideration is of no importance to everyone in this new age. I completely disagree with this point of view, because, reflecting on the past helps to avoid mistakes and also helps in evaluating the progress.",
        "To begin, taking a retrospective look at matters helps an individual to avoid mistakes made previously. This forms the basis of mentorship; the mentor guides the mentee based on past knowledge and experiences. For instance, it is very common in medical practice to learn the theories propounded by the pioneers. This is necessary because they form the basis of the profession. anyone who does not want to learn about the past is bound to work on a Virgin land which could be very stressful, tiring and time-consuming. studying about the past will guide you from repeating errors.",
        "Furthermore, when you take time to look at the past, it will serve as a baseline with wish you can make comparison and evaluate your progress. How do we ascertain or measure of development, if not by comparing with past? To illustrate, new modern cars been manufactured to meet up with the current trend. Does modern designs are not just brought out of the blues, rather they are modifications of the older version. Therefore, taking the past into account helps to evaluate the success in life.",
        "To conclude, I strongly disagree with the standpoint that taking a look into the past is not necessary, rather, I think it helps to prevent errors, as well as evaluating our advancement in life. It is therefore be a routine and continuous practice, not just an occasional event."
