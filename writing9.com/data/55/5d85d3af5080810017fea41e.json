        "In recent times, the margin between the affluent and destitude is widening. This poses serious problems however, there are ways to tackle this vital issue.",
        "The two major consequences are increase in crime rate and also, violence in the society. Firstly, teh frequency of crime would escalate because the impoverished  would not be able to afford their basic needs of life such as , food, shelter and clothing. This would lead to the poverty-stricken population committing heinous crimes such as  burglary, credit card fraud, to mention a few, to obtain finance to purchase basic necessities of life. In addition, cases of violence would astronomically elevate because the needy population would always be unhappy, due to their inability to afford the comfort of life consequently, leading to an unstable society. Nigeria, for example, has a high crime rate and occurence of riots, which has been linked to the tremendous margin between the opulent and the poverty-stricken.",
        "However, there are two important ways to remedy the problems, which are the government creating jobs and offering free education to the masses. Firstly, once the government can create jobs for the public this would enable them to earn wages, which can easily be exchanged for basic necessities of life invariably reducing the margin between the wealthy and the needy. secondly, if the government offer free education to the public, this would provide a platform for the children of the destitute to qualify for high paying jobs. The outcome would lead to a reduction between the affluent and the destitute gap. For example, the Nigerian government has provided numerous jobs and free education till tertiary level, which have resulted in a steady reduction in the margin between the affluent and the poor.",
        "To sum up, the escalation of crime rate and violence occurence are the result of the broadening margin between the opulent and the impoverished however, job creation and free education are two Pivotal ways the state can drastically diminish d gap between d opulent and needy"
