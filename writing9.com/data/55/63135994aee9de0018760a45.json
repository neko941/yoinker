        "As the population increased rapidly in the last few decades, new business ideas are also created. Between all the businesses they will compete for more customers which introducing advertising, one of all businesses' methods to gain customers, but is advertising actually a positive development or negative?",
        "When a business meets another competitor, such as a business that is also selling  identical products or services; it will attempt to eliminate its competitor to 'survive'. If a company attempts to eliminate its competitors, its goods need to be either unique or very valuable, so that it can attract customers' attention. Nowadays, businesses use advertising to give the consumer a better impression of their goods which can rise the chance of consumers purchasing their products.Advertising can increase the impression of a product substantially if used correctly but sometimes it can also leave a bad impression on a product, or even the company.",
        "Nowadays, businesses are willing to win against their competitors by deceiving their customers, and telling them  false information about their products or service. This action could cause a very remarkable impression on the customers and can cause fatal damage to the company or the business. Some advertising uses a special effect and image to attract customers but in some cases can also bring misunderstandings between businesses and customers, making customers believe the product in the advertisement is identical to the product the business is selling. Misundance will also leave a negative impression of the company and so on.",
        "In my ,opinion advertising is a very useful method to improve the impression of the product tremendously, but can also damage fatally to the company if not used in a correct way."
