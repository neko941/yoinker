        "We currently rely on fossil fuels to provide the energy that allows our economies to continue to grow and people to thrive. However, this essay will argue that safer alternatives to carbon-based energy must be developed.",
        "The major reason why we need to find alternative energy sources is because oil, gas and coal reserves are running out. Experts predict that our supplies of fossil fuels will be exhausted within the next 100 ears, potentially causing numerous problems. Transport, electricity production, and manufacturing would all cease to operate, resulting in not only unemployment but also food shortages and even social harm. A hospital cannot save lives unless it has electricity. The longer we wait to develop alternatives, the greater the risk we take in terms of economy and safely.",
        "Another reason is that alternative, greener energies are needed in order to reduce the catastrophic environmental damage fossil fuels cause. Extracting and burning coal, oil, and gas causes pollution, habitat destruction, and even species extinction. Petrol-powered cars, as one example, are the major contributors to CO2, a driving force of global warming. If we continue to rely on these fuels, the damage to waterways, air, and biodiversity could become irreversible. The sooner we reduce carbon emissions, the more likely we can avert a climate disaster.",
        "In conclusion, there is no doubt that our use of fossil fuels puts our entire way of life at risk. If we wish to preserve our planet and the people who live on it, we must make this change soon."
