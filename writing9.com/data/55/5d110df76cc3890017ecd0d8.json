        "The issue of wheather adolescents should do voluteer work when they do not study or are on holidays, is a controversial one. While some people claim that youngsters could acquire pivotal lessons and skills that may come in useful later in life, such as, work experience and group-team skills, others argue that society might be helped at the same time since the Government will not need to fund this kind of work. However, I wholeheartedly believe that working as a voluteer has important benefits for both teens and society.",
        "On the one hand, many people agree with his statement for many noteworthy reasons. The most remarkable is that teenagers could gain experience and ease their chances to get a job after finishing the studies. For example, my sister sent a CV to a well-knowm enterprise, where hordes of people struggled to get hired, but because employer was fascinated about her volunteer work during high-school classes, she had become part of the business. Another key reason is that teens could acquire team work skills as they are encouraged to work in a group where they share various tasks. For instance, in Romania, children learn to work in a team by helping the community planting different types of trees.",
        "On the other hand, there are some people who think that society would take advantage as well. This is because resposabile authorities could focus more on pouring financial resources to jobs that should be paid like doctors, clerks and so on. Apart from that, the nation's appearance might be embellished when people work as voluteers by gathering all the thrown wastages. To illustrate an example, in the UK children under 17's partake in some voluteering activities by collecting recyclables wastes from the streets. Nevertheless, the most benefited from working without being paid is the young generation.",
        "All in all, when all spefic reasons and relevant examples, are considered and evaluated, I strongly agree that teenagers mght acquire essential aspects through voluteering like getting a well-paid job and team skills. However, society is also helped by beautifying it."
