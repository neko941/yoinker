        "It is true that each personal career pathway is significantly influenced by their university education. While many people believe that only young people with excellent scores should enroll in universities, I am more convinced that everyone should have access to tertiary education, even if they perform badly.",
        "On the one hand, a good academic performance can reflect students' abilities and determine whether or not they can fit into the academic environment at university. This is the major reason why universities should only accept young students with excellent marks. Students may not be ready for a higher level of education if they did not gain the necessary knowledge in high school. Additionally, the government can mobilize the funds to develop a more favorable learning environment with improved educational quality, better research capacity, and facilities for a chosen group of high-potential individuals rather than taking a chance on teaching a class of students with varying levels of ability.",
        "On the other hand, I support the idea of making universities accessible to all people, regardless of their age or level of academic ability. It is also true that high school students participate in a variety of classes. Because of this, many students may have poor overall grades while performing really well in some subjects. For instance, my friend had really poor performance in natural subjects like math and physics, which resulted in a very low average score when she graduated from high school. However, she became a top student when entering university because she is strong in the field of English and literature. As a result, individuals like my friend need to be able to join specialized university courses and build on their strengths."
