        "Despite knowing about the importance of bio-diversity for a long time,human activity has been causing massive extinction of different species. This essay will examine the main causes of loss of bio-diversity and possible solution of this problem.",
        "The leading causes of bio-diversity are changes in natural habitats, environmental pollution and finally over exploitation of resources. Nowadays, due to development, people convert available natural habitat into buildings and road. Also, pollution negatively changes the flow of energy, the chemical constitute of the environment is tends to cause the death of plants and animals. Therefore, many plants and animals go extinct due to this alteration of their natural living ecosystem by chemicals and the replacement of their habitat with infrastructures. Finally, overexploring of  animals leads to its extinction. For instance, continuous fishing in a particular river without giving time for reproduction to take place causes a gradual phase out of these fishes. Also continuous farming in a piece of land, kills the microbes that helps to boast the quality of the soil.",
        "The possible solution to curb this problem of bio-diversity  is by promoting awareness to the masses on the disadvantages of bio-diversity and the dangers it posses to humans. Furthermore, the government should pass strict regulations to protect areas that are at risk such as rivers for fishing, most natural habitats regularly visited by tourists and finally farmers need a form of incentive to know about the disadvantages of continuous farming.",
        "In conclusion, with the political will, the issue of bio-diversity will be solved and the ecosystem will be safe for plants, animals, and most importantly humans"
