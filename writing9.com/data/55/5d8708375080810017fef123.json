        "Modern technology has entered in each and every field, even agriculture sector advance due to technology. Many People believe that whether development in farming such as factory farming and fruits and vegetables created by scientific research is advantageous, while others against to this. Discuss both sides of argument in detail and explain why advancement in agriculture is useful to fulfil everyday foods need.",
        "On the one hand, there are some people who support factory farming because this is used for foods need. These days, the population of the world increases day by day and they used the land for residential. Also, this population need food to survive so more food is available and this is done by advance farming. Thus, more food is produced on less land and also scientist creates fruits and vegetables by scientific creation to stand against everyday food need. Therefore, advancement in farming is benefited to meet people hunger.",
        "On the other hand, several people against factory farming and scientific creation of fruits and vegetables because they think these are many drawbacks inform of unhealthy food.The food produced by factory farming is unhealthy as many chemicals and pesticides is used for producing food.Also the fruits and vegetables, which are created by scientists has lack of minerals, which is helpful to increase body growth.Hence, these people against factory farming.",
        "To conclude, the development in the agriculture sector has many benefits in form of enough food produce to meet the hunger of the people. So I support the advance technology in farming."
