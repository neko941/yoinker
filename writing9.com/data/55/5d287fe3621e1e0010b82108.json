        "Statistics reveal that a considerable number of people have been settling abroad for various reasons such as seeking job opportunities and for higher education.Living abroad may allow  individuals to broaden their horizons and can expose them to various cultures and environments. Generally, living abroad can benefit an individual immensely. For example, a student studying abroad may now be able to pursue his higher education at a world class  university which may not be possible in his own country. However, like all things, this has its drawbacks too.  One of the major problems living abroad is that the local language may be mostly a foreign language to an migrant  and this can have serious social and practical problems. Add your opinion and briefly describe your main ideas.",
        "Communication with the locals is crucial in a day to day life. For instance, doing grocery shopping at a local market can be quite challenging if you are not capable of speaking the local language. Although the above problem is rather petty, serious problems can arise. For an example , if the majority of the workers or customers are locals and if they cannot converse in a language that you speak, it will definitely  make life harder for you. Furthermore,simple things in life like making friends would also be rather daunting.",
        "However, some argue that the problem of not speaking the local language is not a serious problem anymore with major advancements in technology. Software developers have come up with various  application to help people translate. Some applications are even capable of translating languages  real time.In addition , they support their claim by saying that languages can be learnt  in a short period of time .This is in fact supported by statistics.",
        "To conclude, Living in a foreign country can be at times miserable if  you cannot communicate with the locals and it may even make you feel alienated. It is important to make use of the technology that is available and to pick up a foreign language as quickly as possible to lead a convenient life abroad."
