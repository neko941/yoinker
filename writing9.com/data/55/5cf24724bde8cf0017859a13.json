        "Museums are educational places which are beneficial for the people in societies. However, now a days, in some museums visitors are being charged for entrance, while many are free to go. Eeven though, charging on entry may lead to negetive effects on people, but I think, this has far more positive points.",
        "To being with, making visitors pay an admission fee to the museum can have detrimental effect on the society and establishment itself. Because, a museum is a blend of rich heritage and futuristic scientific advances, if free access is barred to such a valueable informational place, it can lead to public out cry. For example, statiscal data on the annual visitors to the Victoria's art gallery in the Bahawalpur showed 40% reduction after implying ticket. It clearly demonstrates folks have distaste for such practices.",
        "Moreover, despite of aforementioned drawbacks, enforcing tickets museums has a myriad advantages. Firstly, such earnings can cover their over head  business, like, personal cost, equipments, water and electricity bills. Secondly, a revenue would be generated which could be invested to upgrade the place, improve facilities to attract more visitors. For instance, out of many public places visited by myself, those who charge entry feewere well managed than those who do not. Hence it clearly reinstates applying some amount on admission benficial for both the establishment and the people.",
        "In conclusion, although, I recognize that ticket sales can have a negetive effect on stakeholders in societies, but these figures are justifiable if they are spent on improvement effectively."
