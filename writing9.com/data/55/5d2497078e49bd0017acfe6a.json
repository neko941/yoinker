        "Information is power. However, many individual are of the opinion that certain knowledge such as making explosives, or how to generate credit card passwords is too essential to be made free to the public and can also be disastrous. Meanwhile, others opined otherwise they believe some resources should be shared freely like formulating of drugs. This essay would vividly elucidate both side and a reasoned conclusion is reached.",
        "On the one hand, sharing of information publicly can be very dangerous, especially if it involve to create explosive. Which is usually uploaded on the internet daily. Thus, terrorist and evil minded individual can get hold of such materials as well as also use it to portray evil. A good example of this is pellucid when the 18 year old German bomber Ozil Gourten explained how he manage to make a 40 pounds CD4 bomb in the recent London bombings, which killed over 12 thousand innocent civilians from the article he read from the internet. Therefore, it is not gainsay that some type of research should be removed from the society unless with apt security clearance from concerned agencies.",
        "On the other hand, explanations on how to formulate drugs locally have over the years being shared online as well as in tropical scientific articles. This has assisted to cure certain diseases and ailments. For an instance, Lord Poscal Kosh a Swedish scientist has always put up is popular research work on how antibiotics was first formulated. This has been an encyclopedia for local chemist in developing countries. Moreover, they have used the write up to make local drugs which they consume freely with no side effects. Therefore, if he had hid is wisdom from the public the possibility of good sound health will be impeded.",
        "In summary, looking at both options I am convinced that knowledge that would cause harm to humanity should be mitigated. However, useful resources should be freely accessible to everyone."
