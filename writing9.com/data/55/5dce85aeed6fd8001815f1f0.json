        "Some said that it is not a good solution to put offenders into jails. Instead, providing educational and training programs are likely to bring more benefits. Although there are reasonable arguments about causes of an imprisonment, I am in favour of the idea of educating and training criminals.",
        "There is a convincing reason why opponents believe that offenders should be sent to prisons. This is because they committed serious crimes including drug trafficking, robbery or murder, posing many threats on citizens and society. Putting them into jails not only keeps them away potential victims but also prevents them from constantly threatening others. Taking my local area as an example, people avoided coming home or going out late some years ago due to being afraid of robbers and social problems that can happen to them any time. However, after many criminals were put into prisons by the strong campaign of the authority, the local people have had a better sense of safety when they come back home at night.",
        "However, I am of the opinion that the advantages of providing educational programs and vocational training are much greater. The first benefit is that people offending crimes are aware of the moral values in society when they are well-educated by the government, allowing them understanding their past mistakes. As a result of this, they could repay for society by talking to teenage people to deter them from making serious errors in their lives. In addition, supporting criminals by suffering career training such as plumbing, mechanics or mining creates a favorable chance of landing a job to earn a living, leading to the decrease in the crime rate in the future.",
        "In conclusion, I strongly support the notion that having access to a job training and an effective education is more of the importance for criminals."
