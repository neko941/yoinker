        "Dear Editor,",
        "I am writing this letter after having come across the  request of your magazine to receive readers opinions . I decided to write my response expressing my stand on this topic.",
        "As human progress is developing, it is inevitable that the natural world is, to some extent, impinged in order to supply the energy needs of a thriving society. According to innumerable studies which were carried out on the topic, the increasing human expansion is fostering the deterioration of the environment. The rightful claims about global warming are now exposed to global attention but ,to my mind, other key areas are ignored by public opinion.As such,I decided to illustrate my stance on a less \"hackneyed\" problem,which regards pollinators in particular.",
        "As Einstein once said \"the world would end in 8 years without bees\" and as far as society is concerned, this insects are of paramount importance in ensuring the reproduction of plants of every sort and , the ones which we derive food from in particular. Were this not enough to outline the enormous effect that living plants have on the environment, one should spare a thought on the photosynthetic process from which the oxygen we breathe ensues.",
        "the cause of pollinators depletion,  bees particularly, could be traced back to when pesticides were first employed in an attempt to fight off harmful insects,hindering them from ravaging plantations . From my standpoint, by acting as we are, chemichally wiping out detrimental pests is inducing the demise of bees as a collateral effect.",
        "it comes as no surprise that ,a world in which pesticides and poisonous treatments were no longer used would be utopian.The lack of any control on cultures would have  a disastrous outcome on global food production, which would be insufficient to supply the needs of a fast-pace developing world. What I suggest,however, is that governments should encourage scientific enquiry in those areas, bolstering the research on the topic to find new chemical or biotechnologycal-oriented solutions targeted only at a specific species and cracking down on the usage of venomous substances.",
