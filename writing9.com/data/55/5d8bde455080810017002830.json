        "Because parents are so concerned of their children, they want their children to make their best use of time. While some parents do not prefer their children to read entertainment books, other parents see it as a healthy habit. Not only reading books is beneficial to the children but it also enriches their imagination and widens their horizons.",
        "First, reading books, in general, is beneficial to the children. It is always a good practice to read books. Reading books should not be limited to reading educational books only. For instance, a child might be interested in reading about science fiction or history. Parents should let their children follow their preferences. Thus, reading books is generally beneficial to the children and it should not be limited to educational books.",
        "Moreover, reading books enriches the children mentality. Reading provides the children with new information and always teaches them new concepts. For example, when a child reads about how movies are made, he might become interested in the movie industry and he could make a career out of that, eventually. It is always better to keep the children busy with reading rather than not reading not all. Reading for entertainment is better than not reading at all.",
        "In conclusion, reading is beneficial to the children. Parents should let their children choose the content of what they read and they should not force them to read specific material. Reading widens the horizons of the children and always teaches them new information and new concepts. Parents should always encourage their children to read."
