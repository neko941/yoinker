        "Old-age is itself very complex part of life as compared to other phases. In countries like Britain where kids do not stay with their parents, there is a concept where old people tend to live together and generally, the Government pays for the nurse to look after. The question arises that who should be liable to pay for these expenses? Whether the Government or the family of these fellows should bear it? This essay will focus on the challenges being faced by people from Old age and share views on expenses too.",
        "With the growing age, everyone needs continuous care which in return comes with a cost. The fact that the Government bearing these expenses shows that the country is looking after their senior-citizens which anyone expects from his or her motherland, someone who has been an honest taxpayer, this is a way his/her country is thanking them.",
        "Although the government pays for expenditures of a nurse, I believe their family should also play a part here. As a kid, our parents have been taking care of us from the very beginning and it's the duty of their kids to take care of them too. For instance, keeping aside the nursing cost, there are a few other expenditures too like medicines, seasonal clothes, wheel chair and other supporting equipments, etc whose cost can be borne by the family in a share so the burden doesn't fall on entirely on, either, the governing authorities or just the family.",
        "In conclusion, there are certain areas of improvement which can be worked upon."
