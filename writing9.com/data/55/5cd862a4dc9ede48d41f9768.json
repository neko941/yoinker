        "With the immense help of the vaccines, our communicable and non-communicable diseases among children will be put in a stop eternally. In modern healthcare system, a number of deaths are now getting obstructed among younger people due to the prior vaccination process. Now, this essay will delineate the reasons whether the laws should be inaugurated or responsibilities from the families should be increased.",
        "Firstly, most of the people tend to argue that immunizing children should be up to their parents because there are still now less evidence in the ground. Furthermore, as the vaccination process has remained fairly new to the community, why would anyone believe to test it out with their own kids? For example, a hundred of Indian children had died in late 1990s after injecting one of the vaccines for chicken poxes in spite of no such death records in the past before. Consequently, the belief on the life-saving medicines has been passed because of the taboo.",
        "There is, however, another point to argue that forcefully changing the minds of the guardians towards immunization will save many lives than ever. Additionally, citizens don\u2019t perceive innovation or unique items seriously until or unless the authority makes it mandatory for everyone. As an illustration, after a huge road strike in Dhaka in 2019, wearing helmets while riding motorcycle had strictly maintained after the government passed the rule for the two-wheeler riders and ridees. Thus, parents should undoubtedly be pushed by the lawmakers to start immunizing their child.",
        "To conclude with, widespread medicines, which are practically life-saviors, should be taken seriously whether by the laws or by self voluntarily and the decision for immunizing or not would provide the result in the latter years."
