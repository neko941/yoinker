        "It is true that nowadays, anyone can browse the internet about history and different cultures, but it does not justify the thought that museums have to shut down. I strongly disagree about the idea, because I believe the museums are very helpful since.",
        "First, museums sometimes hold not only the culture and artefacts of the situated country, but also the relics that links to other cultures as well, however all the detailed information about our cultural facts are now available in the internet, the feeling of being there looking at the physical artefacts is much better experience. The amount of information a single museum has is priceless.",
        "Secondly, the experience and feeling when you get while visiting a museum is incomparable to modern day web browsing. While young generation often tend to learn history from books or from internet, there are reasonable amount of interest among people such as university professors, school teachers and students below 14 years still choose museums over the other methods. Schools still encourage to organize study visits to these places as well to give their pupils the chance to visually inspect their history. As a student I personally like to visit these places which I feel proud while seeing what our history looks like so many years ago.",
        "In conclusion, I believe museums should be well supported by governments and the same time the artefacts, relics and other historical things, so that it will be available to the future generation and they will have the same benefits."
