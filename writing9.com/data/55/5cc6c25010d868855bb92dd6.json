        "Education has become crucial part in a child\u2019s life. Many people believe that the education must be imparted in separate schools while others are of dissenting views and think that the learners must be encouraged to attend coeducation schools. Both these views are discussed in forthcoming paragraphs.",
        "On one hand, same sex schools have many positive points. Firstly, same gender institutions helps to communicate and share things freely, to which some children hesitate while studying in mixed schools. Secondly, these schools make children more disciplined by decreasing the rate of indulgence in any teenage fascination and sexual activities in the school premises. Last but not the least, there is minimal chance of cases of sex related discrimination as the boys are being preferred over girls in the integrated schools.",
        "On the other hand, talking about mixed schools, there are many advantages to study at these centres of learning. The foremost being is the chance of better interaction with the opposite gender; inculcating the qualities such as understanding and team work, which will prove to be helpful in later part of their lives. Moreover, it will help to be respectful for the opposite sex as it is really necessary for a healthy society. For instance, a study has shown that the students of co-ed schools are more likely to be respectful to the other gender as compared to the same sex schools. Beside this, there will be an environment of friendly completion among both girls and boys which will help in their holistic development.",
        "To conclude, both these style of giving educations have their own pros and cons. However, in my opinion, the pros of mixed schools outweighs the same sex school, thus, must be preferred."
