However, some people believe that such travel should be limited or stopped altogether to preserve the planet.\n\nHow far do you agree with this viewpoint?\n\nShould governments put measures in place to control the amount of air travel?",

        "Although there has been notable positive change in the number of cheaper airlines,journey to abroad has never been affordable.However,part of the population think that such movement should be controlled so as to keep the earth safe.In this essay,i will discuss in disagreement with the general view and my reccommedation to governments will be illustrated at the end of discussion.",
        "Firstly,there is no evidenced negative relationship between human movement by air and changes in earth's wellness.Moreover, commotion made by aircrafts is basically not on the planet's surface but in the space.For example,an aeroplane moving from kenya to Asia will only have contact with the earth's floor at the beginning of it's journey and at the end.This means that any other locomotion will be happening at the atmosphere where there are no structures wshich can be damaged by the craft.Therefore,travel by air poses almost zero risk to our planet and there is no gain in banning its use.",
        "Secondly,transportation of people is benefitial to the whole world as there will be exchange of technology,culture and human resource which will change the continents for better.For,instance,when professionals move to other countries away from their mother land in search of greener pastures,they carry their skills and knoledge with them to trade them to foreingners hence creating a positive impact to that community they go to hence making earth a better place.This can only be successful if only people are allowed to interact a far and wide.",
        "In conclusion, overseas travelling should be highly appreciated by all governments because it helps the countries compliment each other making the earth balance its ecosystem hence improving people's lives,"
