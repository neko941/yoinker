        "Paparazzi has become a brand in itself in the recent few years by following celebrities and clicking their pictures.Although the privacy of the celebrities is hampered by the same,but sometimes being famous is also not easy.I beleive that these images must not be taken and every person must have the right to protect his or her privacy.This essay will discuss about both the aspects of the topic and will be a bit more inclined towards the safeguarding of individual's privacy.",
        "The public in general follow celebrities and famous individuals and ofcourse remain interested in their lives , however it is important to understand that apart from being superstars they are also normal people with a basic life and familiy and it creates immense pressure on them and their families to always be in the supervision of so many cameras.Nobody can be perfect all the time and sometimes when they get clicked with not so good images ,they are trolled insensitively.For example,I visited corbett national park an year ago and a famous singer named sonu nigam was there too on a vacation and he had to hide himself with goggles and mask to avoid being seen by many people.Privacy is the right of every indidual whether a celebrity or a simple bank clerk.",
        "Athough privacy is important but we see that now a days famous people have also adapted themselves with such paparazzi type behaviour and they gain popularity through the same.Sometimes,it becomes a win win situation for both.The celebrities also have started liking being clicked and followed and enjoy the fame and dress themselves for the same.For instance,airport looks have become so common now a days because of the same reason.Karan johar ,the famous indian director once said in an interview that he doesnt like when he goes to the airport and does not find paparazzi there as he has prepared and dressed himself for the occasion.",
        "In conclusion clicking pictures and invading anyone's privacy without the consent cannot be considered right but if the celebrity does not have a problem with it,then it is absolutely fine.Striking a balance between right and wrong is the key to almost all the problems in the world."
