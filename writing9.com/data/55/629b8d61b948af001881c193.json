        "This is Karina and I am senior product manager from IT department. I am writing this letter to express our difficulty and concern on current parking situation at our office building. Currently, only 500 parking spaces are provided to over 700 staff in this building. As you clearly see that allocated parking space is not sufficient for us at all and most of us bring the car to office due to its remote location from the city center and poor commute option.",
        "Therefore, I am suggesting to have your attention to introduce a fixed parking permission slip instead of practicing first-come-first-serve parking depending on staff's residential location registration. Being part of the IT team, I can help you come up with a list of all staff residential location for you to decide whom to issue parking permission slip. However, I am still open for any solution which you would be thinking to solve this issue like providing the ferry service.",
        "Last but not least, parking is essential for us to come office worry free every morning as it could even take up to an hour looking for available parking nearby office. It will long time leave an impact on our productivity by wasting time for parking issue.",
        "Looking forward to hearing your opinion on this and addressing this issue timely.",
        "Thank you so much in advance.",
        "Yours faithfully,",
