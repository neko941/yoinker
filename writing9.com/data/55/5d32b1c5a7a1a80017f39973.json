        "Healthy and active kids remain a significant part of every nation. Obese children are increasingly becoming a severe problem for several affluent countries. This essay will discuss that unhealthy diet and lack of physical activity of students is having a severe impact on their physical, mental and psychological wellbeing.",
        "A wholesome diet should be carefully balanced with carbohydrates, proteins and vitamins. Even though we all recognize the benefits of a nutritional meal, the consumerism around us forces youngsters to get attracted to sugary drinks, packaged foods, chips, burgers and other foods with unsaturated fats. As per the recent medical survey, children who eat out at fast-food joints at least twice a week tend to have 40% more chance of suffering from cardiovascular diseases by the age of 35. In this manner, an unplanned and unbalanced diet is severely impacting the present and future health of the youngsters.",
        "With the advent of smartphones and iPads, kids devote an enormous amount of time with these gadgets at the cost of their exercise period. A recent MIT study has concluded that children born after 1990 spend 45% less time on physical and emotional activities compared to their counterparts before 1990. This is severely impacting a youthful person\u2019s physical and mental health.",
        "While poorer countries are struggling with malnourished kids, prosperous ones tend to suffer from stout youngsters. Unless we take care of proper diet, physical activity and restrictions on gadget usage, kids with health troubles and lack of emotional balance will remain a significant problem for rich countries. Can a nation be developed by having physically and mentally ill children?"
