        "These days people have had difficulty in maintaining balance between their work and personal life. While, the main problems could be related to stressful jobs and contemporary living standards, solutions, such as, work-life balance and fixed working hours could be suggested.",
        "To commence with,  the problem of prime importance is that  people have become workaholics. That is to say, in order to meet the daily expenditures people tend to commute continuosly. Consequently, this trend leads to immbalance between their personal life and jobs. Secondly, people have adopted the trend of consumerist society, which is the reason why people tend to commute to maintain the standards of modern life. This has resulted in mental related disrorders and even nervous breakdown in some people. To illustrate, according to a survey conducted by American journal of medicine, most of the stress and anxiety is related to work in individuals. Therefore, it is hard to retain balance between life and work due to pressure of job and artificial standards of living.",
        "On the other hand, certain solutions could be suggested in order to mitigate this problem. Firstly, people should have a fixed working schedule, which could enable them free time for their families and children. This would encourage them to perform better in their companies as well as prevent them from getting depressive disorders. If companies tend to have regular work-shifts rather than long duty rosters then this would certainly alleviate the problem of long working hours. Another thing is that, perhaps, people could live a simple contented lifestyle rather than shouldering towards modern living. This would certainly save alot more money and in this way it could prevent them from working hourly long. Hence, it is important for people to lead a simple life and work for fixed hours to maintain a balanceful life.",
        "To conclue, it is imperative that people do not work rigorously to keep pace with modern world. Unless, they continue to work under a fixed job roster and do not follow the artificial life styles, this situation cannot be tackled."
