        "It is argued, whether the developed nation should give shelter to its refugees and offer them basic needs such as food and housing. This essay completely agrees with this perspective because those states possess enough resources to support needy people and the support, these people find could save many lives eventually.",
        "Firstly, the regions which are financially sound also acquire enough resources to support those people who are in need. These communities are economically strong and have sufficient human resources to support those people who seek asylum. For instance, Australia has very high Gross domestic product and its per capita income is one of the topmost. Therefore, it is its duty to aid who are needy.",
        "Lastly, the assistance provided by these realms could save many lives. People do not want to leave their countries until and unless it is serious and life threatening. As a result, if they are accepted by other countries, then it could save their own as well as the life of their family. For e.g. United State of America welcomed many refugees from Bhutan who abandoned their homeland because their life was in jeopardy due to civil war and now this action, by USA enabled these people to start the new life. Hence, it is very crucial for wealthy countries to aid these sorts of people.",
        "In conclusion, this essay agrees that it is very necessary for the wealthy governments to provide support to the refugees because they reserve resources which is not only sufficient to help these people, but also help them start their new life which is otherwise impossible."
