        "In recent times, the desire to be financially independent has made many people opting to work for themselves as against being employed by an organization. While this is a great idea in many ways, there are many problems like bankruptcy and failure that could be experienced in the process.",
        "To start with, financial independency is a major influence affecting people\u2019s decision in choosing to have a personal business rather than working with an establishment. To illustrate, as an entrepreneur, managing one\u2019s business avail people the opportunity to have control over their funds and source of income. This, coupled with many other easily avoidable challenges, attributed to working for others like, unsatisfactory work conditions, disrespectful and overbearing bosses, make people choose to be self-employed. In other words, people get to manage their lives, make rightly and timely decisions, have proper evaluation of self-worth and in general enjoy a fulfilled life for doing what they love.",
        "However, one of the major problem facing having personal business is the failure of not meeting up to expectations. To buttress, many people are compelled to startup a new business as a result of the victimization they are faced with in their current jobs and not because they have the capacity to do so. This makes the business lifespan in most cases to be ephemeral due to the lack of funding, planning and technical knowhow as evidently seen in 2018 annual business report, which shows that 80 percent of new businesses fold up in their first year. Another issue is the inability to secure a target market since many of the so called big companies\u2019 products are household name in many homes.",
        "In conclusion, there is an uptrend in the number of personal business owners due to the willingness to be financially free and this undoubtedly, comes with high failure rates of many businesses as a result inadequate funding and difficulty in getting demands for their products"
