        "Nowadays, children are occupied with lots of things such as schoolwork and gadget. Many believe that due to their busy schedules, most teen spend most of their time indoors and therefore lack natural world exposure. In this essay, I will discuss why minimal exposure of the natural world makes children lack knowledge of natural environment and why they will not be aware to save nature.",
        "To begin with, not all knowledge about the natural world can be learned indoors. Even though school teaches students the aspects of the natural environment, it is important for them to see it in person. Types of plants, for instance, is an important thing for the youngster to understand in order to know which plants are edible and which are dangerous for consumption. If they fail to differentiate them, they may consume poisonous plants that are dangerous for them. Natural sites including glazer, forests, and volcanoes are another important thing for children to see. Society is trying to rehabilitate many destroyed forests, but if most of them have never seen the forest, how will they save something they have never seen themselves?",
        "Lack of natural world exposure makes children not aware to save the nature. Since they  have minimal exposure of the natural enviroment in the first place, they will not have a sense of belonging and also the importance of saving nature. Theoretical knowledge is useless without practical skills. For instance, children learned how trees can save the earth from global warming, but without the skill of planting trees, this information is going to be useless. The efforts of saving the earth will only be plans without concrete actions.",
        "In conclusion, most children are now busy with indoor activities. This has led them to have low exposure of the natural world. As a result, they will lack information of the natural world and they will not be aware to save nature when they grow up."
