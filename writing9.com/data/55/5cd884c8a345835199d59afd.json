        "It is generally argued that provision of variety of sports facilities is the best measure to improve public health. However, others claim that additional measures are needed since increased number of sports facilities would have minimal impact on health of public. I believe that both of these arguments are correct and a combination of both will provide better results in terms of public health.",
        "Providing facilities like cycling, development of jogging tracks and increased number of fitness centres is a mandatory step towards better community health. This will lure the general public into adopting habit of regular exercise. For example, it is usually observed that residents of developed countries are more keen in taking regular exercise as compared to people of developing world. This is mainly due to increased number of sports facilities.",
        "On the other hand, however, another school of thought proposes that additional measures are also needed. These may include running of advertisements on bill boards, controlled sale of fast food items and carbonated beverages. In addition, availability of state-of-the-art health facilities is equally as important. For instance, welfare states like Denmark have an established system of combination of public awareness, controlled sale of food products and a well developed health system. Therefore, overall health status of people of Denmark is appreciable.",
        "To conclude, I think that the best way towards improved level of community health is imcreased number of sports facilities along with other measure like better health care system and controlled sale of edibles. A combination of both of these proposals will ensure a healthy general public"
