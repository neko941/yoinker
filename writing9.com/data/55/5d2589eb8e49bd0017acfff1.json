        "Now a days ,Taking selfies are trending in every part of the world .some individual believe that taking pictures shouldn't be allowed,in other words it is completly controlling there private life.On the other hand other feel that this is just to become famous .In my essay both sides are discussed appropriately.",
        "First of all,celebrities are also known to be a normal people.They have same life style that others do .Because of paparazzi they can't even walk on the road ,due to this not only affecting there life other family member in there life also getting indulged in it .last year when Actor Tom Cruise was divorsed there were lot of photos published of the actor as well as his ex- wife at that time his daughter was worsly included in that controversies.that is why this paparazzi should be abondoned.",
        "On the other side ,Some famous people allow paparazi to others because this make them more fame than others .In a MTV magazine kim kardeshian allowed them to post more than 20 half-nude pics so that she get more fame than her sisters .furthermore Merlin monrow was publicized due to her pose on some newspapers.Even now a days there are lot applications which make them fame by sitting at home.the only thing they have to do take a self picture and edit it like a proffessional way.",
        "In conclusion There are lot of people who live there life like a normal person and will be down to earth with no pictures because they believe it is being covered other individuals in the family.but others like kim kardesian ,merlin monroe who actually wanted to showcase there lifestyle to public so they get more fame ."
