        "A large number of governments believe that their economic progress must be a priority, while some people think that development in other fields is equally important. I agree with the second statement and I will explain my reasons in the forthcoming paragraphs.Firstly, nowadays, the economy of a country plays a significant role in improving the conditions",
        "of people who live  there.for instance, America has the highest rate of production and exportation  of all countries, since it has the most technologically advanced companies in the world like Apple or Facebook, which have a market cap of billions of dollars, resulting in the US having the most powerful economy in the world.on the other hand, if the governments only care about their economic goals, they may become weak in one particular area. For instance, there are some countries that are powerful economically, but have a poor performance in other areas such as education or technology.for example, United Arab Emirates has a powerful economy due to the high amount of oil they export to other countries, but has an awful performance in education. As a result,the number of educated people is quite low in this country.",

        "it can affect the other parts  as well."
