        "The evolution gave us the main way of survival, that adaptability is. Nevertheless, it is not the same harsh rule to alter or die as the ancient law of nature. Whereas, we still struggle with eternal changes of society.",
        "Firstly, it became harder to face altering of our everyday routine because human tend to feel more conservative. Our century is not considered as an era of wars, global migrations, that results in being addicted to actual benevolent way of living. For example, it is very annoying for most citizens of the first world countries to get rid of their ameneties and they consider it a catastrophy.",
        "Despite this fact, the main incentieve for us to be opened for changes is understanding that most shifts of a modern society are progressive and they lead to better implementation of technologies. However, a competiveness is a phenomenon that is really frightening, it implements an idea of a better result for a lower price.",
        "On the other hand, we can expatiate over some unpredictable end even disasterous changes. Futhermore, we need measures to prevent such changes, that is given by a state. The knowledge of social awareness is crucial for everyone. Hence, society is sure that they are safe from dire straights.",
        "In conclusion, I reckon that society should divide all changes to dangerous and positive ones. We need to be aware of the first category and we should have an agile mindset to understand the inevitableness of the second one. Moreover, the assurance of a safety given by a state will make us feel that some changes are vital."
