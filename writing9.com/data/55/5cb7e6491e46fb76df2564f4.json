        "With the rapid development of the technology, most of the household equipment has evolved and become fully automated appliances. This improvement leads women to have much free time to do a job and improve overall income to family. However, if both the parents are working, then there is a high possibility to children to misbehave.",
        "Because of the growing economy, living cost in every part of the world has increased enormously. If both parents are working, that can significantly increase the overall income. With a good earing, a family can have a luxurious life without any problem. For example, a recent study showed that 78% of economically stable families have their both parents work. Thus, it is good to have both mother and father working in a family, so, they can have more stable income.",
        "Even though, a steady income can provide all the necessities to a family, without both parents at home, their children may do nasty things. Since they don\u2019t have an adult to look after them, they will have enough freedom to play video games, watch adult contents on internet or even can take drugs. For instance, a recent police report showed in Sri Lanka, 65% of teenage drug takers are with a family background where mother is also working. Hence, having both parents working for a company may lead to have detrimental impact on children's future.",
        "In conclusion, to face with the demanding basic requirements, it is good if women also can contribute to strength the family income. But this can also lead to some devastating impacts on children\u2019s life including drug addiction. In my opinion, despite the amount of money you get, mothers should stay at home and look after their children and lead them to have a better future."
