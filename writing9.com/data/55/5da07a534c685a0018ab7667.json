        "In a classroom or in a meeting we learn something every time or have discussions on various topics. If the teacher or meeting head says something which is incorrect, it should be amended, so that everyone knows what is right. There are various ways to correct the leader or teacher during discussion but in my opinion it is best to wait until the class or meeting is over and no crowd is there and then have a word with the teacher or meeting head because of the following reasons that I will explain in the following passage.",
        "First of all, I believe that we must do respect to our teachers or the person who is conducting the meeting in a room. We always learn something from our teacher or leaders and their motive to conduct classes or meeting is to teach something or clear our doubts. They do not make mistakes deliberately. They are humans also so they can do mistakes sometimes without realising that they have done it. So it is not good to interrupt them in between the lecture or discussion as they may feel disrespected. My personal experience is a compelling example of this. Once I was in the meeting room along my colleagues and I was leading the entire team. I had to conduct a meeting. I did a mistake while giving a presentation and one of my colleagues pointed my mistake in front of other meeting members that i felt offended.",
        "Secondly, I think that while pointing the mistake during lecture or meeting will cause distraction in the class or in a meeting room. The professor or the leader might feels disturbed when suddenly pointed out by someone and may lose the confidence. For instance, I had to present a presentation in my class and everything was going smoothly and I was so confident while representing myself in front of my entire class. Suddenly, one of my class fellows interrupted me and pointed out my mistake. I got disturbed by her hindrance and lost my confidence.",
        "Hence, I believe that it is better to discuss doubts or mistakes at the end of class or a meeting so that the professor or a leader will not feel disrespected and does not lose the confidence"
