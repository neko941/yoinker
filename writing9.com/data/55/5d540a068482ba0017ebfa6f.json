        "At present, increasing number of tourists are willing to take the risk of exploring destinations with extreme conditions. Even though it can be an adventurous and fulfilling experience which can give them a sense of achievement, it can sometimes prove to be highly dangerous and at times fatal.",
        "There are certainly some benefits of visiting extreme places. One might feel proud at what they have been able to achieve which can make them feel positive and adventurous. For example, climbing to the top of the Everest requires a lot of will power, stamina and most of all, determination. And the experience of achieving such a feat would be remarkable and would definitely uplift a person\u2019s belief in one\u2019s abilities.",
        "Having said that, there are several reasons why one has to stay away from visiting such challenging locations. They are mostly remote areas and in case of health related problems or an injury, it can become very hard to find help or medical facility for treatment. In one such case, a couple who recently visited a remote park in the USA slipped and fell into a valley, although they were alive for some time after the fatal fall, no one knew that they were there as it was an isolated location and by the time they were traced, they had already passed away.",
        "To conclude, it is clear that holidaying at places with challenging settings can sometimes be fun and uplifting. However, they also pose a number of dangers worth looking at before deciding whether one is fit and capable of taking up the trip."
