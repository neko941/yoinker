        "Nowadays, there are many accidents that happen on the roads, some people think the best way to reduce and prevent these is to limit the speed of several vehicles. However, there are also several ways to stop these unwanted incidents. In this essay, I will discuss both points of views and give my opinions to support the arguments.",
        "First of all, there are many solutions that can be made in order to improve road safety. One of them is to set the maximum speed for each vehicle. This is a good idea because people will have to aware of their speed and they will be conscious and more careful about their surroundings, which will certainly reduce the accidents on the road.",
        "However, there are also many solutions that can be introduced. For example, they can set up the laws for people who use their phone during driving because when they are driving and using their phone at the same time, it reduces their consciousness and attention, which can easily distract the drivers and cause the accidents to happen. Moreover, governments should also improve the condition of roads, for instance the countryside in Thailand, their condition of the roads are very poor, so the accidents are always occurring unexpectedly, even though people are already aware about them.",
        "Nevertheless, there are plenty of resolutions, but the most important and the easiest is to reduce the speed and limit the speed for certain areas such as schools, hometowns, crosswalks.  Even though governments can create laws to assure reduce the accidents, but if people do not follow the rules and still careless when they are driving, the accidents can still happen.",
        "To conclude, set up the speed for vehicles is one of the best way to improve the condition of roads, but there are also many ways to resolve the problems. Those are preventing driving and using phone in the same time, improving the roads condition and etc. that can be done with the collaboration from people."
