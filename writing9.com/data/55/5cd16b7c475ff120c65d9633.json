        "Some people believe that learning about certain cultures through visiting different places is not necessary and we could get information from books, films, and the internet. In my opinion, I totally disagree with this opinion. I believe we cannot get whatever we want to know from media and traveling is an essential way to know about cultures.",
        "Knowledge learned from culture-related books, films, and the internet is not comprehensive. it is extremely difficult to find a book covering all information about the culture that people want to learn about due to the fact that there is hardly an author who writes about all aspects of one culture. Moreover, not only are many films, books produced for the sake of entertainment but they may also cover the wrong information. Many information presented in books or films in order to meet business demands instead of serving as a source of knowledge. And also, it is hard to judge whether information on the internet is true or not because of the anonymity of the internet. So a large amount of cultural knowledge cannot be known about from books and other media.",
        "I am of the opinion that traveling to the place where people would like to get acquainted with the culture is very necessary. Travelers could learn about local culture and customs through firsthand experience rather than others' thinking and opinions written in books. For instance, tourists have the chance to take part in local traditional festivals, try local food, and visit history museums, which cannot be accessed by reading books or watching films. Being exposed to other areas helps people learn what the culture really is and how this culture is born, developed, and merged.",
        "In conclusion, going to a place can bring a lot of practical experience which cannot be provided by reading books, watching films, and surfing the internet."
