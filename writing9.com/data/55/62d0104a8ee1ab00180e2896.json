        "Education plays a significant role in everyone's life and school are the door of education.  I agree with the statement that whenever any student go to a new school, it is very common to have some issues, as a ,result school plays an important part in solving  this problem no matter which student is having them.  In my opinion, there are two possibilities school can help their students to solve any problem, which I will explore in this essay.",
        "First, as an initial point; I would like to say that, students who are new in school they sometimes have hesitation to ask or to talk with anyone about their concerning matters. For this, I think that there should be a complaint box in every class. Students can write their issue on a paper and then can place that paper in that box, which later on could be seen by the class teacher. Hence, teacher can talk to the student directly and aid him in solving  the matter. For example, I remember, we used to have such types of boxes in my school and on the first day of my school, I felt very alone  as I was not having any friends in the class. The next day I write this on a paper, which was later on was seen by my teacher and she introduced me to the class and helps me in making friends.",
        "Subsequently, due to the new environment of the school, some students don't adapt easily, they still miss their old school and want to go there only. In such type of ,situation school can add more fun activities for the students, which help them in adapting slowly. Moreover, they can also teach their students while playing, such as come puzzle games activities, which make them to learn things easiy during playing.",
        "In conclusion, I believe that education plays a very significant role in everyone's life and so the school. It is obvious to have few problems when going to a new school,  therefore I think that, with the help of a complaint box and by increasing fun activities for students, any issue could be solved ."
