        "Nowadays, people are enjoying longer life and expectancy of life is increasing by each passing day due to improvements in health department. I believe there are more positive aspects of this modification than its drawbacks.",
        "To begin with, one of the main negative effect of longer life is that it will increased the number of over aged population which will directly become a headache for the governments. For example, old people get retirement when they reach to a certain age and after that they do not able to work and living their life on the pension which is pay by the governments. Moreover, as people live longer and do not work the government have to bear the expense for a handful time and must provide fundamental facilities like free medical or provide accommodation and become a burden. This is why, extensive life and higher life expectancy is a dilemma for the world.",
        "In contrast, living long and rise in life expectancy has myriad of benefits. As a result of optimized medical techniques human are living for a long time and their life expectancy has extended which gives opportunity to the people to work after the retirement as well and due to this reason some countries has enhanced the age limit for the retirement. Furthermore, longer life will help the world by different means which will be helpful for the world to be a better place to live. For instance, old people have more experience and understanding they can use their skills as a lecturer or scientist. Because of above mentioned reasons having a long life and higher expectancy rate is beneficial for the world.",
        "In summation, although there are some disadvantage of the lengthy lifespan and more life expectancy but advantages are more than disadvantages. I believe, it is a blessing for the world to have long life time and low mortality rate which will improve the quality of life in the world ."
