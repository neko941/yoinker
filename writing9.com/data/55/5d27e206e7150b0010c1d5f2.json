        "It has been a debate whether a learning institution or a home is responsible to teach youngsters about their healthy lifestyles. Undoubtedly, both of these institutes have their own role to play, but in my opinion, pupils should be provided with enough information about their health through their teachers rather than their parents.",
        "Most importantly, the knowledge of wellbeing in children in their primary level education helps towards the prosperity of the country. That is to say, if the young ones acquire knowledge about fitness in their early age, then this could help them live longer, which in turn, allow them to serve their nation to strengthen its economy by making contributions such as paying taxes. Moreover, the healthy people are also very efficient and effective while performing in every sector, such that it becomes a competitive advantage for a state.",
        "Moreover, people develop most of their habit with young age. It is known that a person could not change his behaviour very easily which he already habituates himself while he was a child. For instance, Sigmund Freud said that an adult\u2019s habit would be shaped from the time he was born and the guidance he gets in his childhood plays a vital role to determine his adulthood. Therefore, it is very important for primary institutes to provide enough facts about healthiness to their young scholars.",
        "In conclusion, I believe schools should also focus on providing education related to hygiene and fitness to their students apart from regular courses because not only this could help towards the provision of healthy workforce to the country but also people develop many of their habits in their youth."
