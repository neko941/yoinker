        "Nowadays, it is the very common and easily available meal and drinks which contains a large amount of sugar. Many people think that these products should be available at a higher cost so that people think twice to purchase them. I completely agree with this statement. This essay will discuss my viewpoints in the forthcoming paragraphs.",
        "To begin with, sugary products are dangerous for our health. It leads to some serious diseases such as obesity, heart attack, high level of cholesterol and so on. For instance, a survey conducted by the Indian government found that 65% of people consume sugary products and they have  problems with obesity and diabetes. Furthermore, folk are consuming these products because of their taste and the company labels these products with attractive images but never mentioned the quantity of sugar and calories.",
        "Moreover, I think that cost of such products such as fast food and soda drink should be hiked and the prices of  healthier meals should be less so people definitely will go for a healthier diet. To illustrate, in  Germany, there are higher prices are for fast food and also this food is available at fewer prices. The people of Germany are healthier than any other country in the world.",
        "To conclude, in my opinion, this is sure that an increase in prices will definitely decrease  eating high sugary products."
