        "In recent times, it has been discovered that nations around the globe would experience major issues regarding its biosphere, human resource and learning process. However, problems to be experienced are largely peculiar to different societies. As a result, I am of the view that the main difficulties that might be experienced by my country are terrorism and economic recession.",
        "One major challenge that my country has the potentiality of encountering if appropriate actions are not taken is terrorism. In fact, there has been a pocket full of acts of insurgency experienced in various states of the federation, mainly because of the drastic fall in the level of employment. Furthermore, the rise in the rate of unemployment has caused youth unrest and has a direct impact on the rise of the act of hooliganism in the country.  For instance, the Nigerian Army recently issued a press release, encouraging parents to properly monitor the activities of their children as a religious sect,  Boko Haram, is out recruiting young unsuspecting youths into their sect to execute the act of terrorism. Another possible issue the country might experience  is economic downturn, this is because of the fall in the exchange rate of the country's currency. Indeed, the fall in the value of naira would weaken its purchasing power and as such would make basic items costly,  if not beyond the purchasing capability of ordinary citizens,  thereby,  plunging them into extreme poverty.",
        "Nevertheless, I believe that if my country's administration creates job through the public service,  it would reduce the level of employment. Also,  relevant authorities should encourage out of job Individuals to embrace self employment by going into private business.  Additionally, the government should be ready to sponsor,  give tax incentives and provide adequate loan facilities at a zero interest rate for interested individuals.  Also, in the area of terrorism,  financial reward should be given to individuals who can furnish the appropriate authority with useful information on the activities of any extremely groups. In addition,  different public fora that would aid adequate enlightenment of the citizens on the ills of terrorism should be sponsored by government bodies and Non- Governmental Organisations.",
        "To conclude, while there is the possibility of social and economic ills in the country In the next decade, taking the right steps, such as,  job creation, proper education of members of the public on the consequences of terrorism,  availability of tax reliefs,  loan facilities and funding programs, would mitigate these impending dangers."
