        "In the modern era , a number of work was done by  machine ,on the contrary, it did by people  the people so this essay explores the disadvantages of this statement.",
        "First of all , numerous people left their jobs due to the advanced technology and become unemployed , for example , a single machine does the same work as 10 people  , consequently , they lost their  task , owing to the technology and without it , they feel like handicapped.",
        "Moreover , it impacts  their family budget and facing an economic crisis for the reason that they left the workshop , for instance , nowadays ,  farming technology become popular rather than in the past , as a result , labour cannot get work to do farming in the field. Furthermore , most  the things are not too good as compared with handmade items , due to  some reason , for instance , there are lots of  differences between those made by machines and people.",
        "On the other hand , it can fulfil the demand of items , due to get thousands of things in a minute , it works fast rather than individual , for instance , many objects which takes time when it made by people , on the contrary , while machines established in just a minute. Secondly , these types of thing is available in a very cheap range due to the material , for instance , they only focus on stock so that they use low material to produce it , consequently , everyone can purchase it and they can meet their needs.",
        "In conclusion , both are important to the development of a country's economy so we can not avoid any single thing but the government should work on the handmade businesses to establish them."
