        "It is widely accepted by one group of people that kids supposed to stay with family all their off hours. Opposers, however, complain of negative sides. In this essay two sides will be stated. From my point of view, the children\u201cs growing should include interact with peers.",
        "Admittedly, parents or their replaces act as role model. In other words grown-ups copy their codes of conduct and absorb conventions, hopefully leading to absence of several issues. And this undertaking, undoubtedly, results in settling ground rules. Furthermore, spending time with family offers a chance, to some extent, control the familiarities and actions. For instance, the folks are in real-time awareness about conversations, activities and infatuations by spending as much as possible time with their children. Reducing the risk of crimes like abduction or coming under the negative pressure of peers is the another argument.",
        "On the contrary, every boy and girl deserve rights to spend time without parents and several factors contribute to beneficiality. Firstly, engaging in social life with friends maintain basic skills such as team skills, collaborating and negotiating skills, as well as emotional field including empathy and regretting. In order to be self-dependent the offspring should abandon the comfort zone of parental care. Consequently, growing up will reach a successful life with skills of socializing. In addition, peers can enhance one\u201cs creativity and imagination by involving a kid to a activities.",
        "To sum up, while wasting spare time with family seems superficially advantageous, the lack of interact with peers is serious drawback. Instead, going out with friends offers superb opportunities."
