        "For example , last year  research by environmental scientists has done that plastic is a non-biodegradable polymer and it is the biggest source of influence of making abuse.",
        "Another aspect is awareness . Masses have low awareness of  deterioration. So it is a big deal to help pollute the abuse . ,Also some individuals have swept away the waste material in the river which  is the primary reason for drinking pollution.",
        "Shifting towards another problem , drinking infection produced many hurdles for  animals and human activity . drink corruption decreases the  pH level of the drink . To explain it , when the animals use this rain . They faced many diseases. For example , in the new article  according to  scientific research  2000 animals  died in 2022 from drinking this water . Although , this drink takes an impact on human life also . Hence , rain Pollution produces many hurdles and disses for marine growth and human life.",
