        "There is no doubt that money management is a fundamental topic, which many people think should be discussed in the school. I strongly agree with the following statement and will provide arguments to support my view.",
        "One key reason for teaching such a serious subject in schools is the fact that age plays a vital role in forming a financially literate mind. In fact, kids are prone  to grasp information more quickly than adults, leaving some time for more advanced understanding later on. To illustrate this point, imagine a five year old pupil who has heard, for the first time, how to appropriately accumulate some petty cash that were given to him by parents in order to buy some toys that parents would not allow to get him otherwise. In that way, young individuals start to comprehend the value and particular possibilities that come with correct money management.",
        "There is, however, another interesting fact about the early financial education, and that is how adolescents can potentially benefit from it in their upcoming adult years. Numerous studies have consistently found that children, who were approached by their parents with the money topics at an early age, seem more independent financially compared to those without related conversations earlier in the childhood. To prove the point, while financial literacy could be acquired at any point of life, it seems reasonable to assume that school time is the most suitable period which undoubtedly will significantly contribute to students\u2019 financial success in their later years.",
        "As such, it can be concluded that management of one\u2019s finances can and should be taught in schools, in my opinion, as the young mind contemplates information well and acknowledged students would have a baggage of information needed for the grown-up circumstances related to money."
