        "Nowadays, there is no doubt people are provided with a large source of food. In fact, many people prefer to consume food produced in other regions rather than in the local ones. While this trend may have some disadvantages, I believe the advantages are far greater.",
        "It is understandable why some people do not like to eat food grown in other areas. The key reason is that the competition in the food market may cause many disadvantages for local producers. As a result, they would lose profits because they have to reduce prices to compete with other manufacturers. Moreover, transportation of food from one place to another would release a huge amount of carbon dioxide, which in turn would damage the environment heavily.",
        "Despite the disadvantages I mentioned above, there are a huge number of advantages brought to people consuming more food from other areas. Firstly, these consumers could have a variety of food options. Hanoi is a typical example of this situation. Hanoians can now enjoy water spinach (rau mu\u1ed1ng), an important part of Vietnamese diet, as it is now grown all year in agricultural regions in Southern Vietnam. Secondly, while competition may increase, food companies could expand their business to potential markets. Therefore, more job opportunities would be created, which would bring a number of benefits to the whole economy.",
        "In conclusion, while the consumtion of food grown in other areas may causes many pressing troubles for local producers, I am convinced that the benefits are more significant."
