        "In recent years, the debate surrounding how to decide a career has been highly discussed. Many believe that the enjoyability of the job should be prioritised, whilst others believe that a better salary is the definition of a better future. Both views will be discussed before an opinion is reached.",
        "In order to survive in the current world, it is necessary that people have an adequate amount of money. When a person does not prioritise their income, they will often find themselves in financial trouble. For example, people who enjoy working as teachers often complain about the low pay and longer hours. Although, they are doing what they enjoy, they cannot ignore the increasing fiancial stress which leads to disastrous effects on ones mental health. However, if they had chosen a job based on their salary then they would not be going through these rough patches.",
        "By finding a job, you have defined the path you have for your own future. By pursuing a career in something you like, it means that you will never have any regrets and continue to love what you do for the years to come. To illustrate, often it is found that people who pursue a career in something they love have no regrets and have a better outlook in life in contrast to those who are dictated by money. This results in a well balanced life and better mental health which is very important in the future.",
        "In conclusion, although a higher paying job would lead to a more luxurious job, I believe it is essential to love your profession as it plays an important part in your mental well being."
