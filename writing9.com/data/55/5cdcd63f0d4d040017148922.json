        "Opinions are divided on whether the best approach to know about news is newspapers or other media such as internet is more effective . Although the newspaper plays an important role in accessing to news. I believe that internet , TV and other media are more effective to inform people about what is happening around the world.",
        "On the one hand, the newspaper is much reliable as newspapers have many professional journalists see it as their duty to differentiate between true news and fake news. Moreover, the newspaper is the easiest approach to access to news due to the wide distribution of newspapers. In contrast, there are lots of people who have no opportunity or are unwilling to access to Internet, like the poor and the elderly. Consequently, they have no choice but to read newspapers to know about news. In view of these reasons, some people believe that newspapers is still the best way to learn about news.",
        "On the other hand, other media like internet has its own incomparable advantages. Firstly, internet enables people to have access to news in real time on different devices at any place, which provides much efficient way to access to news. In addition, people can share articles they have read and express their opinions on social media. For example, there are tons of people who are happy to share news on twitter and Facebook everyday.",
        "In conclusion, i believe that learning about news by browsing news websites on the internet is more effective than by reading newspapers due to the timeliness and efficiency of the internet."
