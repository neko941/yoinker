        "It is essential to keep the area where we live free from harm. This harm could be in various forms. Although people are aware of this, many do not make it a point to duty to ensure their environs are properly maintained. This essay will discuss how lack of awareness and cost of maintenance are the major reasons that leads to poor human attitude to environmental protection. In addition, solutions will be proffered to how these problems can be averted.",
        "However, most individuals already have the basic knowledge that it is vital to live in a well looked after environment, but they do not see it as their responsibility to take charge of it. They are unaware of the severe damages of this unhealthy practises may cause in the long term. Some believe that only the government should pay attention to it. Also, it is expensive to take care of the environment therefore people tend to shy away from the cost of ensuring their area is free from all kinds of environmental harm. For example, in Lagos plethora of people dump their wastes by the road side expecting the government to help clean it up and cater the refuse away.",
        "The issues surrounding protecting the environment can best be solved both by the government and the individuals living in a given area. Government can develop policies to encourage people to take it as a duty to ensure these problems are put to a halt. A reward scheme for the most cautious person and a punishment plan for defaulters. Awareness campaigns and seminars should be scheduled on a regular basis to keep the public informed of the dangers of residing in an unsafe environment. This way more person will get interested in making it their business.",
        "In conclusion, in as much as many have a general idea of why a clean and safe environment is paramount, people do not want to be involved in the process due to lack of indebt knowledge about its dangers. Everyone which includes the government and the public have a role to play in ensuring we live in an environmentally secure society."
