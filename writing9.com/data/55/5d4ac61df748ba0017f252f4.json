        "Many families have decided to put their elders in care homes. While that have its merits such as providing them with the professional care they need, it has its demerits especially that many seniors may suffer from depression and loneliness. In the following lines both the positives and negatives of putting seniors citizens in nursing homes will be thoroughly discussed.",
        "To begin with, the nursing homes consider to be the best home for the elderly; in other words, they grant the safety and the medical care for the elderly which is very difficult to be achieved in their family homes. For example, according to an article which has been recently published in New York Times, 60% of American seniors live in care homes. Thus, it can be said that the nursing homes are helpful and indispensable to many elders.",
        "Nevertheless, despite the advantages previously mentioned, the nursing homes have their demerits especially that many elderly fear moving into a nursing home because they see it as a final step before the end of their life which can lead them to isolation and depression. For instance, according to a survey which has been recently carried out by Oxford University, 60 % of elderly suffer from depression in their first months in nursing homes. Thus, it is highly recommended that families have to visit their elderly many times and listen to their problems.",
        "Have shown the both aspects of the nursing homes, it can be concluded that the care homes have their merits and demerits. It is expected that nursing homes will spread as they are essential for many seniors."
