        "Happiness is a word that many people want to truly feel. However, people can not have it all, it is a luxury many of us do not have; this raised the question, is happiness a choice? People were split into two groups: one claiming it is a choice, while the other says it depends on factors in one's life.",
        "On one hand, people claim that leisure of happiness is a choice. It depends on a person's mentality, and how they view life; when they look at the half-filled cup, do they focus on the empty space or the full one? Or do they just see a cup as half full half empty, seeing the bad and good at once? This group strongly believes that it depends on one's faith; faith can be in religion, in life, in good, and in anything. Even faith in the world is evil.",
        "Opposing the opinion: if one has the choice of being happy, then life would be easier. Happiness is not a choice, but rather is a feeling built on factors, and is influenced by what is happening in the world. By this mentality, people with depression have the choice to be happy, and people suffering from life have the choice to be happy. Yes, one can smile through the pain, a person has no control over how they feel; only sociopaths have the ability to not be affected by the world's good and evil.",
        "Overall, people have their own opinion and have the freedom of choosing how they feel about the world, or how they view it. Part of the popularity believes that happiness depends on one's faith, while others believe that it depends on one's world.",
        "Humans differ from other species because they have the freedom of choice, they have a brain that thinks on its own, allowing them to have different opinions. In my opinion, happiness depends on one's faith; the nostalgic feeling comes from a person's satisfaction with what they have. A person can be the richest in the world and has it all,  but still feel like they have nothing; on the other hand, one can have nothing at all, but a simple smile from a loved one can make them feel like they have everything they need."
