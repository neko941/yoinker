        "It is considered that if pupils have issues in some subjects at school and they are not able to acquire the skills in them it is better to remove these subjects from the program. However, it seems to me that this issue is not entirely straightforward and making some subjects to be optional, schools do not solve the problem, but rather make it worse and this essay will explain why.",
        "Looking from the one angle, without doubts removing difficult subjects from school program for one who gets struggle in its allows to focus on areas in which pupil has a progress and in which he or she succeed. However, children, who are not taught knowledge and skills which would be necessary in their future life as well as without acquiring some new subject, will not be able to enhance cognitive skills and also problem solving skills. Hence there will be some difficulties when children would enter to university or apply for a job because in order to promote on a social ladder there is a need to have variety of thinking and able to think critically. Also allowing children to quite something in which they have problems demotivate them and teach not to work harder.",
        "On the other hand, it is a huge pressure on children when he has problems in some area, especially in school subjects, because he starts to compare themselves with other pupils which can make him upset and sometime might lead to depression. In this case, of course, it is better to help pupils with his issue, but not compel him to learn this subject because it might be more hurt for him.",
        "Overall, it seems to me that it is not necessary to remove subjects in school in which pupils have problems because it does not solve the problem but rather make it worse."
