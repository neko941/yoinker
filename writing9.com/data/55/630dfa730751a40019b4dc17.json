        "People have different forms of accomodation in various parts of the world. Some people might rent an apartment while others might have their own. This essay describes renting an apartment can be beneficial in short term stay. While, also highlighting it can be costly in a long term perspective and can cause stress from dealing with the house owners. While acknowledging the advantages of leasing accomodation, this essay will argue that the disadvantages outweighs the advantages.",
        "Leasing accomodations can be useful for anyone who is planning to stay short term. If someone is studying or woking abroad, they will need to stay in certain location for a small period of time. In this circumstance, people do not need to invest lots of money because it is temporary. Especially, for example, a student will be studying for one semester in a different country, there will be no need to spend excessive amounts of money which is very costly.",
        "Living in a place by renting it out means that it can be very expensive in the long run. Specifically if someone is planning to live more than 5 years. Calculating the summation of a rent over 5 years, it can be more beneficial to invest in a house rather than leasing accomodation. For example, many medical students who live abroad choose to invest in buying a house rather then renting one. Due to the fact that their studies require more than 6 years to graduate. Nonetheless, if you rent a house it means you have to deal with difficult landlords. Housing owners can be very difficult and picky about keeping the their homes clean. Some might visit where you live every month just to check the quality of tidiness and inspect the conditions of the home. It can be very energy consuming having to deal with landlords like this.",
        "To conclude, renting a home can be cost effective for temporary stay. However, in the long run it will be beneficial both financially and mentally. Hence, I believe renting a house has more downfalls than benefits."
