        "These days, students are well versed about, which college they have to select for higher studies. Numerous of them are more inclined towards getting education from international universities. This essay will discuss both the advantages of this trend and show that, indeed, completing course from foreign countries is superior to getting it from home countries.",
        "To embark on, there are a number of important advantages from courses offered by overseas universities. The first is that the course they offer belong to latest trend, and are more in depth compare to courses offered by domestic universities. The student has multiple chose to select from, courses cover all the hot technologies, latest fields and with detailed knowledge on those areas. For example, there are many foreign universities which offers latest course like artificial intelligence and robotics, which are not available in India or some Indian universities have these courses but only limited content cover. Secondly, these institutes are well equipped, and have all the require facilities. They have all the model technologies machineries and many advance facilities, which students could not find in local institutes. In short, international education hubs offer wide range of course with full coverage and contain modern amenities.",
        "Despite the benefits, there are some drawback associates with the shift always from home educational hubs. The main issue is that during their stay in overseas countries, they can easily adopt culture and tradition of new place and forget inherited one. These type of changes are common and there are many linked adverse effects, such as they could forget the core values of their parent nation. In addition, they have to stay away from their families and it can affect attachment level between them. It is very difficult to come to meet family members on regular bases because of the cost of travel. For instance, if they study in home university, they could come in every holiday or any festival, which would not possible in other case. Overall, they have to compromise from their culture and family.",
        "In a nutshell, this essay discussed the reasons in which adopting studying in foreign institutes will affect those involved. In my opinion, although there are disadvantages associated with this, the advantages clearly outweigh them."
