        "Some people think that e\ufb00ective communication between managers and subordinate employees is the most important feature of an organization\u2019s success. However, there are other contributing factors to an organization\u2019s success that may be more important. I will discuss both sides of this argument in this essay.",
        "Managers make decisions about the direction of an organization and employees implement those decisions. Consequently, it is important that, when a decision is made, this decision can be communicated e\ufb00ectively to the workers. If the workers misinterpret a decision, the consequences could range from a minor discrepancy, to a serious setback for the organization. E\ufb00ective communication and implementation of decisions will result in the organization running as the managers want it to be run.",
        "There are many other factors that contribute to a company\u2019s success, some of which could be considered more important than e\ufb00ective communication. For example, the competency of managers themselves contributes significantly to success. It does not matter if a worker can e\ufb00ectively employ a policy if the policy, created by the manager, is useless or detrimental to the organization\u2019s success. Another contributing factor to success is the reliability and availability of good workers. An organization could have the best managers in the world, but if there is not a skilled and reliable work force available to them, progress will be slow and success difficult to come by. I believe that both of these factors are more important than communication between managers and workers itself.",
        "Communication between managers and workers is an important factor in an organization\u2019s success. However, in order for communication to be e\ufb00ective, an organization needs competent managers and a reliable, skilled workforce.",
        "There are other criteria, however, contribute to the success of companies. First, the recruitment process is of significance. Not only talented is a candidate, but she or he also ought to be compatible with businesses' culture, resulting to enhance the harmony with other employees. Thus, such connection reduces pressure at the workplace, boosting productivity. Besides, a successful company requires a well-devised strategy of the management board. It means that each step a business take is appropriately planned, ensuring sustainable development. In particular, strategic planning provides a sense of direction and outlines measurable goals, which is useful for guiding day-to-day decisions as well as for evaluating progress when moving forward."
