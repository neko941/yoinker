        "These days you see a lot of uniforms, not only in school but also in companies. But why is this? In this essay, I will discuss the advantages of this.",
        "The first obvious advantage is that the employees gets recognised by their uniform and this is important. For example, when your start up is attending a conference people can immediately see that you are part of the start up and can ask questions about the start up, this will result in more interaction between companies. In addition, it is also easy to say which people do not belong to the company and it will keep outstanders out.",
        "The second advantage is that everyone looks to same. This is especially helpful in schoolsystems such as elementary school or high school or even the university. Due to the same outfit, children or young adults are not being judged for the way that they look. This ensures less bullying, which is still a big problem. Opponents say that young people cannot have their own identity, because they can not choose what they want to wear.  I totally disagree with this, because their is plenty of time left where people can wear their own style.",
        "To conclude, wearing uniforms has got many advantages. The first advantage is that the staff gets recognized by their uniform, which helps to keep outstanders out and it makes it easier to find a person form a certain company. The second advantage is because of the unifrom less people get judged by their clothing, this is especially helpful in schools."
