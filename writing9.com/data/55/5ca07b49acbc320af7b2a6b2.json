        "Currently, people have different views on whether  secondary schools should introduce a wide range of subjects to their students or they should only select some specific subjects related to particular jobs. While studying a variety of subjects  brings some advantages to some extent, I believe that it is more essential for students to focus on specific topics.",
        "On the one hand, there are some benefits of learning a wide range of subjects at school. Firstly, children have more opportunities to gain an overview of a wide range of subjects and understand different aspects of life. This helps them to develop comprehensive thinking and become an all-sided person. Additionally, many teenagers  do not have enough experience to decide which subjects they are really passionate about. Therefore, they should be given the chance to get exposed to as many subjects as possible so that they can identify their strengths and weaknesses, allowing them to learn deeper in the future.",
        "On the other hand, learning subjects related to a particular job brings more advantages for students. Firstly, this equips fundamental knowledge for  students\u2019 future career. Only studying several subjects that will be useful in the future allows students to deepen their knowledge and skills in the career that they hope to pursue after graduation. Additionally, these days, many recruiters in modern economy tend to seek candidates with a good grounding in a single field over those who have general knowledge, but have little or no expertise in a particular area.",
        "In conclusion, Whereas there are some favorable effects of studying many subjects, I would argue that learning some subject matters involved in a particular career is better."
