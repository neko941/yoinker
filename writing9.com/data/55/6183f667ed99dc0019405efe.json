        "Each year countries spend huge amounts of money in their space programmes. These missions require billions of dollars to be done and the money comes from their citizens. Sometimes is not clear what are the advantages of these space programmes but a lot of the technology that is used in telecommunications comes from here.",
        "NASA is the biggest aerospace programme in the world, funded by the United States of America. When they spend these large sums of money on their missions, people might think that exploring  space is a waste of time and money. However, these missions have a purpose to discover what is over and beyond our knowledge. This is important because some discoveries can change the way people do things on a regular basis. For example, if it was not because they and their equals in Russia, satellites would not exist.",
        "On the other hand, the amount of money they spend can be overwhelming. Their budget can be bigger than a whole country budget. They will use the money to try things that may not affect people life. Also, people can be suffering from hunger or lack of health and education while their government is spending billions on sending radio waves into the deep space. For example, India has a strong spacial programme although its population is one of the poorest in the world.",
        "In resume, it is important to keep investigating and seeking  more in the spacial area but not if that means people will suffer of lack of hospitals or schools. The money that governments use is from their citizens, so it should be used for what  is better for them."
