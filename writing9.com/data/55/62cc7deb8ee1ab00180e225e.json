        "Nowadays, people compete with one another in most communities and it is viewed by some individuals as a positive quality. While competitiveness affects individuals positively and negatively, I will give my opinion on whether it is a positive or negative trend.",
        "In different societies, people have made it a norm to compete with their peers instead if working at their own pace. The following positive influence are expected to emanate as a result of competition. Firstly, people tend to achieve most of their target goals when there is competition from their peers, at this point in time, everyone is on track with complete tenacity thereby resulting to achieved dreams. For instance, I can vividly remember how I passed my first professional exam and the efforts I channelled towards it because everyone in the class where all competing to ace the exam. Another positive influence is that individuals that compete with each other tend to succeed because nobody would want to be left at the pecking order, Hence everyone strive to be recognised. Competition always yield good results.",
        "Coming to its negative influence, firstly, it will make some individuals to soil their hand on things that are illicit because they want to be counted. Most competitions results in people endulging in different malfeasance which can be detrimental and also jeopardize the growth of society for example, A friend of mine endulge in robbery inorder to meet up to standard and also keep up to the Joneses, Secondly, competition leads to errors and people tend to follow the wrong route because they were not able to work at their own pace. Most individuals forget to think out what is best for them and   also the right part to follow because of what was currently trending among their peers. For instance, people makes mistakes when they go for what is reigning rather than finding their right part.",
        "In conclusion, as there are positive and negative influences that escalate as a result of competition, I think it is a Negative as people missed the right part to follow."
