        "It is mostly considered that boys and girls should be educated in different schools because of comfortable environment, whereas some believe that co education has more advantages because it provides a platform for students where they could compete with one another. However, in my opinion, schools should be separate especially in today's modern world.",
        "On one hand, people suggest that educating their children in separate schools is a better choice for the parents as it is comfortable and safe for both. Similarly, in present situation, young ones and teenagers are exposed to all content displayed on media so adults are more conserved to give them the free environment. For example, in most parts of Pakistan, girls and boys are given separate education in schools because of the conservative environment and strict bringing up of elders. Therefore, it is ultimately the best choice for those who do not want to send their young ones to co education system.",
        "Consequently, there are few who are in the favour of their children to study in mixed schools because these create a competitive spirit among students. Since, it is male dominated world, it is crucial for women to stand equal to men now. For instance, in America, according to the ABC Magazine, 70% of women are leading the top most business companies. Hence, there are many benefits found if boys and girls study in same schools.",
        "In conclusion, general public wants to educate sons and daughters in separate schools because of the authenticity of safety and comfort provided, while some want their offspring to attend co education systems to give them a competitive platform, although in my view, I believe that co education is not appropriate in schools as they are too young to face the cruel world."
