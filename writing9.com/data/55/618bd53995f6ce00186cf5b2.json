        "In the metropolitan areas, everywhere we look, we see the mirrors of the skyscrapers. These types of buildings give a modern vibe to the cities and represent a solution for the big number of population. Some skyscrapers overcome 100 floors, providing a big number of apartments and office areas for businesses.",
        "In my opinion, the taller buildings are not so elegant looking and not so welcoming, but are very good for housing purposes.",
        "In the smaller cities and villages, the houses are placed on a wider area of land. This fact is possible because the population percentage is lower in these areas. In most cases, the houses have a garden and an area of land in the back of the house that has agricultural purposes.",
        "Each country has its own specific architecture. In Romania, for example, the houses are small and are painted in vibrant colours. On the other hand, the houses in England have a gothic vibe.",
        "In my opinion, I think no solution is better than the other. The big cities need a big number of houses for the population in order to provide a sufficient housing to the high demand for buildings. The areas with a small percentage of the population can build houses on a wider area of land. In the smaller cities, there is no demand for the places destined for business purposes, corporations, a big number of habitats. The smaller cities and the villages are not expanding, compared with the big cities where a new skyscraper is built every day by a new investor. The smaller cities are slower paced, present more family businesses and people that live in the same houses generation after generation."
