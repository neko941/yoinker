        "The 21st century is witnessing a considerable change in human lifestyle in which delayed childbirth has become a major concern. Several probable explanations for this social trend will be proposed prior to the interpretation of its impacts on both society and family life.",
        "A few factors are deemed the driving forces behind the trend of giving birth at later stages of life. Firstly, young parents prioritize their career to tackle financial burden and have appropriate means to earn a living. They defer having children in light of a desire to become financially secure which lays a solid foundation for a more prosperous life. Secondly, children are believed to receive better care from older parents. This stems from the fact that parents in their old age are more experienced and willing to take responsibility for children\u2019s upbringing.",
        "The impacts of late-life parenthood on society and families are relatively diversified. On the one hand, having a firstborn later in life poses major health risks to the mother during pregnancy such as miscarriage or high blood pressure. Additionally, the significant age gap makes it more challenging for aged parents to understand and communicate with their young children. On the other hand, children born to mature couples can be more physically and mentally healthy due to comprehensive education and better living conditions. By this way, they will make up productive labour force that remarkably contributes to the social development in the future.",
        "In conclusion, delayed childbearing is induced by a number of factors such as occupational stress and conditions for nurturing children, with both negative and positive impacts on society as well as families."
