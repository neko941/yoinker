        "Studying a second language has become an indispensable part especially globalization in recent years as a marked milestone. Some people argue that the main role of learning a foreign language is that working or traveling abroad while I believe that there are also many other reasons for this circumstance.",
        "On the one hand, one of the main aims of the foreign language to overseas tourism or jobs. First of all, foreign language pave the way for the relationship of people around the world as an good way which enable them to interact with each orther more easily. Many people struggle with language issues, they can not talk or understand what foreign people say. For example, in some Asian countries where the foreign language abilities did not develop, it is a concerning issue due to the lack of indigenous residents knowledge about foreign language when they attempt to talk to overseas residents so foreign people have to learn native language.",
        "On the other hand, foreign language is not only support people when they go abroad but it also help them even in their countries. For instance, there are a lot of international companies so people need improve their abilities to use at least one more language which bring benefits to their jobs such as high salaries, proper positions and so on. Furthermore, the development of tourism as a smokeless industry enhances the income of indigenous residents these days but that mean local people have to often expose to people who come from other countries. For example, if local people take advantage of advertising opportunities with foreigners they able to sell more goods and promote their countries to friends in the world.",
        "To conclude, it seem like bring more benefits to people who working or travelling abroad but I strongly believe that learing foreign language can support people even in their daily life and making people in the world get closer together."
