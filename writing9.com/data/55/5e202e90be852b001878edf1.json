        "Some would believe that the most effective way to increase the quality of public health is to increase the numbers of sports facilities, while others think that it would not give effective result, so other ideas should be implemented. While extra sporting facilities cover increased number of people, I believe that unless the awareness program about the importance of staying healthy is not implemented, individuals would not be interested to work on this matter.",
        "On the one hand, increased numbers of people would be facilitated with the extra number of sporting outlets. This is to say that more sporting centres can accommodate more number of people, which enables increased volume of people to exercise, and it eventually improve the health of public. For example, research suggested that 40% of the obesity problem has reduced in Kathmandu after the government of Nepal implemented the scheme of 1 sports centre per 1000 people. However, I think people are still reluctant to join those exercise facilities because they do not understand the consequences of not having proper health.",
        "On the other hand, the government should raise awareness about the necessity of the sound health. This means the authority should debrief people about the negative aspects of unhealthy lifestyle, and how to avoid being a victim of it. For instance, a study conducted by the BBC revealed that after the Indian government\u2019s health awareness campaign in 2016, the level of public health was inclined by 65% and more in the following years. Therefore, I opine that public should be aware of the importance of healthy body in order to help them become healthy.",
        "In conclusion, although the increase in sporting facilities addresses more number of individuals, I think people would only start to think about their health when they comprehend tha importance of sound health, which could be explained to them via arareness program."
