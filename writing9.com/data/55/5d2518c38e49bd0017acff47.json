        "With the advent of e-books, the future of paper books has suddenly become a contentious issue, with some experts predicting that e-books will be the end of paper books, while others averring that paper books will never disappear. This essaywill analyze arguments from both sides before drawing a conclusion.",
        "To begin with, people who argue that e-books will be the death of paper books predicate their contention on the benefits that e-books offer. For e!ample, they point out that e-books are environment friendly, which means no trees are cut to make paper for printing them as is the case with paper books. Also, the say that unlike paper books, e-books are easy to carry around and can be read using a variety of mediums like laptops, mobile phones, and tablets among others. In short, the environmental friendliness and portability of e-books are the reasons, according to these experts, which enable them to obviate the paper books.",
        "However, the opposing set of experts seem unconvinced by these aforementioned arguments, and they opine that paper books are not going to disappear because e-books also have their own unique set of harms to offer. For instance, reading e-books makes the reader focus on electronic screens for lengthy periods of time, which causes eyestrain in many people. Consequently, reading an e-book can be fraught with distractions like incoming message or e-mail notifications popping up on computer or cellphone screen during reading, or an urge to watch a youtube video before beginning the next chapter. As these problems never arise while savoring \"Harry Potter\", printed on paper, these experts believe paper books are in no danger of becoming extinct.",
        "In conclusion, it has been seen that both sides support their opinions using cogent arguments. However, I believe that even if e-books are more convenient and will be in higher demand in the future, it will never replace paper books as long as people still require them."
