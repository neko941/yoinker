        "Nowadays, an increasing number of countries are transforming to a united shape due to the availability of the identical products everywhere in the globe. In my opinion, this trend has more disadvantages than advantages.",
        "To begin with, if the same items are in reach of people in different countries, there will be a huge crisis and tourism industry. Regarding the fact that purchasing products unique to each country is a vital parametre to keep cross-border travel alive, finding various goods in every country's market will lead to a dramatic decline in the number of people travelling to far away countries. In China, for example, buying Chinese costumes is so popular among foreigners who have not seen such clothings ever before. So, if anyone can find this item in their own country, no one will trouble themselves to travel to China.",
        "Moreover, finding any desired item in any country's shopping zone would threaten the national identity of the country whose products are being sold. Some countries try to depict their culture, heritage and lifestyle in the goods they produce for their own people. These products reflect distinct features of that specific nation. Thus,by buying the items that are sacred and meaningful to another culture, a nation can destroy the meaning behind that object and have a negative impact on the culture of the source country. A good example of such items is the handicrafts made of shells in South American coastal towns.",
        "In conclusion, thanks to the advances of modern age, any item can be found in any market all over the world. This seems destructive to me because of the mentioned reasons."
