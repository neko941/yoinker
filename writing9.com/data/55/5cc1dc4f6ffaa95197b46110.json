        "Some believe that exercise is essential for good health while others argue that it can be achieved through proper intake of nutritious foods. While healthy food improves immunity of an individual, however I believe that workout offers better physical and mental stability.",
        "On the one hand, it is believed that proper intake of food helps to improve a person\u2019s immunity level. That is to say, having proper meal with right combination of nutrients, vitamins and minerals helps to fight against the bad microbes in the body thereby improving the immune level and reduces their chance of falling sick. For instance, recent report published by the US Food and Drug Administration Authority showed that proper diet has almost contributes to 89% of immunity power needed for humans to fight against the deadly diseases. However, I believe despite the fact that it improves a person\u2019s physical state, exercise provides much more benefit of having a better mental state.",
        "On the other hand, working out for a considerable period of time improves a person\u2019s physical strength and mental being. This is because exercising helps people to burn out the calories and  unwanted fat in the body which in turn activates the proper functioning of all the vital organs and regulates the blood flow. This results in improving a person\u2019s stamina and ease out the mental stress thereby helping them to stay focused and fit. For instance, recent analysis conducted by World Health Organisation shows that regular bout of workouts like jogging, aerobics has found to improve people\u2019s productivity and state of mental being. I am of the view that exercise offers double benefit of improving body and mind.",
        "To conclude, although food helps people to stay away from being sick, however I believe that exercise promotes people physical being and mental stability."
