        "In a modern world , that the artists hardly get regconized resulting in the imbalance in term of financial stability is open for discussion . There are artists more or less have a reputation for their work , while others never achieve sucess . I personally disagree to the idea that government should weigh in this problem .",
        "It is undeniable that art is unique and it can not be considered as the same as other occupations . Artists have different ability and when it comes to raising reputation , it is nevertheless an impact from external factors . Van Gogh , who was knowledgable about impressionism , had to live in grinding poverty because his works got distinguished shortly after he passed away . Generally , there are numerous schools of art  , however , critics seek out for an outstanding artist that could work in accordance with public eye . If their artwork is so abstract and surreal , customers are likely to take their eye off and go for the more comprehensible one . Creative jobs require for naturally gifted people and artists should be equally compared to each other , so there is no doubt that government should tackle such minorities .",
        "On the other hand , art is on the same position of other jobs , work under the control of social rules . There is a tendency in artists to debate when it comes to being underpaid compared to others . This leads to one common problems is that they can not adequately supply  materials to continue running their business  . Surely artists being able to raise their fund and make a startup is familiar , and those who neither associate nor ask for sponsorships are undubiously lesser-known . Ultimately , art is a carrer that is overflowing with diverity as well as complexity . Artists who have been developing their skills for ages to exhibit deserve regconition than those who remain unknown , but if they decide to prevail their career , it seems that should accept the situation .",
        "In conclusion , art depends on many factors and views and people who decide to pursuit such creative career should develope empathy for others . Still , artists have to be clever at making decision to find another way of earning a living . Life is hard to comprehend and so is art"
