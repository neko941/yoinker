        "Countries economic growth is a major topic for governments around the world. Some citizens believe other sectors development is as vital as economical prosper. I agree that economic expansion must be the main focus.",
        "To begin with, Authorities direct most of the country\u2019s capital towards development projects such as infrastructure, agriculture, export, commerce and manufacture. In Egypt, more that 70% of the government budget goes into farming and livestock projects and the income from those 2 sectors are directed into other segments. As a result, people noticed enhancement in the transportation network and its services. Additionally, the quality of education increased as more money is spend in advancing the school and university systems offering more chances for students to learn at less cost hence parents became satisfied witness their children involved in proper education. Subsequently, ease the life of citizens and provide them with quality of life and less burden.",
        "Considering other kinds of progress, in order for governments to progress other segments, economic stability is required. In that prospective, without solid economic authorities will not have the power to flourish other divisions. To illustrate, the leadership in Egypt, utilize 80% of its financial resources into military sector leaving only 20% for the rest of sectors including economic evolution. Moreover, the economics of the country experienced trending fall leading to regress across all sectors and lower exports due to the authorities miss planning.",
        "In conclusion, budget is the base of development because without it authorities will not have money resources to increase expenditure against other sectors hence the chance for advancement."
