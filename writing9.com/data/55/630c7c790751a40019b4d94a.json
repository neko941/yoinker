        "The classes based on the Internet have replaced those of colleges year by year. Some people say that classes on the Internet are useful as they do not need to go to college, whereas others believe that learning at university is essential.",
        "Firstly, one of the advantages to take class online is that students can cut down the time to commute to their college and then can spend that time on a lot of things, such as their assignments, part-time and hobbies. Focusing on the assignments, the colleges can give more tasks to students due to reduce commuting time, which may lead to improving students\u2019 growth. In addition, considering hobbies, students can expand their network of contacts by meeting and interacting with people they would not be involved with at college, which may have a positive effect on their career.",
        "However, these are some benefits to studying at university. Students typically can learn not only academics but also a lot of skills they can not learn online, including relationships with friends and time management. Above all, the period of college life is the best opportunity for students to acquire these skills because they are essential to participating in society and success in their career.",
        "In my opinion, both classes on the Internet and universities have each advantage, which means that the opinions depend on people and what they have as the top priority. Furthermore, I believe that it is also important that more and more colleges offer a wide range of classes more flexibility."
