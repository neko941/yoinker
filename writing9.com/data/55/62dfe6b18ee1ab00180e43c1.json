        "Well, It is impressive and surprising. I know that people should not eat more than 5g of salt daily because of the hypertension risk. the study found out that eating much salt relates to the reduction in life expectancy.",
        "I often go out for eating, and sometimes I add a little salt at mealtimes, such as when I eat chicken soup, or eat some fruits.",
        "Of course. It is really strange. In my country, people rarely add salt at mealtimes because chefs always serve  appropriate taste dishes.",
        "According to a medical journal, the average life expectancy is 72 for females and 70 for males. It has increased in recent years.",
        "I think that people should do exercise regularly. Actually, they need to do immediate tense exercises for more than 60 minutes per week. People also need to eat a balanced diet with a lot of vegetables, a medium amount of meat and carbohydrates, and just a little oil or fat. ..",
        "I like some western food such as beef steak, and spaghetti noodles. Near my living area, there is a western restaurant, I sometimes go there for dinner.",
        "I love cooking but I have not cooked for many years. I am living in a rented room, it is small. I don't want to make it look like a mess with many kinds of stuff.",
        "Of course my mom. She makes meat bread and rice very well... She sells these dishes in the morning. She earns a living in this way.",
        "It is so simple. I think healthy eating is a part of a healthy lifestyle, which involves some other things such as work, relaxation, sport or exercise, relationships..."
