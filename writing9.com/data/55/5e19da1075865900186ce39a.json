        "Renting apartments are more popular than purchasing apartments in some nations. This essay will first suggest that an easy-shifting facility is a primary benefit, while the lake of freedom is the main drawback of buying them over renting homes.",
        "The main reason the majority of the public choose to live in rental homes is that it is economic and time-effective to change the places which will be closer to their workplaces. Most of the employees in the multinational companies work temporarily, they can lose their jobs or decide to change their current jobs after getting a better offer from other superior organisations. For instance, a recent governmental survey shows that nearly 80% of the citizen of the cities are living in the apartments which are not their own.",
        "Despite this shifting benefit from remote homes to convenient places, the public cannot enjoy the freedom of having a sweet home of their own. Tenants not only accept the interior design of their living rooms fixed by homeowners but also obliged to leave them with the notice of landlord even they have no intention to change. For example, last month we have to vacant our previous apartment after getting an unexpected order from the homeowner but we have no preparation to do that and my parents were busy in an official meeting and my final examination was knocking at the door.",
        "In conclusion. tenants can be benefited relocating their living places in walking distance from their workplaces, but the cannot enjoy the facilities and mental satisfaction of own homes."
