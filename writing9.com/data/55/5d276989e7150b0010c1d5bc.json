        "It is believed by some individual that the present alteration in climate that is being experienced has come to stay. Therefore, everyone should learn to adapt to it. In my opinion, I completely disagree with this belief  because it is wrecking more havoc than to both human beings and animals than we can imagine. It also affects the economy.",
        "Firstly, global warming, which is the end result of the depletion of the atmosphere's ozone layer is not good for human health because the rise in earth's temperature is directly proportional to the incidence of various diseases such as heat stroke, diarrhea, hypertension, worsening of post menopausal symptoms e.t.c. Aditionally, both terrestial and aquatic animals are equally affected because the hotter the weather becomes, the more difficult it is for animals to get water to drink. Hence, most of them die of drought.Furthermore, aquatic animals also begin to die because the sea becomes too hot for them to live in. For instance, the northern part of Nigeria being the hottest region, they experience temperatiures up to 45 degrees celcius and there has been regular reports of deaths as a result of extreme heat which occurs usually during dry season. Evidently, it has become a menace in our socities and something effective must be done to stop it.",
        "Secondly,climate change has affected both individuals and the nations economy as a whole. This is because most people who ventured into fish farming have been forced to quit the business due to the fact that the water housing the fishes become so hotnthat they are unable to survive. Also, the government spend more money on sick people especially during the dry season. For example, studies have shown that the Gambian president spend double on the health of her citizens during summer. Therefore, efforts should be geared towards aborting every activity contributing to a rise in climate change.",
        "In conclusion, people should not be comfortable with having climate change. Efforts should be made to halt it so as to have an environment that is conducive to support life"
