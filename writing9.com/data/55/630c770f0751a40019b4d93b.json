        "I am writing this letter in reference to address a mistake in you last week The Weekend article. This magazine publishes history of the heritage monuments. In the last article there is an information about the Art Museum which is located in London. The information has been printed on the third page and mentioned about age of this museum which is 300 years old whereas the correct age of this museum is 320 years.",

        "I reckon that this incorrect information about the museum should be corrected as soon as possible to avoid spreading mal information further. I would like you to suggest that you should re-print this article in your next addition and also to drag readers attention, the correct information should be printed in bold characters so it would be obvious to reader to understand the correction.",
        "I would be grateful if you could manage to correct the information in your next addition.",
