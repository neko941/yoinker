        "In today\u2019s globalized world, people with skills and experiences in their own industry, tend to move a foreign country to work in a good environment with better salaries. There lie several reasons behind their migration.",
        "Firstly, these days\u2019, skilled people like to work abroad either from their own interest or higher lifestyle. Many people dream to travel around the world since their childhood. After finishing their institutional learning, they find some way to move abroad for a good career. They believe that foreign industry can provide not only a good job but also a better life. To illustrate this, I can present my brother as an example here, who graduated from Bangladesh and later migrated to France for working in a company that provided with better salaries than his own country job.",
        "Most of the people move to a foreign land for an improved living condition. They may find their own land not as comfortable as they are looking for. If they reside in their own country, they may not find those modern facilities that a foreign country can offer. A study conducted by the Guardian showed that 60% of the highly ambitious educated persons tend to leave their own country and settle in a developed country only for a higher lifestyle.",
        "Besides, in some cases, this migration can result in adverse ways to a country. A country can lose its human resources due to migration. An educated person is regarded as an asset for his own country. He can play a key role in the development of his own country by contributing his expertise in his own preferred field. In my opinion, an experienced person should dream to work for his own nation rather than transferring his skills abroad.",
        "To sum up, an educated person can definitely serve his country with his skills. Every person should contribute something for the betterment of his own land. Although every people have a goal to lead a pleasant life, they should not move abroad to work and, they should do something at their own land using their experiences at the same time."
