        "The financial growth rate in many of the developing nations is not increasing as per the expectations even if they get support from other developed nations and international organisations.They receive money from richer countries and other external sources for meeting their basic needs. However, the economic growth of poor nations reveals that the financial support from foreign countries  is not a permanent solution  to all their problems. Rather than providing large amounts of cash to poor nations, the root cause  has to be identified and solved to eliminate poverty.",
        "One of the main reasons for a nation to become a poor country is unemployment. Having enough job opportunity is the key factor in a nation's success.The country has to encourage the entrepreneurs to start a new business to create employment opportunities. Other countries can help them by investing funds on their new business ideas. They can also help them by providing experienced resources if they are not able to support with cash.",
        "Lack of education is another important cause for a nation's financial instability. Studies show that, the economic growth of a country has a direct link to literacy rate.Others can help the countries which fall below poverty level to educate their people by arranging free education. They can also conduct campaigns to make people aware of the importance of education. Many of the economically powerful countries offer academic facilities",
        "for talented people from other countries.",
        "Finally, the money and resource utilization should be monitored closely to overcome poverty. Adequate checks have to be conducted to make sure that the fund is getting utilized properly.",
        "To conclude, financial support is not the best way to eliminate poverty from undeveloped countries. The root cause has to be identified and rectified for making a poor country better."
