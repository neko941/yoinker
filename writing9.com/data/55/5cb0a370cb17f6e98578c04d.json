        "Needless to say, every human being has his/her own ways of learning. Some people believe that, learn something in a group is better because it is efficient, and others find, sometimes, nature of content matters most therefore learning as individual is an appropriate way to gain knowledge.",
        "Studying in a group is a efficient way to learn something. This is because every single person have their own way of thinking, and they can discuss a single notion with multiple point of views, and at the end, they can come to a single efficient solution. It is believed that a group of three people can solve a problem more efficiently than an individual person. In contrast, if the same work or problem solved by an individual, there are several chances, the solution will not be efficient, and his/her knowledge about that particular work will be remain same.",
        "Sometimes, nature of the content also matters. In these situations, people like to study alone because they do not want to discuss openly with other people. For example, content related to sex education, a study conducted by University of London shows that 90% of people are shy in nature, and they do not find themselves comfortable to discuss and learn about sex education in groups. Ergo, it is better that, they should study about that privately because it is an extremely important part of our life.",
        "In conclusion, although, group studies is a comprehensive way to gain knowledge, but, we should also take into account, the privacy of an individual. In my view, expanding someone'e horizon much more important than the way of learning, and both the ways of learning is efficient according to different circumstances."
