        "IT IS OFTEN BELIEVED BY SOME THAT SUCCESS COMES TO THOSE WHO HAS INNATE APTITUDE, WHERE AS OTHERS SAY THAT ANY ARTS ACIVITY MASTERED BY ANYONE WHO HAS INTEREST IN LEARNING. FROM MY POINT OF VIEW IT IS TRUE THAT ANY ACTIVITY CAN BE LEARNED BY ANY CHILD WITH PROPER TRAINING AND KNOWLEDGE. I HAVE VARIOUS REASONS AND EXPLANATIONS TO SUPPORT MY THINKING WHICH IS MENTIONED BELOW.",
        "TO START WITH FIRSTLY, INDIVIDUAL WHO HAS INBORN TALENT CAN ACHIEVE GREAT ACCOMPLISHMENT BECAUSE THEY THAT SKILLS SINCE THEY BORN. FOR N EXAMPLE, ABHISHEK BACCHAN WHO IS SON OF AMITABH BACCHAN ,IS A LEGEND OF THE BOLLYWOOD, SO ABHISHEK DOES NOT HAVE TO WORK VERY HARD TO BE GOOD ACTORE AS THE ACTING IS IN HIS BLOOD, WHICH HE GOT FROM HIS FATHER, THUS EVEN WITHOUT PROPER KNOWLEDGE HE CAM GIVE BETTER PERFORMANCE IN COMPARE TO OTHER WHO DOES NOT HAVE INBUILD TALENT. SO THIS KIND OF PEOPLE JUST NEED SUPPORT FROM THEIR BACKGROUND FAMILY BUT NOT ALL THE THIS IS TRUE WITH EVERYONE,",
        "IN CONTRAST, IF PERSON HAS PASSION FOR  LEARNING NEW THINGS CAN ALSO GET HUGE ACHIEVEMENYT BY TAKING APROPIATE TRAINING AND UNER PROPER GUIDANCE.THE MOST POWERFUL REASON IS THAT THE WILLINGNESS TO ACHIVE SOMETHING CAN BUILD EXPERIENCE AND INFORMATION. SO FOR THIS ONE HAS TO SWEAT AND WORK HARD, DEVOTE THEIR TIME CORRECTLY THEN DEFINATLY SUCCESS COMES.",
        "TO SUM UP, IF ONE HAS NATURAL TALENT , HAVE TO DO FACE LESS PROBLEM BUT WITHOUT THE NATURAL TALENT UNDER PERFET GUIDANVE AND TRAINING ANYONE CAN ACHIEVE VICTORY IT IS JUST THAT THEY HAVE TO BE PASSIONATE ENOUGH TO GET IT."
