        "It is often argued that the parent should be responsible for educating their children to become a good citizen while others said that the education providers are the best place to educate this. In this essay I'll discuss the both view and state my own opinion by considering children behaviour and the interpersonal skills.",
        "Firstly, There is a old saying that the parents is the first teacher of their kids. It because kids learn things from their parents. In their childhood,they experienced how to behave. Otherwise spoil child did not listen to their parents and do their work as they want. For instance when a child goes to shopping with their parents and keep asking to buy groceries or toys as he want , parents will be embarrassed in crowded place. So inorder to avoid unbearable situation like that child should learn how to behave. They need to know their limits.so it is clearly state that the parent is the key role of child behaviour.",
        "Secondly, Interpersonal skills need to develop when they young. Institutions are best place to check their interpersonal skills such as leadership, courage ,positive thinking etc. It is good to improve these qualities since their childhood. Then, when they become adults, they use these skills to live well.",
        "Most of the people think that parents should teach their kids to become a good citizen while others believe that the best institution is school for that.  Parents are playing key role in children as a first teacher.As well as education providers help them to improve their qualities further.In my opinion is parents and education providers equally responsible."
