        "Tourism can be good and harmful to the nation which accepts it. On one hand, tourism has a great number of benefits for the service industry. In fact, a country with few natural resources like Japan, is relying on tourism to large extent. On the other hand, tourism often provokes complex cultural conflicts and serious environmental issues.",
        "Tourism is  hope for local economic revival. As the number of residents is decreasing, many local economies are diminishing in time. Tourism will not only earn profit in a short term, but also create jobs and residents. Each district can make full use of their characteristics to attract people by introducing a unique sightseeing plan. For example, Naoshima, a small island on the Setouchi Sea became an acknowledged destination for the art tour.",
        "On the contrary, Tourism sometimes causes cultural conflicts. Tourists from a different culture often disrespect the unique native culture without intention. Gion, a place where Geisha works, is a famous sight-seeing spot. However, Geisha was complaining about the tourists\u2019 behaviour of interrupting them.",
        "Moreover, tourism can damage the local environment. When the small village attracts a large number of people, locals have to manage  the waste and emissions they make. Since Mt. Fuji are popular sight-seeing spot, volunteers are correcting rubbish and gavage. Local volunteers maintain the natural environment of the mountain.",
        "As I referred above, I insist that tourism has pros and cons for local society. From an economic aspect, local people gain profit from travellers, however, new cultural and environmental problems occurred."
