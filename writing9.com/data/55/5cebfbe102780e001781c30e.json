        "It is believed that many people tend to move through countries where are spoken English as the native language such as Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States of America. Most people would like to study for an under or post graduate degree in one of these places. Bearing in mind the fact, the importance of English is appearing obviously.",
        "First of all, technological developments such as the internet, computer, social networks have widened people\u2019s objectives. Recently, people have started to communicate with each other easier compared to the past. Thus, work fields and occupations have changed enormously.  There are many international companies, which have employees from various nations. Therefore, being able to speak in a common language is more important than before. Consequently, English has become the most important international language in my opinion. That is why many people would like to study in English. People want to be a part of this new-fashioned business life and the first prerequisite of it, is having good communication skills in English.",
        "Not only business life, but also social life has changed very much in recent years. Internet, social networks, video calling technologies have brought new relationships in people\u2019s social life. If you are able to speak a common language, you can socialize with people from many countries easily. It is clear that generally, this common language is English.",
        "In conclusion, there are numerous reasons, which push people to study abroad, especially in an English-speaking country, and it is a very understandable requirement of the modern community"
