        "There is no denying the fact that drug abuse is an extremely serious problem. It leads to a large number of society and criminal issues. Some people believe that if the substance is taken under control and under laws, the facets of drug abuse will also decrease. However, I cannot totally agree with this view. I am concerned that legalizing the substance would cause other problems.",
        "Understandably, governments look for ways to reduce drug abuse and one way is to legalize and control the substance. Following this, the governments would know the origin of drugs and also uncover the prevalent use of drugs in particular areas. Hence, they would control problems in the right direction. A good example of this is The legalization of cannabis in Netherlands, which has successfully reduced criminalization.",
        "However, the legalization of the substance leads to many problems such as addiction. To be more precise, when the substance is not against the law, It is easy to possess. If people use it more than usual, they will become addicted and get drug overdose. For example, in the case of cannabis, since it is legal in Thailand, the latest news reports that many people died from cannabis overdose.",
        "Moreover, if the substance is brought from a general shop, someone will constantly purchase it to persuade other people. Indeed, people can buy the drug from the grocery store although there is a limited amount of drug or age of customer, it is not impossible to control the whole amount of drugs which they possess. And they will use these to induce other people to be criminals.",
        "In conclusion, there are many ways to reduce substance abuse. One of these is to take it to legal and control it. It could be argued that legalization of substances not only causes health problems, it also causes more criminals. Therefore we should find other ways to solve this problem."
