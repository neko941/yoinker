        "A few people argue that arts curriculums are as significant as other academic disciplines, particularly at the elementary school.",
        "I completely agree with this statement to develop creativity and improved academic performance.",
        "The creative curriculum should enable pupils to think creatively and critically, to solve problems and to make a difference for the better. It should allow them to become innovative, enterprising and capable of leadership to equip them for their future lives as workers and citizens. As a result, the pupil in this range age can generate a variety of different ideas that are new and unusual through divergent thinking.",
        "As the Washington Post says: In an arts program, pupils in this basic level recite a monologue in six different ways, create a painting that represents a memory or composes a new rhythm to enhance a piece of music.",
        "In Addition, arts curriculum has significant effects on other academic disciplines by encouraging children to be enthusiastic and active explorers who are not afraid to try out their ideas and finding the relation between objects. To illustrate that, When we help kids see the overlap between art and math, we not only strengthen their skills in each, we expand their vision of what it means to be an artist and a mathematician. Math can be creative! Art can be analytical! Both can inspire our imagination. For example, Once kids start looking for shapes and patterns in art, they will see them everywhere. Sometimes I go on \u201cshape hunts\u201d in picture books with my preschooler, asking him to find a square, a circle, or a triangle.",
