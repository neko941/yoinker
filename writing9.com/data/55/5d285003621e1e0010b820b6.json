        "Some people say that the pupils obtaining their tertiary education are liable to all their fees because it aids only them, but not their community. However, I totally disagree with this perspective and believe that the people who have higher academic qualifications are extremely vital to their society.",
        "Primarily, the aspirant scholars are very helpful for the development of the nation. Firstly, the knowledge that these people acquire through their educational career could be very helpful in every sector they employ themselves. As a result, these productive areas in the long term becomes very valuable to the nation by being profitable. For instance, the economy of Scandinavian countries are extraordinary because they provide full scholarship to all their students and in return they use their hard earned skills in the field where they work.",
        "Another factor that these students provide benefit to the society is by their ability to provide more educated offspring. The primary inspiration of many children is always their parents and if their guardian is educated then this could motivate them to follow same path as their caretakers. Eventually, if more people go to college for academically higher qualifications then obviously there will be more learned scholars to help the surroundings that they live.",
        "In conclusion, I believe that the people seeking a degree from colleges should not be held accountable for all their fees because they are very crucial for the prosperity of the country they stay, and they also help society by providing them more highly educated future generations."
