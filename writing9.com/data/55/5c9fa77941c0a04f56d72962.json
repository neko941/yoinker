Others, however, argue that the circumstances of an individual crime, and the motivation for committing it, should always be taken into account when deciding on the punishment. \n \nDiscuss both these views and give your own opinion.",

        "Fixed punishments are essensial for individual crime.However, based on the crime\u2019s circumstances and motivation, it should be considered to decide the punishment.Both views and personal opinion are revealed in this essay.",
        "Obviously, fixed punishments are able to help the governments or national authorities to minimize the crime rate and raise the citizens awareness of security and safety in their society..Moreover, each individuals would probably know the punishments they will suffer from if they commit the crime.That leads to the fact that people might not commit the crime.For instance, it might be unfair if not basing on the crime situation and motivation.Especially, despite committing the extremely terrible crimes which harm the society, the criminals who are supposed to be punished extremely heavily are just punished as same as the other people who cause less harmful to society.Actually, based on the crime situation and motivation is absolutely crucial for governments or authorities such as polices to make the decision for punishing. By this way, the governments or politic officers such as the court are straightforward to make their citizens or the foreigners who live in their country to be fully aware of their behaviors.",
        "On my point of views, the police officers or courts need to base on the motivation to give the punishment to the subjects commiting the crime. The motivation is possibly the evidence to accuse of the criminals simply and it also plays the vital role in ivestigating.In fact, in the development countries, such as South Korea, Hongkong and Australia the national authorities base on the motivation of the criminals to conduct the investigation and make the punishment following the situation of crime.",
        "In conclusion, punishments are the most vital methods to keep the country secure and safe.On the other the hands, punishments are also the useful tools of handling with the criminals as the alert for them not to commit this crime in the other time.Although I am not the expert at laws, I absolutely think that there should be based on the crime motivation or situation to make the suitable punishments."
