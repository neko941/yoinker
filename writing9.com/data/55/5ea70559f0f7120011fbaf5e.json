        "The impact of technology on the social lives of young people today is currently being debated. While some persons believe that technology has made young people more sociable, others believe it has made youths less sociable. Indeed, the use of technology does has its drawbacks but it has developed platforms which make youths more sociable in the short and long term.",
        "Many believe that technology has made youths less sociable due to the abuse of social media by young persons. It is true that for some young people, an increased usage of social media has led to a decrease in physical social interaction which can harmful to the development of natural social bonds with family and friends. For example, the average young adults spends 6-10 hours daily on Facebook and Instagram interacting with friends online. This can strain the physical communication between close relatives and loved ones who do not interact online.",
        "However, some will argue that technology has created a much needed online community, larger than what is obtainable physically which aids the social lives of many youths. The emergence of technological platforms has led to the creation of many communities online. Young people can now socialize, connect with friends and meet new people. Most importantly, youths can build professional profiles online and secure jobs.",
        "In my opinion, while the abuse of social media can be rampant and create a lapse in physical communication with immediate loved ones, technology has made youths more sociable by granting access to platforms which they can socialize with millions of people and develop their lives.",
        "In conclusion, although the pitfalls of excessive technological platforms are apparent, these tools have afforded young people the opportunity to be social and build a community, larger than can be done without technology."
