Tax money should spend on people's primary need such as health, education, transportation and house, but using a lot of money for these project people will be against to their government. By doing explore  outer space will be dangerous for the earth and will cost us  life and others. For instance, we saw many disastrous mission done by NASA and other space agencies in recent years and lost many astronauts life and billion's worth assets .",
