        "Unpaid community service such as joining a volunteer work is considered by some of the people to be a necessary part of secondary school activities. From my point of view, I strongly agree with this perspective as it is an activity which contains benefits to younger generation.",
        "First and foremost, while doing unpaid community service, students have the higher possibility to develop social and working skills that are unable to learn from textbook. The different between unpaid community service and a employment is just about volunteer and having salary. Indeed, most of the work in a community service is similar with a job. Owing to this, ones can definitely learn some working and social skills when participate in this kind of activities. Furthermore, due to this, people can have the higher opportunity to find a better jobs after they graduate.",
        "However, some of the people support the opinion that working for unpaid community service is a waste of time. They commonly believed that this kind of activities will deprive their study time. Nevertheless, take part in unpaid community service can help people to increase confidence and become a optimist person. For instance, I have joined a volunteer service club when I am a secondary school student. When doing all the work and participate in those activities, I found out that I have changed my personality from fearful to brave. Hence, I become a confidence person.",
        "In the conclusion, unpaid community service provide many merits to high school students, therefore it is necessary for them to participate in this activity."
