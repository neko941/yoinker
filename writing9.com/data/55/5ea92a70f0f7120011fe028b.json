        "It is widely believed that it is essential for all parents to attend childcare lessons because of the importance of caring for children in any society. From my perspective, I completely disagree with this point of view, and will give my reasons below.",
        "Taking childcare courses is no longer necessary thanks to the development of technology nowadays. Due to this advancement, most information can be found on the Internet by utilizing search engines. As a result of this, parents these days have the ability to gain the knowledge of the way to become great caregivers without spending time and money on these courses. For example, if a first -time mother do not know how to breastfeed her newborn, she can access the website \u201cYoutube\u201d and search for the keyword \u201cbreastfeeding \u201c. There will be a huge number of videos demonstrating the right way do this.",
        "Another reason would be the change in the roles of each family member. In my opinion, even if parents enroll in these courses and acquire a deep understanding of looking after children, they will find it difficult to provide great care for their offspring as they normally do not have enough time. According to research, over the past few years, there has been a significant rise in the number of households with two employed parents, so most children today are sent to childcare centres. Therefore, teachers performs the primary role in giving best care to children; while parents just play the secondary one, and taking childcare courses are non-essential for them.",
        "In conclusion, I fully support the view that childcare classes should not be compulsory for all parents because these could be replaced by modern technology and childcare services."
