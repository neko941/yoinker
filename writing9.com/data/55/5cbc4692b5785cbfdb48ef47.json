        "In this day and age, the worldwide percentage of overweight people is rapidly increasing. A major cause is due to the adoption of a sedentary lifestyle and unhealthy food choices. This essay will closely examine these causes and the worrisome consequences.",
        "Firstly, one of the main reasons for obesity are due to unhealthy lifestyle trends in the 21 st century. With busy everyday lives, people gravitate towards easy lunch and dinner options like fast food and microwaveable meals, which are high in sugar and fat content. To illustrate, a study conducted by the American obesity society found that fast food industry market has tripled since the year 2000. Secondly, people don\u2019t find the time to include exercise in their everyday lives. Exercise is key in burning fats and building muscle which in turn reduces your total body fat percentage. This lack of exercise combined with unhealthy eating is a recipe for obesity. *sitting in offices// transportation *",
        "The effects of obesity are countless. A major one is that obesity leads to massive health deterioration. For example, overweight people are 70% more likely to develop diseases such as heart failure, hypertension and diabetes, the leading causes for death worldwide. This causes early morbidity in younger individuals. Furthermore, overweight people result in massive losses to the healthcare system every year. Due to their liability of disease, millions of dollars are spent each year on diabetes and hyptertension medication. To emphasize, a study by the NHS in 2018, found that 50% of hospital beds each year were occupied by over weight indivisuals.",
        "In conclusion, awareness and implementation of healthy food options , as well as, more vigorous global exercise schemes will help in solving the issue of global obesity. Furthermore, preventing the consequences that arise such as increased morbidity rates."
