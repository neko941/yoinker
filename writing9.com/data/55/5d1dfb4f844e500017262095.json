        "It has been considered by most employers that asking for more personal information from applicants aids in a job selection process, while on the other side, it has been argued that asking for such data is in no way necessary for accessing whether an applicant is the right fit for a company.",
        "Employers normally ask these information because they feel understanding an applicant on a personal level helps them tailor if he or she is the right fit. In order words, employers need these information to get a feel of who the individual is before the interview process.",
        "On the other side of the argument, some people argue that this information is not necessary in judging if an applicant is the right fit. Applicants with that point of view feel their personal lives should be separated from their professional lives. I have witnessed scenarios where applicants don't share their social media accounts on job applications because they feel employers only need to know their education and professional work history.",
        "From my own experience, I have always found asking personal information is key to better understand who you are dealing with. For instance, if my business leverages on employees to communicate and work across distributed teams, I would expect asking more personal information about a person would better determine if he or she would be able to handle working in a distributed way.",
        "In conclusion, if an employer asks for a bit of personal information, I feel it is the duty of applicants to provide such information as it would go a long way in ensuring success in their job search."
