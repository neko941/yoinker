        "Over the past century, the human population has exploded. The rise of a mankind is leading to the destruction of the planet earth. A recent study showed that the humans are paving a way for another mass extinction, many species are dying out rapidly and as a result, earth is losing out its bio-diversity. One of the main factors that lead to this unfortunate situation is human growth itself.",
        "The rise of modern medicine and the industrial growth has shown a huge impact on the human life expectancy, until 19th century the average life time of a person was less than 50 years, but now it is beyond 70 in many countries, this trend ultimately lead to the increase of our population. To meet growing demands of such a huge population, mankind turned to the earth for resources and started extracting them like never before in the history. Deforestation, hunting the wild animals, uncontrolled fossil fuel extraction lead to the loss of the earth\u2019s bio-diversity.",
        "The first two important steps to save the earth\u2019s ecological balance on are, the human birth control and mankind should learn how to live peacefully with the nature rather than by destroying it. Additionally, emission of the greenhouse gases must be limited, and forest cover needs to be improved and wild animal poaching has to be eliminated.",
        "To conclude, all the intended targets can be achieved only by increasing awareness among the public and all the governments should be work together in coordination. If we don\u2019t give enough attention to the crisis, the next species that are going to be extinct is us."
