        "We are currently living in a modern society when people are more likely to judge people based on their social status and material possessions. While some argue that people can neglect traditional values like honour, kindness and trust, I believe that people should consider the old-fashioned values more.",
        "On the one hand, one\u2019s social-economic status can also tell us brief information of a stranger. As the matter of fact, it is quite easy to figure out which part of social ladder a person belongs to these days by knowing the district the person lives in and the occupation he or she has. People are commonly behave differently according to their social position, and thus majority of wealthier people are expected to behave decently. Furthermore, as polarization is worsening, people find hard to socialize with other groups of social level, and it can be another reason why people consider that material values are more important. In addition, some people may say that the rich should be respected because they put more time and effort to be successful.",
        "Nonetheless, people should try to get to know each other concerning personalities. Firstly, because there is more chance that the wealth was not achieved by their own effort but their ancients\u2019, judging people based on their look is pointless. Despite to their designated wealth condition, good people are more likely to try to be better people than they used to be, wherein people should respect them. Great personalities to be trustworthy, caring people cannot be achieved so easy, they are likely to put a lot of energy and effort to train themselves in order to be a good person. Furthermore, if people respect the personalities when they choose their friends, colleagues and neighbors, the citizens can build up better society.",
        "In conclusion, there are convincing arguments for and against standards to judge people, but I believe that personalities should be considered first beyond their social economic status."
