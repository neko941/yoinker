        "Some individuals advocate that Zoological parks should be shut as they engage in cruel activities towards the animal while others believe that they preserve the fauna. I will discuss both the views before citing my personal opinion.",
        "Most of the animals are caged for the show business and authorities earn huge revenue from them. Varieties of animals from different regions of the world are sourced to attract the customers. However, officials forget that they are also living creatures and like to live a free life as humans. As an instance, it is commonly seen that different birds are kept restricted in cages; however, they love to fly in open sky. This is the kind of injustice humans do to these innocent birds. With this in mind, zoo should be closed and wild life should be made free to live its own life.",
        "On the contrary, it is also seen that national parks helps to preserve the rare species of fauna. At times, some of the species get endangered and are on the verse to get extinct. In this scenario; zoo\u2019s play an important role. For example, India was able to save the species of White Tiger when they were getting low in number and it was possible inside the zoological park only, where they were properly cared for and suitable atmosphere of reproduction was produced.This helped in saving one particular kind of breed.",
        "To sum up, although wildlife parks are primarily running for profit purpose, they also have the responsibility to save the endangered species. Since, there are high chances that many animals might get extinct in future, wildlife parks should not be closed as they are the ones who protects them."
