        "Education for students has long been of paramount importance in today's society. It is argued by some that students are inclined to gain academic study with the overall aim of getting through exams in lieu of having skills such as cooking and dressing. However, I would contend that the role of such skills is indispensable to the development of individuals.",
        "I acquiesce in the view that acquiring academic knowledge at schools is of fundamental necessity. The primary reason worth mentioning is that such a wealth of knowledge related to core subjects may be intrumental in assisting students in coping with their homework and tackling exams. Take Vietnam as a prime example. This country has witnessed a majority of students in specialized schools are obliged to build up a sound understanding of inequality, three-dimensional geometry so that they are likely to battle against challenging questions in the national entrance exam. These students would ipso facto stand a higher chance of matriculating in top-tier seats of learning, paving the way for being caught by headhunters' eyes. Another significant reason is that as the nature of academic knowledge is formal and literate, instilling such information in university people means that they may get direct access to a fertile source of learning. Students may, therefore, get smarter and be capable of becoming more confident in their abilities when dealing with examinations.",
        "In spite of aforementioned arguments, I side with those who firmly believe that essential skills such as cooking and dressing can not be treated as unimportant. Admittedly, every school curriculum should be designed to equip students with such necessary skills. In reality, mastering these skills would act as a springboard for students' enhanced sense of self-reliance. An excellent example of this is that when opting to study overseas, people can evidently save a large amount of money allocating for eating in restaurants if they are provided with self-cooking skills. Besides, manipulating the teaching of how to dress could serve as an ideal vehicle for increased performance in students' daily life. For example, when frequenting a trip to untouched areas, citizens will know how to select appropriate protective clothing in order to avoid being in jeopardy.",
        "All the existing data has laid a concrete foundation that although the merits derive from academic knowledge that lend a students a helping hand in succeeding in exams are considerable, I am more convinced that elementary life skills such as cooking and dressing could be undeniably at the core of the enhancement of one person. It is anticipated that more people will consider upgrading their elemental skills in preparation for the future."
