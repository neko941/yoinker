        "Many people argue that it is aimless to protect or preserve animals, humans now have no space left for them to live on. Animals have no use for humans so we don't need to care about them. I absolutely disagree with this opinion.",
        "The statement that wild animals don't have a place to survive. It is clearly nonsense to say that and the reason for it is humans just work for their own benefits, they want to take all the places. Despite the fact that there are many existences of jungles and forests for animals to live in. Nevertheless, there is no reason for us to steal the wild animals' habitats and destroy their homes for our advantage. Humans should be more responsive to the Earth we are living on.",
        "I also disagree with the speech that animals have no need for us so we don't need to spend money protecting them. The fact that natural habitats exist to be a place where creatures can live , the appearance of the natural habitats should be parallel to the animals. The following reasons are rainforests, for example, produce a huge amount of oxygen and the climate for the Earth, they absorb the carbon dioxide from the animals and also the nutrients from their dung. So as a matter of fact, the cost of protecting animals is much cheaper than what we will cope with.",
        "In totality, humans have no permission to decide what they want and destroy the remaining nature. We should control our actions and care more about animals and their habitats."
