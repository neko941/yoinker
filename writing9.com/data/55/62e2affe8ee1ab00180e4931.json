        "Some university students live with their families while others do not, depending on their campuses' location. This essay will go deeper to state the benefits and drawbacks of each scenario.",
        "To begin with, students staying at home can gain several advantages. First of all, there would be no concern about dorm fees, which is really an upper hand. Moreover, it will be safer if students live with their families under the supervision of their parents. A study by the FBI has stated that there had been a large number of undergraduates who were being tempted by drugs due to immaturity when staying far away from home. However, there are two sides to every story, the thinking that family will always be there to give them a hand makes students become less independent. On close inspection, although university students who live with their families can save on dorm fees as well as have a safer living environment, they probably need to deal with the challenge called \"avoid depending on anyone\".",
        "Referring to the views of studying and living far from home, it can be said that students will have a great chance to train themselves in a real society. Stepping out of their comfort zones called \"family\" is synonymous with students must manage their life from the smallest. Even though they have to exert maximum effort to overcome drawbacks, the thing left could be a feeling of freedom. Conversely, homesickness is a common issue that students living on their own have to deal with. Deciding to live on their own, they will have more duties and responsibilities to what they have done, I wonder in a cleft stick, have they ever wished to have their families by their side. Having freedom to manage your life is great, but homesickness somehow might hinder your determination.",
        "In the final analysis, there are different advantages and disadvantages to both situations. Though students living with families have advantage of finance and security, they should not have been dependent. On the other hand, students living away from home seem to be more independent but homesickness could be their concern."
