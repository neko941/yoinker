        "A high number of individuals in recent times depend more on private cars as their main mode of transport which has some demerits including environmental pollution and rise in traffic congestion. These and more would be discussed in this essay along with some solutions proffered.",
        "First of all, the overt use of personal vehicles by people causes an increase in traffic congestion. This is because increase in the number of private cars on roads will slow down traffic, implying that time is unnecessary wasted and stress level is raised thus, affecting people's health. In addition, environmental pollution and potential damage could occur with this development. According to the Journal of Australian Geophysists, a rise in the number of vehicles plying roads leads to more carbon emissions (from car exhaust pipes) which further depletes the ozone layer, posing a threat to our environment.",
        "Secondly, with people relying too much on private vehicles for movement, living in isolation is encouraged. This is as a result of reduced interaction with people as personal cars offer privacy. By so doing, opportunities to communicate with others while taking public form of transport is lost, diminishing interpersonal relationships, resulting in people living socially unhealthy.",
        "One effective step to tackle this issue is by the government enforcing regulations to limit the usage of private cars in certain metropolitan areas. This in turn leads to reduced traffic congestion and environmental damage from exhaust pollutants. For instance, only public transport is allowed in the capital city of Senegal within the last five years and this has aided in resolving their traffic problems. Furthermore, people can be educated on the financial, social and environmental implications of the increase in personal motors for private transport, encouraging them to patronise public transportation for some trips.",
        "In conclusion, while it is obvious that more people utilise their private vehicles for transport, it is associated with some problems. I believe that this issue should be observed closely by the government and adequately assessed for the good of the masses at large."
