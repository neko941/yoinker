        "In a few nations, there is an increased trend among people to follow a vegan diet. This essay argues that health benefits of being a vegetarian far outweighs the minor disadvantage of not having enough options while travelling.",
        "Following a plant based diet can be disadvantageous during the travel to a foreign country as people have a few choices. That is say people who are strict vegetarian have to face problems due to lack of varieties available during their stay abroad. This is especially true for the regions where animal based products are a preferred option. For instance, one of my friends who eats only pure vegan food had to face a challenging time during her visit to Vietnam as most of the restaurants did not provide any vegetarian cuisine. However, this problem can be avoided if a person does an extensive research about places which offer vegan meals before travelling.",
        "The obvious advantage of being a vegetarian is that it is much  healthier comparitively to meat based food products and  reduces the risk of various diseases. That is to say vegan meals are rich in nutrients, fibre and antioxidants which help controlling a person's weight and in turn, prevent people from becoming an obese and other health risks associated with it. For example, as per research by Ohio Health Foundation, people who eat plant based diet have a 50 % reduced risk of a heart attack and diabetes. I believe that this makes eating  vegetarian food worthwhile and eclipses all drawbacks of not having adequate choices during travelling.",
        "In conclusion, In my opinion, people can have a good health by following a vegetarian diet and this advantage overshadows the disadvantage of not having enough varieties of vegetarian meals during travel."
