        "Which is important, work in a company or be a self-employed person?",
        "To begin with. some people want to be self-employed person, rather than to work in a company or organisation. For, instance, when a person is graduating from a university, he or she needs to have a job, therefore that person has two ways in his or her life. Firstly, establish a new company or job based on his or her inner personality and ability. Secondly, work in an  industrial company or a government organisation. In addition, when a person wants to be  self-employed in future, he or she needs enormous money to start new work or job. So it will be difficult for everyone.",
        "Furthermore, there are numerous advantages and disadvantages for self-employing or work in an organisation. For example, if a person work in a majority company, he or she can get different experiences from other people who are working in that company. But in my opinion, if a person starts a job on his or her feet, Finally he or she can achieve newest experiences. Different experiences arise from our routine daily life and some other experiences stem from our inner abilities. Therefore, people can choose to be self-employed or work in an organisation, it depends on their personality and their features.",
        "To conclude this essay, I would say if I have numerous money, I prefer to establish a new start-up and  be an entrepreneur in my life."
