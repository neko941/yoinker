        "Since the social media has been invented it become a major platform for communication and people can keep themselves up to date with their live and about their families and friends lives as well. But many people believe that, positing your personal information has potentials risks.",
        "However, social media has its risks. As people of all ages have access to social media, children are more prone and can easily exposed to adult content and approached by strangers with unknown intentions such as pedophiles. Even if children are sure of who they are talking to, still it does not eliminate its dangers. For instance, cyber bullying, we heard about it in news frequently. In addition to this, parents feel that their children are home and away from their bullies and are in safer environment, but still at some point they are still bullied by their bullies on social media which sometimes disturbs the children mentally so badly that they end up committing suicide.",
        "Furthermore, social media can be problematic for adults as well.  Sometimes it affects their jobs as well, the way they are positing and sharing their information on social websites. For example, when they post about things which they don\u2019t even do in their real lives. They can indirectly cause a bad impression on other people and as well as on their employers and if in case the employer judges the content you post on social media and he/she feels uncomfortable about the content might cost you your job or sometimes it is difficult to keep or attain your job if you present yourself as a different person on social media.",
        "However, if people are more aware while using and sharing their personal information on social media and only post respectful and respectable content, then definitely the advantages of social media outweighs the disadvantages. Finally, children and adults can easily be benefited from such technology."
