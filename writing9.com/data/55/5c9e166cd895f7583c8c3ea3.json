        "Dear Kiran,",
        "I hope this letter finds you in radiant health and good spirits. I am writing to take care of my house while I am away for a couple of days to attend a seminar.",
        "I have an important seminar at Delhi and being a team leader, my presence is unavoidable. The seminar is of 2 days and it is hoped to bring a big contract to my company. To be more specific about my business trip, I will fly from Vadodara airport on 4th of april and will return on 7th of april. Since you have been to my place many times before, I would not have to explain you much about my household. I cleaned the whole apartment, so you do not need to worry about it during your stay. However, I would insist you to buy tea, sugar and salt because the stock for these items is over and i could not get enough time to buy them. Moreover, the only thing that I have to tell you is to take care of my pet -toby, who is a vegetarian turtle. Although he is friendly and would not bother you much, please feed him with special veggies that i kept in the refrigerator.",
        "I will give the keys with my neighbour so that you can collect from Mrs. Jane when you come in my absence. Admittedly, I will not have to worry as you are going to take care of my house and toby during my business trip.",
        "I look forward to hearing from you soon.",
