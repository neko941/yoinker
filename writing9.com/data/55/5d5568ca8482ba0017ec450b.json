        "Deciding whether to work,travel or go to the University can become a challenge for young people. There are countries which propose working or travelling as an option for people who have just graduated from high school, before they continue their studies further. This essay will discuss the benefits and drawbacks about this issue for adolescent people.",
        "On the one hand, there are many positive aspects for a person to whether have travelled or gained some work experience in his or her early ages. \u0130n terms of experience; \u0130f someone has had some kind of it before he or she consider higher education, it will not only be easier to choose what to study, but it will also be a grounded decision. For instance, someone who has worked as a cashier at a supermarket before and then opt to study Economics at University, will be more aware of the studies and what to do after graduation, compared to the student who hasn't worked somewhere at all.",
        "On the other hand, there is also drawbacks of taking a break from being a student and trying on other roles in life. A major risk is that these young people won't opt to continue their studies after having roamed around the world or started to earn some money. As a result, they compare each experience and might not find University as fascinating as before. For example, in more conservative countries like \u0130ndia, students who have graduated high school are competing with each other to start their further education as soon as possible.",
        "\u0130n conclusion, whether a student choose to take a break before University or not, it will always be the right choice because we all operate in different ways. \u0130n my opinion, it will always be harder to come back to school after a long break. Due to the lack of motivation and concentration. Therefore, it is always better to finish something you have started before you go on."
