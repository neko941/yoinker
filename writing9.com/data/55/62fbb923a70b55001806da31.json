        "It is common for students to take a gap year to work or travel between graduating from high school and going to university, to which there are both advantages and disadvantages.",
        "There are some negative impacts of taking a gap year for students. Firstly, it is easier for students to waste precious time when they lack external controls and self-discipline during the gap year. Some students would use a gap year as an excuse and choose to stay at home or idle their time away, instead of making the best use of their gap year. What is more, some students who lack self-control would lose the motivation to study, since they would become confused about what they should do, without a clear plan for their future.",
        "However, more advantages can be seen if students take a year off to travel or work.",
        "For starters, this practice allows students to gain life experience and achieve personal growth. To be specific, the student would become open-minded and experience all-around development through traveling around the world to see the diversity of cultures and meeting various people in different places, which would expand their views in the long term.",
        "Additionally, taking a gap year is a perfect choice for those who want to break from the traditional academic track. Since there is a considerable amount of academic pressure on the student before graduation, which may cause some mental problems like anxiety or depression, students taking a gap year can have enough time to relax from their intense schedule, thus having better stress management when they enter the job market. In addition, taking a year off is an excellent opportunity for students to explore their academic goals. Some students might be uncertain about their field of interest, but during the gap year they could fully consider their options and prepare for future study, which would benefit their professional development and career prospects.",
        "In my opinion, the advantages of taking a gap year outweigh the disadvantages, since it is a perfect chance for students to gain various life experiences, have a break from heavy the burden of academic study and explore their academic pursuits."
