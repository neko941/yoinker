We can use the internet for ordering everything or if we want to travel to another country, we can ring our family or friends on the internet or we can hear new news on the internet. Most children love the internet because when there is the internet they can go to Instagram, we can say the internet is entertainment for some people. As you know there is the corona so stidents can not go to school so they use the internet for connecting with their teachers. From the internet, we can have a lot of income. We can book a hotel or train.",
        "Do you think whit is the disadvantage of the internet? Maby somebody sends a message to children, for example, please send me your parent's email password and please do not say to your parent. Some games need to connect to the internet, when children connect to them, maybe they are a virus. Some games are said children if you want to continue this game you must cut your hand then you have to take a picture then you have to send it to me, You will continue this game. Some children go to some sites that the sites are very very bad for them.",
