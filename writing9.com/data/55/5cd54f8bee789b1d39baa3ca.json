        "There is a popular saying that information gotten from books are limited. It is widely believed that aquired intelligence received from experience is different from reading mainly because of personal encounters and contacts.  I am of the opinion that information gotten from experience is more essential to individuals of this generation because many people spend more time going through life than reading about past events.",
        "There are many aquired wisdom from experiencing a situation or an event personally than reading from a source. The major upside to this is personal encounter. In other words, an individual does not fully know about a situation that he or she has not personally withnessed. Take for example, the 2010, Twin tower bombings, many people read about these bombings but could not feel the impact this had on the survivors. Thus, resulting in personal encounter as a more efficient way of understanding events than reading.",
        "On the contrary, reading different reliable materials would give limited understanding about a particular situation or event. Take for instance, the world war 2, in 1976, most people read about the events that occured during this period giving a great view of activities that were carried out during these periods. Many youngsters of this generation would probably never experience another historical moment but due to available resources, they can read about these events thus, giving them a better view and understanding of those moments.",
        "In conclusion, both ways produce comprehension of events however, there are limited understandings and insights of these events in reading materials than in personal experience of such events."
