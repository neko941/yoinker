        "Audience exposure to television, nowadays, has become increasingly significant in information and knowledge dissemination. Some argue that all famous TV entertainment programmes should have the purpose of teaching its watchers about crucial social problems. I support this view view. Although, I believe that there are other platforms as well.",
        "On the one hand, many TV entertainment programmes such as drama series and soap operas are being aired on screen. With this, a lot of ordinary life scenarios are depicted in the scripts provided and acted upon by celebrities. For example, crimes and violence is one of the most popular themes that are incorporated into entertainment channels such as soap opera and drama series. As a result of this, TV viewers are greatly affected when it comes to their behavior and attitudes. Thus, watchers can learn from this scenes if they are displaying the right attitude or behavior.",
        "On the other hand, with the proliferation of the internet, people have become more sensitive to certain societal concerns. In addition, in this time immemorial, individuals have become more keener on using social media sites such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. Consequently, these networking sites are utilized at its best in educating the greater mass media consumers about certain social issues, presently. To illustrate this, consider the controversial case of Johnny Depp and Amber Heard which was televised on screen regarding domestic violence. This was aired on screen and as a result people have come out to support who they are for or against with, educating them that domestic violence happens not only for ordinary individuals but it can happen to anyone.",
        "To sum it up, TV entertainment programmes like soap opera should aim to educate its viewers. However, there are also other ways in which watchers can learn from social problems like the internet."
