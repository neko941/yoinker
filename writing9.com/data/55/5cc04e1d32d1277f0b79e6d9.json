        "It is true that today one can spend his free time watching their favourite films and playing interesting games, as everything is available at any time through their mobiles, tablets, laptops and desktops which has its own benefits and drawbacks. I believe pros overweigh the cons of this development if these are used within limits as overuse of everything is bad.",
        "On the one hand, one can spend their free time enjoying their favourite movies and games. They don't feel alone at any time with the smartphone in their hand. One can kill their lonely time by starting a movie. In addition to this, It helps people to connect with other members who play the same games. I have seen people discussing about the games, which are in trend, which in turn give rise to communication. Also, people can play quiz games where the person who is fastest to answer will win. These type of games helps building their knowledge base as well as are seen as a positive development.",
        "On the other hand, when people start giving priority to the electronic gadgets instead of other people around them then it makes things unpleasant. To add to this, these things have a negative impact on children growth as they prefer to spend most of their free time watching movies and playing games instead of socializing with their friends and family members and the same trend is seen in adults and older people. Apart from this, these have numerous side effects on people's health such as weaken eyesight.",
        "To summarize, everything comes with its own advantages and disadvantages. Access of anything is bad so if the latest gadgets are used in a controlled manner to watch films and play games then it proves to be fruitful. Alternatively, if these things start replacing people around you then it is considered to be a negative development."
