        "Music has variety and forms in different countries all over the world. This essay will first discuss that people listen to music because they found it a source of relaxation and second why I think a country\u2019s own music is more crucial than the international music.",
        "On the one hand, to begin with, people listen to music in order to get relaxed. People in different countries listen to certain kind of songs or instrumental pieces after work, study or in normal occasions so that they can acquire calm feelings. This is because there may be a song or other musical pieces, which may be a way of soothing for them. This, in turn, may be a way of releasing stress. The international Art Agency of Sweden, For instance, showed in a study that 85% of people opt for music for either making themselves out of a certain mental depression or for feeling relaxed.",
        "On the other hand, I belive listening to own country\u2019s music is more critical than the foreign music. It not only encourages people to support and admire their own cultural values but also not attracted towards other countries\u2019 cultural aspects by listening to their songs. This would boost the importance of a nation\u2019s music in the world. Turkish classical songs, for example, are enormously popular in the Western Countries owing to the profound interests in it by their own people.",
        "In conclusion, although people listen to music for making themselves calm and stress free, local music is of more vitality since it promotes cultural importance."
