        "There are some people who think that a high-level education doesn\u2019t the best for children to find jobs. In my opinion, I completely disagree with this thinking that education is very important for finding jobs.",
        "First of all, education  is very important when people find a job or for the company to choose their employees. It is because each job has its education demands. If people don\u2019t fit the demand, the company will not apply you. For example, being a banker who needs some business knowledge. However, there is different knowledge to learn in secondary education, we will easy to find jobs. And when we have more knowledge, more jobs that we can choose. Moreover, secondary education not only lets us know this knowledge  but also for us to learn how to practice for  exams. So that people can apply their practice to their work.",
        "Secondarily, people can\u2019t find jobs that are not only because of their learning, but also have different reasons like the economic environment. When the environment is not good, the company don\u2019t apply new employees. It is because they need to control their price or can\u2019t open just like COVID-19. There are many companies that need to close their shops or stop their jobs. So , education isn\u2019t the only  reason that makes people can\u2019t find jobs.",
        "To sum up, there are many reasons that make people can\u2019t find their job. Conversely, learning not only brings us knowledge  but also lets us  find different jobs."
