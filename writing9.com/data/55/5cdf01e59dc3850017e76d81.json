        "Mega shopping malls have significantly acquired large portion of the market share from small retailers due to the fact that they were unable to compete with them and ultimately had shut down their businesses. I personally believe that it is a positive step toward transformation of old fashioned  style of doing business to modern one for the reason that it provides comfortability to buyers along with allowing them to get goods much more cheaper than the smaller stores.",
        "Firstly, purchasers prefer buying their needed items from on big center rather than visiting different small stores for every types of the needed products because all items are easily accessible and can be found at one place. In addition, it provides them comforts, saves their time, and enable them to enjoy their moment while walking around those magnificently engineered malls. To illustrate, in 2016 it was reported by Forbes that Dubai Mall in Dubai city had allowed the residents to save almost 50% lesser time by buying them from there than outside small shops.  It says that it is cause efficiency in day to day life of the people.",
        "Moreover, lets consider the financial aspects of it, the fixed cost of the goods is directly correlated with the number of items sold by the suppliers due to economies of scale, thus as the numbers of items sold upturns, unit cost decline which enables business to offer same goods at much lower price. Likewise, the large stores are in good position to take advantage the economies of scale because more people are willing to visit big malls due to different reasons.  . For instance, the success behind offering best offer in Kabul City center is paying less for finished goods than the small retailers; it means that these places provide people an opportunity to save cost.",
        "In conclusion, emerge of enormous shopping centers hugely affected local business to an extent that majority of them are unable to survive and compete with them. In my view, it is a positive development for the society both financially and comfortably."
