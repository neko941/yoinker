        "There is no doubt, that all parents want to protect their children from any problems, especially from any health issues. While some people believe, that children should develop their immune system by themselves, others argue that young age vaccination is paramount to avoid catching fatal disease. In this essay, I will discuss both sides of the argument and explain my support for the latter view.",
        "Immune system should be developed naturally without any external invasion. Opponents of vaccination believe, that this is a part of human\u2019s evolution; children get sick and once they recover their body becomes accustomed to those viruses and more protected in case of future contacts. Furthermore, immunization may have very troubling side effects. It\u2019s true, that there have been cases when a child obtains a lifelong disability as a result of a medicine allergy.",
        "On the other hand, some long-gone illnesses like varicella have started to emerge recently. Based on the latest World Health Organization report, this problem is directly correlated with increasingly higher number of families, who opted not to immunize their children. I find this trend very disturbing, basically only one unvaccinated pupil in a school exposes all the rest to higher risk of catching a life-threatening sickness. In contrast, if all parents immunized their children according to the globally approved standards, the likelihood of a virus to appear would be significantly lower.",
        "In conclusion, although all parents struggle to force their precious children to endure shots and there is a temptation to delay vaccination or refuse doing it completely, such behavior may lead to fatal results. In my opinion, immunization is crucial for each individual child and the whole society, hence I would advocate that the governments must enforce obligatory vaccination around the world."
