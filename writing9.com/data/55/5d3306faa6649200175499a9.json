        "It is often argued that tuition fees for education ranging from pre-school to going to college should be sponsored by the government. In my opinion, I strongly agree with the above statement, as it will not only gived a person an equal right for education but will also lead to a better generation and lifestyle.",
        "First of all, receiving an education is one the most essential human rights to be provided for an individual. In other words, a person is entitled for receiving a decent education regardless his financial status. As a result, all children whether they come from low-icome families or from wealthy families will have equal and similar opportunities towards their careers and future lifestyle. For examplem a person should not be judged by his financial problems, however he should be seen based on his qualifications and education that he received equally as a child from the upper level society.",
        "Second of all, governement providing funds for studying to their current and upcoming generation will definetely lead for a better workforce and an upgraded life style. To state this thesis in other terms, having educated individuals will gradually increase the quality of life in a society, where crime rate will surely decrease enormously.  For instance, a recent study showed that neighborhoods with well-schooled population have 30% less murder and theft cases comparing to low-educated neighborhoods.",
        "In conclusion, I believe that it is more benefecial for both both individuals and the society for the governnement to sponsor tuition feels of schools and colleges, leading to a better future in regards to life paths and quality of life."
