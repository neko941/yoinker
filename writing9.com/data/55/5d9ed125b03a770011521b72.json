        "In the modern world, it is commonly seen most individuals spend a tremendous amount of funds to have grate matrimonies. although on the one hand, it is reasonable to celebrate the most wonderful event of their life with their family and friedns. However, I believe spending so much money to celebrate only one grate day of life cannot be accepted.",
        "Firstly, many individuals use to have bank loans to get an enormous wedding day but sometimes, it is extremely beyond their level. Most of the time those who get loans, will not able to pay after the wedding. After the wedding, they will struggle with those debts. As a consequence of it, those individuals will not able to spend happily married life with those money issues. As an example, without money, those couples will not able to spend on their day to day processes like food, medical and other services.   Moreover, debs can be an effect on the development of the family.",
        "Secondly, to spend a huge amount of money for a simple party cannot be accepted. Clearly, In the general population, many individuals suffer from poverty.

It is important to help those people instead of wasting money on partying is grate humanity service that those wedding couples can be satisfied in their lifetime.",
        "Finally, I believe spending a tremendous amount of cash on one matrimonial, better that has a simple wedding and help other people or use those funs to have a great life is the best thing to do."
