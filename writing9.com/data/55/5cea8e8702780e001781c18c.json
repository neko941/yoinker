        "Recently, charity work has been greately debated. It is proposed by some that the charitable services should be an integral part of secondary education. I do agree with the recommended idea and i think they could be beneficial to shape a welfare society.",
        "To begin with, unpaid community work and welfare of the other is thenoble job of righteous member of any society. Including charity organizations work as a must to do part of  high school education, has myriad of advantageous, not only to the student but to the whole community. To elaborate, firstly, it will create sense of responsibility, helping and cleaning in pupils. they would come to know what part they are expected to play and how mutaul efforts are channeled to upgrade sorroundings. For example, in Japan, unpaid community work carries a weightage in final exam, hence we see Japan as a social state.",
        "Secondly, certainly, team work is the key to succes. It will improve enhance cooperation and communication among the students and the valued members of society. When students work in groups, they come in contact with people from the different back grounds and cultures, it will help aleviate mutual difference for a common cause. For instance, a social studies research has revealed that people involved in group taska are tend to be more sociable than those who do not participate team work.",
        "To conclude, although making free social service a unit of secondary education may a burden to some, but it can prove as minder of new generation, instilling sense caring and cooperation in them."
