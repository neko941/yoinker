        "These days, English is widely used at many tourist destinations around the world, even in the non-native English speaking countries. As a consequence, in many places it is argued that this will result English as the only global speaking language. This essay will highlight some pros and cons related to a one language society.",
        "To start with, lets look at some positives of such situation. First and foremost, it will break the communication hitch amongst the people as they can talk in a common language without any hustle. Furthermore, it would also open many tourist attractions as an option for those people who were not being there because of linguistic issues. Another important advantage would be that, many job opportunities for youngsters would arise as English will be the common source of interviewing and interacting with the customers. To elaborate, many english language speakers will be able to find new jobs by adapting to English and can travel worldwide.",
        "Nevertheless, there are some drawbacks to a common language as well. Firstly, it would become a compultion in the society to learn English for every single use. For example, many people who do not understand English very well find very hard to adapt in this system where every level of communication takes place in one language. On the other hand, there will be a huge risk to many ancient languages to might go extinct. Some languages like French, Italian and so on, which is being spoken for past many decades might become unpopular amongst youth as they all will focus on learning and developing English skills.",
        "To conclude, the idea of same language all around the world is appreciatable. However, it should not restrain people to learn other languages, as it creates a diversity all across the globe."
