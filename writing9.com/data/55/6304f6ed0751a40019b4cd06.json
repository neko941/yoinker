        "Have you ever wondered what a day without your phone, laptop, or other technology might be like? We frequently view technology as an integral part of our life and attribute these advances to humans. There is an opinion, however, that \"people change technology daily, but technology also changes people's life.\" Is technology increasingly influencing and guiding individual behavior and habits and those of communities or generations?",
        "The term technology is taken from Greek, which refers to the instruments, abilities, and techniques humans employ in their daily lives. Today, technology is viewed as a system of methods, instruments, and capabilities for resolving issues or creating goods (physical and intangible). Humans are simultaneously becoming more technologically advanced and dependent or ruled by technology. Technology development and transformation is an unavoidable rule, which occurs when people actively replace an essential component or the complete technology in use with a more advanced alternative. Technology permeates every aspect of our life and provides us with undeniable benefits. Our lifestyles are getting better and better, saving work, etc. However, there are also negative repercussions associated with increasing technological dependence. When the majority chooses to retain meeting, chatting, and caring primarily through messages on social networks, this leads to laziness, inactivity, and drying out connections. Festival. The world of technology makes it easy for people to fall into delusion.",
        "Technology development is still required in the modern day. However, technological usage should be reasonable and acceptable. The government must improve the administration and application of technology for health and community reasons. In addition, each individual must strike a balance between using technology and fulfilling community and family obligations. Let technology become a valuable and efficient component of our life."
