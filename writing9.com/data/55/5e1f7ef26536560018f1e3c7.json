        "With the advent of technology, more and more children want to be financially independent by joining the workforce post-graduation. But with the rise in demand to get university education, the pressure to secure a seat in the university is increasingly getting challenging for both wealthy and not so wealthy people. This essay will argue that despite having an equal probability to get admission why wealthy people stand a greater chance to gain access in higher education institutions.",
        "Over the years since the demand for higher education has become a trend in a society, resultantly getting an admission into a higher university is increasingly becoming difficult for both extremes of society \u2013 rich or poor. Because of growing imbalance between the demand and supply to get higher education owing to a limited number of seats and teacher to student ratio, parents from all spheres of financial spectrum are struggling to have their children admitted. This fact is compounded by the result that the ratio of children not educated post-secondary education is growing at a rapid pace especially in developing countries. Hence, the amount of wealth is not a determinant factor in deciding whether a child gets the opportunity to pursue higher education or not.",
        "Although securing a spot for graduation or post-graduation is becoming an issue for everyone in the society, people with monetary muscle power still hold an edge to guarantee a position for their children. The above argument is even more strongly supported by the signs that show the gradual inclination of education industry towards commercialization. An example to complement this is evident in the growth of management (donation) quota in every institute primarily among the developing nations. So, to argue that both wealthy and poor children stand an equal chance for a degree is skewed and only partially correct."
