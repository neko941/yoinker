        "My name is Weisen Jiang and I have been working as a machine learning engineer since I graduated and receive Msc from the Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2015. Because of my career plan and my passion for research,  I consider possible labs for doing further research and pursuing a doctoral degree at this stage.",
        "My Master research focused on the identification of piecewise linear systems using sparse optimization and stochastic approximation approaches. During this research, I started to read some publications written by you and your co-authors on identification and estimation. Furthermore, our group also implemented the iterative feedback tuning technique in the recommendation system, which contributed to optimize its hyperparameters automatically and improve the robustness and stability of systems. Last month, I noticed the open positions on your homepage and decide to apply.",
        "The four years of professional experience in top Internet companies equipped me with solid programming skills and applied machine learning knowledge, as well as teamwork skills. These soft and hard abilities would certainly benefit my future study and also, the researches in your group and NewLEADS.",
        "Please let me know if these positions are still open. As shown in the attached CV and transcript, my grades are strong, especially in the major mathematics courses. You are welcome to contact my Master supervisor and work colleagues listed in the CV. Unlike the students who have not yet graduated, I could go to the lab and start research at any time when I receive the admission offer."
