        "The growing usage of virtual literature has led to a reduction in paper books. Many argue whether or not this is a positive development. This essay will, firstly, outline the advantages of e-books, namely, that they are more easily accessible and cheaper. Secondly, touch on the disadvantages, such as, the damaging effects they have on eyesight that can be easily tackled. I believe the positives effects exceed the negative effects.",
        "With the emergence of the internet, e-books are available at the touch of a button. In addition to this, translation options to over 100 languages are obtainable. Furthermore, the world wide web allows access to rare, ancient books that cannot be found at a library. For example, there are free websites like e-books.com that provide direct download links to millions of different books, ranging from world renowned novels to academic learning titles. As opposed to physical books, electronic literature is cheaper. When buying an book the value of the trees cut, the ink and printers are included in its price. Moreover, this obstacle is overcome as electronic literature does not require any costs. This makes it possible for people who cannot afford physical books. For instance, as a medical student I find medical books very expensive, alternatively, I download virtual copies that not only cost me nothing, but can be taken with me anywhere on my digital devices.",
        "Despite the easy accessibility and the low prices of books, there are also drawbacks. To begin with, a disadvantage of e-books is that an over-indulgence in them can lead to eyesight problems, like weaker vision. To illustrate, the Eyesight society published a study in 2012, stating that 4 hours of screen time per day can lead to a 50% reduction in vision. Thus,the constant glaring of screens is indeed, unhealthy and detrimental to visual acquity. Another negating factor is that people do not use as many books, which will lead to loss in their value and principles instilled upon us for thousands years.",
        "In conclusion I reaffirm my belief that e-books are clearly more advantageous than paper books as they are more affordable and accessible, and the minimal drawbacks are easily overcome. In the future, I hope all e-books are available for free by libraries and all authors."
