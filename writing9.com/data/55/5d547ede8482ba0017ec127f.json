        "The trending up rise of noise pollution in our day to day lives, poses great danger to all living creatures. There are a good number of ways to curb this menace like, policy against the use of automobiles and  installation of sound proof in companies, churches, and studios.",
        "One of the major problems faced with sound pollution currently, is the health challenge associated with it. That is, when we are exposed to disturbing sounds for a while, it destroys the typmpanic membrane and ear ossicles which are responsible for the protection of the inner ear. This will further damage the inner ear causing permanent deafness. A study conducted by a group of scientists at Havard University using 10 Universities with 5 students exposed to disturbing sounds from an industry while the other 5 students were protected with an ear blockade. The study revealed that the 5 students without protecting aids were deaf permanently while the other 5 students were not.",
        "Nevertheless, there are a number of ways by which noise pollution can eliminated. Although it is tasking but with constant monitoring and dedication, a lot can be achieved. One of the ways to eradicate sound pollution is the policy against the use of automobiles that is, government should enact laws, banning the use of automobiles in the society. In Nigeria, the legislative arm of government recently enacted a law against the use of automobiles in the country. It has reduced noise pollution from vehicles and motorcycles. Furthermore, with the promotion of sound proofs in industries, churches and studios, there would be reduced health hazards, associated with noise pollution. Moreover, this would instill sanity in the society. For example, in the United states of America, it is compulsory for churches and industries have their sound proofed to eradicate sound pollution. Fortunately, trucks and motorcycles are restricted from plying the roads. This is to reduce the number of automobiles on the road.",
        "In summary, there are a lot of ways to effectively prevent the physical and health challenges associated with sound pollution, they include; policy against the use of automobiles and promotion of sound proofs in industries, churches and studios."
