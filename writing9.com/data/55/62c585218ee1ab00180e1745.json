        "In the contemporary epoch,there is irrefutable debate among folks about  young star attending tuition.Certain individuals anticipate kids should take part in additional lectures after school while at the same time others contradict.I firmly coincide with and withstand the stated notion because more classes facilitate better performance despite the time for other essential activities will be limited.This discourse will further elucidate my assertions in the forthcoming paragraph.",
        "Firstly,the upper hand of attending tuition will always show results because the teachers will have ample time in attending students weak areas as a result their performance will improve.Moreover,toddlers who wants to perform extraordinary must go the extra mile to outshine although sometimes the exam can be complicated but they place themself in a position to beat all odds.For example,a research was done by Kenjohn(2020) in Uganda depicts that 90% of students who performs well attend further classes.This kind of arrangement gives the child confidence in performing better in the examination.Consequently,teenegers who attend special classes never disapoint as they are well prepared to face any challenge in the test.",
        "On the other hand,engaging a child with only school activity is detrimental as they are not able to handle other essential activities such as games despite performing well in their studies..Moreover,this will lead to a seleditary lifestyle which will lead to illness such as diabetes.For example a research done by the university of Nairobi depicts that 70% of students currently cannot perform house chores by the time they are done with their primary level of education.Therefore,a lack of social activities can cause complications to a child because they do not create time for such due to their commitment in academic studies.",
        "To sum up,i would like to restate my perspective that supplementary classes are indispensable as they facilitate the performance of the children.However,imperative social activities will be displaced by extra time created for studying which can lead to non-communicable diseases."
