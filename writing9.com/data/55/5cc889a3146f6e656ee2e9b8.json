        "It has been an age-long discussion by individuals, groups, society and governments about stakeholders\u2019 responsibilities with respect to making their habitation dirt-free and more liveable. To some, the onus lies on every inhabitant of a particular place while others believe that it is the government\u2019s bit. I believe, this duty majorly lies on the shoulders of each and every member of the society.",
        "To start with, every resident of an area is expectedly and naturally saddled with the task of keeping their environments as clean as possible; this eventually cascades up to form the bigger picture of a serene and neat neighbourhood. To further spur this instinct in people, leaders of societal gatherings, religious gatherings, social media influencers also have a role to play through awareness and campaigns against bad environmental habits such as drainage blocking with waste, nylons and plastics. This will definitely go a long way in keeping a pristine environment void of dirt.",
        "However, as much as every individual has a prime role to play in keeping a non-filthy surrounding, governments at all levels also have a skin in the game. A special arrangement should be made in gathering every household waste through provision of refuse trucks for residents to bin their refuse. These refuse are then conveyed to a special dump site usually at the outskirt of the town where they are possibly recycled into useful materials.",
        "In conclusion, in a bid to maintain a clean and tidy society void of dirts and filthiness, every individual in an household, every household in a community and the community at large have a major role to play in order to achieve this. These responsibilities lie more on everyone than the government."
