        "Social networking as a medium is very powerful and its popularity is growing day by day. Despite its virtues, social media\u2019s negative effects on our youth, especially the impressionable teenagers, are well recorded in the news. Major crimes resulted due to it  but not limited to, as per the crimes bureau report 2019 are, kidnaps, molestations, harassment, physical attacks, public shaming etc.... Gullible young people tend to trust random strangers online which are leading to vulnerable situations, as in the case of kidnap of a 12 year old girl from Kolkata. However, the bigger concern is lack of knowledge to the parents about their kin\u2019s activities on these platforms. This is proved by their surprised faces when police unravel the mysteries.  Luckily, there are ways to tackle this problem.",
        "Firstly, restriction helps. As prevention is better than cure, monitoring their activity and restricting the usage by hours they spend on mobiles would greatly help. This is because it reduces the probability of falling in a trap. In addition to these, technological solutions like \u201cChild Usage\u201d plug-ins similar to child lock on TV, would come handy in this situation.",
        "Secondly, communication is better. Though, the first solution works, there are limitations. There are several workarounds for these surveillance tools helping users hide their activities. Also, restricting mobile usage is practically non viable given their importance in today\u2019s education system. Hence, educating them about the potential hazards of the Facebooks and the Twitters is important. While there is a risk of looking like a preachy person, it is important to have this conversation. Additionally, providing a choice of  a healthy hobby like sports or reading will provide extra benefits as well.",
        "In conclusion, I suggest a two-pronged solution to curb the ill-effects of online social media. First idea revolves around controlling the usage while the second deals with a softer counseling approach. Both, if employed together, they work wonders on eliminating risks of this new age essential evil."
