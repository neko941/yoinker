        "In the modern society today, gender equality has been an increasingly debatable topic among people. While some people are of the opinion that both genders are equivalent and therefore should be able to perform any occupation they desires, others are of a contrary opinion. This essay will discuss why both males and females can perform the same jobs due to their equality.",
        "People still believe that the female gender is beneath the male gender. There is a common mentality that men are greater than women in all ramifications, and so they are not entitled to the same type of job. Certain jobs that require so much mental and physical capability are believed to belong to the men, while the women take the not so tasking jobs. The reason for this belief is that girls will grow to become mothers and wives and so they should left at home to take care of their husbands and children. For example, a final year student of psychology explained that his study on equality gender revealed that most men expect that they should be the ones carrying out most jobs. For these reasons mentioned, men and women are not equal and should not do the same jobs.",
        "Conversely, many people today today are of the opinion that gender equality is achievable and by so doing, both genders should be allowed to venture into the same occupation. Despite the fact that there are some jobs that require a lot of strength mentally and physically, we have women who have been trained in such fields and end up performing excellently. Females should be allowed to choose what they want to do without any limitations. In Spain, for example, three of the top neurosurgeons are women and serve as role models to others. This shows that the power of women lie beyond simple jobs and sitting at home.",
        "In a nutshell, there are different opinions on gender equality. While some believe there should be a balance between both genders, others do not have this belief. Ultimately both men and women should be able to do the same jobs."
