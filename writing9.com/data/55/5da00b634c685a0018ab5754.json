        "Dealing with criminals has always been a challenge for police officials. The advent of technology has marked a considerable rise in crime. To curb the issue a school of thought says that the best way to deal with criminals is to provide them education and job security rather than putting them in prison. This essay will discuss why I completely disagree with the notion including criminal minds are dangerous for society and it will be an injustice to the victim.",
        "To begin with, the prominent reason why criminals are liable to be in prison is that their minds are destructive and they only know to harm people. For this reason, it is seen that if someone commits a crime for a single time, it becomes their habit. To illustrate, the brain mapping of criminals has shown a different pattern. Therefore, such people are highly dangerous to society.",
        "Secondly, it is huge injustice to the victim. There are countless crimes that take place on a daily basis. For instance, every day a rape case is registered, dozens of snatching takes place and people are killing each other for wealth, health and jealousy. Particularly, there are people who have either lost their lives or those who are affected mentally and physically and for all their relatives it will be a matter of shame if the convict is being provided with the amenities instead of punishment.",
        "To sum up, dealing with criminals is a matter of concern. This essay discussed to build a safe society and justice to the victim it is essential to keep the prisoners behind the bars.",
        "ssential to keep the prisoners behind the bars."
