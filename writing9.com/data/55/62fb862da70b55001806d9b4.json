        "Studying another language apart from our mother tongue has always been a challenge to most people. Some said that this task's only purpose is for travelling or working in another region while others indicated that there are more reasons for learning a foreign tongue. This essay will analyze both perspectives and demonstrate my view on this matter.",
        "Firstly, a job or a trip in another country has been posed to be the only reason for learning a language by some folk. Language is often thought of as a barrier to communication for people coming from different countries. Considering that working and studying involve lots of communication, it is true that learning the nation's native tongue is necessary. In a working environment, people are assigned tasks by ones with higher authority who mostly comes from that country. In order to understand and tackle the problems completely, one should have profound knowledge of the language as well as the culture of the current country they are working in. For travelling, it is necessary to know at least some basic sentences of the native dialect in case of misfortunes such as getting lost or being robbed. Without studying the same language, it is impossible for a person to explain his or her situation to the authorities of that foreign nation. Apart from travelling and working, learning a language seems to play an unnecessary role in a person's everyday life. Without a chance to use that language, it is likely that we would forget the lexical and syntax resources in that linguistic system.",
        "On the other hand, many people have stated that jobs and travelling are not the only purposes of learning a language. Language is the root of all cultures and conventions. It is the source of human perspective as well as traditions in all countries. In this regard, many people argue that learning an accent helps them broaden their knowledge and shorten the distance between people from all over the world. Considering the development of technology, it is now easy to connect with community from anywhere, thus, resulting in the demand for learning a new dialect in order to understand each other and not trigger any conflict due to the lack of other cultures' knowledge.",
        "In conclusion, language is an absolute requirement for working and a helpful tool for travelling. However, I believe that an occupation or a trip is not the only reason for obtaining a new dialect. As human, we always long for communication and community, especially a community on the internet with all kinds of people. Therefore, a new dialect will support us in many other aspects of life, not just working and travelling."
