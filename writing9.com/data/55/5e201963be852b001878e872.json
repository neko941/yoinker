        "The definition of success vary among the people. Some individuals believe that, the major part of accomplishments are due to hard work and the rest is talent. This essay will discuss that the factors that mainly contribute to becoming successful are a person's efforts compared to any in born skills . In my opinion, working towards excellence consistently will definitely bear fruit irrespective of any talent.",
        "There is a popular belief that anyone who has an in-built skill will surely excel in that field. The primary reason is that they can perform tasks related with complete ease as compared to anyone else who wishes to learn. For example, a famous singer A R Rehman is considered as the best singer in the music industry and has great accomplishments on his name because it is said that he talented to understand music. Hence, a talented person may not struggle as compared to someone who is learning the skill.",
        "Despite all these factors, I believe that if continuous efforts are put to learn always supersedes talent. Even if someone has the capabilty but does not put any effort it may never show results. On the contrary, with the help of constant practice expertise in any field can be gained. For instance, Albert Einstein a well-known scientist was never talented but, is a known genius for his consistent efforts in Physics. Therefore, all this proves that hard work can definitely beat any gifted individual in any aspect of life.",
        "To conclude, there are many methods to become successful. Some argue that it is important to have the art while others say it is dependent on the consistent work. I opine that, without consistency any form of in-born skills will not reap success."
