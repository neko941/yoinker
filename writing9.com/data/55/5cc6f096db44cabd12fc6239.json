        "These days several parents give their children autonomy to freely make decisions on their own and also buy them anything they demand out of love. In my opinion, this approach is the main cause of behavioral problems in children and hinders their social and moral development once they become adult.",
        "Firstly, the belief that children should be allowed to do whatever they want and their demands should be fulfilled stems from the fact that they ought to be made independent. Moreover, some people have a rationale that for children to become resilient and robust, it is important that they need to make decisions on their own regarding food, clothes, and education. Consequently, this approach will make children responsible and accountable at an early age. Moreover, when they will become adult, they could make better career choices regarding their careers without having to seek the guidance of their parents.",
        "However, there are some drawbacks associated with this approach, particularly its impact on children behavior and social outlook. Indeed, by allowing children to do and get whatever they think is better for them will create narcissistic tendencies in them. Furthermore, when they would grow up, the impulsive nature will affect their personality and instead of being dutiful towards their parents they could become defiant and flout their orders. For instance, in western culture, it is common that children are allowed to make decisions regarding future without obtaining their parent's consent. As a result, they forget the fact that their parents have sacrificed their lives, energy, and resources and often leave them in OLD-CARE homes, forcing them to live last stages of their lives in loneliness.",
        "In conclusion, although the idea of making children independent by fulfilling all their wishes may have some benefits in making them competitive, it is my firm conviction that perils associated with this approach could spoil the fragile nature of children and make them defiant and insolent when they will grow up."
