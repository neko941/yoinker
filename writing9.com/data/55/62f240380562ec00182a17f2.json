        "In this modern developed society, news plays a very crucial role. Some pupils believe that newspapers are salient to read the news while other argue with this phenomenon that, they prefer  social media. In this essay, I agree with the second statement and will see  both sides of view.",
        "On the one side, Newspapers are  great experts who provide reports. Through this source we get standard data. But there are some disadvantages regarding newspapers that is it is not user friendly to carry everywhere. Even though India is the world's biggest country to prefer newspapers to read messages meanwhile some other countries stopped using newspapers as their cause to read the news.",
        "On the other hand, Social media is one of the modern technologies used as an origin to read the news.Most pupils are preferring social media because it is convenient to use. Pupils are good at browsing the internet, so it is easy for them to use media of their origin. For example, some countries like the USA are preferring social media as their expert to read the news.",
        "In conclusion, I agree with the people who prefer social media as their source of  news. Through social ,media people get infinite data and will get updated according to the technology."
