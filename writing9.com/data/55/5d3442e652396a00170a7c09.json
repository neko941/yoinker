        "Childhood obesity is rising at an alarming rate in the developed world. The only way to address this problem is for parents, school and governments to each take some responsibility for the issue.",
        "Schools have to educate young people abount diet. There is a lot of misinformation about health in the media today, and consequently, many children don't have enough information to decide what is genuinely nutritious. If children have real scientific knowledge about the effect fast food has on their bodies, they will be much less likely to make bad food choices.",
        "Parents should also monitor what their children eat. The major reason for childhood obesity is not what children consume at the dining table, but what they eat between meals. Parents ought to write down the snacks children have throughout the day, which would allow them to suitably adjust portion size at meal times. As most parents prepare their children's meals themselves, implementation this solution would be relatively easy.",
        "The government may be able to ban fast food restaurants selling meals to unaccompanied minorts Young children and teenagers are often not mature enough to make healthy eating choices themselves. If young people were unable to purchase convenience food themselves, then the intake of these unnecessary calories would be significantly reduced. While I concede that this would be an unpopular move with the fast food industry, the health of the next generation must be put before profit.",
        "In conclusion, only when parents feed their children less and schools educate their pupils more, will the obesity epidemic be overcome."
