        "Home schooling has become very popular among families who doesn't trust the education system or have barriers that prevents their kids from joining schools. Some people believe that the advantages of home teaching outweigh the school ones, others believe that no alternative can replace the benefits of getting a traditional education. Personally, I strongly believe that studying at house is only for specific children and any ordinary child should join the school. In this essay, we will discuss the advantages of home teaching and the problems associated with it.",
        "It is no doubt that home schooling can be tailored to suit the needs of any child and help him to maximise his learning and improve his skills. Although school can help children with social skills, it can also expose them to bullying which is one of the major problems schools currently suffering from. Moreover, there is no pressure associated with studying with parents or familiar tutors where children can feel safer and more comfortable. Where schools can be an intimidating environment and will limit the ability to learn with shy children.",
        "However, schools are offering another type of skills that house cannot provide, such as social skills and self-esteem. Usually parents tend to be protective and will limit their children exposure to the world by forcing them to study at house. Whereas schools can put children in a competitive environment which can push them to perform better and learn more from their peers. All the above cannot be found in houses and this can make the learning experience incomplete and not sufficient for a student.",
        "To conclude, in my opinion, unless there is a medical reason or force majure that oblige parents to home school their children, any child must join the school and have a proper learning expreience including social skills and knowledge exchange."
