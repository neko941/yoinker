        "Across many countries around the world, a few workers are known to earn very high salaries.  Certain people opine that this helps foster productivity and development not just for the individual but for nation at large. However, some other people believe that salaries should be capped. While it may seem unwise to invest very heavily in one sector of the economy, I believe that the country\u2019s labour force forms the backbone of the country\u2019s growth and should be strongly supported.",
        "On the one hand, the reason some proponents feel that granting high salaries to a small sect of people is unfavourable is that it might breed resentment and widen the gulf between the rich and poor. When a select number of people hold all the aces, the rest would be deprived of opportunities to grow, how morale sets in as the larger group tend towards thinking that bias holds sway. This happened in 2001 in Kuwait where the labour force went on strike because they felt unappreciated and under-compensated for their contributions to the nation\u2019s growth.",
        "On the other hand, I agree that it is only fair to reward any individual who exceeds expectations in performing their tasks. This helps the worker understand that they are also recognized thereby making them highly motivated. Higher salaries would also translate in a better standard of living for the individual and the family. Productivity would be at an all-time high because the staff would not be overly concerned about the family\u2019s welfare, would dedicate more time and effort to the job at hand and have the resources to adequately plan for a bright future ahead. To illustrate, 90% of employees in Nigeria who earned well above the minimum wage formed a coalition that helped cater to the less privileged and worked collaboratively with the government to restore various aspects of the country\u2019s dilapidated infrastructure.",
        "To conclude, having high-energy employees is what makes successful economies. This cannot be achieved by ignoring the needs of the labour force and with a lack of worthwhile incentives as a country cannot do without its people.",
