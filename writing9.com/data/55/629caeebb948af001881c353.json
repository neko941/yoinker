        "Recently, many countries have contributed a lot of financial budget to prepare competitors for the main worldwide sports competitions. However, some other people believe that it would be more beneficial if countries spend this money motivating children to participate in sports from their childhood. Personally, I totally agree with this argument.",
        "There are several reasons why I believe countries should stop spending a huge amount of money preparing competitors for sports competitions. Firstly, the cost of training an athlete to become competitive in the Olympic Games or football World Cup is extremely high. For example, systematic training needs high-quality equipment, experienced coaches, professional nutritionists and so on, which definitely costs a lot for several years. Secondly, the sunk cost of the preparation would be very high, since athletes are very likely to fail in competitions even though they have been trained for years. Finally, spending money cultivating competitors to take part in major competitions is a way some countries seek for national honors, but it has limited benefits for normal people.",
        "I believe that countries should allocate money to motivate children to participate in sports from a young age. Doing sports from childhood is beneficial to children's physical health because children could become stronger and more energetic through taking exercise. Doing sports could also make them more agile since exercising trains the body and brain of children to respond to things more quickly. Furthermore, from my perspective, encouraging children to take up sports from a young age is the best way for countries to prepare competitors for the major worldwide competitions. Starting doing sports from a young age, more and more children would have a chance to identify the sports they are good at and interested in, thereby resulting in their higher motivation during professional training in the future. With the passion and practice for years, children are more likely to succeed in global competitions after receiving more intensive training from the country. For example, the Chinese skiing athlete Eileen Gu started skiing from a very young age and continued to practice for more than ten years. After participating in the professional training of the national team, she won the championship in the 2022 Winter Olympic Games. It is true that starting skiing from childhood laid an essential foundation for her success after growing up.",
        "In conclusion, I totally agree that countries should allocate more money to motivating children to take part in sports from their childhood, instead of spending a huge amount of money on preparing competitors for the worldwide competitions."
