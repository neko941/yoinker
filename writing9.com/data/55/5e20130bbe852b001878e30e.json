        "First and foremost , there could be various advantages of moving large companies and factories to countryside , such as , people get more space for constructing houses and also it becomes easy for them to choose place according to their taste. Secondly , it also helps to diminish the obstacle of traffic as the roads get broaden. For example , in Delhi (India) , the problem of traffic is enhancing day by day and also people from different family live in one house by dividing the floors .",
        "Moving further , it will become easy for individuals for community around the society with in less time . Moreover , inhabitants from rural area can also move to urbar area and confront with new lifestyle and more opportunities.
