        "I completely disagree with people\u2019s notion that difficulties are much needed to make hobbies enjoyable; however, I ponder that it could be anything simple which offers people joy.",
        "A pastime can be exquisite, yet need not to be a strenuous task. All hobbies are meant to be exciting and with fewer difficulties so that we can keep them without any hustle. However, involvement of intricacies needs huge arrangements, time and money, for many it will be difficult to maintain perfectly. Difficult activities can provide excitements and memorable experiences, but to exercise as pastime we need something simple, yet can feel our mind with joy. For example, a simple reading habit is an outstanding hobby that affords people delightful experience. Through reading readers achieve a sense of happiness, for imagining the characters and climax of the story. A Harvard study reveals that reading is apparently easy; nonetheless, it fuels people\u2019s relishes more than 80% of other leisure activities.",
        "Besides, hobbies should not promote unwarranted stress in people\u2019s life. The key purpose of having a hobby is to derail people from their mechanic life and facilitate them to live stress free; paradoxically, complicated pastime activities compel people to involve in arduous tasks which evolve a great deal of anxieties because of the inextricable risks and threats. For instance, Bungee Jumping generates a potent adrenaline rush in human with a feeling of extreme exhilaration which amplifies the heart activities in an uncanny manner. Consequently, the performer becomes restless and irritable while performing that contradicts the concept of a salubriousness of hobby.",
        "Although some people opted to troublesome hobbies on account of the adventurous experience they gain, it is not obligatory to be difficult to be delightful. My firm conviction is that, activity that makes people relax, happy and passionate to stick with it for long time should only be contemplated as a pleasant hobby."
