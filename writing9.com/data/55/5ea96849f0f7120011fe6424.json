        "In some places television is the only source of entertainment. Where people can relax and make their mind fresh. Many people use their free time in watching movies, series and news  in their free time and it makes people lazy, unhealthy and prevent from social interactions",
        "I agree that television makes people lazy, especially when it comes to children now-a-days without television they won't eat food properly and that is completely wrong, they just want to sit and watch television for hours this makes them a week and it is unhealthy. Kids need to play or do different kind of activities rather watching television. For example: In my childhood when summer vacation you to come my mother didn't allow me to watch television for hours she use to set me a time where I have switched off the television. So that I should give more time to improve our own skills, play and interact with different people around me.",
        "In the 21st century people don't like to meet people and mostly want to spend their time watching television. When they have off days they like to sit in front of television and spend whole eating junk food. Most of the people miss their workout sessions because they want to complete Netflix series or movie and sometimes they miss social gathering. For example, one of my cousins all watch Netflix in his free time or sleep and which put him into obesity. People are getting lazy day by day. We have to avoid television sometimes to keep our self healthy and to avoid uninvited health problems.",
        "No doubt television gives us a lot of information about the world and updates us with important news and entertain people, but we have to watch in limit and focus on other important thing around us."
