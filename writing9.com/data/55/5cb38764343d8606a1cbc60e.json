        "Nowadays we have seen the trend that that people of different age work together in the same company which may cause benefits to the companies and individuals but there are some disadvantages. In this essay I will discuss its pros and cons and at the end will give my opinion.",
        "To begin with, first of all working together in the same workplace there might be different employers like junior and senior of different thinking. Sometimes we have seen the fact that senior employee often ignore junior candidates to assist them properly when they are in some difficulties about task to perform as result this will bring negative consequences to the company. In addition fresh graduate or internee or junior employee feel isolated which will be dangerous for him in long term in the form of finding work in another company.",
        "Secondly, employee working in the same platform will bring positive consequences if all compromises to work together in group and friendly. Not only company will be beneficial also the employees who work there. For instance nestle one of the best and good reputed company across the country where most of the people work together in a groups that contain seniors of age over 40 and internee under 26 years old. All senior staff transfers their work to junior candidates where they perform tasks according to instruction provided by senior authority.  In this way senior worker reduced their workload and junior gained practical experience, furthermore company will grow and give best output.",
        "In conclusion, despite the minor disadvantages working together from older candidates in the form of discrimination however performing in a group and equal assignment of work can cause good effect to the companies and employees."
