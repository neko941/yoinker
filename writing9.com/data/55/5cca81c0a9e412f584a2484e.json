        "In most of the developing nations work satisfaction considered as a luxury because, it is linked to the employee\u2019s professional as well as personal life. In my opinion, job satisfaction is extremely important and if employee is happy with his work, he will perform very efficiently and productive.",
        "Work ethics and daily practices are defined in most the companies by human resource department. If these policies really satisfy employee\u2019s expectations they definitely love their job. In developing countries, organizations are providing facilities such as, healthy working environment, life and heath insurances including their family, availing work from home, yearly increments and bonus\u2019s etc. These all facilities mean a lot to any employee while his or her employment serving period. For example, according to survey conducted in Canada on happiness index relating to their work life, which exemplifies, 85% people are happy with their employment and they believe it is all driven well as a treat due to standardization of work practices.",
        "In addition to this, job satisfaction plays vital role in employee\u2019s personal life too. People who are really like what they are doing, they serve better, efficiently and more productively. Satisfied employee\u2019s personal and professional life is stress free and they can enjoy their life fully. Such kinds of person\u2019s have fewer complaints about their life, work and even family as \u2013well. For example, in reference with survey conducted by Unicef Inc. in 2010 regarding employment satisfaction and they were interviewed around 2000 people around the globe. They came to supposition that, people who are satisfied with their work are happier as compare to unsatisfied people, they have more time for their family and regularly they enjoy short picnic plans with their family and friends.",
        "To conclude, in my opinion, considering job satisfaction as a luxury really worth it, when, it comes to happiness on personal as well professional level. At the end of the day job satisfaction really matter in everyone\u2019s life."
