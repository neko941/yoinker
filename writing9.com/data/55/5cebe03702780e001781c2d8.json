        "The number of crimes is soaring in many regions of the world, albeit many efforts of the society. What is worse, there is a significant growth in trend of ex-prisoners who will commit misconduct again after their first imprisonment experience. This essay will discuss some attributes to this dangerous trend before figuring out any feasible solution to it.",
        "Firstly, there are a host of reasons why these people reoffend once released. The main attribute is their incompetence in finding a decent job, since criminals are often lack of necessary life skills, ample education or vocation training to meet requirements of employees. Even if they were well-trained before imprisonment, implementation of these knowledge and skills could be challenging. To clarify, an engineer, who once mastered the art of creating wooden furniture, may be possibly unable to make a wooden chair after a 10- year sentence. As a consequence, they have no other options than involving in theft, burglary or more serious crimes to make ends meet. Moreover, ex-criminals are often regarded as unsuitable candidates in interviews as most employers only prefer those who have a decent background.",
        "However, with certain attempts, there is a high possibility to diminish reoffenders. An advisable solution is that the government plan more carefully about the education for sentenced criminals. This will ensure they can find a career afterwards to support their life and thus, benefit to the socioeconomic. That means, if they can find money themselves, their family or the government will no longer have to support them. In Korea, for example, vocational training schools were opened to reform prisoners across the country. In these special schools, they receive moral lessons, up-to-date knowledge about high-demand majors such as agriculture or technology. Thus, this country not only has the lowest rate of reoffenders in Asia, but also the one to spend the least on recapturing ex-crimes.",
        "In conclusion, there are numerous reason for the increase in the amount of crimes\u2019 misconducts after their release, namely due to these people\u2019s inability to find appropriate jobs. One of effective ways to control this rate is the government\u2019s effort in reforming the rehabilitation of them by a provision of proper education."
