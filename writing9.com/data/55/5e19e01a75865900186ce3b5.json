        "Now a days, in most of the cases people like adventure and consequently they plan a tour to visit places full of risks. There are several places where these people like to travel such as Antarctic region, Mount everest and so on. It is observed that people feels motivated after completing such an adveturous journey and it will help them at some point in life. There are various advantages as well as drawbacks for such destinations with full of adventure.",
        "First, let's talk about the positive aspects of it. People who plans such a trip gain good knowledge on how to survive in extreme conditions. For example, if someone starts trekking on Mount Everent, oxygen level reduces rapidly after a certain distance and as a result it becomes difficult to breathe. So, it is indispensable for every individual to carry an oxygen cylinder at their back in these types of journey which is another advantage where people learn to carry a heavy substance at their back in case of emergencies. Visiting such places also ensures discovery of any ancient material which nobody found earlier.",
        "There are several disadvantages as well if someone visit a place full of challenges. They risk their life in order to achieve something. There might be a danger of any hidden animal which is not familiar to the world and since nobody know how to handle such creatures, it becomes difficult to handle them. There could also be a possibility of a natural disaster like snow storm in places like Himalayan ranges that could take someones life as it is difficult to escape through it. There are some places whose routes are not well defined and it becomes difficult to track them. This is turn can lead to an unexpected location and might become difficult to return.",
        "To Conclude, everyone should be well prepared and take good training before staring their journey to such places. Also, a good study is expected in order to understand the place of visit. And it's important to always carry a map while travelling to places where people rarely travel.This is to ensure a safe and wonderful trip with full of good memories and learnings."
