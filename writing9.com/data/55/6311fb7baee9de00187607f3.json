        "Nowadays, In many countries, expert positions have higher salaries compared to those of inexperienced workers of the same company. Some people think this is not fair, I do not agree this idea because experienced people should earn more than other people.",
        "F\u0130rstly, experienced people should earn much more than inexperienced people. Some people comply with that but it is fair because experienced people always manage and their duty is extremely difficult. inexperienced people's duty is easier than experienced people's, Such as average officer duty and CEO duty. being a CEO is a very difficult job but being an officer is not difficult as being a CEO, Therefore experienced people must earn a high salary.",
        "Secondly, experienced people work harder than young people. Young people do not good at taking risks, \u0130f they don't take risks they would not reach their aim. Experienced people have got apparent characteristic features such as leadership and management. due to this feature, experienced people earn a high salary but young people have not got this feature.",
        "Young people can not manage their company because they have not got this ability.",
        "To conclude. there are many reasons why experienced people earn high salary. I totally agree on every reason because they deserve it. Young people do not earn the same amount of money because they lack experience. Professor suggested that young people should work hard to be experienced. \u0130f they work hard they would earn a high salary. Experienced people have got a lots of skill at different sections but young people are very limited."
