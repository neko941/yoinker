        "Some parents believe that their children should focus on reading serious educational books instead of other entertaining books. I completely disagree with this view because it will result in children losing interets in reading.",
        "Children will probably lose interest in reading books if parents require them to only read those books which are of educaitonal value. That is because most of that kind of books are boring. They are full of sophisiticated figures and complex concepts. Children may spend most of their time figuring out the complex equations and reciting essays. Gradually they will feel stressed if their brains keep learnig various difficult concepts and struggling with remembering them. In the end this may result in their giving up reading and leaning new things.",
        "In my opinion, I do not think reading entertaning books is wasting time. By contrast, reading interesting books can encourage them read more books. Children can find pleasure from reading those books which can help them relax. For example,  picture books can inspire their imagnation; some fun science books can improve their creativity. Those books can open a door to another world for them and encourage them to enojoy their lives. Moreover, if they are interested in some topics, they may read more related books to expand their knowledge and gain more experience. This is also a learning process and not a waste of time.",
        "In conclusion, I believe that reading a wide range of books can help children contact a more colorful world and grow up to be a well developed person."
