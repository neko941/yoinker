        "It is often argued that newspaper provides the most crucial method for people to get news for the reason that it is most effective as against others. I completely disagree this notion since modern medias such as internet helps people grasp news immediately and more conveniently.",
        "The process of reporting news on newspapers is time-consuming than releasing news online. It at least needs quiet a few hours to print the words on papers, yet news reports can be posted online as soon as they are completed. As an example, the news online are always browsed five hours early than that which is about the same event on newspaper in China. Thus, newspaper is not the most crucial media for general populations in that its speed of spreading news.",
        "In addition, reading newspaper is not convenient. People have to pick up them in the particular spots, and need to carry them all the time if there is no bin. On the contrary, the phone and internet which are more portable are the entire requirements for reading news online. For instance, compared with newspaper, news which is spread online saves individuals the unnecessary routines such as walking to the newspaper pick up locations. It is considered to be extremely tiring to read newspaper after modern medias have developed.",
        "To sum up, newspaper is not a essential way to get information because it consumes long time to be available and leads to troubles. As far as I am concerned, the traditional medias such as newspaper will be replaced by modern medias in the near future."
