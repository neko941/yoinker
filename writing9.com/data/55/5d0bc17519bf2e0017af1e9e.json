        "Nowadays, people prefer to have a small family rather than a bigger one. The reason for this trending decision is not far fetched. A small family guarantees minimal financial responsibilities including a better parental attention in the upbringing of children. Although there are many merits of this situation, it is not void of demerits.",
        "One huge benefit of having a smaller family is the lesser financial responsibilities it promises. This is because there are fewer mouths to feed, clothe, shelther and sponsor through school. For example, it is generally believed that a family with fewer kids is the one that can afford additional excesses apart from the basic needs of life. Again, having a smaller family would result to a better parental attention. Here, parents devout their time extensively in training their kids. By deliberately attending to each child, parents are afforded the knowledge of their children&apos;s potentials.",
        "On the other hand, having a smaller family is dreaded by some people because of the loneliness it introduces. Due to the size, boredom becomes the norm. Children in such homes do not get to share their play time with a lot of other children. Moreso, socialization of children in such a family is affected. The reason for this is that the child naturally learns how to adapt and live by himself, but fails to learn how to co-exist with other people.",
        "In conclusion, although there are many benefits of having a smaller family, such as lesser financial responsibilities, better parental attention, amongst others, it is not without some demerits."
