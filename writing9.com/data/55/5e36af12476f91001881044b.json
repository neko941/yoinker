With no outdoor sports or socializing with friends, they are becoming lazy day by day. Similarly, our youngsters have their own eating preferences. According to the health survey, it was reported that 90 % of the sampled population of teenagers preferred to eat fast food items in their meals. However, food experts suggest that excessive usage of in-organic food items and no physical activity slowdowns the metabolism system which results in gaining weight. Due to this reason, youth is getting fat and lazy now a days.",
