        "Generally, today's parents increasingly see to the liberation of their kids in terms of expressing  their likes and dislikes. This, in my opinion, is a highly constructive development as it  has resulted into numerous positive impact  such as their ability to  make crucial decisions among  others.",
        "To begin with, freedom brings about beneficial growth in the lives of youths. One of  the benefits is their  capability in making life choices at very tender ages. Moreover, children nowadays are very knowledgeable and coupled with a limitation to confinement make them altogether exposed to hypothetical situations, thereby enabling them to take favourable future decisions. In contrast to the past, family elders and parents are usually saddled with the responsibilities of making choices for the younger ones   whereby they had no option  but to accept decisions made  without recourse. For example, my mom once told me that her father decided for her to be a teacher whereas, she wanted to be a nurse.",
        "Additionally, children who have free hand are able to socialize and mingle well amongst  their peers as well as people outside of their  peers without being timid. Similarly, liberating the youths from unnecessary restriction  helps  them  interact freely and wholeheartedly  without holding themselves back thus enabling  children to speak up for themselves in all situations therefore, helping in  reducing child  oppression and abuse. To illustrate  further, a secondaary school student, who lives in  my neighbourhood , was bold enough to file a case against her school teacher  who sexually  assaulted her.",
        "To sum up, youth freedom today, unlike in the past has helped  groom positive  developmental features in children particularly, features such as the initiative  to make right choices along with the ability to socialize and mingle accordingly are a few of the various positivity that can emanate."
