        "It is often argued that machines have taken the place human beings, which is also true to some extent. However, I strongly believe that there are more disadvantages in comparison to the number of advantages. My inclination is justified in following paragraphs.",
        "Some of the advantages of replacing machines with humans, it makes the work easier and less time consuming. Which helps in increasing the efficiency of the work. There reason behind this is machines are programmed in such a manner that they have a tendency to work faster than most humans. They are more accurate and more reliable in comparison. For instance, machines do the work quicker than labourers in any industry, even they have surpassed humans in calculating as most of us use calculators to ease the load. Therefore, machines are made to lower the burden on our shoulders.",
        "There are several disadvantages as well, which in my opinion over shadow the advantages. Machines make people lazy, which leads to several health problems as we lose our desire to work. It creates unemployment in several sectors and many poor starve because of it, which is definitely a more important concern. For example, Tesla launching driver less cars in India will affect the lifes of many lower class people living in India as the sector contributes a high rate of employbility in the country. Therefore, the using such machineries may lead to hazardous issues and affect the economic development of a nation.",
        "To recapitulate, I reckon these issues have more significance in comparison to the merits of developing such machines and the government needs to take initiates to limit the usage machines and encourage hand work."
