        "With the fast development in recent years, children are having many different personalities. Some research indicates that these personalities and developments are influenced by the characteristics they are born with much more than their experiences. Personally, I consider experiences they have in their lives to be the major influence.",
        "First and foremost, one\u2019s personalities can practice and become habits from their everyday life. Apart from some research I have seen before, they said that it has just 21 days to create new habits in people especially in the youth. For example, when someone meets a girl who likes reading books every night before going to sleep and they find that she inspires them, they try to imitate her and read books every night for 21 days, they will have a habit of reading some books before sleeping.",
        "Secondly, experiences and environments affect their thoughts and their habits. When people live in a certain environment, they will always try to blend into it so as not to get out of the community. We can easily see that many spend most of their time working and studying so that their best friends and their close colleagues may have the same personalities as them. For instance, someone who is not very hard-working but they study and contact many hard-working and intelligent people, after a while, they will be more diligent. In contrast, some people believe that one\u2019s personality and developments can not be changed by experiences in daily life. However, I find that almost all people's personalities can be changed, have new habits for a long term that are not easily seen or they are affected by their families.",
        "In conclusion, we can not negate that the characteristics they were born with influenced their personalities and developments, but the important affection is their experiences and their environment they are formed in their everyday life."
