        "Advanced technologies has significantly changed the way how people interact with each other nowadays. Many people opt to send messages on the phone to communicate rather than making phone calls. Although communicating by messages may not get instant reply, it can quickly and effectively convey the information. In my opinion, the positive points of this trend surpass the negative aspects.",
        "There are various compelling reasons why people prefer sending text messages and the prominent one is that they are cheaper compare to voice calls. Along with this, it is a fast and easy method of communication which enables us to communicate with others in a small amount of time. For these reasons, instant text messaging is gaining popularity nowadays.",
        "The crucial beneficial factor of this trend is that sending messages can avoid inconvenience as people could be disturbed by others if they were calling at the wrong time. Additionally, it gives the recipient to take their own time to decide whether they want to reply or not. To illustrate, a recent survey conducted in japan has revealed that nearly 80% of people perceive that sending messages is the better way as it is unsuitable to make phone calls I some certain circumstances including attending meetings or watching movies in cinemas. However, the practice of texting has certainly some drawbacks. For example, you may not get an instant reply even though it\u2019s urgent.",
        "To sum up, sending messages on the phone as a way to communicate has become incredibly common nowadays. I\u2019m inclined to say that the overall benefits of texting are superior."
