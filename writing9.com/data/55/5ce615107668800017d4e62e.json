        "Sports celebrities have higher income than those of other significant careers. Many individuals believe that this is logical while other people and I think that this is inequitable and I will justify that in this essay.",
        "Nowadays, many sports have become a profitable business rather than being an entertainment. Basically, these sports have a wide base of followers and fans which has constituted a great chance to be seized by marketing departments in many companies. They used to promote their products using the athletics as advertisers or even via putting their trademark on the latter\u2019s sport garments. For instance, companies like Nike and Adidas spend anually millions of dollars sponsoring many sports clubs just to promote their products and garments under the name of these clubs. These expended monies are thought by some to be the cause of high salaries of sports celebrities.",
        "On the other hand, there are many other careers like teaching, engineering and medicine that are of higher value and influence in the society. The owners of these professions should have the priority in terms of salaries and rewards in order to be satisfied and motivated to exert more effort. This is mainly because these jobs are life-saving in many cases, so as much as those professionals got awarded, as best results we gain from them. This is already applied in many developed countries like United States and Canada where doctors and lawyers are well paid, as a result the medical system in these countries is one of the best in all the world.",
        "In conclusion, some people believe that the justification the high income of many famous players is due to the revenue of sponsorship of many marketing companies to their clubs which makes it normal to have such salaries. However, I argue that this is not a suffecient excuse for these high incomes and there are many other professionals, such as doctors, tutors and engineers, in the society that deserve equal wages or even higher ,because of their pivotal role and influence in the society."
