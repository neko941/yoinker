        "In modern times, the issue of the starting age of schooling has become highly controversial. There are those who say that children should start formal education at an early age (4 years), while others believe that the age of seven is is the best for those enrolled in schools to commence their educational studies. In this essay, I will examine both sides of the argument and provide my overall opinion.",
        "Generally speaking, there is a wide range of reasons why people believe that seven years of age is best to begin the education. Perhaps the main reason why people are in favor of this idea is that children need time to build their bones in the early years of their life. The result of this is that they will not suffer from obesity in the later years of their life, which in turn could lead to a healthy mind and fit body. Secondly, the socializing process can only be learned from the parents and not in schools. If children are able to interact with other people, then they can easily boost their confidence level which is an invaluable skill to become successful in the later stages of life.",
        "Despite these arguments, there is also a case for the idea that the educative process needs to begin early in a child's life. The main reason why people think this is a good idea that those going to schools can learn basic skills of life such as appropriate language and simple concepts like addition, multiplication and subtraction. It will not only stimulate ideas but also imaginations and conversations.",
        "In conclusion, the right age of starting schooling is a topic which raises strong passions on both sides of the argument. Having considered both sides of the issue, I would argue that the right age to begin formal education should be 7 years."
