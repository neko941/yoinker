        "Nowadays, children are occupied with lots of things such as schoolwork and gadget. Many believe that due to their busy schedules, most children spend most of their time indoors and therefore lack of natural world exposures. In this essay, I will discuss why minimal exposure of natural world makes children lack knowledge of natural environment and why they will not be aware to save the nature.",
        "To begin with, not all knowledge about natural world can be learned indoors. Even though school teaches children the aspects of natural environment, it is important for them to see it in-person. Types of plants, for instance, is an important thing for children to understand in order to know which plants are edible and which are dangerous for consumption. If children fail to differentiate them, they may consume poisonous plants that are dangerous for them. Natural sites including glazer, forest, and volcanoes are another important thing for children to see. Society is trying to rehabilitate many destroyed forests, but if most children have never seen the forest, how will they save something they have never seen themselves?",
        "Lack of natural world exposure makes children not aware to save the nature. Since children have minimal information of natural world in the first place, they will not have a sense of belonging and also the importance of saving the nature. Theoretical information is useless without practical skill. For instance, children learned how trees can save the earth from global warming, but without the skill of planting trees, this information is going to be useless. The efforts of saving the earth will only be plans without concrete actions.",
        "In conclusion, most children are now busy with indoor activities. This has leads them to have low exposure of natural world. As a result, they will lack information of natural world and they will not be aware to save the nature when they grow up."
