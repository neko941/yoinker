        "Plastic bags have become one the major contributor to pollution of land and sea. Some people believe it should be banned and I totally agree with this opinion as it is indeed necessary to save world.",
        "There are numerous problems associated with plastic bags. Firstly, it takes up to 100 years for some plastic bags to decompose and some are not even decomposed after 100 years. Consequently, all plastic bags end up in water and land as a garbage and waste. Recent study by Sweden university students shows that a time in near future will come when we have not enough space on land to dump our waste. Thus, it is our responsibility to avoid plastic bags and go for alternative sources such as paper bag to avoid this situation. Government needs to step forward and put a ban on plastic shopping bags.",
        "Plastic bags not also pollute land but also water as well and because of these bags there are many species endangered in water. Recently, I watched one documentary which shows in Atlantic Ocean many turtles got killed because plastic bag stuck into their throat. Many developed countries such as Sweden, Norway already take steps and ban plastic bags completely from all over country. Other countries should follow these countries good step towards better future which not only benefit our children but also animals which are threatened2 because of plastic bags.",
        "To conclude, I am strongly in favour of banning plastic shopping bags because of dangers it poses on environment and our future."
