        "In This Era of freedom and democracy everyone has their right to information in every field. Nonetheless, some people have claimed that knowledge in the field of academics, science and business should have a direct access to the people. While, others opine that information should kept in privacy and direct approach to this should be scrutinized. Personally, I believe that info in science academic arena and business should make open to them. Further, in this essay we will discuss some reasons.",
        "Firstly, it is true that some information which is valuable should not be directly accessible to the public which can later creates crisis in the society, state and can affect the public. Furthermore, As in this world of technology and internet the data or any information spreads like an wildfire which can give an subject of chance to terrorist and other such to do their misleads. For instance, Information for nuclear should not be shared with all countries. Therefore, if the information for nuclear have access to everyone it will bring the world soon to the verge of obliteration.",
        "Secondly, It is of paramount importance that distribution of information in scientific research depends wholly on previous discoveries and results and if not share openly to academics and researchers can make the progress of world standstill. However, Sharing of data in business fields can make the new opportunities for individuals. To illustrate, As the internet has an wide access all over the world and if the US not share this technology to all, many countries now can be in the period of pre-internet. Therefore, Sharing of such material would can be an excellent part and should be shared more with other minds.",
        "Lastly, The information which is kept in the shed of privacy has no value to it. In addition, It is clear that in the history every discoveries and invention was not successful without the information which provides an potential progress to the work. Moreover, openly shared knowledge provides a devastating progress in every research and fields.",
        "To conclude, Knowledge has an limited value if not shared with great minds. But the valuable material should not be disclosed openly to the public. In my view, both this position are merit."
