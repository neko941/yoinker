        "As you can imagine, living in a foreign country with a new language comes with its own set of difficulties due to the language barrier. I agree with most of these comments.",
        "First of all, language barriers hinder communication. When we move to a new place, the first thing we want to do is to make friends with someone. However, if we do not understand the language, we will not be able to join the party and will feel alienated and helpless. Also, if we go shopping and try to buy something, we cannot explain well because we do not understand the language, and the shopkeeper cannot bring the right product. It will be frustrating and extremely irritating to not be able to do things that you could do in your native language without difficulty.",
        "Then there is the problem of employment. Even if they are lucky enough to start working, they will not be able to use their abilities to the fullest and will receive lower evaluations than they actually deserve. In addition, the expressions used at work are unique and can easily lead to misunderstandings and failures. Of course, using a translator or other tools will make it easier to understand, but the unique vocabulary often does not translate well and is not useful.",
        "For these reasons, I believe that living in a foreign language is difficult because of the communication and recognition problems that arise. However, by actively researching what you don't understand and using the language without fear of making mistakes, you will be able to adjust to the new society and language."
