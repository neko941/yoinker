        "In the modern times, there are some countries which its number of young people is larger than the older. From my point of view, I do not believe that this brings more benefits for the society than its drawbacks.",
        "On the one hand, it is obvious that there are some advantages every nation obtains from young population. Firstly, the youth is the main workforce contributing to the economic growth of a country. Because they are at young age, they are much stronger than old people so that it is easy for them to be engaged with manual jobs which require strength and flexibility such as mechanic, nail technician, worker and so on. For example, China is regarded as the world\u2019s factory because of its rich young labor, which results in China\u2019s significant increase in economic growth over last decade. Secondly, young adults have ability to adopt updated knowledge and adapt what they have learn more easily and faster than the old, which a key factor for the development for advanced technology industry.",
        "On the other hand, a country lacking old people may bring some disadvantages. The old has more life and work experiences than young adults so that they can be confident enough to tackle difficulties in daily time or working environment. For instance, doctor is an occupation that old people seems to be more precious than the young because they have encyclopedic medical knowledge and experiences in diagnosing and treating diseases.",
        "In conclusion, I think that although some countries benefit from the large number of young people, the older are also indispensable for the whole community."
