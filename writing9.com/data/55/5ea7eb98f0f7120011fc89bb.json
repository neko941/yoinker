        "On Saturday 27th April, all my office fellows decided to celebrate project success.",
        "So, we decided to dine at your restaurant. I had already reserved a table for four in advance, so that we do not have to wait in queue. Despite, the booking, we still had to wait. Although, we got our table, but still we could not settle down since it was not cleaned. The services were not very organized. However, we ordered food which again got delayed, due less staff. Also, we were expecting a an amazing live band performance, since it was a Satudary. But, later we got to that due some internal issues all events have been cancelled.",
