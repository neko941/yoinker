        "Technology has been florishing by leaps and bounds and providing us new avenues while keeping ourselves updated with latest news and current affairs. Therefore, a fair amount of people believe, a conventional way of newspaper reading will be disappeared. I do not completely accord on it because conventional newspapers are easiest and cheapest way to get news.",
        "To embark on, there are multiple reasons why the traditional ways of getting news are still popular. First of all, reading newspaper has become ardent habit of many people. Everyone whether from affluent or middle class is seen desperately waiting for newspaper in morning and enjoy it reading with cup of tea. Moreover, newspapers are the portable, cheap and easiest way of knowing about the global activities. They can be carried from one place to other in a bag and available at economical price. They are handy and merely by continuing flip of pages can make you omniscient. Secondly, electricity and other appliances are not required. Moreover, the other attachments are like icing on the cake. For instance, the Hindustan times has multiple attachments like women\u2019s fashion, career guide, culinary art and so on.",
        "However, undoubtedly, technology has given the radical approach to reading news, for example, videos provide full and clear view to reading besides that we can download, share and forward it to our relatives and friends. Needless to say that technophobic will be having no place in this ever-advanced modern world.",
        "To conclude, the lives of people are drastically affected by advanc versions of technology yet, in my opinion, it will not be able to pose threat to the existence traditional newspaper and magazines."
