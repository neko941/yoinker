        "\u0130t is considered by some people that It is important for children to learn the difference between right and wrong at an early age. Punishment is necessary to help them learn the distinction. I completely agree with the opinion .  \u0130n my opinion , parents  and teachers  should execute punishments for their children in a detailed way , and thus punishments can be provided to children for learn the distinction.",
        "Firstly , a good education is provided  in the  schools by teachers , and thus many parents wanna send to school their children . \u0130n my opinion , the good education should be provided in family .  Also , good education is good punishment at same time .  Children can learn the distinction if  parents or teacher will give to children  a punishment properly . For instance , a child will has to a bad career in future if his who make a false  can be punished   badly by his teachers or his parents .",
        "Secondly ,   unfortunately , many parents and  teachers can't  execute punishes in an equal way , and thus  some problems reveal such as inequality or be stressed among children.   Many children can be rescued from these problems thanks to seminars if governments will set up seminars about the development of children for teachers and parents. For instance , a teacher that give a false  punishment can learn  how will give  to children punishments.",
        "To conclude  , many parents and  teachers can't  execute punishes in an equal way , and thus many children can't learn the distinction . Therefore much trouble reveal in schools  . \u0130n my opinion , many teachers and parent can learn  to give a punishment properly if governments will set up seminars about the development of children ."
