        "It is evident that fresh water reserves are becoming scarce globally. 2.5% of the globes water is fresh water. Although there are many reasons for the marked decrease of reserves, they are not without solutions. This can be done by both governments and individuals. For the remainder of this essay I will outline the two main reasons behind this problem: the increase in the global population & the decrease in the supply of fresh water. Furthermore, I will also discuss solutions /such as/ namely, the passing of new government legislations to control water expenditure and the education of individuals on water conservation.",
        "There are many reasons for the rise in demand in fresh water. Firstly, with the increase in population, comes an increase in water consumption. For example, in 2005 during the world\u2019s highest population peak, the amount of fresh water decreased by 0.3%.",
        "Another reason for the marked decrease of fresh water resources is none other than global warming. Time and time again we hear about global warming and its dangers all over the media. It has a direct correlation to this very cause. As temperatures decrease, more water is frozen and turned into glaciers, therefore it becomes unattainable for our use. For instance, in 2005, the state of Alaska reported the spike in the formation of the number of glaciers by 20%.",
        "Despite the many issues, there are many measures that can be taken by both the authorities and individuals to tackle them. Governmental laws can be implemented, such as: limiting water consumption through minimizing the number of times someone can wash their car. This was proven successful in the UK. Until today, people are limited to washing their vehicles once a week, which has resulted in a 50% decrease in weekly water usage throughout the kingdom. In addition, individuals may participate in water awareness campaigns, organized by neighborhoods to educate the population on efficient ways to preserve water. Personally, in my local community I was taught to count the seconds I use my tap for and ensure it doesn\u2019t surpass 30, which has helped and benefited me in water conservation.",
        "In conclusion, the acknowledgment of the causes just discussed and by the application of these solutions, we may help alleviate the issue of decreased fresh water reserves worldwide."
