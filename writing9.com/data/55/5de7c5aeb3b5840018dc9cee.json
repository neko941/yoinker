        "No doubt, there are many problematic environments surrounding us which is really need to be resolved immediately.A substantial number of people consider that, the drying out of many plants and animals is the momentous issue while others believe environmental problem is more significant.But people have strong feelings on their arguments.However, my opinion, both issues are serious these problems need to overcome urgently.Both view point will be discussed before doing a reasonable conclusion.",
        "On the one hand,it is not deniable that, a large number of plants and animals are decreasing dramatically.As a result,not only wild animals losing their homes but also losing the balance of the environment.For example,two kilometres away from my home, there were a large forest.As the population growth,the trees were cut down and houses were built in that area.Moreover,people are cutting down trees discriminately as a result we are missing out various kinds of fruits.Furthermore women earned money by selling those fruits but now they are deprived.",
        "On the other hand, there are many issues that people are concerned about it such as polluted environment and alteration of climate.Moreover ,there are huge Industries around the city. they are discharged their chemicals into rivers.As a result the balance of the environment is hampered daily.It is undisputed that not only vehicles are responsible for pollution but also industries.For instance,a couple of decades ago ,there were no huge vehicles surrounding the city but now the situation has changed there are too many vehicles.In addition the  greenhouse is again in question.In this situation the fatal disease are affected people such as cancer.",
        "To conclude,in my point of view,despite the main environmental problem but plants and animals aid to sustain the balance of the environment.However,the government should awarded about this issue."
