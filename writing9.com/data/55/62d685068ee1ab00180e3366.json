        "These days, the risk is one of the most crucial factors in parts of people's lives. If people take any vital risk with a careful decision, it will make their lives better. In my opinion, the benefits of taking risks outweigh its disadvantages and reasons with relevant examples will give in this essay.",
        "The first reason that the risks should be taken is life success. It is a symbol of a stable life. Most people need to be successful because it could bring money which is an important factor leading to a comfortable life. For example, when people are businessmen, they have a lot of risky chances to invest their money. If it works, it means their investments aren't worthless. Hence, they can gain a lot of profit and use this experience the next time.",
        "Normally, people want to have a stably professional life first as mentioned above and they then think about the next step which is having a family. Family can bring happiness called perfect life. After succeeding in business, people need to commit to someone having children together, but it has a risk to choose a partner. Anyway, they think it is worth taking this risk because they can have a happy life forever.",
        "In conclusion, taking risks is the best choice for me because it could let to a successful life and a happy family."
