The security at the gate of the college refused to get me in, however I showed them my lectures\u2019 timetable and my friends told them that I am a student in the language department. However, they did not change the rules. As a result, unfortunately, I could not hand my assignment for phonetics class. For sure I lose marks in this subject. In addition to that, on Thursday night I could not register on the linguistics class, which negatively effect on my studying. I have to wait for the next month to apply.",
