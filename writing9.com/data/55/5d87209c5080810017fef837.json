        "It is often argued that it has become quite difficult for students to get admission in a tertiary level institutes irrespective for their financial status. In my opinion, I completely agree that getting into a college has become tougher for all students as admission now depend more on academic status and rising competition due to limited seats.",
        "University admission is considered as important step for a successful career. As such, Majorities of colleges has formed a definite criteria for giving admission to  student and good academic track record has become important necessity. For example, in India getting into universities require a student to achieve a definitive percentage of marks in particular subjects in secondary school examination. The student who achieve this percentage get admission irrespective of their financial status",
        "Along with academics, the second most important factor for this change in admission strategy is an increasing competition among student due to limited number of seats in each university.  Each university has a definite number of seats in each course and has to conduct entrance exam for giving admission to students. Those students who cleared these exams get admission without considering their financial status.  For example, for admission into 10000 seats of IIT about 1000000 students gives entrance exam and those who cleared whether belonging to rich or poor family get admission.",
        "In conclusion, I agree with the view that both strong affluent and poor face equal amount of difficulty in accessing colleges as more universities now focus on academic performance of student and have restricted intake due to limited number of seats."
