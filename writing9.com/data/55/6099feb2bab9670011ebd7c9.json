        "With the arrival of modern transportation vehicles and technology, people have more options to choose the locations of their workplaces or even work at home. This certainly benefits employees because of more opportunities in workforce markets,  flexible work schedules and a better living environment to live in. However, there are some drawbacks such as high competition among their peers, less family time and poor relationship in workplaces.",
        "Modern transportation vehicles help commuters to travel fast daily and expand their capacity to reach larger areas daily. As a result, people are able to reach the workplaces far away from their living places and definitely help them to accept more job offers daily. In the past, especially in the ancient time before the invention of steam engines, ancient workers only travelled a limited distance daily by foot. Therefore, they used to be limited in certain areas with a limited amount of jobs available to them. However, nowadays, people are having more hectic lifestyles and high competition insofar as many people are able to apply for one job.",
        "In addition, nowadays, people are able to work or study online because of computers and the Internet. Many office workers are able to move their offices back to their home and are taking advantages to working at home, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. They not only can save commuting time but also enjoy more family time with their families. Moreover, many CEOs or entrepreneurs also hold a conference with their staff or business partners nationally or internationally via social media such as Skype business or Zoom without leaving their houses or their nations. Under the assistance of  modern devices, the world has evolved into a global village. However, sometimes, working at home may have drawbacks. People may spend more time on their tasks without paying any attention because they are able to have access to their work 24/7. Eventually, it is tough for them to separate their personal life apart from their jobs.",
        "Last but not the least, under the assistance of modern transportation equipment and technology, many citizens prefer to settle down in suburban areas where more facilities and better living environment in the residential areas are built for them to raise their families. For instance, in many metropolitan areas, high-speed trains or light trains can deliver many commuters to inner cities in the morning and then give a ride for them to travel back to their houses in suburban areas in the afternoon. Living in suburban areas has many benefits for people of all ages in terms of facilities, fresh air and less pollution as compared to the living environment in inner cities worldwide. Although people are able to live far away from their workplaces because of modern transportation equipment, commuters may face some level of traffic accidents due to the fact that they are on the road daily and the chance for them to run into motor vehicle accidence may be higher than those who live in inner cities.",
        "In conclusion, modern transportation equipment and technology benefit contemporary residents worldwide because they enhance humans' capacity to travel more areas daily, are able to access more job opportunities and provide a better living environment to their families. However, people may encounter high competition in workforce markets, lose their family time and have a high risk to experience  motor vehicle accidences as commuting."
