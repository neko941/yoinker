        "Quite a number of students engage in part-time jobs while schooling in the higher institution. Their engagement in such jobs is indeed a good idea as it gives many opportunities to o make money and gain experience while studying.",
        "Firstly, students taking up part-time work while in school gives room to make money. In other words, this opportunity avails the students means of making extra money for their needs. For instance, not all university students can afford their tutions, so it would be an opportunity to pay up. A research in Oxford university, UK, shows that 40% of the students need the pay from those jobs. Some of the payment are used in buying items such as books, clothings as well as settling accommodation cost. These reasons shows that students engaging in part-time job is a positive idea.",
        "Furthermore, students taking up part-time jobs while schooling gives room to gain work experience. The period of would be a training grounds for building capacity on the job. Many of jobs teaches accountability, teamwork, computer skills, project management and so on. These skills are quite necessary for their success upon graduation and starting work fully. For example, the job market needs people with well of experience and skills necessary for a 21st century job. Moreso, some of these experience could help students to become employers of labour in the nearest future. These makes a part-time job a good idea for students.",
        "In conclusion, this essay argued that higher institution students taking up a part-time jobs while schooling is a laudable idea which help them to meet their immediate needs and also gaim pre-requisite experience necessary for their first job."
