        "Some people believe that children should not be given homework every day, while others believe that they must get homework every day to be successful at school. Discuss both views and give an opinion.",
        "Education plays a vital role for every people. Some people opine that homework should not be given by a teacher at home. However, another teacher at home. However, other people believe that it is necessary to achieve the higher score in school. This essay intends to discuss both views and give an opinion.",
        "It is thought by some people that, children should not do school work at home. The first and foremost reason is a child can specify their some time for sports activities. Sports is very essential to learning important life skills. A child can learn numerous skills by playing games with their friends like social skills, and so on. Another concrete reason is, that some unfavorable impact occurs on children if they study for the whole day. Multiple students are not able to focus and concentrate for long hours. They feel tired and bored.  Consequently, many admission can not give attention to the next day of school. And there are chances to lose their score in exams.",
        "On the other hand, homework can be profitable to get success in not only school but the whole carrier life, admission can perfectly memorize all things to do repetitive work. It helps to achieve the higher score in school as well as other competitive exams. According to the researcher, repetitive work can enhance long-term memory. Thus continuities of work can create a better result. Last but not least, student can use their leisure time to do appointment instead of wasting time on other things. Their study needs to use their precious time for better",
        "manner. Otherwise, they got busy doing some purposeless activities like playing games on mobiles phones, or computers.",
        "To conclude, I believe that appointment is helpful for admission in numerous ways if they are limited otherwise, students can not study happily. Also, it can be unprofitable for their results."
