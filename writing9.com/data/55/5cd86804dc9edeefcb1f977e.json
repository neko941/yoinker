        "The internet has changed the way we share and consume knowledge, but it has also led to numerous other issues that were previously non-existent. The main problem this causes is that people prefer to interact with each other on the internet rather than face-to-face and the most viable solution is an awareness program to educate people about the dangers of isolation.",
        "The principle issue with the usage of the internet is that people are mostly interacting with each other using various online services and are drifting away from physical interactions. Nowadays, e-commerce portals provide many home services, such as laundry or grocery delivery, and people prefer to use them rather than leaving their houses. As a result, their interactions with others are reduced and they feel isolated in their environments. For example, a survey conducted by the American Food Association found that 50% of people preferred to order their groceries online rather than visit the local supermarket.",
        "To tackle the problem, the government should launch an awareness campaign in the media and schools warning them about the dangers of isolation. If people realize that lack of physical contact can lead to mental issues, like depression, they might try change their habits and put in more efforts to interact with others. For instance, a similar initiative in Japan resulted in 40% decrease in people feeling depressed because of isolation.",
        "In conclusion, using the internet lead to reduced interactions between people that can result in isolation and depression, however it can be addressed by initiating an awareness campaign warning the people about its dangers."
