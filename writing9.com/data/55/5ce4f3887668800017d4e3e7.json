        "Nothing is permanent in this materialistic world. People used to live together and their families were affectionate enough to assimilate members of different personality and outlook. But, nowadays, people prefer nuclear families because of the desire of being independent and live without any restrictions. Advancement of technology and busy schedule are some other causes of this transition.",
        "Everyone, in today's world, need independence of thoughts and are generally egoistic. They only think of their own benefits and do not take family betterment into consideration and this eventually lead to disputes. Moreover, working people hardly get any time to exchange word with their families due to busy schedule. As a matter of fact, due to the increased use of smart devices, people can now talk or see each other at any time. As a result, they do not realise that they are physically away from their close ones.",
        "To bring family members together again, there is a need to inculcate brotherhood among kids right from their birth. A child always learns from what he sees, so it is a moral duty of elders and parents to live in integration. The first step in this direction is to discourage the increasing trend of child care centres and old age homes, for instance. Government should also initiate family integration campaigns so that people can be motivated from within against this unfortunate reality.",
        "In conclusion, busy life of a person sometime separate him from family but it is necessary to live with our blood relatives to create positive impact on our future generations. To bring harmony, some distinguished efforts are required from individual, society and government too."
