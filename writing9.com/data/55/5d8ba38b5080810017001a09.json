In many cases, the people being monitored are unaware that this is happening. Do you think the advantages of this development outweigh the disadvantages?",

        "Due to security reasons law enforcement agencies use technological devices to  monitor people by cameras and other tracking devices without letting them know. I believe, benefits of observing people are more than the disadvantages for the security reasons.",
        "To begin with, there are some negative aspects of observing people by tracking their calls or by  video cameras as it is against human rights and spoil their privacy.  People feel embarrass when they know that they are under observation and their personal life can be expose and they do not able to live or work freely. In addition, the collected data from this exercise can be misuse if go to wrong hands. For example, offenders can blackmail and threaten a person using his personal audio and video clips or use sensitive information which people share with their families like Bank account details to stole from individuals bank accounts. This is why, keep an eye on people actions is against personal privacy and make the life of people complicated..",
        "However, there are certain positive sides of watching people with help of audio and visual devices which have proven helpful to stop many terror activities. This make easier for police and other security agencies to watch crowded areas and stop illegal activities on time . For instance, if anyone is planning which is against law or harmful to the public, the police can hear their plans because of tracing their calls, this will able the forces to make strategies and stop the incident to happen. Thus, monitoring the people is conducive by security perspectives.",
        "In summation, although, monitoring people is an interfere in people privacy, but advantages are far more than disadvantages. I opine, government and security agencies should improve the monitoring practices and make it confidential."
