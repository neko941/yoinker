        "Researchers reported that aged individuals lived better life in the past as they were physically active and spent major time to be socialise, while some of them faces problems such isolation and unhealthy.In this essay I will examine the causes of this problems and discuss some possible remedies.",
        "The two major causes of these problems is insufficent knowledge of the modern technology and laziness of them. Nowadays majority of people use the social media to socialise with friends and families, while people who are over 60 does not know how to use this medias. Due to this reason they are unable to be with their families. Moreover, most of these persons leads sedentary life without nutritious dieat.As a consquence, they are suffer from serious health issues, such as obesity and heart disease. For example, research conducted by the Health Department of India reported that more than 60% of older people have cardiac diseasebecause of leading inactive life style and consuming fatty food.Thus, more use of the Internet and laziness of older people make them alone and ill.",
        "Some possible solution for these situations is raising awerness about use of technology and by subsidising the finess centres. By providing information about technoloy's negative effect on the older people to youth, we can make olders more happy.For instance, if grandchild know that his grandparents suffer from loneliness, most of them will certainly spent their leisure with grandparents. Also, subsidising gyms and other sport activity, government could help age group above 60.To examplify this, if people gain financial help from state government in fitness clubs, most of them join this clubs. So, providing subsidies by state and raising awarness in young people might be useful for olders.",
        "To conclude, Three decades ago people were used to more joyful life and socialise,but because of the invention and inactive lifestyle, many of them are alone or suffer from critical diseases.However, this problem could be solve with funding in fitness centres and informing young about this."
