        "Although a big amount of food are transported from far abroad, many people claim that consuming local profucts would benefit economy and environment. Current idea has own pros and cons. This essay will examine both before reaching a concrete decision.",
        "From the one hand, importing food fork different countries give us opportunity to taste some tropical fruits and vegetables all year long. For instance, there is an evidence that Canadians don't grow some sort of fruits like mango due to different soil and weather conditions. In this case, agricultural countries like Mexico supplies Canadians by their goods from food industry.  To sum up, two countries created win-win strategy, because one of them had demand another one can satisfy it.",
        "On the other hand, agricultural industry is not well developed in many countries. Moreover, local farmers don't produce enough and that's why very often crashed by import. Despite the fact that national products are even cheaper, people prefer to buy from other countries. According to recent research of Ontario's Statistics only 30% of Canadians give preference to the local groceries, when another 70% are sticked with abroad one. This slightly negative effect on agricultural industry and country economy in general. As a result, majority of us choose low nutrition food which benefit financially other countries.",
        "To put in a nutshell, golden middle should be defined between national amd abroad agricultural products. However, mostly people should give a choice to the groceries from their own countries. In this case, the economy balance and society health will be on a high level."
