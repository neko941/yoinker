        "Nowadays, money is a prime driving force in human's life and it is very difficult to earn money these days because competition is increasing day by day. There is a need to have several careers or ways of earning money rather than having a single career. Single career is becoming an old fashioned one and related to this, further education will be something that continuous throughout life.",
        "To embark, I believe that for living a luxuries life, a person must have several careers or ways of earning money because expenditures are on the top in everyday's life, for example, a person who lives in a big family will not fulfil the needs of every member of the family if he have single career or he must have some business to run with his job simultaneously to fulfil the needs and desires of his family, furthermore, if  we take an example of a farmer, all family member are engaged in one business and a part of their earning distributes among all family members so they do not live a luxuries life by having a single business. People are encouraged for education these days and further education will be continuous throughout life. Some people think they get an employment if they have several degrees so they do not stop study and continuous it with their jobs to get high income jobs.",
        "However, some people think one should focus on single career to earn money and do not divert their mind and they think one should make one particular aim by which they earn more money but I disagree with them because it is not a time of single career and they get only limited money by this.",
        "To sum up, a person should go for a several ways of earning money because consumerism is reached at its highest peak and money is the only thing which fulfil everyone's desire."
