        "The rapid spread of the internet has changed our world. Most people and companies today cannot imagine their day without the internet. Despite its numerous benefits, the internet has brought a number of serious concerns that must be addressed.",
        "The internet has simplified many aspects of our personal and work lives. It enables people in different countries to effortlessly communicate with their friends and relatives. Virtually everyone has an email address and WhatsApp account today. We can find answers to most of our questions by simply typing them into Google. Companies easily sell their goods and services abroad via online shops without opening new brick-and-mortar stores and offices. In short, the internet has become an indispensable part of our lives.",
        "On the other hand, the internet has given rise to new forms of crime and manipulation. Any computer connected to the internet can be remotely hacked. An example of this is the recent data breach at Yahoo, which affected its customers all over the world. Young people using the internet may experience another sort of threat, online bullying, which is becoming increasingly widespread and dangerous. Finally, the opinions and important decisions of millions of people may be manipulated through fake news. All these illegal and unethical activities present a clear threat to our society but will not prevent people from using the internet.",
        "In conclusion, the internet has brought many positive developments into our lives that by far outweigh the drawbacks. Although security threats and online bullying are alarming, we cannot deny how much the internet helps us to communicate and do business with people all over the world. We should encourage further development of the internet, as well as the introduction of new controls and security measures that will minimise the threats."
