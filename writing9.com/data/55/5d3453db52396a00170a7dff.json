        "In today\u2019s growing world, money has become very essential to all living beings. While some agree that surplus money brings joy, remaining believe that there are other factors to create joy. This essay will explain how having more money can help people live a life of choices and also discuss other ways such as pursuing one\u2019s passion and serving people can also aid in happiness.",
        "First of all, having money in abundance helps people to choose how to live life on their terms. With no worries of working just to pay the bills and survive through life, they can take up any work they are interested in that keeps them happy and motivated. Moreover, it helps them to live in their dream homes, drive their dream cars, go on a vacation when they desire for any amount of period. For instance, a recent survey done by The New York Times stated that around 70% of the people choose money as they prime reason for happiness. Thus, having more money not only keeps you stress free, but also helps in having time freedom which 90% of the world\u2019s population don\u2019t have.",
        "Having said that, there are other factors that also contribute in creating joy in peoples lives. One is to pursue your passion: if anyone is content in what they are doing, happiness is just a byproduct. For example, wild life photographers don\u2019t get paid that much, but what they enjoy the most is their work, having to travel places, experience nature like no one does and the most importantly, the satisfaction they get in doing their job is just priceless. The other is to serve people without any expectation. The best way to illustrate this is the job of a teacher, where he or she shares all the knowledge they have with their students only to see them successful on the bigger stage and that gives them happiness to do more. All in all, apart from money there are other ways to create joy.",
        "In a nut shell, while having more money can create time and financial freedom, there are other ways where people find happiness by pursuing their goals and serving other people."
