        "Teaching can change a child's life, whether in positive direction or negative direction. Some people believe that teaching at home is the best way for his growth, on the other hand, some believe that child must go to school for his development. Both the methods have its own benefits, but I also believe that every kid should attend school for his learning. In this essay we will discuss advantages of both the methods and conclude with my opinion.",
        "Many people assume that education starts from home, and family is the best teacher for a new born. There are many pros of home education, first is child spends more time at home, so can learn a lot of things from relatives. Take an example of the recent IIT topper, he was given all his education by his brilliant parents. So it is not necessary to go out for growth. The second advantage of home education is zero fee, we don't need to pay hefty school fees for child teaching. So more time with lessor cost makes home education a good option.",
        "One other way of child teaching is going to some school for enhancing his skills and knowledge. School is a place, where he gets guidance from trained teachers and learn many new things from the peer groups. Every parent cannot be mastered in all subjects, so educational institute provides a platform for learning from specialized and experienced faculties. Even there are many other students of the same age, in their company kid can learn many things. So for specialised education, kids should join some school and make a bright future.",
        "As every way of education has its own benefits, but I always prefer to go to some good school for specialized education as all knowledge cannot be given by family members and after school hours a kid has sufficient time to spend with family members, so he can also learn from them at that time. So every child should get the opportunity to go to some educational institute."
