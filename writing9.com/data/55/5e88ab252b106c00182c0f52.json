        "As the rate of job requirements is increasing, the employer is searching the ways to select professional employees. According to some individuals, employers should take into consideration personal qualities of employees rather than their experience and workmanship. This essay will discuss why I completely agree with this statement despite conventional method of assessing.",
        "There are many qualities which employees should have in order to get daydream job . One of the important qualities is emotional mentality. Employers should pay more attention to emotional state and their ability to empathy. Moreover, employee should understand own emotions and can control them and also support collegues and create healthy workplace atmosphere. How hard it is to work when you have problems in your personal life. For instance, it would be great  if colleagues and the boss required less from employees in their tricky days and helped to get out of a depressed state.",
        "Besides this, in today rapidly developing world , creativity prized  more than diplomas and even experience. I believe that  qualities like preferences and creativity can never be learned and formed at any educational setting. Employees who can create new products, offer fresh ideas and use non-conventional ways are more useful for company or any establishments. Furthermore, in our modern world computers or  internet can solve any even very difficult task and it is quite obviously that workmen who able to create something innovative and extraordinary will be prized more.",
        "In conclusion, personal qualities of worker has to  play a pivotal role when employing them rather than any other features. I believe that amicable personal traits are certainly beneficial as two analyzed reasons above."
