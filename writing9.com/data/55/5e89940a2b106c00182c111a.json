        "Although craming is considered as the most significant part of studies to achieve desired goals ,I ,personally, disagree with this as education is not about the rote learning only.",
        "There are various reasons for my disagreement with the obove notion. The preponderant is , to get good score in any subject, one has to  understand the concepts behind the facts .To elucidate, if a student would crame only facts then probably he may stuck in the exam because of moulded questions. On the other hand , if  student knows the actual concepts of the  topic  then he could answer any question realted to the given topic. In the subject of Mathematics, for example, learners are enforces to cram the tables but it happened many times that children are not able to do futher multiplications as they do not understand the logic behind tables. Resultantly; they failed to solve multiplication beyond tables they cramed already. Thus, deep understanding is the only thing that leads to success in academic.",
        "Aditionally, rote learning has very short life span .It is proved by many studies that memorised facts remain in memory for a short time but on the other hand, if they are understand well logically the effect is long lasting.For example, if a child learns alphabets of English in a sequence , he might forget all if he skiped any one from them. At the same time, if he understand their phenotics as well as recognize them with pictorial representation then surely, it reamains in his everlasting memory as it has been proven that , human mind learn things much faster with subconscious mind.In short, for long lasting learing one should never depend on craming.",
        "In conclusion, to get success in academics one should rely on understanding and concept clearence instead of rote learning"
