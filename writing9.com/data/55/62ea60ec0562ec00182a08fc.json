        "Commercials have been a means of promoting the company products which effectively attract customers to make purchases of them. However, there are some opinions that these ads are not trendy as they used to be, thus people no longer take notice of them. In my point of view, although advertising doesn't guarantee people's attention all the time, it is still a way to draw a number of attractions to buyers.",
        "There are two major reasons why marketing is popular in making people feel like buying commercial products. Firstly, consumers choose to pay for an item or not after evaluating its values displayed on ads. The content of commercials includes information about new product aiming to show various benefits it can bring to users. For example, many milk companies target the needs of customers by displaying the children- oriented benefits such as boosting height, strengthening the physical state, enhancing cognitive abilities. Furthermore, purchasers tend to buy things after seeing beautiful promotion videos and attractive deals informed in marketing. Colorful animation and amazing decrease in price make a powerful combination that viewers positively respond to. To exemplify, promotion of clothe assets showcases the beauty of items professionally and informs a surprising drop in price in a limited period of time, which makes youngsters feel they should go shopping before running out of events.",
        "On the other hand, marketing can be bothersome and no longer interesting to customers. It can cause annoyance to the experience of viewers, thus considerably dropping their mood and leaving a bad impression on people. For instance, an advert suddenly shows up when a person is enjoying their favourite show, which makes them feel frustrated and switch to other channels. Moreover, marketing projected repeatedly and showing no sign of new content cause consumers feeling bored and no longer paying heed to. For example, the customers fully know the information regarding medicine after seeing plenty of similar commercials, watching them again feels like they are wasting their time.",
        "In my perspective, advertising still remains a useful, effective way to attract consumers' attention and the producers should make an effort to change their ads to be more refreshingly different and find a way not to cause discomfort to buyers."
