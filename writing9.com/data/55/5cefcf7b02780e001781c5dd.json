        "Every parent wishes to have a very well-behaved kid in his attitudes. However, schools are found to take care of this. But many parents think that it is not the suitable place. While other parents don\u2019t mind leaving kid\u2019s education to his school. Well, there are many opinions on this, but mine is different.",
        "I believe that a good member is a result of his parents\u2019 instructions and the school education at the same time, because the basics will be learnt from the school and on the other side, traditions will be taken from the parents.",
        "Furthermore, the parents are the influencers, even if the kid is going to stay many hours in the school, at the end he will copy the same manners from his parents. For example, one of the most important things that the kid learns is to wash his hands. He might do that at first but if he sees his parents don\u2019t, he won\u2019t continue. That why parents have significant role in their kid\u2019s life.",
        "In the same amount, school is important either. All thing that we have learnt such as how to deal with adults, ethics and the main studying are a result from the school itself. Many parents might think that some schools, specially the foreign ones, would teach the kid some manners that parents would deny such as some manners in religion. In this case, they should be very careful, or they can report this to the school\u2019s principle to solve.",
        "In conclusion, every parent should make a huge effort in order to have a good child. Either in school or in home or in both."
