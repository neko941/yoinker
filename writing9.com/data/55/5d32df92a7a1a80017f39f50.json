        "\uf0d8\tIt is generally Believed by many people that criminals shall be kept in jail. I firmly agree with this statement. It will be beneficial not only the society but also for saving the states valuable money(36 words)",
        "\uf0d8\tThere are variety of reasons why I would argue that unpaid work in local community would be positive idea(Thought) first come first prisoners shall learn something new they could develop new skills such as a plumbing, furniture, gardening and while they perform in person equips inmate with skills and experience necessary to gain and maintain employment after they are released so this can be beneficial for the states as well.(This may lead to promotion and successful career) Moreover, selflessly(unpaid) Working for community helps to make criminals a productive member of society, for instance in jail they could get trained for work and because of that activity prisoners shall help society to gain some particular  knowledge. (109)",
        "\u2022\tFurethermore ,when they do unpaid for the country (community) it strengthens the economy of the nation. for example, they may help elder people in various tasks in old age homes and exchange their thoughts with them and also the government also hire them as an employee in factories as worker. However it may have inappropriate results, as offenders may disguide the younger the younger ones, it may lead to disaster so as to prevent this catastrophe effect, past records of criminals must be evaluated.",
        "\u2022\tTo sum up, for the reasons mentioned above it seems to me that necessary to give to culprit to improve their ability and become a fine person I think it will make healthy and well society for everyone."
