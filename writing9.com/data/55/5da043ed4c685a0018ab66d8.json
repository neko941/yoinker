        "While some people would rather accept a bad situation and do nothing about it, there are people who are of the opinion that unpalatable situations must not be accepted as final, they opined that something must be done to change the circumstances for the better.",
        "Those who accept bad situations as final and do nothing to improve on them strongly feel that such conditions cannot be remedied and as such, chose to live with negative situations. Similarly, some believe it is their fate to have bad experiences in life and since fate is divine according to them, there is no need trying to change what God has destined.",
        "Those with contrary opinion however believe that there is no condition that cannot be improved upon. To them, no situation is unchangeable and constant improvement is attainable if one can engage his mind in deep and critical thinking. They believe that there is no situation in life humans cannot proffer solutions to. They are also of the school of thought that resigning to fate is foolishness as God has put inside of every creature the ability to surmount his or her challenges.",
        "Personally, I believe that there is no condition or challenge in life that can not be adequately addressed by man so far we have the right attitude and approach towards it. Man needs to engage his thinking faculty in order to be able to gain full understanding of his situations. Having a full comprehension of the issues at hand offers him the opportunity to think about possible solutions. God has given us the capability to think and resolve life's issues, He will definitely not come down to do for us what He has given us the ability to do.",
        "Conclusively, no situation in life is permanent and man must always strive to improve on his situations through constant research and solution oriented  life style."
