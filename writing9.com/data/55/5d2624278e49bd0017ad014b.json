        "Health problems due to high intake of fast foods have been an alarming issue around the world. A lot of people believe that higher taxation on fast foods can help curb the health problems. I agree with the premise stated above. This eassay will first discuss the negative effect higher tax will have on the quantity of high fast food intake by people and then will delve into the positive impact the tax will have over the behaviour of the fast food chains.",
        "Increasing tax would severly hamper the quantity of fast food intake by the citizens of a country. One of the major reason for these fast food chains becoming successful is that they are able to optimize their supply chain, so that affordable fast food can be made available to the customers. Since the food is cheap, hence, people can afford eating more frequently, which results in heath problems. Hence, one of the major factors towards high intake of fast food is the economical price at which one can afford the same. But, in case higher taxes are charged by the government, then, the food will become costlier in the market, which would affect the intake as the people will be able to afford lesser quantity of fast food in same price. This would help in controlling the health issues. For example, in Kerala, additional tax of 10% has been implemented on fast food products, which has resulted in lesser sales over the past year.",
        "Conversely, if the taxes are increased on fast foods, then the fast food chains would also be compelled to change their menu. The fast food chains would be pressurized to sell more of healthy dishes, so that the customers can be retained. This would bring a positive change in the society, as the people would be left with healthier options to eat, which will be cheaper as compared to fast food. For example, post implementation of higher tax by Kerala government, sale of natural products such as coconut water, etc. has increased.",
        "To sum up, I believe that higher tax on fast foods will help us in dealing with the health problems that arise due to high intake of fast food."
