        "It is argued that, many creatures and plants species are disappearing from the planet due to environmental issues, while others believe that other problems are more valuable. This essay agrees with the first view and believe that rare species are in loss. This essay will discuss the reason of why creatures and plants are disappearing and then talk about other environmental threats.",
        "The major reason, related to the atmosphere is noise pollution. It is evident, that the electrical trasmission towers are considered the big hazard for birds species. As they produce radiations and noise some rare birds are at risk of life. Moreover, the life of plants is in danger as people are cutting trees day by day for own purposes the air pollution is increasing rapidaly. For example, it was shown in a recent study carried out by Levi's University that 59% of African birds are disappearing from last few years. However, the loss of animals and plants is a huge threat on the globe, thus resercher's must take steps to prevent incovenients.",
        "On the other hand, many claim that there are other environmental issues. As we know, the number of population is increasing dramatically as consequences, the consumption of fuel by private vehicles reached a peak. Moreover, this have a negative impact on the globe which cause air pollution. To illustrate, a recent survey by Oxford University found that the level of global warming is increased by 75%. However, i believe that government should concern about the effects of pollution on the planet and take inerent steps.",
        "In conclusion, after having discussed pertinent points, i believe that citizens should be aware about the environmental issues."
