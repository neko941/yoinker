        "In this world, there are some people who got a gift by born and that makes them special. While, many people argue that anyone can became a sportsman or song producer. In this essay, I will check both sides and I will share my personal opinion with an example.",
        "Firstly, some people say majority of professional sportman have extreme ability to do certain task because they cannot do that, while it is true for some; they have different genetics. To prove it, many of them have more type 2a/2b muscle fiber in their body, which means they have more endurance than others. Furthermore about singers, they have good voice by default, and even if they sing simple song it might sound good. For example, if anyone with good low pitch voice can product good vocals or  if it is high than good hip pops song.",
        "on the other side, if nature gift is not put on work then it might not give them a success, it can give some advantage but not much. Hence, hard work and smart work is necessary to became professional in any field. In one research, scientiest found that, only five percent of athleties have different insertion in their body, which give them an advantage. Alternatively, it takes months to release a song, where hundered of hours are spent by different people in that band. For example, one of the popular american rapper, eminem has a more than adaquate collection of vocabulary, and it takes more practice to build that and to use it cohesively.",
        "In conclusion, very few individual have extra ordinary gifts, and most of them are popular because of their dedication and hard work. Personaly, I believe that they do take their work more seriously and spent a good amount of time in it, hence they are good at it now."
