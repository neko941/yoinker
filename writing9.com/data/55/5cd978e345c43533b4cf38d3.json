        "It is undeniable that life in metropolitan cities is becoming involved, as so, the quality of life is experiencing a downfall. In most of the cases, the prime reason for this degradation is paradoxical to prosperity. In this essay, we will further analyse the responsible factors and feasible solutions in this issue.",
        "Indeed, with the advancement of science and technology, as well as, with the blessings of globalisation, life in a metro is now enjoying numerous amenities. However, along with it the complexity and other reasons related to the degradation of life quality is on the rise. Furthermore, the ever-increasing demand for prosperity has somehow backfired in city life. For instance, cars with incredible features were invented to ease living, whereas, it is a cause of traffic congestion leading towards diminished life quality.",
        "Additionally, to be endowed with the facilities of mega cities there is a huge inflow of people making it a crowded place to live, and further decreasing the quality of life. The more facilities and luxury a city offer, the more inflow of people it is to face, subsequently diminishing the life quality. For instance, a mega city like Newyork is bestowed with abundant facilities and thus attracts others more than it can capacitate, and making it less liveable.",
        "Accordingly, to solve the problems related to the stated rise and downfall, the state should implement both long term and short term measures. Firstly, decentralisation of various amenities should be enforced by the state, which will prevent the inflow of inhabitants. Secondly, the infrastructure of the city should be redesigned, if possible, to mitigate the sufferings like traffic congestion, overpopulation and so on. However, as the world is a greedy one, it is quite challenging to upgrade the situation in megacities.",
        "In conclusion, though a large city benefits it's dwellers tremendously, it is also responsible for poor life quality. The advancement of life is consequently causing the degradation, and mitigation of this problem shortly is bleak."
