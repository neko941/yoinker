        "The ability to create the art has been a subject of many debates. There are people who believe artistic ability is not specific to certain individuals. Others, however, think it is hereditary or innate. In my opinion, every human being is born with a distinct talent but not everyone is able to demonstrate an artistic work. This essay intends to analyze both sides of the argument before a conclusion is reached.",
        "The aesthetic sense is part of human quality that gives every individual the potential to create the art. But, creativity doesn\u2019t grow naturally into person. To produce an artistic work, a person needs so much practice and experience to express that hidden flair. For example, a composer requires a thorough set of listening skills to develop internal mental processing. In long run this inner hearing can leads to better understanding of rhythmic structure. Moreover, an artistic ability requires imagination and the skill to draw or compose music. A person can master the techniques and the skills of the art to their fullest potential. However, He may not have the same creative imagination of the person who is exceptionally talented. Thus, the production of artworks requires dedication or a lot of hard work and the natural gift.",
        "However, scientific evidences have proved the ability that we inherit from our parents plays a decisive role in determining our aptitude. To illustrate, many great artists showed prodigious ability from an early age like Mozart, who was a great classical composer and musician, compose from the age of five and perform before the high ranking officials of his society. Another example, Homayon Shajarian, the most well-known Persian classical singer whose euphonious voice is supernatural, was born in a music dedicated family. Furthermore, the genetic influence of an individual can\u2019t be ignored as it gives a person a certain ability that may not exist within all people the same. A person with a particular talent see things different from the way regular people do.",
        "To me, people are born to display different talents across different domains which very much depend on genetic influence. If a person is good at something, it doesn\u2019t mean he can be good at everything. Even in the classroom, a student may have natural ability in math but he may not show the same talent for art. Therefore, people who are born in families having an exceptional talent in a specefic domain are more likely to be intelligent in that area.",
        "In conclusion, the significant role of genetic inheritance in generating high level of artistic ability is irrefutable. Practice can help the person at lower level but it is ineffective at higher level."
