        "In recent years, it is noticeable that the number of people who decide to postpone giving birth to their first kid reaches a record high. From my perspective, there are some reasons driving this shift, and its disadvantages absolutely eclipse its advantages.",
        "To begin with, in this extremely competitive labor market, many couples claim that they want to devote their whole early working years to establishing themselves or laying a better foundation for their future career before having their first child. Besides, putting off having babies until they are more experienced and mature to take the parental responsibilities is considered another chief reason accounting for this trend. Last but not least, it is the availability of reliable contraception offers that successfully helps women to delay their pregnancy.",
        "When it comes to the benefits of this tendency, I agree with the belief that the children will be nurtured in a better environment if their parents, at later stages of life, are financially and emotionally stable. However, we should also take its drawbacks into careful consideration. Firstly, according to some scientific findings, middle-aged women are more likely to be prone to miscarriages than younger ones. Additionally, women\u2019s fertility begins to decrease when they reach 25 and decrease more sharply 5 years later; therefore, it may not be easy for them to get pregnant at older ages.",
        "All in all, many factors contribute to the fact that people are delaying their parenthood. However, for all the aforementioned potential risks that people may face, I firmly believe that couples should consider having kids when they are still young."
