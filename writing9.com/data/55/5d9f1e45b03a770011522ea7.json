        "Traditionally, elements like gray but neatly combed hair, bushy eyebrows and keen eyes behind a pair of wire-rimmed spectacles often formed the normal image of a government official in a leader position.Subconsciously, the majority of us still perceive that important jobs in the government are more suitable for the old.However, due to revolutionary changes having taken place in many aspects of the entire society, questions have also been raised about this image, asking whether it is better to nominate younger candidates instead.",
        "Admittedly, compared to older members of the administrations, younger candidates are often viewed as less experienced and therefore less competent for some senior posts in the government, such as a mayor or a director in some department.These positions are so important and their jobs are so complex that they require the candidates to be perfectly familiar with not only their own sectors but also the operational mechanisms between different departments.",
        "However, a leader\u2019s competence and charisma are not just associated with his/her age. Rather, they are predominantly about what he/she has learned in the past, whether from text books or from previous experiences, and if he/she has charming characters that encourage colleagues under his/her charge to make more efforts. Both of these are what young contenders are able to achieve.",
        "In addition, they also have advantages over elder officials in many aspects. For example, receiving a more systematic education, they have a better understanding of more advanced tools, such as the internet and big data analytics, which would possibly boost working efficiency. Second, they are often more energetic and thereby more capable of working for longer hours \u2013 possibly due to their better physical conditions. Third, they are always more flexible and more willing to change, which is a key quality essential for every decision maker in the present context.",
        "In conclusion, although elder government employees may seem as a good choice, the appointment of a leader position ought to be more dependent on his/her knowledge, characters and adaptability."
