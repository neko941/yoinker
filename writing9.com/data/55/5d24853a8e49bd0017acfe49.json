        "It is often thought that introducing more stringent punitive measures for reckless driving will facilitate an improvement in road safety. I completely agree with this point    of  view because it deters the tendency to drive recklessly and  also discourages the temptation to drive under the influence of alcohol.",
        "To begin with, severe punishment would help to discourage offenders who are likely to drive recklessly if there are no punitive laws in place. It is certainly true that when people are punished for the misdeeds, they tend not to repeat such acts especially when such punishment are harsh. For instance in Lagos State Nigeria, there are stringent regulations ranging from imposition of heavy fines to outright impoundment of vehicles to jail terms, which are all targeted towards discouraging careless driving. This singular action of introducing harsh punishments has made the state to have the safest roads in the country owing to a low number of traffic offenders.",
        "Furthermore, harsh consequences for drivers who violate the rules is an effective means of discouraging people from consuming alcohol before driving. Alcohol consumption is one of the chief contributors to unsafe roads because drunk drivers are likely to have their judgment and cognitive impaired which then predisposes them to hitting pedestrians or getting involved in road traffic crashes. For example, an online survey I came across linked a high level of pedestrian knock down  as well as road accidents to indiscriminate alcohol intake by drivers in Sub-saharan Africa. This has made many of these countries to enact laws that ban the use of alcohol among drivers. Consequently, this has led to safer roads in these nations.",
        "In essence, If we sincerely  desire to make our roads less prone to accidents, there is an undeniable need to increase punishment for drivers who violate traffic rules. I, therefore, recommend that government at all levels should promulgate laws in this regard."
