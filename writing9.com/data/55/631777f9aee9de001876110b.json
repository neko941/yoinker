        "Dear Sam,",
        "Hope this letter of mine finds you in good health and in high spirits. As you already know that I have purchased a mixer blender for my new modular kitchen because it becomes quite challenging to do everything manually.",
        "The major reason for buying this appliance was that I was not able to manage cooking at a stipulated time and usually reach late to the office. The mixer comes with 3 jars and only 180 voltage is required for its operation. Moreover, it also comes with 1 year of warranty and in case of any damage, the company will repair it at their own cost. I could make fresh juices as well as blend onions and garlic.",
        "However, it becomes quite challenging while using this machine as it is bulky and is fixed in one place.",
        "After I bought this machine, I could see there were multiple options in the shop such as juicers, jar-blenders and many more and were light in weight. If a customer buys an appliance in Lulu Mall, they will give a 40 per cent discount on the next purchase. You can also check out other options for your new kitchen because you would be needing conduction as well.",
        "Let me know if you need any further assistance.",
