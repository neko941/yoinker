        "Some people believe that computers are unimportant invention of the last century. This essay disagrees with this statement because the fact that computers have been changing people's lifestyle to better of communications and businesses.",
        "The first reason that computers are important invention is computers have an effect on communication. In the past,  most people have letters and face-to-face communication, but now people use their computer, laptop and smartphone to communicate. The communication via computer and the internet is faster than old-fasion comminucation since people can send messages from one hemisphere to another hemisphere in just 1-2 seconds. For example, people in the country which were damaged by Tsunami can post on Facebook application to make a donation from another country immediately.",
        "The second reason that computers are important invention is computers have been changing businesses. Most of bussinesses have to change their advertisement from bill-board and television to an online media such as Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. The new-fasion communicative platform are chaper and easier to use than the old-fasion platform. For instance, in Thailand, people using Facebook application average 8 hours a day. So most companies in this country have to have an admin page and a Facebook page to promote their new products. Furthermore, the customer also contract to shops faster than before, they can ask for the product information or complain of services.",
        "In conclusion, I disagree with that computers are not the most important invention of the century because the communications and businesses were significantly improved during the last hundred years."
