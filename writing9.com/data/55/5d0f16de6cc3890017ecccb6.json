        "The lesson learnt from the past does not have no more advantages for people living in the present.  In my experience, it is not true at all and the lesson from the past can give us a chance not to happen a serious mistakes in the present.",
        "First of all, the present issues that we face today are result from the past. It is impossible to neglect all the bad lessons that happened in the past. By doing that can affect our society seriously if we ignore the practice from the past. Take an example, there was a surge cyclone hit in delta region of our country the last five years ago and over 100000 people were killed by this giant storm because of a wrong information announced by the authorities. Apart from that, people also did not take serious action about that tropical storm as they thought that is just ordinary storm because they always used to face storms annually. As a consequence, there were a massive of death and a huge damage on infrastructures and economy of our country. After that, the government always aware to release the exact information concerned with such a kind of disaster to public. The community also always follow the metrological information released through radio, newspaper and the broadcasting strictly.",
        "Secondly, learning about the past brings many benefits to our society by not doing serious mistakes in the present. Our world came across with the First and Second World War and the countless people were killed and injured during the world. Furthermore, several things, for example, heritage and historic places and the ancient cities, etc were destroyed during the war. Then, the world leaders and people learnt the effects of war and they wanted the peaceful society. As a result, the biggest organization in the world, the United Nations was established in order to maintain the peaceful world without no more world wars.",
        "In conclusion, learning the past is very important for our society because the serious faults were happened by human being. The learning lesson from the past can create not to happen the unpleasant events for our future generation."
