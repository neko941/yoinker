        "Advancement in technology has fulfilled the gap in every part of the world ,especially in the agriculture field. Despite this, the majority of people around the globe still have to tackle the problem of fits of hunger. This essay will examine the reasons for this before suggesting some possible methods to eliminate this worldwide issue.",
        "The predominant factor resulting in famine is gaping between the needy and affluent people because of this wealthy people can access food first in comparison to poor people. The second most important factor that causes this situation is the political power that basically provides permission to a richer section to intaking a healthy diet. However, people who belong to the under poverty line have to remain with hunger. For instance, In ,Africa more than  half number of children have suffered from malnutrition because of a lack of food in their region.",
        "The solutions are not simple. First of all, the local authorities should reduce the heavy taxes that are imposed on crops and seeds. Consequently, the farmer could afford such a reduction and ultimately increases the farm yield which further serves people with basic food supplements. Secondly, the bridge that has been generated between rich and poor should be overcome as a result, this will resolve the issue of hungriness which is the biggest problem among the community despite, having better agricultural facilities. Therefore, the word Hungary would only be removed through stringent steps that have been taken by the government.",
        "In conclusion, in spite of having advancements in agriculture people all over the world ,,still go  hungry and it could only have culminated through the removal of discrimination between rich and poor as well as lessening the prices of crops."
