        "In this era of globalization, with the enhancement of the technology has certainly helped mankind\u2019s in many different aspects of life especially crime. In addition to that, the police and law enforcement mutually agreed that smart technology has certainly reduces the rate of crime occurring in the nation. Despite of that, some refuted that having savvy high-tech device can only cause more harm to the society as the criminal able to commit even worse crimes than before. Both of these notions with be discussed further in this essay.",
        "First of all, having smart tech gadgets can aid in curbing serious offences in the society. With the help of the CCTV camera and GPS tracking system, identifying criminals will be easier as there is a facial recognition and able to track down the person\u2019s location at the same time. For instance, tracking down a missing person using suspects and dogs will be the thing in the past as surveillance camera in the street and GPS in the car enable to track down the kidnapper\u2019s location. Besides that, many of the cold case file can be solved thanks to the advancement of the machinery in the forensic science laboratory. As a result, many civilian\u2019s lives can be saved and the offender will be receiving punishment that they deserve.",
        "On the other hand, there are a few setbacks with incurring number of smart gadgets around society. These days, a lot of crime committed through website and this is known as cybercrime.

Moreover, there are a high number of illegal websites such as gambling may rotten the minds of the young children and this potentially creates more criminals in the future.",
        "In conclusion, in my perspective, I belief that technology able to mitigate this serious and deadly crimes and with the strict supervision in the website by the higher authority and police, cybercrime can be curbed."
