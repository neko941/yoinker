        "Some individuals are of the opinion that hosting multinational sport tournament is advantageous for the host Nation. Although some people disagree with this view. Personally, I think it has a great benefits because it increases the economic growth of the State and infrastructural development,but not without a drawback.",
        "There are some distinct advantages of been a host State of multinational sport tournament. Firstly, there is increased economic growth because many tourist, sportsmen and women will flee in from different States thereby increase the internal generated revenue. For example, the Commonwealth games held in Brimingham attracted over 500 thousand sportsmen and women and spectators who Lodged ,shopped and travelled round the city. Secondly, there is infrastructural development within the Nation especially the hosting location. The country will not allow other Nations to see them in their worst state, so they use it as an opportunity  to improve the overall scenery of the State. Thus, it is obvious that  multinational sports tournament benefits the host Nation in terms of financial growth.",
        "On the other hand, there is one major drawback to the hosting of world sports tournament. At first, the country spend more which runs them into debt that takes years to pay. This means that they spend heavily on this project like building standard stadium, hotels hospitals and other facilities which might not be used to generate any fund after the event. For example, it is estimated that about $100 billion was spent on the just conclude Olympic games held in Beijing, which is quite exorbitant for a nation with the recent inflation all over the world. So, without doubt gelding a sports event runs the countries economy dry and also come with indebtedness.",
        "Conclusively, I believe that been a host Nation for Multinational sports event has both merit and demerit. However, the benefits outweighs the drawbacks because it increases the countries over development both capital and structural growth."
