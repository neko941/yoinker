        "Arts, music and theare play a vital role in our life and also promotes harmoney in the society. But, it is believed that arts, music and theatre are not very useful and that it is directed to public services like education or heathcare. However, I completely disagree with this and feel that arts are the every worth penny that is spending on them.",
        "Firstly, It encourages people and bring out the hidden creativity. Furthermore, it helps us to express our emotions and also teaches us about our own culture and history. Secondly, If a nation has rich historical background then it helps to promote tourims. This way government can money from the foreigners and also raise the economy of the nation. For example, According to the Time News, Indian government earn 5 million rupees from the tourism industry in the year 2015. This is possible only because of rich Indian heritage.",
        "Furthermore, arts, musics and theatres are the rich source of entertainment for the several people of the nation. Additionally, people's love to watch movies in cinemas and government can earn money  from movie industry by appling cinema tax on each ticket. Art is what differentiate us from animals. For example, According to Linda, Australian government charged 50 cents on each movie ticket and in this wasy they excel their economy. So, spending money on arts, musics and cinemas  is not a waste of money. On the other side, some believe that investment in public sector should be prioritized over arts and also claim that public basic need should be put before luxurious such as arts, music and theatre.",
        "In conclusion, Arts is what differentiate us from animals. So, government should allocate some funds in order to preserve the culture."
