        "Tax rates have been ongoing debate for centuries. Some people argue that tax rates should be instantiated. Others believe that higher tax rates do not benefit us as much as we think. This essay will discuss why I completely believe that the higher the tax rates people pay, the better the quality of public services tends to be, but there sould be a limit to how much governments can tax someone.",
        "Public services, such as education, transportation and health care rely on taxation. The more tax people pay, the more these services improve. This is due to the fact that a high tax rate means that the government has more money to spend on its public services. For instance, countries with high taxation, such as Australia and Sweden, have a solid infrastructure, whereas in other countries with low taxation is quite the opposite. Therefore, there is a strong correlation between tax rates and the condition of public services.",
        "While I support higher taxes, I believe that there should be a limit on how much governments can tax its citizens. This is because if a person is taxed to much, he or she can lose the motivation to work. Although I think that rich people should be taxed even more than their counterparts, they still should be incentivized, to continue to climb the economic hierarchy. Clearly, without a limit on taxation, many poeple would suffer.",
        "In conclusion, even though I completely believe that governments should increase taxes in order to improve its public services, it should not exceed a certain limit. This is the only way to improve public service while ensuring that people are not affected negatively by it."
