        "In the modern society, lives of people have become more complicated. Their requirements have changed dramatically. In order to simplify their complex life, they tend to buy many things to simplify their life. But in nowadays, people are not using these items for long term and dump these in a short period of time.",
        "Firstly, we need to look at why people are buying so many things in a short period of time. It is always good to buy things that make your life lesser complex. Those items are becoming more affordable, widely available and that leads everyone to buy or try out these items. Also, people have become more attracted by the marketing strategies and advertisements of those products. Because of the people buy things that is not necessary for their lifestyle. I think those are the main reasons for buying those items.",
        "Secondly, let\u2019s look at what sort of problems can arise because of this uncontrollable behaviour. This will surely affects the financial side of each individual. Also, this is going to impact the economy of the country if these items are importing from other countries. Other than that, when you buy more stuff more junks are going to pile up at the home. Furthermore, this will contribute to the environmental pollution as well. Sometimes I have seen lives of people have become more complex than before because of the new item they purchased.",
        "In my opinion, I strongly believe that people need to more causes about what they purchase. Because of the purchases life can be more complicated. For example, I do not spend money on a new stuff that recently introduce to the market without looking at the actual usage of it. Also, I am going to compare with other things in the market that does the same job before do a purchase.",
        "In conclusion, people need to more aware about the market and need to do a proper research before purchasing items."
