        "In the recent days, it becomes apparent that the quantity of the elderly people which experiences an upward trend is more than the number of the younger in many countries from then onwards. While there are clear positive aspects of this trend, it also causes positive growth in having less the youthful people.",
        "On the one hand, one main advantage of this issue is that senior citizens can have a significant impact on countries\u2019 economy. First and foremost, they rely on a pension and cannot enough power energy to make money. As a result, it is true that government have to pay extra-money to nurture them rather than boosting either education or entertainment services, which vividly loses budget of that country. Public insurance companies in Japan country, for example, giving more and more various discounts for bills such as electricity, water and health protection are likely to waste a lot of cashes.",
        "On the other hand, the \tadolescent people can indeed gain more knowledge and take a great advice from elder individuals. Firstly, old people who witness ups and downs of the history can reveal the former events more comprehensively than others. Besides, they can help their families to do housework such as cooking or looking for their own grandchildren instead of sending to child care center whenever the younger members are busy outside.",
        "Having considered both views, I do believe that the big amount of the senior people is of overriding importance, contributing hugely to the both drawbacks and merits development in each country. In my opinion, government should control this aging rate to create an effective system in the future."
