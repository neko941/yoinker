        "Food shortage is a growing concern around the world and a number of methods have been proposed to overcome it. I believe that consumption of genetically modified food is a good solution to food scarcity, however, it is definitely not the best.",
        "On the one hand, artificial food can be a promising solution to end food shortage. First, it will result in an increased production of edibles. One of the major reasons for food shortages around the world is low production which can be mitigated by increasing genetically modified produce. Secondly, genetically modified food is much cheaper than naturally produced food. As affordability is a factor that determines whether food can be purchased by a large segment of society, the cheaper genetically modified edibles would be within the purchase power of many.",
        "However, while consumption of genetically modified food is a good solution, promoting contemporary agriculture is probably a better way to end food shortage. Genetically modifying the food can provide enough food for people, yet it may not be of high nutirional value. Promoting agriculture, on the contrary, can help alleviate food shortages with natural food of high nutritional value. Many farmers today, cannot export crops at an optimum level because of taxes. If the governments ease duties, they will be able to export more produce while contributing toward ending the food shortages.",
        "Finally, perhaps the most common reason for food shortages across the world is poor supply which can be alleviated by taking neccessary steps. Remote regions in many countries do not receive enough food supplies. This is because they do not have proper roads for transportation. For example, the biggest factor that contributed to the deterioration of African famines was lack of poor transportation. Due to the poor condition of roads, food supplies could not reach the affected areas which resulted in many casualties.",
        "In short, even though genetically modified food is a good way to tackle food shortages, I believe that providing better transportation and improving agriculture are better solutions."
