        "There is debate whether having people from different nationalities and cultural backgrounds living together in the same country allow for a faster development on a national scale. I completely agree that diversity amony cistizens is a great benefit due to multiple reasons which I will explore in the essay below.",
        "First, exposure to different cultures be it in the way an individual dresses, eats, practice his/ her religion encourages tolerance. Moreover, statistics reveal that children are less likely to be bullied at a school where the majority of students come from different backgrounds. Also, when one is raised in an environment where it is normal to work and study with people who look and act differently than one's own cultural heritage, it becomes less likely to judge a person's value based on appearances alone.",
        "On the other hand, there are some who would argue that these same differences can actually instigate conflicts rather than tolerance. However, I disagree with this statement because histroy has proven that wars have arisen only when nations chose to embrace seclusion instead of inclusion. A stark example is Hitler's WWII beliefs of building a nation based on a single race. While Nazi Germany quickly crumbled both economically and socially , countries such as the United States of America and Canada which are built by people who immigrated from different regions of the world are still rising globally.",
        "To surmise, countries whose populations showcase different cultures have the advantage of developing faster due to the following reasons such as promoting tolerance among their citizens and decreasing the risk of international conflicts because of their ability to embrace the \" others\" ."
