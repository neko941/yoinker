        "Cigarette is not only harmful to the people who consume them, but also to those  around the consumers  who smoke should be banned in public facilities. I totally agree with this statement because of some aspects.",
        "To begin with, smoking has many worse effects ,especially on people's bodies. A cigarette is able to cause many diseases such as respiratory disease and throat disease. These diseases are really detrimental and can cause  decreasing productivity of people when they affect disease because of cigarettes. To take an example, there are a lot of people who suffered from consuming  cigarettes, and all of them regret why they consumed cigarettes in the past. As a result, their productivity decrease to this trend and they feel hopeless because of the disease.",
        "Besides the healthy aspects, smoking can also cause  economic problems for  smokers. Some people who consume cigarettes are coming from mid-low societies, and because of that smoking area should be limited by the authority so that  smokers only have several places for consuming cigarettes. Making a strict rule can make them  realize that smoking is a bad thing that can be done in a public facility. To take an example, the government can strict several public facilities for the smokers such as bus stations, airports, and schools. Hence, people can decrease the number of people who get negative impacts from smoking.",
        "To sum up, we know that smoking is not only dangerous for  smokers, but also for their surroundings. Suffering because of disease is one example of smoking, and cigarettes are supposed to be banned from public facilities such as schools, bus stations, and airports by making strict rules for the smoker in order that the number of people who suffer from this trend can be decreased slightly. I believe that when this solution is made, it will make the number of consumers of cigarettes decrease."
