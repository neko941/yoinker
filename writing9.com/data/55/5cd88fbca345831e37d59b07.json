        "It is commonly believed that modern technological devices, such as cell phones are decreasing social interaction between the people. I totally agree with the statement and in this essay I will explain how revolutionised working life and different leisure activities than before are pushing people apart.",
        "To begin, advance technology had significantly changed our working methodologies. Previously people used to perform their tasks through traditional methods by spending long hours in offices and working with mutual cooperation and assistance. This in turn helped them in staying socially connected. However,with the advent of internet technology and launch of modern gadgets like mobile phones people are becomimg isolated because they prefer to get their jobs done online at home as online tasking is feasible, time saving and efficient as well. For instance, in past people used to visit banks in order to submit their electricity or telephone bills. Whereas, now this can easily be done at home through mobile phones using easy paisa application. So in this way frequency of social interaction is decreasing.",
        "Further, people are now provided with more interesting part time activities. They used to spend their free time by watching online videos or playing on net games with least social exposure. Contrary to this, people before were so much socialised. They used to have sports, excursions, arts activities and family gathering so they were preserving their mutual bonds. For example, PUBG is a latest gaming sensation which is popular worldwide. It has millions of online players connected to one another through technology but in reality they have no social circle around.",
        "To conclude, latest technology is producing fragmentation among people by proving mechanical ways of working and fascinating entertainment activities."
