        "Today is the era of technology and there are so many hazards that causing  problems for our planet . There are widespread worries about pollution , pandemics , natural disasters ,global warming etc. In this , essay I will discuss  the most prominent problem and by using a prudent approach will provide a logical conclusion.",
        "According to my, Global warming is a hot issue  today that is affecting the earth in various ways. Firstly, Due to global warming temperature on earth is constantly changing .in addition to this, in many places in the  the world it's causing floods and drought. Secondly, it is affecting  the ozone layer that is playing an important role to protect the earth from dangerous UV rays , which will lead to many skin diseases. Thirdly, global warming is the cause of the greenhouse effect ,furthermore it affects lots of all living things on the earth.",
        "To control  this government should take serious steps , such as planting more and more trees , promoting  public transport to control pollution . Furthermore, they should give hefty fines to those who contribute to increasing global warming by any means . People also use recycled products to help the authorities .",
        "In a nutshell, According to my ,opinion we can ignore other issues but global warming is the most preponderant one that should be resolved at an alarming pace ."
