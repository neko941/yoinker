        "Nowadays, a recent trend shows that a vast majority of individuals opt for foreign movies in comparison to the locally produced counterparts. This essay will provide a substantial reason for this, in terms of increment knowledge. Furthermore, the promotion of international recognizance and support of indigenously film industries will be discussed as major reasons why there should be a governmental assistance to these industries.",
        "One of the major reasons why there is a preference of international films is the improvement of intellectual repository. Consider language as an example, people tend to watch movies produced by Hollywood so that their English language vocabulary can increase. Infact, current research conducted at the University of Nigeria, with the undergraduate students as case study, shows that more than an average of its citizens watches Hollywood and British movies so as to familiarize and improve their accents. More so, exposing oneself to foreign shows also leads to the knowledge and acquisition of the culture and traditions of the overseas nations.",
        "However, in order to support the solid existence and the non-negligence of these indigenous movie companies, the government should channel more financial resources towards their growth. Take for instance, the Nigerian movie industry, also known as Nollywood. Statistics have revealed that the firm came third when ranked with other highly reputable world-wide movie companies, like the Hollywood (First) and the Bollywood (Second). The Nollywood was brought to limelight owing to the interference of the Nigerian government and has thus, increased the GDP of the country. In addition, jobs will be created for talented individuals when the government pledge their unwavering support to such industries.",
        "To sum up, most people who displayed preference of non-local movies noted that it helped them in the skilled usage of international languages, as well as, an awareness of the traditions and cultures of other nations. However, job creation, promotion of international recognizance and improvement in country\u2019s GDP can be positive insights which can be gained when the governments support these firms."
