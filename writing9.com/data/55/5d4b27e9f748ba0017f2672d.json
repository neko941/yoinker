        "An increasing number of people from developing nations are making their first car purchases. The primary problem this cause is the increased pollution in urban areas and the most viable solution is to improve the public transport system.",
        "The main problem that people are facing due to the increased number of cars is air pollution. In other words, the emission of a huge amount of carbon dioxide and monoxide by cars in the atmosphere polluted the air and thus cause air pollution. Therefore, more number of cars will release more harmful gases in the atmosphere that will result in more pollution in cities. For example, according to a recent survey by the Times of India in city Delhi, there is a 40% increase in the number of motor vehicles in the last 10 years and this results in a 20% increase in air pollution.",
        "The most viable solution to this predicament is to build a sustainable public transport system. That is to say, the government should encourage people to travel by public transport such as underground trains, electric buses and this could reduce the number of cars on the roads. As a result, people will use their cars only when it is necessary and prefer public transport to travel in the city that will reduce air pollution. For instance, a recent report by the Times magazine revealed that there is a 30% reduction in air pollution in Delhi ever since the government started metro service.",
        "In conclusion, the main problem with the rise in the number of motor vehicles in developing countries is the air pollution but this problem can be solved by building a proper public transport system."
