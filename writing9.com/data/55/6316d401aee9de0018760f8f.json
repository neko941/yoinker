        "In this contemporary era, population in urban cities have increased at an alarming rate. A lot of people like to live in a house with small or no outdoor areas. This essay will deliberate the positive to live in a small house without outdoor areas, but also negative development in the upcoming paragraphs.",
        "On the one hand, there are some positive effect to live in a small house. The first and foremost is that people who live in a smaller house or flate without outdoor areas, they don\u2019t have to pay much money for it. Secondly , smaller house or flates are cheaper to rent to buy. This kind of accommodation is suitable for those youngsters who are studying or just have a job. For example, a survey taken by the Time of USA newspaper, in America 2016, that 87% of the majorities liked to live in a small house without outdoor areas.",
        "On the other hand, there are few negative effect to live in a small home. Firstly , limited open space gives negative effect on individuals healths. Due to this, they cannot do any kinds of physical activities at home and they become victims of many diseases such as obesity or diabetes . Secondly , it\u2019s also bad impact on people\u2019s mind. In less space, they cannot see outdoor views. They live alone in small home without outdoor areas, and they feel bored and frestrated . For illustrate, a survey taken the Time of New York newspaper , in America 2018, was that living in a smaller house no outdoor areas have increased from 64% to 87% in past 5 years.",
        "In conculsion, I want to reiterate my words that living in a small home is very good for simple and  happy life, and it\u2019s also beneficial for older and younger people, but it\u2019s also negative effect on their health ,mind and body."
