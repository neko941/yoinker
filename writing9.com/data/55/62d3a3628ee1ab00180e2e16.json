        "In the modern world, there is a general tendency toward studying e-books instead of textbooks books which is dramatically increasing. Using these books has some pros and cons. This essay will illustrate both of them in detail.",
        "Using and reading e-books have a lot of profits. The first and foremost of them is environmental protection because in this way publishers don\u2019t need papers. In other words, it avoids cutting trees in order to produce papers for publishing books. Furthermore, these books are cost-effective in comparison with printed books. For example, since the cost of producing and publishing  an e-book isn\u2019t high, the price of the final product is cheaper than its paper book.",
        "Despite the above arguments, e-books include some drawbacks. Lack of enough focus during reading time is one of them. It means, that when somebody uses an electronic device like a smartphone, his focus might be distracted by other applications such as a messenger. In addition, we shouldn\u2019t overlook eye injuries. For instance, if someone  is interested in studying a book at night, if he doesn\u2019t set his mobile light appropriate night, his eyes will injure over time.",
        "To sum up,  these days, using of e-books is rising. Notwithstanding the upsides of them like conservation of the environment and low prices, the downsides, such as focus distractors and eyes strains, should also be taken into consideration."
