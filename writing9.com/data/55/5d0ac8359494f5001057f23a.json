        "Overweight is undoubtedly one of the biggest concerns faced by the world today. Many people opine that in order to tackle this issue cost of fattening food items should be raised significantly thereby discouraging people to consume them on a regular basis. This essay completely advocates the aforementioned suggestion.",
        "To begin with, in recent years, there is a dramatic increase in the number of fast food outlets across the globe. These convenience food chains sell eatables like burgers and french fries which are high in saturated fat and can be directly correlated to the deteriorating health status of the population. The restaurants which sell delicacies rich in fat content are often more cost effective as compared to other places. Fast food joints are highly popular amongst the young generation due to their pocket friendly nature. Children often have limited budget and the menus of these places are designed intelligently to lure them into purchasing these meals on a daily basis. This is creating a detrimental impact in the overall health of the community. Therefore, the government of every nation should make it compulsory that the price of such food items is increased in order to demotivate the population from consuming them.",
        "Furthermore, an increase in the cost of these dishes will compel people to eat home cooked meals more often, as a result, the damaging effect caused by the fattening products can easily be reversed.",
        "By eating meals prepared at home people will develop an inclination towards healthy food habits, which will enable the entire population to eventually become more health conscious.",
        "To sum up, obesity is a pressing problem that needs to be addressed immediately. In my opinion an inflation in the price of fattening substances is an absolute imperative in handling this matter."
