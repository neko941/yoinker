        "A lot of upper level management positions have been occupied by male employees despite of the fact that half of the workforce is of female in the developed nations and it is being argued that a certain number of these positions should be reserved for female. This essay is in disagreement of this notion because by doing so, firstly we are putting a restriction on selection criteria and secondly, as the level of responsibilities female have in their lives, it can be a risk for the companies.",
        "By allocating a number of high level positions to female employees, companies will have an addition in the selection process for these positions. And, if in case this criteria is not met by any candidate, then there are chances of  unfilled position for a long time. For example, 5 years ago, when Nestle allocated 5% of the upper-level management positions for female, 4% remained vacant for 2 years as neither they found a women candidate who satisfied other criterias nor they could offer these positions to male employees.",
        "Secondly, it becomes a big risk for the companies to provide leadership responsibilities to female candidates. As women have many duties in their personal lives, so making them a decision maker of the company can be a big mistake at sometime. For example, in Colgate, in the year 1992, 7% of female employees under performed due to their personal reasons.",
        "In conclusion, despite of the fact that myriads of women are working these days, but due to unwillingness of adding another clause in the selection criteria of a prestigious position by the company and, also the amount of responsibilities they have in their lives, it is not a right decision to block a number of high positions for female."
