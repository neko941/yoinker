        "No one can deny that there are both positive and negative aspects of buying things on the internet.From time to time it is becoming more and more popular nowadays this form of buying from the development of technology.In my opinion has absolutely a good impact on people around the world.The reasons for this will be addressed in the following essay.",
        "Most of us believe that the popularity of purchasing online is rapidly increasing because one of the most prominent advantages of online shopping is very convenient since consumers only need to browse the website or they can compare prices between different shops to find the appropriate deals, and they only need to wait for  delivery. Moreover, going to crowded places such as the plaza or the supermarket can be avoided since many people can feel uncomfortable going to these places. For instance, during COVID, there is no doubt that both customers and businesses find that being able to shop online is extremely useful since they can avoid contact with many people, also they can maintain their sales by satisfying their customers' needs and wants.",
        "On the other hand topic, some disadvantages need to be concerned. Making purchases for technology pieces or expensive clothing can be very risky because sometimes they need specialist advice. In addition, jo you need to try them on to know whether they are suitable or not. Furthermore, Internet hacking or scamming is a significant risk because you have to input your personal information as your address or credit card number. Besides, choosing a credit card as a payment method will be difficult to handle the total amount of money that you are spending since you are not physically counting the remaining money that you have. For example, many Apply pay users shared that their unpleasant experiences in terms of managing their total expenses because Apply pay does not show the remaining money on their account after the payment."
