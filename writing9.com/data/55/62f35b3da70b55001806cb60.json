        "I don't believe that the character of a person is predetermined by the gene. Rather the environment does.this essay will discuss extensively on this.",
        "The DNA consist of traits such as physical look like eye color, skin color , and similar dressing code can be imitated as well and also some disease condition which is subjected to be family history in medical term. The character of an individual can be shaped by the educational system and upbringing. Children are like sponge that easily absorbs everything around them. For example, a child whose father drinks alcohol and behaves irrationally can be educated about the negative effect , and as such his mental health will be reformed.",
        "Secondly, education will enlightened a person's character on how to show respect , and differenciating the bad from the good . Another thing that can reshape a person is the environment , for example , a child who is brought up in an aggressive society tends to have a trace of high temperament this has nothing to do with gene rather environmental effect. The gene has no effect on character instead the circumstances within surrounding changes one into being worst or better. Also peer group association influences a child in different forms and that's why parents or guardian should be able to supervise their child on the type of friends the keep, Furthermore, morals can be learnt either from church , schools and other decent forum ,thus reshaping ones' character generally.",
        "In conclusion, the gene of a person has nothing to do with character , but the situations surrounding the environment where we find ourselves does. This is why education and proper upbringing is pivotal."
