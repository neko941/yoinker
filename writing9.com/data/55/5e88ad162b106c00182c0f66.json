        "People have different view about the adverts which  of the target audience   are children  should be banned due to having detrimental influences  on them  . I completely believe as advertisements yet possess some  violent  scenes and upset the family budget by forming the behaviour of stubbornness in children.",
        "To begin with,  it is undeniable that advertisement has a great impact on people's lifestyle especially,  offsprings who are being more influenced by them. It seems that some adverts including  some toys and other online games , nowadays, are flooded with dangerous stunts that children can cope with them . It is really dangerous , although there is a little warning text  in the bottom  saying  \" do not  make  a attempt to do  in real life \" .  Since little kids can not fully understand the meaning of it  , not to mention their curiosity towards  trying to do  any interesting things in their younger age , some left unattented children do the same acts in reality. Undoubtedly,  the consequences of them may end up with big losses or far-reaching damages for both they and their relatives.",
        "Moreover ,   some obstinate children are  being encouraged to be owner of  new goods  by advertising them  simultaneosly,  they are ,being encouraged to be more stubborn . As a result,  by buying unnecessary things  , family budget can upset . Such kind of behaviour make them more persistent not only in shopping but also other important things like trying to go internet clubs without permission of their parents or being disrespectful to people in society  since they begin thinking of their activities are  always acceptable .  Especially, advertising of goods in school premises including educational  materials have greater influence on pupils, as they think that they have a approval of school authority .  Or  when they see their friends with latest smart phones or laptops and force their parents to buy them if they can not buy then  they are depressed . In turn , it damages parents ' pocket.",
        "To conclude , it can be evident that   children's advertisement  programmes have  negative effects on   both children's behaviour and life as well , they should be banned to provide young generation with better life ."
