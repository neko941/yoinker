        "Nowadays, plenty of teenagers are leaving their comfort zone to pursue higher education internationally ,while other attendants are keen on living with their mom and dad. It is certainly that living far from home has some disadvantages to itself, however, I believe that there still a lot of benefits we can get from living in other cities or even countries.",
        "Undoubtedly, the drawbacks of living away from home can cause many devastating effects on us later on. Firstly, the admission that prefers to attend universities in other cities is not mature enough to recognize among bad and good, which may lead pupils to consume drugs and make them lose the scholarship that they earned. Secondly, depression is the thing that happens to most of the enlistment who want to get a bachelor's degree, moving away from their loved ones who are hard to leave behind.",
        "On the other hand, live for away from parents can bring many advantages to students too. The first and may be the most important thing is that pupils have more free time for themselves, to do whatever they want. The second one is students start becoming more independent from their parents, they will know how to manage time reasonably, and their laundry and cleaning will be done by them.",
        "In conclusion, although, living away from home involves some very bad changes, whereas become self-reliant and have more time to invest in something they actually like."
