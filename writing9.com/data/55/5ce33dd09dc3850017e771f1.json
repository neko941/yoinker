        "The idea of online shopping is gaining grounds in this present generation. A significant number of people, purchase commodities via the internet. This essay will discuss why the benefits of shopping online are far greater than the negatives.",
        "To begin with, buying things online saves time and energy, which consequently increases productivity. In the world today, a lot of people work two or more jobs, or even longer hours, in order to make ends meet. In order to cater for themselves and their families, they buy food items, books, as well as flight tickets, from the comfort of their homes or places of business, without having to miss out on other activities. Furthermore, it eliminates the stress associated with the conventional forms of procuring items as goods can be delivered to ones doorstep. For instance, a working mother of four, who is also a business woman can order dinner for her family at the close of work to enable her have more personal time with her children.",
        "Nevertheless, some people believe that online shopping causes isolation, by reducing the amount of physical contact people have with other human beings. However, this is not the case, as the world is now a global village. Online transactions are done by majority of people and this in turn fosters human interaction through social media platforms. For example, a survey done in Italy in 2018, revealed that most citizens purcahsed items for China and now frequently talk and relate exceptionally well with the Chinese as opposed to the happenings a decade ago.",
        "Additionally, buying items online opens the buyer to a wide range of products. With technological advancements, people can use search engines to look for a variety of sellers of a particular goods and services, after which they can make informed decisions based on specifications and what they can afford. Futhermore, it gives people options to choose from and does not limit the reach of businesses worldwide. Therefore, organizations can thrive and expand. As an example, in 2018, I went online to see if I could purchase a medical textbook, which costed about thrice my budget in the local bookstore. I found someone who wanted to sell off his old collections at a price I could afford and that is how I became a book owner.",
        "In conclusion, internet shopping is becoming increasingly popular. This essay discussed why the positive impacts of this development\u00a0 significantly outweigh the drawbacks, due to the fact that it reduces stress and inconvenience and also provides options for individuals, as well as improving social interactions."
