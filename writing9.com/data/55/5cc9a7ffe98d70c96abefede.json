        "The role of history in our lives is increasingly becoming contentious in resent times. To some, there is no future in the past, for others however it is an important ingredient of knowledge especially with respect to humanity. In my opinion the value of history depends on the history itself.",
        "History sometimes negatively affects the present and the future of a person or even a nation. In some countries, history has been scrapped from the school curriculum because it is seen as incendiary, inciting cold wars and even actual wars occasionally. History of Nigerian civil war in the years 1968 to 1971 is a good example of where history can be harmful. It was found that youths in south-eastern Nigeria felt terrible after they were taught the wickedness perpetrated against Biafrans by the then northern Nigeria soldiers and militia in those days. There was growing hatred against the northerners, jeopardising national unity and peaceful coexistence. As a result history is no longer taught in Nigerian schools.",
        "Conversely, history as a body of knowledge is beautiful to have and also can help to determine the future positively. In some countries, it contributes to their wealth. For instance, museums, antiquities and monumental structures are products of history and they serve as the basis of tourism from which some countries make a lot of money. In addition, good history as against a bad one can influence nations or individuals positively.",
        "To conclude, I believe that a good history is good and should transferred through generations while a bad history that incites wars and has other possible unwanted effects should be dropped. The beauty of a history is in the history."
