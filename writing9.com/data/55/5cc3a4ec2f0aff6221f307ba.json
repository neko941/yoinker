        "It is the case that the increasing living standard in a country seems to be more substantial for cities rather than non-urban areas. There could be several problems from this and I take into account that there are some solutions to mitigate these issues.",
        "This trend provides the rural depopulation which causes a large number of countryside dwellers to move to the cities, thus resulting in a housing shortage and environmental pollution. With regard to the former, there are more and more migrants in urban areas whereas the area square limits, this leads to the over-priced accommodation and the poor people cannot afford to satisfy the need of settlement. As far as I am concerned, more increasing population, more garbage is wasted, which places a weighty burden on the environment.",
        "From my views, one of the remedy, in order to tackle these problems, is the government should allocate budget into the suburban areas to attract people to live and work here, to take an example is that the education investment in the countryside rises, which makes parents will not make a decision to move their children to the cities to follow education anymore. Another way forward is businesses relocation in order to appeal to more employees in these areas and take contribution to foster a higher standard in the countryside.",
        "In conclusion, this situation can put residents at some disadvantages, however, I believe a number of solutions can address them."
