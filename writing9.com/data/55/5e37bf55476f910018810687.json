        "Exercise plays a vital role in one\u2019s physical and mental health. It is believed that exercise is beneficial at early ages. In my opinion, it should be mandatory for all the students to actively participate in physical and sports activities.",
        "Children spend most of the time nowadays on electronic gadgets. This restricts their body to any physical exertion. To achieve a better physical health exercise is suggested by the health organizations. For instance, the eye sight of the children playing video games is more exposed and is much easily affected as compared to other children. Furthermore physical activities keep the body in shape refraining obesity which is very common these days.",
        "In addition, a sound mind needs a sound body. Exercise not only helps to attain physical health but to nourish one\u2019s mental health also. This means children gain more confidence and develop decision making skills as they indulge themselves in sports activities. For example, children who do not participate in sports events in their schools feel difficult making a decision. It is observed that children who are physically more active are more confident in daily life as compared to other children.",
        "To conclude, I believe that schools should organize sports related events on a regular basis which should be mandatory for all the children. These initiatives taken by school will encourage parents also to make exercise mandatory for children on a daily routine. In the growing age children need both the curricular education and the extra- curricular education. Physical and mental fitness develops confidence in children which is the need of today."
