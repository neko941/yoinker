        "People have different views about the causes of the worsening of children behaviour. In the following essay, I will discuss both sides of this issue as well as give my opinion.",
        "On the one hand, it is considered by some that, in contemporary societies, school do not disciplune students in earnest as they were used to do. In other words, in the first half of the last century, the education was much more strict. Taking Italy as an example, it is reported by many writers how teachers were used to adopt corporal punishments until the late 1960. As a result, in order to avoid any physical or psycological suffering, girls and boys were habituated to behave both in and outside the class.",
        "On the other hand, I would argue that parents are to blame for the deterioration of behavioural standards among young people. By way of explanation, nowadays most husbands and wives pay less attention to the way in which their pupils grow up than previous generations. For example, much current research shows that in the last few decades, having the digital era revolutionated the daily living, the time spent on parenting has dramatically decreased, whereas people indulge longer on computers and smart-phones. Consequently, the younger ones do not receive enough directions to become responsible members of the community.",
        "In summary, both sides seem to have some sounds arguments. However, I am of the opinion that parents are the main responsible for the worsening of the children behaviour."
