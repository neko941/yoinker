        "Now, turning to the details, in the hotel and catering, most of the workers used to be much younger in 1998, and they were under 26 calculated 25 & 64. In 2006, the majority of workers were under 46, counted 21,303. While only 7544 people over 46 used to be worked in hotel and catering service. Similarly, the majority of workers were junior in the building sector, they were counted 112,565 in 1998, while the number decreased dramatically in 2006. In every age, the number of people worked in the building and construction in 1998, decreased in 2006.",
        "It can be seen that technology was the popular job sector among the age group 26-35. In 1998, 63889 people would work in technology, while the amount rose significantly at 454,375 in 2006, and this was the sector where the highest number of workers involved in comparison to other sectors.",
        "In 1998, the almost same number of people chose to work in the education sector in 36-45 and 46-56 age groups, and there was not that significant change in 2006. Although, people used to like to work in education who were over 56."
