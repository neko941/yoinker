        "Plants and animals play crucial role in maintaining the nature. However, there are some negative effects of individual activities on flora and founa. While, some people think that steps should be taken to change this phenomena. This essay will discuss both the views in the subsequent paragraphs and also provide my rational opinion in conclusion in an efficacious way.",
        "To commence with, some developed nations kill animals for making luxurious daily use items for human beings such as belts, clothes and shoes. Consequently, it is the cause of extinction of a number of animal species. For instance, numerous animals are killed in order to make sources for individuals. Excess rate of animal deaths leads them to extinction. Moreover, plants are destroyed to use the space for urbanization, such activities can spoil the environment. As a result, wild animals will lose their habitats and they can come to cities and it is harmful for masses. For example, plants cut off by human beings and animals who have shelters on them will become homeless and they search for home and can come to human houses.",
        "On the contrary, animals and plants have significant role in making the balanced nature. Therefore, some important steps should be taken by the government to protect them. Primarily, authorities should impose panalities on hunting the animals. Because, animals are the essential part of the environment. To demonstrate, people who hunt the poor animals should be penalized for hunting and killing the animals.",
        "Furthermore, cutting the plants should be restricted by government in order to keep the environment green. To illustrate, cutting the trees should be banned, and individuals should appreciate the greenery.",
        "To conclude, although some people opine that hunting the animals and cutting the plants is essential for the fulfillment of human needs but it also plays the role in balanced surroundings. Hence, government and individuals should save animals and plants in order to make safe environment."
