        "Famous people as supermodels and movie stars nowadays or in the past, they used to receive so much money comparing with other people who are assumed to do more important jobs as doctors or engineers. Moreover, they live a luxury lifestyle by just work for two or three month in the year.",
        "However, due to the luxury and the empty life some of them get depressed.furthermore, some of them commit suicide such as Marilyn Monroe. She was a super star when she decide to end her life.In fact, many of them think because  they have everything , so nothing seems interesting anymore.For example, in the past the used to enjoy their birthday party. Espeically gifts, but now they can just buy what they want .",
        "On the other hand, being a famous person mean that you have to be so careful in the way you talk, clothes, even the  way you eat.Aswell,  you have to be nice with people who always asks for photos with out considering your feeling.Besides, sometime they just takes pictures without any permission. despite that , public believe that is part of being a celebrity and I partly agree with that but. Also, I believe that even Celebries need some privacy.",
        "In conclusion, being Celebrity it dose not mean that every thing is allowed, as a famous person and a role model they need to behave well.In addition, we still have to thinke that all these celebrities are huomns and some time they  make mistakes.also, we have to respect their personal space."
