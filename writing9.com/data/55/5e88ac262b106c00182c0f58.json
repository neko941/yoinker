        "It is true that private-for-profit medical practices are becoming popular for the public; however, some people claim that healthcare services ought not to be operated by private organizations. In my opinion, although this kind of services may be expensive and sometimes provide poor medical services, their current and future benefits exceed any damage that they may cause for both individuals and society.",
        "There are two main reasons why private medical systems should not be operated in the healthcare sector. First, patients often have to pay exorbitant costs to receive their services. In fact, since governments do not introduce restrictions on such costs, many private owned hospitals set high fees for services such as prescriptions charges or using high tech machines in the operating theatres. As a result, the costs of treatment in a private institution are more likely double or triple those of a public hospital. Second, a minority of private-making companies tend to focus on maximizing their profits rather than improving the public health. This means that these clinics or hospitals may only employ less qualified and less experienced medical practitioners to increase their revenue.",
        "Nevertheless, despite its disadvantages, it is potentially more advantageous for patients and public health to maintain private medical services. With regard to the former, compared to community health systems, a majority of their counterparts are more likely to provide better quality services. For example, if people choose to undergo medical examination and treatment in a private institution, such as VinMec or FV hospitals, they will be arranged instantly to a private room equipped with advanced facilities. Also, private healthcare institutions could be a practical complement, or even a substitution for the public systems in less accessible regions. For instance, in mountainous areas in Vietnam, due to the appearance of private clinics, ethnic minority groups could receive primary healthcare at present.",
        "In conclusion, in spite of some certain drawbacks of private healthcare systems, I believe that their advantages can outweigh the disadvantages because of the convenience in term of its provided services and the benefit of improving nation\u2019s general health."
