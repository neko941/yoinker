        "Many argue that virtual games are a bad influence on kids development, even though others state that can help them in different ways. It is agreed that games can provide a way of learning which varies from any other. This essay will, firstly, describe some upsides of  the computer entertainment industry, and secondly, it will take a look at one of the most important disadvantages.",
        "The effects that gaming can have as an educational resource for children, especially in primary school, is sometimes overlooked by many people. In other words, having games technically developed to attend educational topics such as history would make kids at school much more interested in the subject. For instance, a trial made by the Primary School of Bad Segeberg in Germany, stated that after using new computer games based on virtual reality to interact with historical concepts, more than 60% of the students described the classes as \"fun\" and \"productive\".",
        "On the other hand, games also have some drawbacks. Maybe the most relevant one is the lost of focus by the children instead of concentraiting themselves with an activity given. This is mainly because children tend to look at games as an entertainment that can be easily played during several hours. A research made by the University of Cologne stated in 2016 that 85% children who played more than 2 hours of console or computer games a day, had difficulties on finding motivation to do homework or other activities.",
        "In conclusion, even though many could look at the downsides of these resources and judge the bad effects these may have on a children\u00b4s educational motivation, a good manage of gaming industry could be also used to teach kids in a more interactive way than ever before. And who knows, the reults might even be better that someone could expect."
