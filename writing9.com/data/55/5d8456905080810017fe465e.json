        "In this contemporary era, people moving to abroad for Job has become fascinating popular.  Currently individuals are going to International countries for job purpose. Few people think this can have positive affect on children while other thinks it can have a negative impact. In this essay, I will argue on both the scenarios and give my point of view.",
        "Although, numerous people moving abroad for a good purpose; leaving children unhappy in some cases. They miss their own country and city there have been living. They feel lonely as there are use to live in a home country, surrounding their relatives and friends. This happens because some children are not get adjusted to a new environment easily. For example, huge difference in the weather, new living habits, unknown people to look around, new languages and many more things one has to go through while staying alone in other countries.",
        "On the other hand many people get use to new environment easily. For most of the individuals moving to other countries plays a vital role. It completely changes their standard of living and gives a positive impact to children. Many children mingle easily with other people and new location. In this case, there have numerous advantages on their lives. For instance, children and adults have good opportunity to learn new things which prepare them for their future.",
        "Furthermore, from my perspective going aboard can lead many advantages for a family. For example, they start living by their own without depending on others and started learning new technologies at work and many more new things around them. One of my best friends moved to Canada with their children and got adjusted very easily and is jubilant staying there.",
        "In conclusion, even though there are many obstacles moving to abroad, but there are always many merits for the whole family. In my opinion, I believe that moving abroad is a good choice for a person that gives many benefits to his family."
