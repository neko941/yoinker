        "They reason why we work hard may depend upon many factors such as gaining more knowledge through manual work, or as a personal interest in the work domain but the main intention I would say is ultimately to earn more money. In today's day and age money is the only thing that matters most because survival depends on it and to earn money one needs to work hard.",
        "It was not this kind of scenario say some 10 - 20 years back, people used to work hard even then but just to earn enough money to support their families or have 3 meals a day. Working hard is always been a trait in humans, and because through this hard work  we have reached  at this level of technical advancement. For instance, in a recent discovery an image of black hole was developed by an MIT student and it was a 6 month long process and it consumed almost 5 terabyte of data. When interviewed, the student never stated that money or fame was the aim for this achievement rather her aim was to get the image itself and that gave her happiness.",
        "Nowadays, not everyone is enthusiastic about working hard for passion, rather money has become the main focus. Materialistic is what we have become. Working day and night just to make future secure but not living the present while some people forget friends and families in order to achieve the target money. Another reason is the living cost, since the economy is growing it has also increased the standard of living making it difficult for many people.",
        "To conclude, we humans always used to work hard but money was not always the reason. What comes first is health and then wealth."
