        "Recently, the world was hit by a pandemic which made us realise that many professionals can work from home instead of going to crowded offices. This trend has both advantages and disadvantages to the workers and Employer.",
        "Firstly,the employees during the pandemic were the most vulnerable group of individuals as they were working in closed places within a crowded areas. Due to this,the companies started to give the privilege to work from their houses which reduces the risk of getting infected. Secondly, the workers felt safe and also simultaneously do their job. The main reason behind working at home was the discovery of the internet. The internet made it easy to call or Vedic chat with anyone around the world. To illustrate, if the one working at the home can discuss with all the colleagues on the zoom application, in which all the members are in a single call. It also has an option to see participants on live cameras.",
        "On the other hand, it also has some demerits, the employer will compel their employees to work with no time boundaries. Additionally, the workers can not take leave because, they can work even lying down on the bed. Furthermore, sometimes employees get disconnected  if the internet service  is of poor quality. To exemplify, the internet companies such as BSNL or Jio have the less reaching capacity in  rural areas, the individuals working from rural areas find it difficult to complete their work.",
        "To sum up, the modern inventions of the internet have made life easier but even then, they cannot replace the natural working environment. It depends on the personal opinion to like or dislike this new life."
