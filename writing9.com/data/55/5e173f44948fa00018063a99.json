        "It is commonly believed by certain individuals that artificial intelligence robots are gradually substituting humans in jobs. While many laborious jobs may eventually be done by robots, jobs that would involve human interactions would not likely be carried out be machines. This essay will discuss why some jobs would not eventually be done by artificially intelligent robots in the future.",
        "Robots may likely replace labour these days, in jobs that require less human effort and delicateness. A lot of corporations would rather choose robots as they have higher efficiency and improve productivity thereby increasing turnover rate. This yields more profit in the long run. For example, a huge multinational in India, has began to employ the use of machines in their production line, as was reported in the times newspaper, it is said to have doubled their production hence an increase in share value and profit. For these reasons, these low efforts jobs would likely be replaced by robots.",
        "Notwithstanding, some human jibs cannot be replaced by robots, as these jobs require a certain amount of human relations which machines cannot provide. Machines, despite their sophistication, would never be able to achieve and interpret emotions and circumstances which has taken the human race many centuries to master. For example, in the health sector where empathy is important would not likely be understood by artificial intelligence. All in all, it goes without reason that these kind of jobs would not be properly served by machines.",
        "Artificial intelligent robots are progressively replacing humans in the workforce. Even though, menial jobs may be substituted by machines, jobs requiring the human touch could never be done with artificial intelligence. Ultimately, only few human jobs would survive this age of technological advancements."
