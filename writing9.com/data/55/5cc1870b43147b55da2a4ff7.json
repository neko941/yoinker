        "It is true that home education in which many parents begin teaching their children themselves at home has become commonplace worldwide. While this method of education tends to bring some advantages, I believe that the drawbacks do outweigh the benefits.",
        "On the one hand, there are some main reasons that lead to a considerable increase in the number of home-educated children. The first objection is that this mean of education provides opportunities for parents to take great care of their youngsters. When students take lessons at their own houses, parents can easily identify their children\u2019s weaknesses and then prevent them from having difficulties in studying. For instance, homeschooling students can ask their parents or tutors whenever they misunderstand lessons or have problems. The second reason is that home-based education is more convenient for families who live in distant areas with poor means of transportation because they are offered lessons directly at home instead of going to school.",
        "On the other hand, I believe that home education might bring more negative effects than positive ones. The first reason is that private lessons are usually prohibitive expensive as it requires one tutor for a particular field and there are often more than ten subjects which students have to learn. As a result, a family who has a limited budget cannot afford this way of education. Another reason why parents should not apply this way of teaching is that children cannot receive enough social experiences which they can be provided at school. If students just learn on their own without joining a study group, they will lack social skills and cannot get on well with the other people. For example, almost homeschooling students tend to be shy and reserved as they might lose the abilities to solve realistic problems."
