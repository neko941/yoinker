        "Since the inception of government and civilization, humans have engaged in various forms of public speaking. The current relevance of public speaking in the 21st century causes policymakers and education experts to debate, including this skill, as a curriculum add-on. This essay will examine the significance of including audience presentations and support this move as a beneficial decision.",
        "Implementing public speaking in the school curriculum holds value in two primary areas. The first of these areas relates to the improved academic performance derived from speaking in front of others. If a student learns a robust public presence through speaking, their stress will reduce in the current and future classes, and they can offer well-rounded answers through enhanced critical thinking skills. Slightly secondary to academic performance, the decision to provide public communication as a course embodies a valued administrative decision since it builds personal development. Numerous studies show that a clear, confident speaking voice fosters self-esteem, leadership, and confidence, which are all beneficial student attributes.",
        "The public should offer uncompromising support towards a mandatory public speaking course. Almost every human eventually engages in public speaking, and this course will provide skills to grow in stature, leadership, and personal development. These three skills allow students to differentiate themselves in life, business, and community. This difference occurs through influencing the thoughts of colleagues, friends, and compatriots, which inevitably creates more positive outcomes in academia, industry, and relationships.",
        "Although one could offer various reasons to impose public speaking skills on students as a significant action, probably academic performance and personal development hold the most weight. Every concerned citizen should place 100% support behind this decision since most parents would desire a child with improved stature, leadership, and personal development that would enable the power to influence others' thoughts and create a brighter future."
