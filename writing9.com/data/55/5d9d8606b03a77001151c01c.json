        "These days, animals of different kinds are major part of human life all over the world. Whether they get similar rights as people do and need not to be used unfair, or humans should use them to fulfill their daily requirements, such as consuming them as nutrition and investigations is a matter of discussion. As such, there are merits to both sides of the debate, although I am of the opinion that the latter proposition merits serious consideration.",
        "On the one hand, animals are the creation of God, so they must be treated well as the human race. Since they don\u2019t have the ability to speak and express their feelings, neither do they are bond to serve people, so it\u2019s our responsibility to take well care of them. For example, now days not only many people keep animals as pets in their homes, and provide them all the facilities they could, but many countries also created zoo\u2019s which are very close to nature like safari zoo in South Africa. Besides, there are many NGO\u2019s working in various parts of the world to protect endanger species and spreading awareness among people about the animal care. Therefore, they have been under good care and protection.",
        "On the other hand, animals are the blessings, and they are here to feed us and take advantage of this creation in all possible ways. One of the reasons is that animals are the biggest source of food for humans in the shape of meat, dairy and other byproducts. For instance, meat and milk are the best source of proteins that a person requires to fulfill their daily dietary needs. Another reason is they can be used to learn more about nature; animal\u2019s biological function is very close to humans, thus more deep study in this regard can be more beneficial in the field of medical science. For example, frogs are being used in medical colleges to teach students about the human body function, since their immune system is almost same as us. Hence, it is apparent why many are in favor of utilizing animals for human necessities.",
        "In view of the arguments outlined above one can conclude that the benefits of using animals for numerous purposes to accommodate human needs are indeed too great to ignore, provided that we also need to take care of them."
