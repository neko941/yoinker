        "The chart below shows information about the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) one person releases into the atmosphere which is collected from the UK, Sweden, Italy and Portugal from 1967 to 1967",
        "At first in 1967, there were more than 1,5 tonnes of CO2 per person discharged in Portugal, 4,2-tonne in Italy, 8,8 tonnes of gases in Sweden and the highest one was the UK with 10,4 tonnes of carbon dioxide per citizen. ( The UK and Sweden have the most emissions of the 4 countries with about 10,4 tons and 8,8 tons respectively in 1977, 4 times more than Italy and 5 times more than Portugal). While other countries\u2019 gas releases increased to an alarming level in 1977, the rate in the UK stabilizes and  tended to decrease.",
        "From 1977 to 1997, the trend of carbon dioxide emissions had two different ways. The first one which had the increasing rate, the developing countries tended to go up include Portugal ( from 2,1 to 5,3 tonnes) and Italy (from 6,1 to 7,8 tonnes). Whereas, in Sweden, there was a sudden fall of 6  tonnes and 8,8 tonnes in the UK. Lastly, the figures for Sweden and Portugal were at about 5,7 tonnes while they  reached about 8 tonnes in both Italy and UK in 2007.",
        "Overall, the inhabitants of the UK are responsible for the highest discharge of all time. ( At the downward trends are considered to be connected with the changes is economic development and high-, tech inventions which reduce   carbon dioxide)"
