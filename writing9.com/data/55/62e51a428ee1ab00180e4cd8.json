        "Our lifestyle has indeed been changing with the advancement of technology, which converts our face-to-face contact into a virtual online process, where people can do the shopping, finish their work, and communicate without physical contact with other people. It seems to me that this trend has given enormous benefits to society in terms of the environment, time, and convenience.",
        "One main benefit of using the internet for working, shopping, and communication would be a decrease in the amount of transportation because there is no need for face-to-face contact. This would result in lowering harmful gas emissions, which consequently leads to a cleaner environment. Additionally, dispensed commuting time could add additional free time for individuals, which could be spent on various activities with family, inviting or visiting friends. This would eliminate fears of social disintegration, which is claimed as a result of the internet. Another important merit of using the internet is the ease of transferring data regardless of its size or distance between sender and recipient, which could not be possible in decades ago. this helps different institutions or individuals to exchange information smoothly.",
        "However, there are some fears erupted from the negative impact of the internet on social human bonds. This could possibly happen due to the lack of contact that resulted from excessive use of technological advancements. Moreover, the negative effect of internet addiction on people\u2019s mental health,  which costs billions to many countries to treat affected individuals. These fears, however, as mentioned before would be reduced by using the extra time that the online lifestyle provides  to us. This extra free time would strengthen our social human bonds and improve our mental wellbeing.",
        "In conclusion, using the internet instead of physical contact in shopping, working, and communication has given many benefits. An eco-friendly lifestyle as well as adds more free time for individuals, and the ease of transferring data through the internet. Because of all these merits, I believe that it is a positive development, and any fears of social disband and mental health can be tackled by spare time provided by technological advancements."
