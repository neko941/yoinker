        "Nowadays, people are facing with many dangers, one of them is criminal such as violent crime, pick-pocket and kidnapper. In order to cut down on the number of crimes, many people suppose that we should lengthen the prison sentences, whereas others believe that there are more effective solutions.",
        "On the one hand, there are a variety of reasons why doing other things is more practical to reduce criminals. Firstly, some prisoners keep doing bad things after being set free and they could be sent back to the prison or they could do anything  to run away before being caught again. This might threaten peoples\u2019 safety. Secondly, some people who have an extremely poor and live in very reduced circumstances, they have to become bad people and commit a crime, indeed they do not want to. Therefore, we could have other solutions, for example, we should educate people well since they are at school as they could have either enough knowledge or good health to improve their lives. Additionally, we must teach children what they must do to become good people and especially what they must not do, if they do then what they will be punished. Moreover, the job market now is very competition so the unemployment rate is high, government should provide jobs for those who cannot find a job to make end meets. Besides, some people do not have a good physical health or they are not well-educated, so that they could not find a job, the government should provide them an amount of unemployment compensation. In result, all people could live on their own without commit to a crime.",
        "On the other hand, expanding sentences is beneficial in some ways. Firstly, when dangerous prisoners are kept in prison for a long time, life of normal people could be safe. Secondly, as long as the judgement arbitrate strictly, the citizens would be scared and avoid doing bad things.",
        "By way of conclusion, it seems evident that both lengthening sentences and carrying out other better solutions have their own advantages to reduce crimes."
