        "Crime is rising at an alarming rate in the contemporary world. To curb the problem there is a school of thought that says capital punishment can help in overcoming the crime while others say that different methods should be implemented. This essay intends to discuss both the views and will conclude about why I believe that depending on the crime punishment should be given.",
        "On the one hand, the exponential rise in crime such as murder, snatching, and rape are making people fear-stricken. Consequently, judicial execution is being considered as the only solution by some masses. For instance, crime report in India says that, one rape case is registered every day, more than a dozen reports on chain snatching are seen who have either snatched, tried to snatched or nabbed at the time of snatching and people are killing each other on issues such as money, property, wealth and dispute in the family. Therefore, people feel unsafe even in their own homes, and strict actions can only fear of death can prohibit the rise in crime.",
        "On the other hand, there are several other ways of punishing the convict that can help in reducing the crime rate. It follows that life imprisonment or at least twenty-four-year imprisonment can do all the good to the people. For example, a serious offense committer should be given immediate life imprisonment, which will halt the crime to some extent. Whereas, offenses of stealing and trafficking should have imprisonment of twenty-four years. As a result, it will not hurt the moral sentiments of the people and subsequently serve the purpose of creating fear among the criminal minds.",
        "To conclude, a rapid rise in crime is considerable in the era of technology. I believe that capital offenses should be there for rape committers and child sex abuse otherwise life imprisonment needs to be implemented for every other type of crime. This essay discussed why capital offense is imperative to create reduce crime while discussing the opine of those who think life imprisonment deals criminals in a better way."
