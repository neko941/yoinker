        "No doubt ideas and attitudes towards some aspects change with age. Sometimes it creates conflicts between two generations and there are a lot of problems due to this, which I am going to discuss in the upcoming paragraphs.",
        "To embark upon, when a person grows old it is but natural that his thoughts change. For example, when we were kids many of us refused to eat green vegetables. As we grew older and learned about the benefits of veggies, we started eating them. Other differences are about the choices of younger and older ones. For instance, while youngsters like to wear bright coloured clothes, seniors prefer light colours. Likewise, young people can be quite rash but seniors think twice before taking decisions. Often times parents want to impose their beliefs and value systems on their children while the kids want to follow the global culture. They want to follow the latest trends. Moreover, parents force children to choose career of their choice, but children like to walk on the untrodden path and explore more opportunities in that direction.",
        "All the differences mentioned above are the causes of many problems. First, children start disobeying their parents  and ignore their valuable guidance and land themselves in trouble. They are of the view that parents belong to older generation and cannot understand their problems and issues. The second problem is that youngsters leave their parents due to these generation gaps and to pursue their profession. This in turn is detrimental for both parents and youngsters. Both of them start living monotonous lives and are deprived of the much wanted love and affection. What\u2019s more, this deprivation increases their stress levels and stress is the root cause of many heath related issues.",
        "To conclude, generation gap cannot be wished away; however, it can be bridged to a great extent if parents and children try to understand each other\u2019s perspectives."
