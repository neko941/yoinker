        "It is often argued that governments should allocate more resources and fundings to defense but less on social benefits to ensure citizens\u2019 safety. I strongly disagree to this statement as wars rarely happen in today\u2019s society and it may only have little improvement regrading to the defense.",
        "In today\u2019s society, it is uncommon that wars will happen between countries. However, a majority of the people in some developing nations died owing to starvation and polluted water supply rather than wars. In this way, governments should not merely emphasize on defense, but also pay more attention to social welfare that can save more people\u2019s lives. Take the example of Indonesia, as many people are unlikely to access clean water supply and food, they may suffer from diseases or even death.",
        "Another reason is that it may have little improvement on defense. As weapons and planes are extremely expensive, some developing countries can only buy one or two latest weapons which cannot bring great improvement to the defense. On the contrary, if governments allocate the same resources on public health and education, this can greatly boost the economy as people may find promising jobs with decent salaries in the foreseeable future. Take the example of Africa. The authorities have spent millions of US dollars on weapons produced by the US with only little effect on defense.",
        "In conclusion, as wars rarely happen in today\u2019s society and it may only have little effect on the defense, I strongly disagree that governments should allocate more resources and fundings on defense instead of social welfare."
