        "It argued that younger people are more eye-catching than the older generation in trading activity or in the office. People can not decline the reality that young people are more attractive than the older generation in several aspects such as communication skills and body.",
        "Nowadays, all aspects of the universe have been changed including in business or office. Recently companies are pushing themselves to hire young generation to their office, it can happen because of the young adult is more useful than the older. For  example, companies need a person who has a lot of energy to obtain their market target. As evidence, some research said that companies that have a numerous number of young adults  can reach their target.",
        "On  other hand, the physically aspect is one of the main factors why capitalism believes that the young generation is more attractive than the past generation. The young generation has a good body shape for hiring customers and is more energetic than the older one. To take an example, in the growth of the technology era, people have much pressure than in the past, and it can be followed by the older generation. As a result, young employers are more needed in this era even though the older workers have much experience.",
        "To sum up, I believe that the younger generation is more attractive and useful in trading activity or in the office. If companies want to reach their target, they should regenerate their workers from the older to the younger."
