        "In recent years, there has been an increase in the number of e-books published in comparison to paper books. Whilst many believe that this a progressive step in the right direction, others believe that it is not. In this essay, I will discuss both sides of the argument at hand.",
        "One of the most significant benefits of e-books is the reduction of paper used. As e-books are online and do not require a paper medium, it can help reduce deforestation. To illustrate, in order to produce paper books, paper is needed, this paper comes from trees which are cut down to in order to create paper. Furthermore, these trees are homes to many animals and often can lead to the loss of habitat for them. However, with introducing e-books, there won\u2019t be a demand for paper books which will result in a reduction of the trees cut down.",
        "On the other hand, without paper books, people will spend more time starring at their devices in order to read. This can often lead to eye problems due to the continuous exposure to the screen light. For example, many people find that after using their electronics for an extended period of time, this results in headaches and eye pain. In addition, doctors have always warned that children should not be introduced to devices at young ages. If books continue to decline then there would be no choice but to use these devices for them to learn to read, resulting in harmful effects for their health.",
        "In conclusion, although some view the downfall of books an environmental benefit, others feel that it provides a risk to a person\u2019s sight."
