        "How to improve public health is debatable. Some think that building more sports centers is the way to achieve good health. Others, however, opine that its ineffective and other steps are necessary too. In my opinion, although, settling new fitness clubs is an effective tool to attain good health, but healthy eating and adapting active lifestyle are equally important.",
        "To begin with, it is an undeniable fact, if more sports facilities are available, people will be enticed to do regular excercises. Which in turn will keep them healthy and active. Due to busy city life, too long working hours, an office worker finds it hard to grab more courrage and head towards a gym which may several blocks away from his dewelling. This discourrages joining sports facilities, hence people prefer crashing infront of a television at home than going fitness club. If workout equipments are installed in community parks, people would be more likely to do physical excercises and as result comunity health wil be better.",
        "Secondly, dining at fast food restaurants has become a trend. Fast food caffes serve diet which is rich in fat and calories. It increases triglycerides level in blood and poses serious risk for heart diseases, obesity and other comorbidities. Hence, eating healthy, organic and getting rid of sedentary lifestyle is crucially important to acheive total well being. For example, international disease center research revealed that, due to chinese people preferably consuming vegetables and eating at least 4 hours before going to bed, has greatly reduced their chances of getting obese and has increased life expectancy.",
        "To conclude, people may vary in their opinion, but i strongly advocate a daily excercise, healthy eating and changing lifestyle will have paramount effective in improving public health, enabling us living in disease free communities."
