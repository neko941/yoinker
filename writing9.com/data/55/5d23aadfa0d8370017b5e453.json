    "question": "Climate change is a big environmental problem that has become critical in last couple of decades. Some people claim that humans should stop burning fossil fuels and use only alternative energy resources, such as wind and solar power. Others say that oil, gas and coal are essential for many industries, and not using them will lead to economic collapse.\nWhat is your opinion?\nSupport your point of view with relevant examples.",

        "Over a couple of decades, change in climate became a serious issue. In my opinion, this is because of extensive usage of fossil fuels for the daily needs.",
        "Pros of usage, As of now, most of the industries are dependent on them. Sudden stop of using them, may lead to closure of those companies. In this case, it can't be unavoidable. For example, If an industrial machinery is running on coal for energy and the supply was stopped then either factory should be shutdown or else need to replace them with machines which runs on alternative source. In either of the case, it incurs an huge investment and loss to the company. Secondly, Most of our transportation is dependent on oil. we don't have the one, which works on sunlight. For instance, if power source for them was stopped, then all of them will go in vain and create chaos in public.",
        "Cons, Usage of them create environmental imbalance. Extensive mining for resources, create an huge impact on the weather. This is because of high deforestation for mines. For example, we need to clear the surface area, in order to dig underground coal, which may create climatic changes in that area.Not only the mentioned one, but also pollution with usage of them. For example, Air and water from factory emission. Extension usage of them, may lead to rise in the global temperature. There are many side effects on human with the gas that are emitted from vehicles. For example, Breathing problems like Asthma, is one of them. In this case, Solar and wind energy, is the best alternative for the problem.",
        "In conclusion, I support the usage of wind and solar power, by slowly reducing the usage of Oil,gas etc and increasing by usage of the other sources."
