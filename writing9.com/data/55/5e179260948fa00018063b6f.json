        "Global warming is a matter of our survival. After the industrial revolution, we are constantly moving towards a global disaster. Melting of glaciers and changing seasons have caused severe damage to our resources.  The international community must take action to control the effects of global warming. There are multiple steps that we can take to protect the environment.",
        "The pollution caused by our industries is one of the main reasons behind global warming. Over the years, world leaders have come to many agreements to control our changing environment. However, much more practical work is still required to be done. Some of the countries are hesitant to play a role in order to solve this issue . For example Recently the US has changed their policy towards the global warming. They have decided not to be a part of a world treaty that was signed by the  international community to protect the environment. As leader of the free world, the US must lead the struggle, which is in the common interest of the globe.",
        "United nation is an authority that is working on this issue for years now. They also need to pass more resolutions and must implement its rules regarding global warming around the world. For example,  there are UN resolution specifically on the protection of melting glaciers and Ozone layer. However, the implementation of these laws has been very limited. The world must understand the ramifications of global warming and take actions immediately. Otherwise, the world can enter a phase of environmental crises.",
        "By looking at the above examples and arguments its is understood that world must take more action to protect our environment. If the international community does not play their role we can face the extinction of humanity and a global disaster."
