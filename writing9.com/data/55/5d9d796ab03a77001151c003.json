        "In the past in order people used smoke, hooting and animals to communicate with each other. These communication methods had many limitations and wasn\u2019t reliable. As an example, the messages were sent for short distances, the message was nt clear, and sender was not sure if the message was delivered.  At the next stage telegram and letters were introduced. In spite still some issues were remaining as before.",
        "Modern communication is a vast topic, which could be described in different aspects. People have moved on to electronic equipment as a medium to communicate with each other, having no limitations in the distance. These devices are embedded with various features and provide the facility of updating. Furthermore, the information sent through these communication medium is convenient, secure and respond in seconds. The capability of information storing facilities are maximized up to TB range.",
        "Comparing with modern communication, former methods can be neglected, due to lack of features. Communicating with new devices adds a cost, and internet plays a major role in most of the methods. Working with newer methods are easier and faster, which admit complements to modern technology. There are instances that malware occur, or information is dropped while the communication process is on but there are techniques, software and protocols develop to diminish them.",
        "Though there are a number of benefits in modern communication I agree with the necessity of letter writing. Considering the parameters such as, time and pool of storage, new methods get its priority. But, as we focus on security and for proofing documents, I still believed we cannot let hold of letters. As I summon up, modern communication and letter writing are necessary when dealing with information."
