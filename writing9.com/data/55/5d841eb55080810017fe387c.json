        "Dear Sir/Madam,",
        "My name is Madhuri. I am studying second year Computer Science subject in your college. I am writing this letter to appeal for new student ID card as I have lost my Identity card in college premises on Friday when I came to an attend extra class. I have been searching from two days and I am not able to find it.",
        "I am very unahppy and depressed about loosing the ID card as it is one of the paramount rules of our college to bring the student card along with them.  Besides, I have been facing many problems lately. I am afraid I cannot borrow the books from the university library without my student ID card as my  exams are coming in 2 weeks. It will be a terrible problem for me if I I did not attend the exams. Furthermore, I also requested our university transport services office about my problem as the transport in charge didnot allowed me to broad our college bus and I was unaware that students can not travel unless they have the student proof.",
        "And same with the computer department. I appreciate if you can approve a new student Identification card so that it will be beneficial for me to prepare for my exams as well as to use the university student services. I have filled in and attached the New ID request form walong with this letter. I hope to get my new ID as soon as possible.",
