        "The media shows us images of famous people on a daily basis. Their lifestyle is often depicted as glamorous and enviable, though clearly it is not without its troubles. This essay will discuss the benefits and problems that fame brings.",
        "Fame, and the celebrity status that accompanies it, is created by the media. A photograph of a top film star, athlete, or musician, can be very lucrative. Because of this, the paparazzi seemingly accompany them everywhere, hoping to get the perfect shot, and they can no longer enjoy simple pleasures, such as going to the cinema or eating out. If they do, they are mobbed or pestered for photographs. This inevitably takes its toll on relationships, because the loved ones of the famous are also a target for the cameras. Added to this, if we consider that celebrity heartaches and indiscretions are shared even more widely than stories of their accomplishments, the notion of being famous can seem a lot less desirable.",
        "Nevertheless, the benefits of this fame are also very clear to see. The majority of the news reports about film stars and elite athletes show them living a life of luxury. They travel by private jet, holiday on remote islands, and build enormous houses that give them back the privacy they have lost. If they want to see a movie with their family, they can even build themselves a home cinema. Clearly, not only do celebrities have few worries when it comes to money, but their wealth also means that they can easily mitigate the problems associated with their status.",
        "In conclusion, while being rich and famous does bring some problems, in my view, the rewards are more than adequate compensation for what celebrities have to give up. In fact, I very much doubt that those living in the spotlight would trade their place for very long."
