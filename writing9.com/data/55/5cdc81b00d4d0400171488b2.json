        "Nowadays, many students tend to take a gap year before going to university, going to travel or to work. Despite the fact that it brings tremendous advantages to students, I would argue that the drawbacks of this trend are outweighed by its benefits.",
        "On one hand, there are two significant advantages it can bring to young adults. Firstly, work experience along with many life skills, can be gained by students. By working in a company, students understand the working system in reality and they can try various types of part-time jobs which will motivates them, giving an idea of what career they would like to have in the future. Secondly, they can meet a myriad of new people with different levels around the globe. Making friends with people with different cultural backgrounds widens students' horizon, enable students to cooperate or share ideas with them.",
        "Regardless of these advantages, there are significant disadvantages it can bring to students' lives. First of all, students may not want to continue their study after quitting school for a year. They probably enjoy travelling or the time that they get paid off for hard work. If this is the case, most of the students will choose to keep travelling or working rather than studying; which may make them feel regretful in the future when they realize most of the job with high salary only hire employees who attain high qualification. Another downside is that, students need to get money from their parents in order to travel or to maintain their life. With a college qualification, it is even more difficult for them to find a job with satisfactory salary; therefore, their income is usually insufficient for them to use. As a result, they need support from their family which students may take it for granted.",
        "Under this line of thinking, although there are advantages of the current trend to take a gap year, they are outweighed by the disadvantages which I addressed above can affect students\u2019 future seriously.",
