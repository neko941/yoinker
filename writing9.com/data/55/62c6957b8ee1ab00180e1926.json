        "People living around the world in urban areas, waste their precious time due to traffic jams. This is a serious issue because it affects people\u2019s mental health. Whereas, there could be many reasons for traffic jams. This essay will focus on some serious causes of traffic congestion and as well as offer suggestions to improve it.",
        "Foremost, organizations, schools, and universities follow the constant timing to begin the day to perform  activities & work, which results in heavy traffic on roads. Moreover, shortage of public transport facilities and unstandardized infrastructure. Because of this, people choose a convenient and alternate way to use their own cars and motorbikes. Therefore, it may concern of huge traffic congestion, in order to reduce traffic on the roads government should come up with standard infrastructure and provide a sufficient public transport system.",
        "Also, population growth can be the cause of many problems. Traffic jams are one of those. For instance,  these days every single house consists of at least one car and two-to-three bikes in many states of India. Sometimes competition among the companies would be beneficial for  individuals. Cheap motorbikes and cars are also available in instalments. Many peoples are availing this facility. This can cause  traffic jams in the cities. However, the government cannot stop those businesses. But can implement some strict laws to control the traffic such as imposing heavy fines in violation of the traffic rules, police patrolling, organising signal timings and installing CCTV cameras everywhere in the cities.",
        "I must close, by saying that, both individuals and government are responsible to control the traffic issues in the cities. People must be patient while driving. Rash driving can cause  accidents as well as traffic jams. Government should upgrade the traffic rules and infrastructures every year in research of increasing in the number of registered vehicles and population."
