        "Nowadays, the rate at which adolescents across the world seek part time employment has been observed to be on the increase. While some countries consider this development as a right step in the right direction, others however, believe it should be discouraged.",
        "My opinion, as will be buttressed in the sequel, agrees this is a positive trend that should be embraced by all.",
        "Asides the prospect of an enhanced livelihood which indirectly reduces social vices in the society, getting engaged with part-time job at a tender age can be seen as an avenue to add values, exposure and experience which would come handy later in one's life. For example, the invaluable knowledge and skills I gained while working in an integrated farm during my undergraduate studies at the University come have become highly relevant in performing my current job roles more effectively as an Agribusiness Consultant.",
        "On the flip side, the argument could be made that young ones who have secured part-time jobs at their formative age tend to lose focus and end up performing woefully in their academic pursuit. Increased number of school dropouts across the globe has also been attributed to this phenomenon. A recent report on the BBC news channel further laid credence to the fact that more than 50% of young students who combine academics with work bow out of school untimely.",
        "In conclusion, with governments and parents taking conscious efforts to minimise the dropout rate of employed younger ones through awareness and campaign, this development should be encouraged especially in the developing nations as the advantages clearly outweigh the disadvantages."
