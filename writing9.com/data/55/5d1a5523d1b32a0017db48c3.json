        "In this era, arts play a significant role in children's life. Some people concur that children should read arts subject in their education while others believe that it is waste  of time and they should focus on important subjects like mathematics and science. This eassay will discuss both sides of  the argument in detail and provide evidence as to why art is an essential subject  for children's in their primary classes.",
        "Firstly, it helps us to show our feelings and emotions. With help of this subject, student's know about the history and get knowledge about their freedom fighters like Bhagat Singh.  Moreover, if school's make arts subject compulsory for students, then it helps to bringout the hidden critivity and with this tallent, they can get good jobs in near future. As an example, Indian painter Ramesh Sharma, got their name and fame from his artistic drawing skills. So, this subject is important for students.",
        "On the other side, some people believe that it should be an optional subject and children should pay more attention on other compulsory lessons. They thought if students pay more attention on this unimportant subject, then they did not get good marks in their examination. If they did not get good marks, then they will not survive in this compitative society. For instance, According to Indian Times, now days,  25% students did not qualify for the jobs as they scored less marks in their academics. That's why some people believe that it is a waste of time.",
        "Finally, I concluded, importance of arts subject can not be neglected in education.  As, it helps to bring out the hidden talent and art is what differentiate us from animals. However, students should study other subjects too in order to get good grades."
