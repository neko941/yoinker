        "With the rapid growth of modern society, human beings are using more and more natural recourses, lead to over exploitation, global environmental problem. Facing against the problem, results the opinion of which these problems should be handled by government other than each individual should have responsibility contribute handling the situation. To me personally, I disagree with the opinion. We individually should contribute to tackle the problem.",
        "On the one hand, environmental problem should be handled by government, because the government can provide experts who is knowledgeable in environmental fields. Also, by establishing policies to authorities of each living place, for example, banning people to throw rubbish on the street, can help reduce the environmental damage, too. Moreover, government can gradually force companies, factories renewable energy from solar, water, or wind power. With such control and availability, governments acts have a great impact on reducing global environmental damage.",
        "On the other hands, each of us should act along to change the current problematic environmental problem. Each of us, without any care to the environment can still ignore the rules and policies the government make, results that these issues will not be countered nor reduce its severability. Actually, it is up to us, to take steps to slow down and eventually stop the damages through awareness of our daily energy use, and have a care to the ways we can save electricity and minimize fossil fuel usage.",
        "Finally, I can clearly see reasons that the government should handle the environmental problem, but the government is made by us, without any consideration to act, help solving the problem, there is no way we can make any impact on the issues."
