        "It is often argued that voluntary charity works should be included in co-curriculur activities of high schools. However, many others opine the opposite. I do believe in the notion that voluntary charity works should be made mandatory for school-goers and I will discuss them in upcoming paragraphs.",
        "Working for a charity should be made mandatory at school level,  as it will instill a feeling of helping others. This is because the minds of the pupils are still developing and if they help others without thinking of having a barter benefit, it will make them a good person in future. For example, In a renowned School in Ludhiana, a system of donating \u2018One Chapati A Day\u2019 from all the school students is getting famous, as all the students bring a Chapati from their home and then give it to the Charity NGO which ultimately feeds the destitutes in and around the society. As a result, younger ones earns good reputation leading to welfare of the society.",
        "Moreover, Governments today are working day and night for the development of society , still there are many shortcomings faced by Government. If the volunteers join hands, then the society can boon in a much shorter time. For example, a famous park in Punjab was about to be built by the Government authorities, however, due to shortage of labour , volunteer NGOs ,which included teen-agers, came front and helped in building the park. As a result, People around the area got a new neighbourhood to spend time with each other.",
        "Hammering the last nail, it can be reiterated that younger ones should be taught to serve for the welfare the society at an early age and this can be made mandatory at school level so as to make them a better citizen and giving an overall benefit to the society."
