        "In this contemporary era, technology is revolutionising every aspect of human life.Due to advancements in the technology, a person now can explore and learn in a much easier way as compared to the past. In recent times, a person can learn through various sources.Some of the sources are Computer, Tv and different gadgets like tablet, mobile. Some people argue that watching videos on TV or computer is more educational than reading. However, I still believe in this era that reading helps more in learning than watching Videos on TV or Computer.",
        "The Habit of reading is extremely beneficial for an individual. If a person wants to acquire good in-depth knowledge about any topic or subject than he/she should read books by great authors.Reading improves language proficiency and vocabulary.Reading brings peace to the mind.It is an active activity and helps a person to increase focus and concentration in life.Watching videos on a computer or Tv distracts a person while learning.Students in schools are advised to explore by reading books rather watching TV or videos on computer.Apart from these advantages, It has less health implications.For example, it has less adverse effects on the eyes.",
        "On the other hand, some people are more comfortable in learning by watching videos on a computer or television.I also believe that watching discovery or educational videos on tv helps a person in developing personality.Moreover, in this modern era, lots of online free videos are available on the internet to explore and help people to improve knowledge in various subjects.",
        "Considering the points above, I fairly believe that reading makes people concepts more clear and assist people in learning in a better way than watching TV or videos"
