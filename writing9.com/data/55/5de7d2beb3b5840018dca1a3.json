        "Today, whether violence on virtual world has influence on our society harmony has caused a dispute. Among the people, there are some who strongly oppose any violent scene on TV or in games. Conversely, there are another bunch of people can not buy that opinion and believe it is not these fierce plots cause the violence problem in our society. Now, I wish to check both points, then give my own view.",
        "Nowadays, many people are addicted to competition games which involve in a lot of bloody and violent situations. Thus, objectors have sufficient reasons believing these inappropriate settings would affect people\u2019s behaviors, then damage social security. As an example, players indulging in military games often more likely to mimic the behaviors of roles in their game world. They dream of using the weapons in the real world, because an imaginary stuff can not make them satisfy. Considering the imitation is one nature of human beings, I really want to echo to this point.",
        "But people who oppose above view say that this claim takes the current situation too seriously and blaming the virtual world violence for all the matters in real world, is not valid. That is because we as humans have our own cognitions and behavior disciplines. Hence, we are not influenced simply by the cruelty and rudeness in a fake scenario. There is no doubt that we can identify the reality and the imagination, while detaching from the latter.",
        "In conclusion, I favor these people who oppose the violence in cyber world, because there are too many negative news about someone committed to crimes  due to their intentions of following virtual life activities. When games can not let participants feel content, it is possible that some people seek real stimulus and excitement in their real life. Therefore, I do advocate entertainment industry companies should reflect themselves, then make their products and services more harmonious and healthy for society development."
