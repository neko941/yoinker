        "I disagree with the statement that young people have no say in important decisions, mainly because there are in fact many ways young people today can influence the decisions that determine the future of society as a whole: they can arrange massive protests for a cause, they can make petitions which can have a big impact on society and they might even influence their parents voting decissions.",
        "The first major way young people can impact the future of a society, is arranging massive protests. If there are enough young people who believe in an idea, they will be able to stage successful protests that will have an impact on an important decision. For example: French students are known for holding very influential demonstrations which changed the way they were treated and this had both an economical and a moral impact on the entire society of France.",
        "Another great way young people can make an impact, is by getting people to",
        "sign petitions. If enough people sign a petition, the government will not be able to ignore it and will have to comply with it\u2019s terms. A friend of mine believes strongly that genetically modified foods should not be allowed to be imported into Serbia. Because of this, he actually brought a petition to a birthday party which demanded banning the importation of such foodstuffs in Serbia and all of the people present there signed it.",
        "On the other hand, a young person could influence important decisions through the votes of his parents, if he were still not old enough to vote. If he felt strongly enough about a certain decision, he would get informed about the various aspects of the situation surronding that decission. With this knowledge, he might be able to convince his parents into voting the way he would vote for such a decision. When it was time to choose a new president for our country, I was still not old enough to vote, but I really cared about this issue. So I really got informed about the whole situation and managed to convince my parents into voting for the person that I thought was best suited for the job of being the president of Serbia.",
        "As we look back on the various ways in which a young person can influence important decisions that impact the future of society as a whole, we see that there are in fact many ways a young person can contribute. It is because of this that",
        "I believe young people should be encouraged to take whatever part they can in order to influence these major decisions."
