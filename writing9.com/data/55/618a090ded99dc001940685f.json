        "I am writing to you regarding your plan to create a new shopping-hub in the city centre, which I oppose due to plenty of outlets are already operating for the locals in this area.",
        "The main purpose of my writing is to make you aware about the competition of the local outlets in the city centre that shopkeepers  are facing and their hardship.",
        "About my issue, as the city centre is already crowded with numerous types of outlets around. As a result, many owners are planning to close down due to the high competition from rivals\u2019 low-price offering; therefore, establishing up-market outlets will snatch market share from local outlets. Consequently, I am planning to protest against this development in the city centre.",
        "Alternative proposal, we face regular customers from the outskirt of the city, who share their experience about finding quality stuff in their residential areas; consequently, my proposal would be to create a mall in the old-harlow town for these people, which will surely provide benefits for shop-owners and customers.",
        "I am awaiting your response; otherwise, we will visit the parliament member if necessary.",
