        "Nowadays, the adolescents visit shopping malls as a recreational activity which may result in drastic effects. I completely agree that this recent practice is making youngsters materialistic and unhealthy.",
        "First of all, using leisure time in shopping centres tend to make people materialistic and extravagant. The teenagers are vulnerable target audience as well as psychologically and cognitively rather immature. Moreover, there is a trend among newer generation to show off which leads to competition in the society. Because of that, a lot of youngsters end up buying things that are not even needed which ultimately disrupt their foundation while setting them on wrong path. For instance, a survey in Australia, in 2010, showed that teenagers were buying jewellery, notably diamond rings or necklace, mostly to show off their status and how well-off they are.",
        "Secondly, while strolling in malls, one comes across a lot of food stalls. It is already apparent that the youth population prefers unhealthy dining options rather than a well-balanced and home cooked diet. Also, the food areas has very tempting sight and aroma which compels people to buy it. Not only it leads to more waste of money, but it also prones them to bad health. For example, in an interview, the OPTP ( fast food restaurant) manager, admitted that they have more sales in a shopping centre\u2019s food section than in their other branches.",
        "In conclusion, in my opinion, the rising trend of spending time in shopping malls among the youth is bringing unwanted effects such as spending money unwisely as well as opting junk meals."
