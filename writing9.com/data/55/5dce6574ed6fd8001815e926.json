        "Advertising, which is an essential part of marketing any product or service, has seen a massive growth in the past few decades. Some people argue that some commercials support certain ideas that against moral values in our community. I completely agree with this view. This essay will discuss how advertisements portray unethical and unacceptable views.",
        "Firstly, advertising companies support the idea that dark or brown skin is not attractive. Television commercials endorsing cosmetic products carry story lines that highlight this idea. Fair and lovely skin care product is a good illustration of how commercials impact viewers. The characters are shown to be devastated by their dark skin tone after which they seem to be happier and healthier when they use the skin brightening products. As people watch such commercials, they get the idea that certain colours are superior, affecting their self-esteem. Thus, such regressive ideas in today's society are totally unacceptable.",
        "Secondly, some commercials display sexist ideas. Women are displayed as sex objects when it comes to car commercials. Even though one can be satisfied that women are given space in commercials, their characterisations are degrading. They are shown to be characters who get merely attracted by a male who drivers expensive cars. In addition, perfume endorsements also display similar opinions, once again proving that women need not be respected as a human being.",
        "In conclusion, body-shaming and sexism are regressive opinions that some advertisements endorse these days. Given this situation, it is highly recommended that relevant authorities take necessary actions against these commercials and take a stand against unethical views."
