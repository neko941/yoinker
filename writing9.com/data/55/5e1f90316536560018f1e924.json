        "Students nowadays can work under some companies for not a long period of time, and that is one of the education approaches. However, they do not get paid for their working hours. Personally, I advocate that both pros and cons of this statement are equal. This essay will elaborate that more with some examples.",
        "On the one hand, the advantages. Undoubtedly, experiencing new challenges in life will always benefit young people to have ample sophisticated skills and expertise. For instance, working at libraries or bookstores can encourage students who have interests in writing to flourish their writing skills; as well as increase their knowledge especially when they are surrounded by various books. Therefore, working as a student is a genuine opportunity to improve one's self in life, and to acquire the key skills before getting a real job.",
        "On the other hand, as the aforementioned advantages, there are likewise some disadvantages, such as companies' utilization for students. Some companies can take the advantage of the fact that the students are working for them with no payment, as a result they might make them excessively working in this short period of time, and with no doubt it will cause a detriment on students physically and mentally. In addition to that issue, working while studying can affect students' grades negatively because it can take the time that they should spend on studying and enhancing their academic performance.",
        "To conclude, I believe that this process of students work for companies can be equally positive and negative and that depends on different factors."
