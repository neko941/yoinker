        "A group of individuals are of the opinion that product marketing encourages us to purchase items that are irrelevant to us. However, another group believed that marketing informs us about current items that might have a positive impact in our lives. This essay will give reasons why advertisements helps in informing people of current items that might change their lives and also with relevant examples.",
        "There are primarily two ways in which advertisements inform people of products that could impact positively in their lives. Firstly, people leaving in Rural area have limited access to information on some of the medical products they use. This is because they don't have access to modern markets or internet facilities. And also, some of them really don't know what and where to get some of these products. For example, medical doctors that practice in rural communities often do not know when the latest brands of medications is available until it is introduced to them by pharmaceutical representatives. Therefore, it is necessary that companies advertise their products in rural communities.",
        "Secondly, it is imperative to note that advertisements will enable people make a better choice of product. This gives people the opportunity to make a better choice on the kind of products they use wither at home or work place. For example, Pfizer pharmaceuticals upgraded from the conventional use of Ventolin inhaler to seretide inhaler. During the launch of the product and with better advertising, the superiority and advantages of seretide inhaler over ventolin was conveyed to both the distributors and the consumers. Product advertisement is necessary to enable people make a better decision when selecting a particular product.",
        "In conclusion, Advertisements is important in informing people on the impact  current products have in people's live and also giving them the opportunity to make better choice."
