        "Nowadays, our society is well developed and people are richer than ever before that allows us to spend more money to buy consumer products. However, although I agree that advertising plays a good role to motivate people to purchase things, I do not believe that it is the main reason.",
        "On the one hand, a good advertising policy has an impact on peoples' decision making process. Firstly, due to the prevalence of advertising, such as ones on the street, on magazines, or even online, people see them very frequently and the more often they see the items, the more they tend to want the items. Furthermore, those advertisements are usually invested a lot of money and are most likely to be very eye-catchy which can be powerful to attract people's attention. Electric devices, for example, are often advertised very stylishly and well-designed by professionals that highly encourages people to make purchase them.",
        "However, despite the obvious advantages of advertising, I still believe that trends and popularity can be a reason for consumers to buy the products. For instance, fashion industry usually lures people's attraction, with seasonal trends that change every season. As a result, shoppers are very motivated to purchase the goods to follow the popularity.",
        "Finally, probably the best way to make high sales is recommendations from friends and families. Since friends and relatives are normally the closer and more reliable information resources for customers and they tend to value the personal opinions. What's more, consumbers are highly likely to believe the opinions of their peers rather than the ones from advertisements.",
        "In short, I agree that advertising is a good way to make high profit in our consumer society, I believe that seasonal trends and personal recommendations from people's friends and relatives are more convincing."
