        "Many people have watched movies every time. Obviously, viewers can find films a different quality. Some people believe that this activity has more advantages, others find disadvantages. I think, if film a good quality, people should watch it.",
        "On the one hand, people like to spend their leisure time interesting. Some pictures could be a masterpieces, so time is worth it to watch and spend free time. In this case, it is a good opportunity to go to the cinema; for example, for a date. At the same time, what could be better to watch a comedy with close friends.  I think, it is good entertainment among them.  Moreover, documentaries can teach us something new without any boring books.",
        "On the other hand, people can waste time watching movies. Sometimes, films can be like a drags; for example, TV shows. I suggest, people could postpone important matters to watch their favourite show. For example, film fans prefer to watch movies instead chores; therefore, they need more time for family and work. In addition, sometimes people see a distorted reality on TV. As a result, they begin to believe in fake news and images.",
        "Nevertheless, today people have opportunity to watch movies in different formats; for example, people should choose 3d or IMAX format to see and feel all special effects. It makes modern films more live that motivate to watch movies more.",
        "In conclusion, it so important to feel the difference between waste time and watching a good movie. People can spend their free time watching movies usefully. I think, it is important to choose film accurately to do not waste time in a future."
