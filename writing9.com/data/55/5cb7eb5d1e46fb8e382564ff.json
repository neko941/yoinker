        "Recently, long-distance classes instead of several face to face classes in school since the development of the internet technology. In my opinion, the merits are far more than the demerits of the change.",
        "It is true that the atmosphere of the distance class is not as good as the another. It may reduce the quality of the training. People usually take the online class at home. Unfortunately, there are numerous distractions to study in the accommodation compared to study in the classroom. For example, if the new born baby start to cry, no matter what the parents are busy with, they have to put down the work and start to take care their baby. In this case, how could them concentrate on studying?",
        "However,  a large number of cons, such as reducing transport time and being more flexible, exit. First of all, the time cost in the transport for class is a kind of waste especially for employees. Except the working time, people usually don\u2019t have lot of leisure time what they can spend for education. Time is really valuable. For instance, it is not cost-effective to take two hour to drive for a one hour class when people just have 6 hours to sleep. Furthermore, people don\u2019t need to attend the distance courses in the particular time.  In this case, distance courses is a good way for people who don\u2019t have a fix schedule to get the qualifications from training.",
        "To sum up, even though people may learn more knowledge in face to face course, yet the merits of distance learning definitely outweigh the drawbacks."
