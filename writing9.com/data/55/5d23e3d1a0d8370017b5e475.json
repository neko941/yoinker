        "Currently, people are likely to buy products from big companies rather than from local businesses as the former ones invest massively in maketing and advertisement. This essay is going to expose the negative consequences of this situation and suggest some solutions to adress it.",
        "One of the major problems caused by purchasing no local made goods is the contribution to increase our carbon footprint and the global warming effects. Normally, the factories where the large businnes order their products from are located in remote countries such as China. So, they have to delivery their products either via airplaine or ships, for example. This shipping methods are significantly polluting because they release high amout of CO2 in our amosphere, this substance traps the warm of he sun and heats our planet. Furthermore, big companies effect negatively local communities by bringing about the closure of small businesses, generating unemployment and poverty.",
        "Governments has an important role to play in order to ecourage eople buy local proucts. They should subsidise local business by lowering the taxes they pay so that small entreprenours could afford their large competitors when it comes to pricing. In addition, small businesses should invest in marketing on social media. For instance, using facebook and instagram as marketing tools is cheaper and has a significant impact on sales, nowadays, since they can target their audience easily. In their advertisements they could highlight the positive impact of buying local products on both environment and community.",
        "To conclude, local productores are assets in comunities since they play a significant role in local economies. No to mention that they help to preserve the environment in a global scale. For this reason, people and governments need to be aware of their importance and support them."
