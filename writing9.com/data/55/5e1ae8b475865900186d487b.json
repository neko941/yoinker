        "While few experts believe that retirees should reside with certain people, whereas others confer that they must pass their life with their family members. In my opinion, living with their children would be the best idea. This essay deals with the former and later view, followed by a conclusion.",
        "To begin with, pensioners staying at old age homes do not become a problem for their family members. Since these individuals are sensitive, they require huge attention from their care takers, which might not be available from their dear ones. For instance, people are shifting to cities, leaving their parents alone in pastoral areas, which could affect their health. In addition, these centres are unde observation of trained citizens. As selected staff are taking care of the old age people, they are able to schedue their eating habits and stay fit under trained supervisors.",
        "On the other hand,some locals are againt it and consider that care of parents is their moral duty. While the aged citizens has accomplished their responsibility of nurturing their children, the children ought to take care of their parents. Moreover, these people would instill ethical values in their grand children. As the grand parents are free from all activities, they can teach the young generation to be a perfect human. For example, the youngsters are usually listening stories from their grand parents, which could stimulate them to be honest in thier life.",
        "In conclusion, although the experts think that specific atmosphere would be suitable for older people, I firmly advocate that they must stay with their family, as children must take care of their parent and even these people can teach the young children morally."
