Secondly, visiting these places provides the visitor first-hand information about the various cultures as they themselves meet with the new peoples and mingle with them. They learn about their values, rituals and traditions. Hence, expanding their knowledge about the various societies. Thirdly, spending holidays at those difficult condition places can be adventurous and could be a life thrilling experience.",
        "On the other hand, one problem while visiting those places is that there might not be adequate facilities to live thus might not be suitable to spent long duration. For Example, at some places there may be scarcity of water, hygienic food and other basic amenities. As a result, tourist may not enjoy their trip, rather they would be more focused on solving these issues. Another possible issue is that at few places climate could become very unkind like during summer the temperature could rise to 55C and during summer it can even goes to -10 C. Moreover, few places could also be dangerous. Perhaps, there may be wild animals which can endangered the visitor\u2019s life.",
        "In conclusion, while visiting places seem to exciting and but sometimes it can also be an awful experience."
