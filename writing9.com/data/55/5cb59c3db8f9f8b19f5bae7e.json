        "In recent years, there has been increasing interest in using public transport. While some people think that using public transport brings a lot of advantages to the society in general and to themselves in particular, others argue that they have to face disadvantagesss when using public transport. My essay will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using public transport.",
        "First and foremost, people should recognize that there are many advantages of using public transport. A very important point to consider is that using public transport may help to save money. This mean that people only pay about 7000-8000VN\u0110 for a ticket to move from this place to that place where they want to go.Using public transport is not as expensive as using private transport. Another point I would like to make is that public transport helps to protect the environment. This is because of the fact that using public transport such as trains and buses may reduce the amount of carbon dioxide.",
        "On the other hand, in addition to the important advantages of this problem, it has some disadvantages. In fact, people have this opinion because public transport are not as safe as private cars and some criminal activities in public buses or train such as pocket thieves are still being reported. This mean that drivers who control the public transport usually drive very fast. It makes passengers feel scared. An addition drawback of using public transport is that you are limited by the time schedule. This mean that you will be depended on the drivers.",
        "In conclusion, the above mentioned fact have outlined the benefits as well as the drawback of this issue. Its disadvantages should be taken into acuont . People should take advantage of the pros and minimize the cons of this issue."
