        "In the current day, humans and wildlife are both suffering from a lack of resources to support their lives. The debate is about spending the available resources to either protect the wild animals or compensate for what the increasing human population is consuming.",
        "Starting the first part of the argument by discussing the wild animal's life, since there are many species that are about to disappear from our planet. Many reasons are behind the possible extinction of some of the wild animals, for example,  unjust hunting, and  destroying the wild environment that they live in it. Saving the wild animals will need more than spending extra resources. However, it is about putting farm laws that works to protect not only their lives  but also to save their lands and the original environment from  industrial development. Moreover, teaching sustainability to a new generation is something that could save not only the wild animals, but it would protect the planet for  future generations.",
        "On the other hand, the growing human population is already using huge amounts of our planet's resources without control, which effect in an indirect way  wild animals' lives. Controlling the increasing population is a serious issue that effecting the whole world, not only the undeveloped countries. As a result, it should be on the head of the United Nations agendas, by giving it all the priority and working on slowing it down. A balanced population will not only save the wildlife, but it will save our lives as  humans  since it will increase the chances of education, and work, and reduce the crime levels.",
        "The resources of our planet should be used with wisdom to balance the life of both humans and wildlife. Because both lives are connected with a sold chain if one went down all of the other lives will go down too."
