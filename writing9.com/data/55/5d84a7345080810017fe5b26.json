        "In todays modern world many  students are migrating to abroad for the purpose of studies.However, there are people who think that getting admission into university is demanding, despite their financial conditions. I strongly agree with the notion that admission in a university is difficult for both rich and the poor.",
        "Nowadays there is a demand for masters degree because of which students are migrating to other countries.for a student to get admitted, there are some specific requirements. A student with a desired percentage can apply by qualifying the international language examinations like IELTS and TOEFL.Even after writing these examinations and during the application process the university gives preferrence to the native applicants not the internationanl students, even though if they are financially strong.Hence, people who want to pursue their further studies find difficult due to the above reason.",
        "Secondly , language also plays a significant role when moving to a new country.In other words, people who have completed their education in a non-english speaking country, these people find it difficult to understand. For example, Most of the universities in america and germany, the lecturers speak in a american accent and german accent which most of the indian students are unable to grasp.To tackle this issue the students should undergo language certification courses which would help them to understand. Therefore, when moving to a different country and to understand their accent will require time.",
        "In conclusion, when people want to pursue their studies abroad they will have to qualify examinations and also undergo language courses.Eventthough they got qualified , most of them find complex."
