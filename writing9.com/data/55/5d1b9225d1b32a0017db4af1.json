        "It is commonly known that high intake of sugar is unhealthy for the health of people. It is often argued by some people that it is the accountability of government to monitor and watch the amount of the sugar people eat, whilst others disagree and believe it is a personal responsibility. I totally agree with the fact that it is an individual liability to maintain a good health. This essay will discuss both points of view.",
        "It is clear that government have a responsibility towards the society to keep them in good physical and mental condition. Firstly, the government should tax more on products that is harmful for the health. For instance, when the product price will rise, people gradually will start buying other healthy products. Secondly, Government should publish ads in different ways to remind people of the risks in consuming high amount of sugar such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and blood pressure.",
        "However, it is also undeniable that person has a liability towards himself to well fit and in good health. To begin with, each individual have a different case than the other. Meaning that some people have diabetes as hereditary therefore they should consume less sugar. Also, people should find the substitute to cure their craving depending on the level they need sugar. This can be done by using artificial sugar instead of normal sugar.",
        "In conclusion, Sugar is a harmful substance if not eaten wisely. I personally believe it is the responsibility of a person to monitor his sugar consumption."
