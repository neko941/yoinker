        "Many hold the opinion that creatures should not be trapped in places other than their natural habitats. While others believe that this set up is advantageous for both the animals and people. This essay will explore both sides of this argument, followed by a reasoned conclusion.",
        "On the one hand, trapping animals in cages is an abomination of their rights and natural evolution. This is because, they are not made to live in captivity, they are made to roam free in vast lands and develop primitive instincts like predator and pray charactertistics. This is exempliefied by, tigers kept in zoos that are further released into the wild after decades of captivity. They become unable to hunt because they are accustomed to being fed everyday at a certain time, in addition to this, they often do not survive and end up dying from lack of basic animals skills.",
        "On the other hand, in some cases, it becomes an imperative for human intervention. Although it is immorale, but sometimes the mammalian at hand is sick , dying or facing extinction. Moreover, their only means of survival are with the aid of professionals such as, vets and experts. For example, the white tiger, who was facing extinction in 2003, has overcome this threat after multiple conservation schemes in Thailand and central parts of Africa. Through these schemes White Tiger's were put under a microscope, and transported to large field where they were protected and their reproduction was assisted. Overall, conserving their population, this can be seen in many more instances.",
        "In conclusion, i believe, if the creature under question is under no direct threat of extinction or dying out then it should not be put behind bars."
