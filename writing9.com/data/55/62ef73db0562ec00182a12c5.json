        "In this competitive world, it is not possible for any person to survive without proper remedy and good health. Some schools of thought presume that  currently many people choose medication and alternative medicines over visiting doctors. Here, I coincide that not selecting health takers' advice can be a positive development for some as a middle-class society can not afford the cost as well as dissatisfaction and high effect of medicine plays a vital role to avoid it.",
        "It is irrefutable that, fulfilling each need can be difficult for middle-class communities due to major costs which same way applies to consultation. To explain vividly, price and management of money are the main factors owing to which poor and middle-class families need to manage their finance as a result they pick self-treatment and home remedies. A recent survey revealed that 60 out of 100 patients having viral infection cure themselves on their own and do not consult doctors due to raises in vising fees.",
        "Additionally, society having dissatisfaction with treatment can be the chief reason for choosing another option. In fact,thoughts of having side effects and mental readiness sometimes change the vision and lead to avoiding therapy. Most folks nowadays are scared of side effects and pick self-treatment at home.",
        "To agglomerate, though visiting a doctor for analysis is a way still home remedies and using alternatives can be the best choice."
