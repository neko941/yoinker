        "The high incomes of celebs in the field of sports and entertainment have always been a matter of dispute. I disagree that doctors, nurses and teachers should be paid more than these celebrities. I shall put forth my arguments to support my views in the following paragraphs.",
        "No doubt that doctors, nurses and teachers are making a great contribution to society but the contribution of these celebrities is also no less. They provide us entertainment and inspiration and they also bring name and fame to our country. They are role models for the society and people follow them and listen to them.",
        "My second argument is that they have a very short career span. Most of the people in the sports and entertainment field start their career at the age of 19-20 and retire by 33-35 years. A doctor, teacher or nurse does not ever retire if he does not wish to. For example, my uncle is a doctor and even at the age of 94 he goes to his clinic for two hours every day. Whatever these celebs earn is during these few years and after that they face struggle. Of course, there are exceptions such as the great legend Amitabh Bachhan but such examples can be counted on finger tips.",
        "My final argument is that these celebs sacrifice their personal life completely and so they do deserve these high salaries. They cannot enjoy the common things of life like the common man does. They are always followed by the paparazzi and their children too always need security. This is too much price to pay for the high salaries they receive.",
        "To put it in a nutshell, I pen down saying that people in the field of sports and entertainment well deserve their high incomes. Their services to the society are as important as, if not more, the services of doctors, teachers and nurses."
