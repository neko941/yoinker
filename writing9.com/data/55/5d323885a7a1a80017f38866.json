        "Family owned businesses are thought by some to be the perfect way to manage a company. Despite its upsides such as stability and commitment, there are drawbacks to be taken into account .",
        "Firstly, one benefit of family runned business is that it offers stability and commitment. For instance, the leader of the business is often determined by hierarchy until an unforeseen event such as accidents occur.Consequently, this leads to stability as it goes on for generations. Commitment and dedication is also a given because it involves family and one is more likely to put in more effort to ensure success. Secondly, having common values is also a positive aspect of family owned business. It is more likely that a person and their family share the same views and beliefs on how things should be done which is very necessary for a prosperous business .",
        "On the other hand , one problem with overseeing a family  business is that family conflicts can arise frequently due to difference of interests ,as a result of this destabilization would occur due to bad decisions and resentments governing business decisions. In addition,  favouritism is also a very common negative aspect to running family businesses. It is often difficult to remain objective and positions are given to individuals who are not good for the job thereby damaging the business structure over time because managing a successful business means making decisions for business reasons and not personal ones.",
        "In conclusion, while some people benefit from being part of a family owned business, it can lead to family disputes and nepotism."
