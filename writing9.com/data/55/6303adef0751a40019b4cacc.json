        "It is commonly misunderstood that adolescents these days have a more comfortable life as compared to the past because of the advancement of technology, but it is the opposite in reality. The life of young ones is more complicated these days. In this essay, we will discuss the reasons why is it so.",
        "To initiate with, parents nowadays have more awareness, so they indulge their children not only in better school but also in sports so that they can have a career in that sector. For example, a child goes to school from 8AM to 2PM, then he has his game class in the evening for 2 hours and additional time is needed to do his homework. Thus, contributing to stressful life as no time is left for their leisure activities.",
        "Secondly, with the introduction of social media, children these days feel more competitive as they have to keep up with the latest trends surfacing around in order to not to be judged by others which further leads to mental stress.",
        "Additionally, students these days want to make their parents proud as a result, in order to prove their metal they work hard day and night contributing to a stressful environment.",
        "To recapitulate, I reiterate that, it is needless to say that the life of the wards these days is more complicated as compared to the past as they not only have to deal with the judgements of others but also have to work hard for their holistic development and to make their parents proud."
