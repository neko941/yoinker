        "Nowadays, transportation is one of our modern life problems, specially when people depend on their own cars. This assay will discuss the problems of car transpiration and some possible solutions.",
        "Firstly, the most obvious problem of depending on private car is the traffic jam. For example, old city like Damascus, it is very hard to go its downtown by your car as this city is very crowded with the old streets, markets and poor places for parking. As a result, movement of people will be restricted and suffering especially during an emergency such as a dangers car accident or a sick patient in an ambulance where they should be transferred urgently.",
        "Furthermore, one of the serous effect of car transportation is pollution. To illustrate, the capital of Iran, Tahran, is one of the most cities which has very high pollution since it is very big, crowded, and industrial city. In addition to the bad traffic jam and its affect, Tahran has high level of carbon dioxide and consequently high records of lung cancer and chronic lung disease.",
        "However, government and individuals must play a role to solve this issue. For instance the government can develop the facilities of the cities by creating new and wide streets and underground parking. Thus it can increase public transportation like bus and trains and encourage people to use it by making them more accessible and cheap. Also people can help solving this problem by using public transportation rather than their own cars in order to reduce the traffic jam and the environmental pollution.",
        "To conclude, depending on private cars make many problems but government and individuals has the role to do the solutions by development of new way to help people movement in the future"
