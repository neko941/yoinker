        "A lot museums do not come free, whereas others do. There are various advantages, or disavantages that people can argue for, however, I think the cost of disadvanges are greater that the opposites. This essay will walk you through to such opinion.",
        "One upside of having museum operating in capitalism is that they will have the revenue necessary to renovate the buildings, to cover up the operating cost, which, with a good management principle, can results in providing superior visiting experiences. In fact, people walk in the sites with their paid tickets actually expecting better immersional experiences than what they wouldn\u2019t expect from the free and public host ones.",
        "To put on a price tag for the people who visit the museums can make the museums less available for children. For example, a parent, who is taking a vocation visiting a new city, may not want to buy the tickets of the museum that they just randomly discovered for their children, simply because they did not plan for this extra spending. Furthermore, the children may cry and insist to go, so the parent have to pay. That whole occation could become the family\u2019s unhappy memories. Therefore, I think, by comparing the pros and cons, the downsides weight more.",
        "In conclusion, while many museums charge people to visit, people argue that there are side effects to that. Throughout the arguments laied out in this essay, I think that the good outcomes of such norm do not seem to trump the bad effects."
