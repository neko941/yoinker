        "The issue of large investment in space exploration missions is a source of controversy nowadays when there are many people think that important aspects of life which should be taken into consideration. In my opinion, I totally agree with the argument of reducing these missions would bring some various advantages.",
        "Firstly, less money invested in space missions allows more urgent problems could be solved. Homeless, diseases, starvation, environment are the serious issues over the world nowadays leading to many deaths and negative effects on our lives. However, these problems could be resolved with the cost lower than planning for outer space missions. Recently, a prestigious magazine has interviewed some economists and made a simple calculation which shows that we could supply enough clean water for Africa just by canceling only one space mission",
        "Secondly, if the number of crew flying to space increases, the risks to humans and the universe will also decrease. There are many evidences show that astronauts\u2019s health after a spaceflight decline. Weightlessness environment has caused variations in biorhythm which have negative effects on their constitution, immune system. In addition, today, there is growing concern about the threat space junk poses to spacecraft. This waste can not disappear in the universe because of gravitation of earth\u2019s surface, so they not only lead to pollution in the space but also have the ability to fall toward the earth making unforeseen danger.",
        "Admittedly, some scientists may claim that these exploration could help us find another living planet with pollution and global warming today. However, I think this argument is not convincing since it takes a long time to discover where humans can survive excepted earth. Instead, we should invest in some policies, solutions to reduce pollution and protect the environment by applying technology and science.",
        "To sum up, although space exploration could lead to significant scientific discovery, it is a better use of money to invest less in those missions and shift our focus to other current emerging problems"
