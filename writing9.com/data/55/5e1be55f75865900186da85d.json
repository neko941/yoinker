        "Medical Studies have shown that smoking is not only leads to health problems for the smoker, but also for people close by.As a result of this, many believe that smoking should not be allowed in public places. Although there are arguments on both sides, I strongly agree that a ban is the most appropriate course of action.",
        "Opponents of such a ban argue against it for several reasons. firstly , they say that passive smokers make the choice to breathe in other people\u2019s smoke by going to places where it is allowed. if they would prefer not to smoke passively, then they do not need to visit places where smoking is permitted. In addition, they believe a ban would possibly drive many bans and pubs out of business as smokers would not go there anymore. They also argue it is a matter of freedom of choice. smoking is not against the law, So individuals should have the freedom to smoke where they wish.",
        "However there are more convincing arguments in favour of a ban. First and foremost, it has been proven that tobacco consists of carcinogenic compounds which cause serious harm to a person\u2019s health not only the smoker. Anyone around them can develop cancers of the lungs, mouth and throat, and other sites in the body.It is simply not fair to impose this upon another person. It is a also the case that people\u2019s health is more important than businesses. In any case, pubs and restaurants could adapt a ban by, for example allowing smoking areas.",
        "In conclusion , it is clear that it should be made illegal to smoke in public places. This would improve the health of thousands of people, and that is most definitely a positive development."
