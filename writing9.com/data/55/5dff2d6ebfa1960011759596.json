        "(THE )Amalgamation of multicultural people in one country brings some questions. This trend not only makes people's lives more enjoyable through sharing different views, but also assists to thrive by sharing new ideas. I completely agree with this view ; this essay will discuss the benefits of co-existence of diverse cultures.",
        "To begin, when people from different countries and different cultures meet together in one country, their lives become more enjoyable. People always find unique cultural things more fascinating that are sometimes impossible to experience from the home country, but A mixture of a (numbers) NUMBER of nationals (make) MAKES it possible. For instance, The USA, the land of diverse cultures, is said to be the most happiest nation COUNTRY in the world (that's) WHERE people enjoy different cultures rigorously. In addition, people from developing countries generally prefer to move to developed countries where they can earn more money and live quality lives that makes them feel happy.",
        "Furthermore, the country, which is followed by A diverse group of people from around the world, (develop) DEVELOPS rapidly. Because only talented people with effective ideas do venture to settle in a new country, causing development in that country (more -REMOVE )rapidly. Canada for example, which is considered the most successful country in the world having been a (diversed) DIVERSE cultural system that makes sure the influx of talented people who are contributing in the development of the country in every way, like economical and technological development.",
        "To conclude, I believe, by sharing different ways of life and knowledge from a multicultural environment pleases people more as well as flourish the country."
