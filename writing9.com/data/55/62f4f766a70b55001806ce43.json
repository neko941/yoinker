        "The way how parents raise their children is highly controversial. Some people believe physical punishment is the most reasonable method of discipline. This essay will argue why smacking children is adverse.",
        "Legal guardians have the responsibility to raise their children to good and responsible citizen which is a huge duty. On the one hand some children show a really challenging behaviour for instance using unexceptional language and unrespectful attitude. Therefore, parents believe punishment is the method to discipline their children. Generally, they want to protect their children from wrong manner and decisions in life. Despite, parents quite often experienced domestic violence by themselves during their childhood and they do not know better. These few instances have bolstered their justification of smacking children.",
        "Research shows that spanking, slapping and other forms of physical punishment don't work well to correct child's behaviour and it is against children\u2019s rights too. Recent studies have also shown that those children are more aggressive towards other persons. Besides, this also can damage the relationship between the parent and the child. Instead of punishing them for misbehaving, parents should give time-outs and talk to them about correct behaviour. If parents do not know how to control their children, they must ask for help. There are therapist and support groups which are happy to help.",
        "In conclusion, the essay argued that physical punishment is unacceptable. In my opinion, this behaviour towards children is flawed and therefore, there should be way more education and support groups for parents. In"
