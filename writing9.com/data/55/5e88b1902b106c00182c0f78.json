        "In the last decades, the population growth rate is increasing dramatically, and this growth has created many needs in human societies. For example, many governments do not have the potential to produce the necessary food for their people so thy must seek help from other countries and the transfer of the food can lead to some disadvantages like negative impact on eco-system of these countries.",
        "Firstly, indiscriminate harvesting and indiscriminate killing of animals for food production have a lot of negative effects on the eco-system. For instance, many African countries are valuable resource for many years, and when people see their condition right now not only, they have economic problems, but also plenty of unique plant and animal species have become extinct. this can be considered as one of the irreparable traits to the environment.",
        "Secondly, food transportation requires the use of fossil fuel. Thus, this fossil fuel consumption can lead to air pollution that is harmful for natural environment. For example, transporting the huge amount of food needs thousands number of tools to transfer such as many planes and ships trailers and other vehicles. So, each vehicle can make a little air pollution and sum of these amount can make a huge air pollution which can lead to destroy the Ozon layer.",
        "In conclusion, however many people believe that the food transportation can help to people to save themselves, but in my opinion the eco-system is most important things in human life . So, regarding to thrive of technology the governments can use their own countries to support their people for food and meet their needs."
