        "Population across the globe is increasing year by year. This essay will highlight some of the major problems that are being caused by overpopulation and will also give suggestions on what actions could be taken by the government to control population.",
        "Some serious problems such as unemployment, poverty, lack of basic facilities and basic education which already exhibit in the present time are getting further accelerated due to increase in population. The aforementioned problems are a root cause of many other problems such as begging, theft, robbery etc., as a person who does not have a job to feed with his family, would then have no other option but to beg or steal from others.",
        "Apart from the above mentioned problem, economy of a country also gets an adverse hit with increase in population. Because of demand- supply imbalance, inflation rises and everything becomes difficult to afford for those with limited income.",
        "To control acceleration of the above mentioned problems, the government should take steps such as spreading awareness in people about the family control procedures as in many underdeveloped societies, people have no or very limited knowledge about methods used for family planning. Government should also run family planning schemes under which women should be given free treatment for family control procedures. Also, the price of family control products should also be very less to ensure its affordability. Another possible solution could be is that the countries which are underdeveloped should offer flexible immigration opportunities in order to create a balanced world.",
        "To sum up, overpopulation is a serious issue which requires immediate attention across the globe. If the issue continued to increase with time, the world will further get into recession."
