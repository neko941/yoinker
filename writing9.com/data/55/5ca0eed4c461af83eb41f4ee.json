        "Many people attribute that increasing the minimum valid age for commuting by cars or motorbikes would be the best way to keep the road traffic safer. Personally, I entirely disagree that it is the most ideal.",
        "The age has right to access traffic with machined vehicles should be limited for several reasons. The first one is that young people did not truely concern about their physical well-being. In fact, although they met the age standard, lack of physical strength could drive them to be out of their control on their own vehicles. This might block the traffic or even cause unexpected casualties. Premature perception is another reason. The young virtually have shortage of skills and experiences. Exposal to thousands of traffic flows requires them to possess the flexibility and sharp reaction. However, they are not skilful enough to manage to and this contributes to higher accident risk.",
        "However I would argue that there are effective ways to reduce the traffic accident. Firstly, heavy punishments have significant impacts on encouraging people to drive more safety. From that, people will avoid repeating the same offence unless they want to be fired a decent amount of money. Finally, the authority should release more strict regulations on granting driving licence. This could be done by bringing out more difficult driving test aiming to issue qualified certification. These expressed might be more feasible to alleviate casualty.",
        "In conclusion, although raising the lowest legal age is an acceptable choice, there are more efficient measures proposed to make road traffic safer."
