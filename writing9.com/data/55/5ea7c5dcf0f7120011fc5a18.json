        "oThese days, the job world has become very complicated, since the common and old idea of having to daily join the office has been already overcome. Generally speaking, there are so many possibilities in this field, that people might manage to risk and change path, following the self-employed way. However, the magnitude of people who are still working in huge companies and organizations highlights that this second frame, still guarantees many advantages. In this essay I will analyse both pro and drawbacks of being self-employed and suggest some food for thoughts.",
        "One of the main advantages of self-employment is that you are totally free to schedule your work time, following your needs. What I mean is that you can respect your daily plans since you do not have to join meetings or you cannot be interrupted by your boss, who is suddenly searching for you.",
        "Secondly, the self-employed are completely free to autonomously choose how to deal with their business and get rid of the hierarchical steps that relevant decisions should follow.",
        "In contrast, the self-employment is often an uncertain position. In details, if you have to take some important decisions, you cannot discuss with anybody and sometimes these situations left you with the drowing in feeling that can cause a lot of stress.",
        "Moreover, another major disadvantage it that in case of any troubles you cannot ask for help and you are completely alone in coping with them. In particular, you are totally responsible for each of your decisions and a failure could really damage you and your job.",
        "All the things considered, the self-employment could be a very stimulating perspective, but requires strongly motivated workers, ready to face with many difficulties. Personally, I think that many problems of being employed could be just solved by some weekly smarting work days and therefore some more open minding is necessary."
