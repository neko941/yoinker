        "In several parts of the world, there is currently a lack of students choosing to study science in universities and colleges. This problem happens due to some reasons, and it can have some adverse impacts on society.",
        "There are several reasons why favour University students are chosen science as their major. The most obvious reason is that  these subjects are usually modify called and demanding, which requires students to put much fought into the study for example my friend who is doing the course in biology said that he had to conduct too many experiments and complete numerous projects, which prevented him from having any free time. As a result, science subject seems to be less attractive to students compared to economics or business-related subjects.",
        "Another important factor is, as there are currently favour employment opportunities available for graduates in science fields, learners are less likely to decide to select this major . Instead, the 10  choose other subjects which allow them to find jobs some more easily.",
        "Ka shortage of learners in science will stand result in some negative effects. The first impact is that when favour students decided to learn about science, there would be a serious shortage of employees working in this field. This would lead to favour technology developments, which would also prevent improvements in people's life quality. For instance, it would be difficult for humans to produce newer smartphones with better functions.",
        "Additionally, a wireless significantly interesting number of students are choosing economics and business to study, but the number of job vacancies in these areas is limited. Therefore, many University graduates would have to face unemployment, which increases the burden on society.",
        "In conclusion, to shortage of students choosing science subjects is caused by several factors, and this problem might beating about serious impact."
