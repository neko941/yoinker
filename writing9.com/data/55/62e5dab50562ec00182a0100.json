        "In recent years there has been an increase in the number of students studying abroad. Some people argue that studying abroad is not necessarily beneficial. However, I believe that it may be one of the most beneficial experiences a person can have. Therefore, this essay will focus on showing how advantageous such a study is.",
        "Studying overseas has a number of advantages. Firstly, it may give students access to career opportunities in different countries. Many students find that they love their host country so much that they decide to seek work there. In that case, you will find that a local education will be precious when searching for a potential job in that country. Another benefit to studying abroad is the opportunity to discover yourself while gaining an understanding of a different culture. Being in a new place by yourself can be overwhelming at times, and it tests your ability to adapt to diverse situations while being able to solve problems. Thirdly, one of the major draws is the opportunity to study a foreign language. Studying abroad grants you the chance to immerse yourself in a new language completely, and there is no better way to learn than to dive right in.",
        "It is true that studying abroad has certain drawbacks. Apart from the fact that it is almost always more expensive than studying in one\u2019s local university, the effect of studying abroad depends to some extent on the individual. In other words, not all people who have studied aboard have found it an advantage.",
        "Nevertheless, although studying abroad does not work for all students, the advantages of studying abroad outweigh the disadvantages in most cases. Many of the benefits last students all their lives, offering a unique opportunity to grow academically, professionally, and personally while going on a once-in-a-lifetime adventure."
