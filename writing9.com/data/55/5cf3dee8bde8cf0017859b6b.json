        "Some commentators argue that physical qualities are different between male and female, which determines what jobs are suitable for them. While there were intensive debate to justify this view in the past, I disagree that it should apply to the modern society.",
        "Firstly, I would like to discuss distinct characteristics which affect the range of jobs open to men and women and which traditionally affect their choice of career. On the one hand, men are considered to be born with strength and bravery, symbolising for power. They are supposed to be suitable with such working environment requiring physical strength as military. On the other hand, women, especially those who are brought up traditionally tend to favour caring professions. That is why they are likely to do jobs involving taking care of children and the elderly.",
        "Secondly, I believe that the world of work has changed and there is no room for outdated attitudes towards capabilities of men and women. Both genders deserve equal opportunities in all careers. One reason is that changes in education has given women the same chance to gain qualifications as men. Moreover, they are able to reach the top in their chosen field by working hard. Another reason is that modern views have broken the traditional barriers, which effectively barred men and women from doing cetain jobs in the past: construction workers, truck drivers, soldiers in the case of women; nursing, cooking and cleaning jobs in the case of men.",
        "In conclusion, I would argue that sex discrimination at work today is not tolerated as much as in the past - either against men or women."
