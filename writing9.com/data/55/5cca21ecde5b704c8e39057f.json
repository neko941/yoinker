        "Acquiring a university education has become increasingly important in recent times. While some believe that colleges should teach more of the lessons and skills that will be useful in a work environment, others are of the opinion that tertiary education should focus on the course of study alone. In my opinion, the principal function of a college is to provide and equip students with the neccessary skills and information to lead productive lives and also to function maximally in their various work environments.",
        "Colleges should teach more practical lessons regardless of the course of study of its students because it provides a well-rounded education as well as making them more employable and useful in thier places of business. Furthermore, asides from allowing them to be able to draw inspiration from different sources, it also makes them adaptable to different situations. For instance, computer skills, public speaking and other interpersonal skills are mostly useful to gain employment nowadays.",
        "The notion that only the course of study should be focused on in universities tailors the minds of students to think in one direction which experts say can improve efficiency and skill in that particular field. However, this is not neccessarily true as it also breeds myopic individuals who cannot see the bigger picture. For example, a very intelligent scientist will not be able to pass his knowledge across effectively if he or she cannot relate well with others or speak in public.",
        "In conclusion, important skills that make people employable regardless of course of atudy as opposed to sticking to the major course outline is still a controversial topic. However, I am of the opinion that life skills should be a part of every course's curriculum in a university as the maim functions of such institutions is to produce well-grounded minds."
