        "Thanks to medical and technology advances in the current society, human\u2019s longevity has been greatly improved, which leads to longer working period. Although starting working life earlier seems to be a reasonable solution to the issue, it should not be considered the best alternative to act against the increase in life expectancy.",
        "One of the reasons to deny starting to work at a younger age is that people during that age are not sufficiently well-prepared for the work life. Firstly, being made to work when they have not reached 18 yet, teenagers are not fully aware of the society around them, making them prone to deception and abuse by their older employees. For examples, they can be forced to work longer hours with lower salary if they do not know much about working regulations. Besides, they have not been equipped with appropriate knowledge and employable skills in the related fields, which made them less potential from the perspective of the employers. Those employees can also reduce productivity and success of the corporation as a whole.",
        "Furthermore, people have not fully developed their physical status yet. This prevents them from working in the field where some specific health and physical features are needed. For example, working in the army usually requires a certain level of height and weight of an employee to make sure that individual can carry out some heavy tasks during their work.",
        "As a result, those young-aged candidates have to wait until they can fulfil all the requirements to apply for the job. Besides, if they insist to begin their careers, there is high possibility of some chronical diseases. These diseases can happen immediately now, which stops them from continuing their career or appear later in their life, affecting their health and longevity.",
        "In conclusion, starting to work earlier to cover up the number of years increased in human\u2019s life expectancy should not be encouraged. It can impose some negative consequences on the society and human beings\u2019 health status."
