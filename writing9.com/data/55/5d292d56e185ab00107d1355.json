        "The rapid development of modern technology has been a subject that attracts profound interests in recent years. Many people opine that the amount of time which people take to hang out with their friends has decreased because of modern forms of communicationsuch as email and messaging . This leads to many disadvantages on the society. From my perspective, this viewpoint is justifiable to a certain extent",
        "On the one hand, depending on using of the internet devices has made people more passive and lazier. in the past, to communicate with friends, people usually got together; which took a lot of time , though, helped to keep relationship. Nowadays,with the tools such as email and SMS human do not need to go out to meet each other. that they just sit at home is able to chat with friends. This does not consume energyin the bodies, which leads to obesity and cardiovascular disease.",
        "On the other hand, this reason is not utterly acceptable beacause this sophisticated forms of communication also offer mant benefits in social relationship. People living far from their relatives can contact them regularly without squandering too much time and high cost. For example, an Indonesian student who is studying in canada can tell his information by transmitting an email or a short message service to his parents. It is more efficient, faster and cheaper than he calls them by phone or send letter. Another advantages of information modern communication method is most people obtain simplicity to spread information or news to other population because message or text on email or SMS may be occupied , as the result, they are not necessary to retype again the similer messages. The technological advancement in communication not only help human to save time and money but also motivate the economic global. With various companies, specially international cooperations which have a variety of branches and subsidiary companiesin faraway places, new communication technique helping to transfer and carry out decidions immediately from far sections, contribute absolutely ptvotal factor in their success.Additionally, modern communication systems impact to break up every distance make the world become smaller.",
        "In conclusion,I think that email and messaging can influence on social lives because they do not have much time to visiting their friends. However, T believe that modern forms of communication will provide people to widespread their networking and linking to other people over the world."
