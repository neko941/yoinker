        "It is clear that in this day and age, the development of sports has flourished so significantly with many professionals are born. Consequently, it is adequate to draw the attention of enterprises. Although I agree that this trend can develop in a positive way, I would argue that there are certain drawbacks that should not be neglected.",
        "Sports certainly has widespread and profound influences on our lives. First and foremost, firms are the group to benefit from it in the first place. Via the advertisements of their products being showed at the stadiums, companies stand a great chance of reaping an enormous amount of profit. According to a survey conducted in 2016, in America, large enterprises such as Pepsi and KFC take advantage of World Cup the most due to the great number of spectators. Secondly, the current trend can produce incentives for individuals to work out more often. This happens because of a belief among those people that they can earn a lot of money from becoming the professionals in sports.",
        "Despite these arguements, I still believe that there are significant disadvantages that we can witness quite often. Due to the high density of the involvement of companies. Before these intervension, sports had always given prominence to the morale of entertainment and relaxation. However, sports events nowadays are nothing more than the competitions among enterprises to have the opportunity to perform the advertisements. Moreover, degradation of meanings of sports might lead to individuals being discouraged from involving in these activities. In consequence, it can result in problems relating to health phisically and mentally.",
        "In conclusion, I believe that the advance of sports can have positive effects on human. Nevertheless, as every coin has two faces, there are noteworthy disadvantages that we should be aware of."
