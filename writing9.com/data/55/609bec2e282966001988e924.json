        "Currently, few people interested in walking compared to olden days. The main reasons are over consumption of fast food  and sedentary lifestyles. However, these causes can be effectively managed by adopting strategies such as public awareness and heavy taxex on unhealthy edibles.",
        "On one hand, many working class and students may not have sufficient amount  of time to prepare homely food on daily basis. Therefore, they  highly consume packed items, which have high sugar and fatty contents,  since these are affordable and tasteir than healthy options. Similarly,  due to busy lifestyle, people hardly participate exercise programmes or walking. For instance, previously, humans were not obese as they involved a lot of physical activities and  had homely foods. As a consequence, the culmination of  both the causes contribute  to obesity and other health conditions.",
        "Nevertheless, the above-mentioned issues are manageable if the government takes necessary steps  at right time. Firstly, the public need to be made aware that how  junk foods affect human body in a negative manner. They would be  educated about  a balance and healthy diet along with how to cook easy healthy meals. Secondly, the authority can impose  a heavy tax on unhealthy drinks and snacks. For example, in the UK, as children are seem to be over weight due to the over consumption of packed items, the government started to levy sugar and fat taes from these.These are the proven methods.",
        "In conclusion, even though obesity is a global issue , this can be minimised successfully by educating and taxing appropriately."
