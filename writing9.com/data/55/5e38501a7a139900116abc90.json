        "An increasing number of arguments are going around whether people are nowadays more dependent or independent. This essay will discuss both sides of the views before presenting the conclusion.",
        "On the one hand, it is widely believed that regardless of the technological advancement, the dependency syndrome on each other has been dramatically increased. For example, at present, people are more scared about the outside environment due to the alarming rate of crime in the surrounding, thus hindering them to go anywhere alone. Although if they decide to go, they have still made one person available to track their route until reached their destination. It was not in the case in the past.",
        "Despite this, however, currently ,people are becoming increasingly independent. One of the possible examples is that the rising number of students are prefered to study abroad rather than within the country. Although they are well aware about the difficulties that they may face alone in the foreign country, they have still chosen that option. This mean that this current world has made a change on their attitude, thus posing them to not only pursue their career and but also for making their life independent.  Also, available of enormous travel options have attracted the people to explore the new world and the new culture, resulting in an increase number of people are travelling alone all around the world just to gain a knowledge in new things. All in all, it is obvious that at present people are more independent when compared to the few decades before.",
        "In conclusion, while it is certainly true that people are sometimes depending on each other due to the violence and crime that has happened in the community, I believe that with the advance technology and resources, people are more likely to become an independent person now and then."
