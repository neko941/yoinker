        "It is amazing. I believe that many parents want their children to learn to play at least one musical instrument. Music plays an important role in the development of children. The survey found out that over 50 parents want their kids to play musical instruments.",
        "Of course. It is a really great proportion. In my country, most classes focus on Math, chemicals or English. When I was a student, I did not play any instruments.",
        "If I had young kids, I would want them to learn flute. It is my traditional instrument, and I love the sound of it.",
        "I think boys prefer to learn to drum while girls prefer to play the piano. You know. boys are energic, active, and noisy. Whereas, girls are gentle, patient and handy",
        "Well, I don't think so. Children have different talents in distinct fields. In my opinion, let children choose which kind of arts or hobbies , they want to learn.",
        "I don't. My parent let me learn everything myself. I used to learn Flute, but I was busy because of a lot of lessons in class. So I quit.",
        "I wish I would start learning guitar as a kid. Some of my friends play the guitar well, and they often gather at parties together. I believe that if I could play the guitar, I could attend their parties.",
        "One of my friends. He is talented on play the guitar. During our parties, he played the guitar, while others sang along.",
        "Well, She was my primary school friend. We studied in distinct classes, but we sometimes met in schoolyard. She is a famous singer and musician now. She has a lot of popular songs.",
        "I love to meet Den. He is a rapper and a musician too. His songs have wonderful lyrics which contain a lot of philosophy about life."
