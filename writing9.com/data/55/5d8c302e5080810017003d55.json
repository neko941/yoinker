        "Selection criteria for the employees have been a difficult task for the employers throughout the past. Selecting an appropriate candidate for a position is crucial for a recruiter. Some argue that creativity and ability to work individually are important factors to consider prospective employee, while other believe workers should be able to work in team and rigorous in operation. However, I believe that different characteristics are required for different employers, and it depends on them which criterion needs to be prioritized more.",
        "There are some grounds for the belief that innovation and working independently are the key factors for recruiting. Firstly, innovative way of working could bring optimization and creativity to the work which could solve many problems that are unsolved as of now. For example, in software industry, invention of new design pattern has resolved many issues of software throughout the world and also optimized them. Secondly, working alone on any product could give a worker leeway to take risks and important decisions which in turn can give some artistic output. For instance, while designing a house, if an architecture need to work with team, all will put their ideas which could create conflicts and affect the design. Thus, inventiveness and expertise to work alone are imperative for employers to consider future employee.",
        "Nevertheless, there are some bases for selection of applicant who is expert in team work and obedient in terms of following orders strictly. Firstly, an individual in team would be more efficient than the one working alone. Team work enhance the ability to communicate as when any difficulty arise, person does not stuck and could ask others in team which could decrease the resolution time. For example, if a CAD machine operator would face any problem while creating a predefined die, he could ask others for the solution. Secondly, adhering to instruction given by the superior would not allow any space for the mistake, this could bring upon standard output by many individuals. For instance, if a person can adhere to guidelines for operating a machine, it will never give faulty outcome. Thus, efficiency to grasp the directions and working with others are vital for the employers.",
        "To conclude, I believe that firms where creative production is required, candidate with innovativeness and ability to work independently is required, on the other hand, person who can work with team and rigorous in operation are appropriate for positions in operation line."
