        "The notion of  Art is one of the important cultures in the world and promotes understanding and appreciation of our diverse cultures, stories, experiences and distinctiveness of personal opinions. But nowadays, most people are focusing on science, technology and business. In this essay possible the reason behind and measures to arouse people\u2019s interest in the arts.",
        "The reason for this trend may involve the recognition that science, technology and business are playing a key role in economic growth. First, there are some forms of scientific investigation of future problems of the Earth not being able to support the human population. Scientists innovated in order to conduct in-depth research on the future of humanity. Therefore, people focus on science more than art.  Second, on the one ,hand technology is a replacement of people with computers is an inevitable trend. On the other ,hand automation is a tool that can be used equally in all endeavours including art so that people concentrate on  technology more. Third, a business can boost the economy, increase its competitive edge and build a good reputation.  toaccording this point, people are affected more by business than by art.",
        "As a consequence, how could impact more people  appreciate  art?  We could educate  people to understand the importance of the role of art better, and broaden their horizons, it is necessary to bear in mind the explicit and implied functions of art. In the face of the increasing ignorance of the arts, I suggest that the government should arrange different art exhibitions in public places. The place would be suggested downtown  or central town centre. It is easier to seek arts  everywhere, plenty of space to advocate people's interest in arts. Thus, urge them to government build up more and more galleries or art museums, sometimes exclusive to offering free tickets, to give an art atmosphere surrounding  everywhere.",
        "In conclusion, my view is that people should be encouraged to be art-oriented, upgrade the facilities, and strive to endeavour people to take interest in  art. That is the best way for them to get a clear perspective of what they are hoping to do with their art life.The human consciousness continues to incorporate ate these achievements into its activities by arts."
