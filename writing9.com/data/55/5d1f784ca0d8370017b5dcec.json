        "Some experts believe that it is better for a foreign language at primary schools rather than secondary school. Do the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages?",
        "In today\u2019s world, many parents want their child should have multi-lingual dialect. While some professionals opine that as young one should start learning a foreign language from kindergarten, others opine that secondary school age is the most appropriate one.",
        "To begin with, many experts have argued analysed that children below the age of five have an ability to learn a foreign language in a similar fusion as mother tongue. This is because they do not have the same academic pressure, as that of secondary school students, which in turn gives them extra time to explore and learn a foreign language. In a survey conducted by Panel of language has concluded that children who learn a new dialect from the budding age become an expert speaker of the new language. Consequently, based on the research many experts and parents gives priority to learning a new speech from an early age.",
        "On the other hand, I opine that sometimes language learning for minors can act as an extra burden. The reason for this is that they are on the path of learning and understanding the minute details of the surrounding. Thus, inability to learn a foreign tongue might lower their self-esteem and confidence. However, at a secondary school age they would have understood the basic concepts of other subjects, such as maths and science, it will act as an edge to boost their moral in grasping a speech. In addition, parents as well as teachers can calculate the potential of juvenile\u2019s ability to grasp a new dialect.",
        "To conclude, although the young age of a child could act as an advantage to learn a new language as their minds are fresh, inability to learn a foreign dialect could lower their moral and confidence. Thus, I believe secondary school age is the right age to learn a new language."
