        "A lot of people believe that having modern equipments like computers, laptops and telephones have made the work easier and people can perform the tasks, better from their place. The primary benefit of doing tasks at home is that it saves time. Firstly, the impact on time saving will be discussed in this essay, secondly, sedentary lifestyle that made the life threatning effect on the human body, by consuming more and more junk foods.",
        "Firstly, with the help of modern technology, our lives are getting better, as we have more time to cope with the growing competition.This is because, previously we had to go to offices for completion of various tasks, we had to ignore our commitments with friends and family and this lead to weaker relationships in the past. For example, the Cambridge publications of 2017 showed that people have more positive behaviour towards their work and they are performing better, as we have given the opportunities to do tasks, whenever they felt comfortable.This will surely help them to perform better at work.",
        "Secondly, on the other side staying at home and using gadgets to fulfil the tasks,  promotes sedentary lifestyle. This is because people will stay all day in front of the screens, in return results in more obesity and growing health concerns. For example, the research conducted by the Oxford university in 2010 had a clear view that people now have more obesity and this rate will get higher if they continue to opt for, stay at home lifestyles, stick to their screens and eat fast foods. Furthermore, if, they will continue to do the same things their lives will surely be in danger.",
        "To conclude, i believe that the benefits and dis benefits often come as a package, so staying at house benefits are far from, any negative outcomes, because people have more hours to enjoy life, as it will not only increase their productivity of doing tasks but they will also cherish their personal lives."
