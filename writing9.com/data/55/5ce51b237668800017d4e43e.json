        "There has been an upward trend in using technology like laptops and computers in the education system. There has always been an argument whether the using of technology in for education propose have a positive or negative effect. Some believe it has a positive impact, while others think it causes a counterproductive effect. I support the first view, that is,  it has beneficial implications in the education field. In the following paragraphs, I am going to discuss both points of view.",
        "It is clear that the computer enhances the classroom experience by incorporating audiovisual media. As a result, the student finds the lure to learn through this entertainment way of learning. As some research has been published in Manchester newspaper in the UK shows that pupil finds it more enjoyable and attractive to them to learn through video's which contains sounds and pictures. All this is achievable through computers and laptops. further, it allows teachers to share ideas as well as resources online using the computer network. Online learning is now potential with the help of the Internet and computers, which helps those who in need to learn but find it challenging to come to school due to specific resonance.",
        "In contrast, many disagree and believe that computers and Technology such as Internet have negative feedback on children because nowadays schoolboys spend more and more time playing video games through them that influence their education and the school grades. Also, sitting in front of a computer screen for an extended period may impact the health and cause some eyes problem such as buried in vision and headache. In 2017 study done by some university student in Colombia that discuss the impact of technology in student specialy laptop and computers and it shows that 30 % of the student have any problems due to prolonged standing in front of computers.",
        "In conclusion, I believe computers and Technology have many profits in the education system to  the leaner and teachers also on the way of teaching which is tempting despite the fact of the health problems and the negative actions in children that is can be resolved all by well supervision from the parents on how to use the computer and Technology. So I encourage using technology more education suggest."
