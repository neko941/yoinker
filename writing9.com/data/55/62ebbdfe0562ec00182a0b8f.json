        "Nowadays, there are many discussions about ranging vacations for chilldren in schools. Some argue that fewer periods with larger longevity are preferable, some argue that frequent and short holidays are preferable. While frequent vacations allow students not to be overwhelmed, in my opinion, longer holidays are more appropriate for long-term deep focus, planning, and stress resistance.",
        "The first view might involve arguements about higher productivity of students during the studying time. Due to many holidays kids are able to eliminate retained stress and be more active during the studying sessions. In such systems, examinations, for example, should be more successful. However, frequent holidays lead to frequent interuptions of learning process and focus, decreasing effeciency of large modules learning. Therefore, students may experience a lack of deep understanding of themes and may retain only the surface knowledge, which often unreliable and unnecessary for further education.",
        "On the other hand, few holidays lead to overwheling and overstressing of students during the studying process. A lack of relax may appear as an irritated condition of students and a plummet of efficiency. End-term examinations, for instance, would be less successful due to high levels of retained stress. Nevertheless, long learning terms give students an opportunity to focus deeply on a subject and plan complex researches. Moreover, Less interuptions during working not only develops planning and focusing skills but also allows students to become resistant to stressful situations and deal with them on the work.",
        "As far as I concerned, being able to focus and plan your own work in long-term perspective without frequent vacations and stress resistance are more important aspects than successful examinations in school without a contemporary application in the future and a low amount of real pressure."
