        "In the last years, the rapidly changing modern world such as technology and other events, especially pandemic covid 19 had made creativity have an important role in companies, much is said about how important business innovation is to improve results, especially in today's highly competitive market. But what is it? This word is defined as \u201cthe use of skill and imagination to produce something new or to produce art\u201d. (Oxford Learner's Dictionarie.com. n.d. Creativity). This essay focus on factors that impact creativity and its importance on the job.",
        "Firstly is it important is important to analyse the factors that influence this ability, recent research findings show that Creativity in the workplace can be influenced by organizational characteristics such as leadership, group work, and organizational climate, the same way for individual characteristics, for instance, cognition, personality, and affect. (George, 2007). Another individual component is self-efficacy which is a belief that one has the ability to achieve a specific level of performance in a specific situation. (Bandura, 1986). It is commonly heard that the organizational characteristics are more relevant than the individual, one argument is the connection between goal setting and creative requirements on the job and how organizational support for creativity affects employees, in regard to, one study showed that employees who perceived a personal responsibility to bring about change were more likely to initiate extra-role behaviors to start the change process. (Wolfe Morrison & Phelps, 1999). But the other hand, another research suggested that self-efficacy was relevant when a person needed to solve problems. (The Journal of Creative Behavior, 2013). In addition (Woodman et al., 1993) argue that \u201cthe interaction of the two components is what truly maximizes creativity; that is, both environmental factors and individual factors play a role in employee creativity\u201d.",
        "Secondly and as mentioned initially, creativity serves an essential role in business, and is a crucial step that needs to be prioritized in one company because always has been recognized as a sure path to success in an organization, due to helps employees cope with and adapt to change and solve work problems. There are many advantages of creativity: making more efficient processes: \u201cFrito-Lay, for instance, reports documented cost savings over a four-year period of almost $600 million due to their creativity training programs\u201d (Morrison, 1997). Just the same identify new opportunities: this point is relevant for the job because allows the company to take advantage of the competition for example conceive new products or services, another aspect is solving problems \u201cwhen you solve a problem, you transform\u201d (Vangundy, 2015, p23). This point is particularly relevant not only in the job but also in aspects of daily life, due to gives that competitive edge that any business is striving to achieve, for this reason, the organizations try"
