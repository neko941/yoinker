        "Nowadays, how to load for children best and who can offer the best responsibility for offspring has become an issue that everyone is concerned about. Some people think sending them to the babysitting centres is the best choice, but others believe prefer letting other families' agendas be the right persons to take concern of. I think daycare centres are the best choice for many families.",
        "Honestly,  taking responsibility for their  family shows really can be more responsible carefully and strengthen  good family relationships. Firstly, a family meeting",
        "can take responsibility will put more passion and patience into their care, which is . It\u2019s better for their physical and mental health.  Secondly, with more company, the scion will be closer to their family numbers.     They will  be in a very happy family atmosphere.",
        "But, the family meetings will meet many challenges and troubles.  Firstly, a family show like grandparents may have not so much energy to take concern of heir, while governance centres have enough active staff. It mostly reduces the burden of family numbers. Secondly, governance centres normally have more professional knowledge with their heir, which parents and other family meetings don\u2019t need to worry about. They can spend more time on something important and have  better emotions at home, which is more important to their mental health.",
        "In conclusion, if conditions permit,  I think parents prefer to send their heir to babysitting centres to get a better load."
