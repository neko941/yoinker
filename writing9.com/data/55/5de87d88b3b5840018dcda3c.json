        "Advertisement has played a pivotal role in economy field with the development of media world. However, some people argue that advertisement aimed at children negatively affects children\u2019s growth, and therefore should be banned. Personally, I disagree with this statement considering the benefits of the these advertisements.",
        "There are various reasons why I disapprove of forbidding advertising aimed at children. Firstly, these advertisements are important source of information both for children and parents. It is commonly recognized that the lines from these advertisements are well-worded and catchy to attract children\u2019s attention. For children, they can unconsciously learn a variety of words and phrases from these advertisements, which could expand their scope of vocabulary. For parents, they are equipped with the latest information about products aimed at children, which could help them choose relevant products.",
        "Furthermore, many of the advertisements aimed at children are creative. According to a recent research, 80% of these advertisement use cartoon characters and colorful images. Some of these advertisements also involve stories and fair tales. By watching them, children need to follow flow of the advertisements and thus are encourage to develop their imagination and creativity.",
        "It is true that some advertisements aimed at children may encourage children\u2019s vanity. Young children may compete with each other for buying the most trendy toys or stationary. However, this could be avoided if parents and schools appropriately guide the children and help them build up the right value.",
        "In conclusion, regardless of some negative influences, I still insist that these advertisements should not be banned, given that they can not only be important source of information, but can also encourage children\u2019s innovation."
