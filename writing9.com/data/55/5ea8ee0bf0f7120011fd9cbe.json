        "I am writing this letter to complain about my mobile phone which I lost on a subway train.",
        "I recently purchased an Apple iPhone 11 series of black colour from the Costco business centre, which it cost me around  $1200.  Additionally, I took the insurance for that mobile for a period of 2 years from the date of purchase. It has an elegant look and style with almost all the features of upcoming mobile devices.",
        "Last week on Friday at around 5 o clock in the evening, when I am on my way to pick up my friend, I catch the first class coach from the Union subway station to Kenndy station. Since its very first time to travel in subway, I kept my mobile phone in the front seat which is basically free all the time for my journey. While I am in a hurry to pick up my friend, I left the mobile in that coach.",
        "Even though I have the insurance for my iPhone, it would be great if you could take up an action to fill the missing case and try to locate my lost device.",
        "It would be a great benefit for the insurance company as well as for me, in case of you are able to track my device.",
        "Appreciate your efforts. Looking forward your positive response.",
