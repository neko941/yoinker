        "Language is by far the most distinguishing factor between two different cultures around the world. Although adopting English as a common language has advantages in areas of better immigration and growth of businesses, it has its own drawbacks in terms of lost culture and literature which makes this world more colorful and pleasant.",
        "One of the most significant advantages of a common language is the growth of business and immigration. People across the world will be able to connect and communicate better, which can lead to new business ideas and in turn the growth of the economy. Additionally, Immigration will be easy between countries which will companies with wider access to talent across the world. More immigration will also improve the standard of living of some of the poorest countries which cannot provide opportunities to their people.",
        "Despite the advantages, the cultural loss is one of the most significant drawbacks of adopting English as a common language. Without exceptions, all rich cultures around the world have their language and literature. Discarding one\u2019s language can result in loss of traditions followed by the country or Tribe. This loss will be permanent and cannot be reversed. For instance, Aryan and Dravidian cultures of India which developed for thousands of years have suffered irreversible loss in the field of Yoga, Ayurveda. Much of the newer generations cannot read Sanskrit which has been the traditional language of the region.",
        "In conclusion, although adopting English as a common language provide advantages in terms of business growth and employment prospects to the under-development countries, it comes at a dire cost of loss of cultural heritage and history."
