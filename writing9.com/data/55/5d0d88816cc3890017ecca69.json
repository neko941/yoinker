        "Many think that those opting for the relocation to another country should abide by the culture and tradition over there. I strongly, agree with the statement that following the rules and traditions after migrating to a country should have foremost importance because every country has its own set of rituals and traditions.",
        "Most of the people want to migrate to pursue their dream of having a lavish and healthy lifestyle for themselves and their family. While adopting the new laws and customs of that country should be the most significant part to integrate into customary traditions of the new country. While residing in a new country we represent our homeland, whereas any misconduct could result in the defamation of our motherland so we should be aware of those laws and traditions. For instance, numerous studies have consistently found that 90 percent of people become familiar with rules and customs in Saudi Arab prior to their moving.",
        "Moreover, the rituals and traditions vary from country to country so the new migrants may encounter some enormously unusual acts in the newland. The migrants have to compromise with those practices and traditions to make a devoted bond with that country. For example, recently an American family that was residing in Saudi Arab was deported because they were found guilty of not following the dress code advised by the government.",
        "In conclusion, I strongly agree that while migrating to a country and respecting the customs and traditions afterward should have the foremost priority. Whereas, it could help to intimate in that community to build an affectionate relationship."
