        "Most of the parents consider educating their young ones about the significance of money and how to use it wisely. In my opinion, the younger generation should be taught about this otherwise, they would never know the importance of hard efforts behind making money and would recklessly spend on owning the material wealth. Moreover, there are several ways to motivate them to learn about valuing the money, that will be discussed in the ensuing paragraphs.",
        "The main reason to teach the children to value money is that they would learn to save money and use it optimally. Admittedly, when they understand the hard work applied to make the money, they will think twice before spending on useless things. For example, if a teenager enjoying parties and gadgets is told about the labor his parents put to give him money to spend, he would stop wasting money.",
        "Another reason to make children aware of monetary aspects is due to the fact that he can learn to appreciate the hard work. The adolescent would know the naked truth of the world where nothing comes without money. Gradually, this would make him focus on his studies and learn the skills to get a decent job in the future. Without qualms, this will help him to be independent and earn employment in the job market instead of asking for help from parents.",
        "Furthermore, as every child should learn to give importance to money, there are ways to educate them. Undeniably, parents can set the best example for their young ones. If the parents would not hastily spend on useless things, the child would also see and reciprocate the behavior. Additionally, when the elders narrate the story or share their experience valuing the money, the youngsters would definitely learn it effectively.",
        "In conclusion, I pen down saying that the younger generation has to be aware of the importance of money and this can be done by elders through stories or experiences shared with them. moreover, it is important for them because in this way they will learn how to spend wisely."
