        "The level of criminal activity among young adults is substantially rising across the world. This essay will discuss the main reasons and possible solutions to tackle it.",
        "Nowadays, people live in a busy world where they have no time to spend with their children. They are so involved with their life that they forget to nurture good values among their kids. This is the main reason, that teenagers stray away from the right path, as they do not know what is right or wrong. Moreover, in this modern world, they face immense peer pressure to obtain the modern gadgets, look stylish and show their strength, which forces them to get involved in activities like stealing, harassment and sabotaging the property. As an instance, a teenager who is independent to live his life wants to look his best, but he does not have money to buy new clothes, so he gets involved in stealing money.",
        "However, as it is believed that every problem has a solution, so does it. If the parents and the teachers teach kids the fundamental good values, which a child should abide when he grows, then the majority of the problem is solved. Further, they should keep an eye on the activities of the children and become their friends, so that the youngsters are comfortable to discuss their issues with them. Other than that, pupils should be engaged in community service, yoga and meditation to calm their mind and further they would be able to empathies with others.",
        "To conclude, although youth is prone to get inclined towards crime, good core values and proper guidance from parents and teachers can bring a significant improvement. Techniques which relax the mind of the pupils are also a good way out."
