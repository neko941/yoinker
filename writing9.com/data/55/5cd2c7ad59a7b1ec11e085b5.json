        "Advancement of technology such as innovations of electrical equipment like computers and television as a great impact on our daily activities, people tends to engage in less physical exercise as this has greater effect on health. Which I strongly agree to.",
        "Although, using all forms of electronic gadgets for example, computer aid work faster, thus making work more productive. People tends to use lesser period on a particular task and job delivery system are faster while prolonging of works are being limited. Thus boasting source of income with less stress. For instance, introduction of online businesses  people tend to buy and sell goods without being stressed. Also transaction can be done at faster rate. Further more, some of electrical equipment serve as means of relaxation for people. Watching of various films and news can be done at comfort zone with either there phones, television or palmtops, which makes life's convent and enjoyable",
        "Despite the benefit mention above peoples sedentary life's style tend to increase on daily basis which as negative effect on health. Engaging in physical activities helps in burning of fats and calories thus,preventing disease conditions such as Diabetics and heart related issues. For instance some scientists conducted Research at Harvard university stated that physical exercise helps in mental and physical wellbeing. Thus, giving you good sense of reasoning and having a good reproductive life.",
        "In conclusion, modern electronic inventions make life and work easier, also some serve as relaxation means. However, it should be use with caution so as to maintain a healthful life."
