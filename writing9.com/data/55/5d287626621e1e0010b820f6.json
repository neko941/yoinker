        "In many countries around the world, there is an increase in the number of business manage by family members. This essay will argue that the benefits of family-run business offset the drawbacks, as such an enterprise would create employment opportunities for members of the family and resources can easily be pool together to ensure the success of the enterprise.",
        "On the one hand, one commonly cited disadvantage of the business manage by a family is that it has limited expertise. This is because some members of the family who hold key positions may lack the needed skills. Thus, the business may improvise which is not ideal. For instance, a son or a daughter with limited business knowledge or experience may be employed in an administrative position. This could impair the functionality of the company.",
        "However, family-run business create employment opportunities for their members. Thus, a person who is part of the family and interested in the business is likely to be offered employment in the company. For example, relatives of Mr Alico Dangote, a businessman in Nigeria, are gainfully employed in the family company. This would not have occurred if it had been a public corporation.",
        "Furthermore, members of a family-run business can pool resources together with ease. In other words, instead of seeking loans from financial institutions such as banks, the owners can easily make needed momentary contributions. As a result, the business can pull through in the during periods of financial crises.",
        "In conclusion, although family-run business may have limited expertise, it would ensure members of a family are gainfully employed and can they can contribute to the success of the business. I would argue that this type of business have more advantages today."
