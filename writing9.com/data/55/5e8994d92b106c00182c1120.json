        "It is irrefutable that military activities require a lot of demand from the militarist. Some individuals are of the opinion that women applicants should be considered as equal as men in military sector. However, others hold the vice verca view that women are not appropriate for this. In the following essay, I will discuss both stands of the argument, I personally agree with the latter view.",
        "From one perspective, military work demands a huge amount of physical strength. First, during the special exercises like training the heavy machines, militarists have to endure the challenging tasks that are not for ordinary people. Secondly, people are more prone to encounter men in military sector, so they underestimate female ones.",
        "Moreover, military workers should have strong mental and spiritual preparation simultaneously with physical. This is because, during those exercises they do not really need mental strength, but during the wars or police work every individual should have psychological stamina to overcome difficult situations. Females have difficulties with psychological stamina shortage and that is why, it is not their work.",
        "On the flip side, when men are treated as more suitable in militia, women candidates are more dominant in acting diligently. Since some women are more prone to sort with extraordinary situations out because of their creativity. That is why, sometimes women are more successful than males in militia.",
        "To conclude, some people suppose that military work is not for women, while others suggest opposing stand. In my opinion, despite their creativity, they can not be considered as equal as males in military work."
