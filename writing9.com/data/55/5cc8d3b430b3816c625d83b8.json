        "Youngsters below the age of 18 are seen as minors, thus many people think that it is better not to charge them whenever they visit such places like museums and historic centres. In my opinion, offering all children free entrance would be problematic, and therefore should be offered to certain children.",
        "Making these art and cultural centres open without pay for under eighteen would incur so much expenses to the government and the society. This is because if such is allowed, a lot of young ones would be attracted always  to these areas thereby leading to overcrowding, and consequently,  causing so many damages to the facilities. This is because their numbers would be outrageous thus making them difficult to be controlled by the staffs. In order to repair the damaged structures, extra finance would be required which sometimes  come from funds allocated to other public services. Furthermore, keeping these important places open without entrance fees for youngsters would make them not to attach any value to them, thus demoting the prestige and honour ascribed to them.",
        "Nevertheless, some younger chaps can be allowed to visit without paying. For example, in schools, certain  parents found it difficult to pay their children's school fees not to talk of paying paying extra money for escortion when required due to poverty. Such kids could be assessed in their various classes and those who are very intelligent and smart could be selected as a way of compensating them for their hardwork. As a result, poor students are encouraged to work harder in order  to be included in all their school's activity.",
        "In conclusion, despite peoples' view, I still believe that allowing access to museums and historic sites without charge for younger individuals might become a burden for some countries and thus should be considered for few chaps."
