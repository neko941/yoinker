        "Some educationalists believe that its better to learn in class rooms however other say in order to cope with the modern world competition, we have to train students on online study materials. This essay will agree that tradional method of learning i-e classrooms are the best for the children. So, keeping this in mind, we will talk about both sides and then I will give my own opinion.",
        "Firstly classroom learning is a system, to train individuals from their childhood to adult life in-order to train them, how to cope with the world. Because, it will not only teach them how to learn something but how to behave with a large number of people, how to act accordingly to certain time tables, also to follow deadlines moreover the cooperation teach them how to be a good human being in life, while taking care of other needs. For example,  in recent research publications, it is proved that children learn much faster in classrooms this is because its a pshychy of a man that it performs exceptionally well in a group. Secondly, the most important thing is that man is a social animal he is built according to this protocol if he does not behave according to set pattern then surely he will face difficulties in life later on.",
        "On the other hand, people prefer to opt for online study courses these days as it saves a lot of money and time. But, obviously there are some drawbacks of this approach. Firstly, this is against man's nature if he does not know how to live with other individuals, then how he will perform in a group, so, as a result he left behind in this era of increasing competition. For example, if a child has brought up in a environment, in which he does not see the world pressure of deadlines, strict environment of class, peer pressure, and also the aspects of group learning then how can he be able to stand on his feet in this world where everyone is in the race of making money. So, he will surely feel left behind which will cause depression and ultimately suicide attempt which are rapidly increasing these days.",
        "To conclude, I can say classroom learning is by far the best method to teach individuals, to outperform in an environment, but also, helps them to make a person full of abilities which makes them stand out in the society."
