        "In the digital era the world is connected, and the people are able to communicate with each other like never before. With the exponential increase in the technology adaption, many people from across the age spectrum started coming online for the first time and as a result, use of the social media has exploded. However, this trend has both pros and cons associated with it. I believe, disadvantages clearly out muscle the benefits it provides.",
        "The best thing and important aspect of using the social media is, individuals can connect with the loved ones from anywhere in the world instantly, never before in the history humans talked or sent a message with such ease. It successfully helped the mankind, particularly the younger generation to look at the world with fresh perspective.",
        "However, like it happens with all the good things, there are some risks associated with the use of social media too. The main concern is data privacy, people often tend to share the personal details in public domain and many of them are not aware of the consequences of doing it. Many rouge individuals and in some cases even multinational companies use the data for their own benefits. For example, social media giant Facebook sold public data to the 3rd party vendors which in turn influenced the elections in many countries. There are reports that Russia used these public domains to influence the election results in America. Finally, fake news is another menace that is troubling everyone and the companies are finding it tough to tackle it.",
        "To conclude, even though there are some best things that came out of social media since its invention, the cons of using it outnumber the advantages it provides right now, may be if the content is tightly regulated future might be bright for these platforms."
