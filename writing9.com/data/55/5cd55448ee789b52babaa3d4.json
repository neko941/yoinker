        "Getting ample amount of free time to younger adolescents have become hard now a day. Despite, a significant amount of parents think that, the free time has to be spent for educational purpose while others feel that, they have to spend on recreational activities. I believe that, time is very precious. It has to be wisely managed for both education and part-time activities.",
        "Firstly, in this fast moving world, technology is flourishing every leaps and bounds. The enoromous growth of the digital world has impacted every field, out of which younger lad's are the most to face these consequences. However, in the free time they are forced to prepare for competitive tests by their parents. Additionally, children are experiencing only studies in the whole year, which will have a negative impact on their performance. For instance, one of my friend's son has committed sucide, as he was unable to bare the pressure from college as well as parents.",
        "On the other hand, If enough time is given to younger people for sports and other physical activities, there would be a great improvement in their efficiency. Secondly, physical fitness is very important to balance mental stress, as they face diffuculty to manage stress at this age. In addition to this, a recent study has shown that, the children who spends 2 hours daily on sports have succeeded better than others. For example, all the IIT top rankers in india have some hobbies such as sports.",
        "To conlcude, it is very tough to get free time now a day while majority of parents force their children to utilize the time for education, each individual has to use it very cleverly. I believe that it has to be used for both studies and exercise."
