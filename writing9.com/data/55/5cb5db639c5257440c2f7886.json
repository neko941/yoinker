        "Based on the development of the modern life nowadays, student have many opportunities to expose to the diversity of subjects such as science, technology and so on. However, others argue that history is the most essential subject in the school while I believe that this opinion should be altered in this circumstance.",
        "On the one hand, there is no doubt that the aim of history is really important because it represent for the cultural identity of any country in the world. First of all, if the education do not require their students to comprehend the history, they might forget their origin. According to the analysis of many scientist, children are still good at many subjects except history but they will not appreciate the results of older generations, they have to suffer the pain from wars in order to let children live in peace. Secondly, enhancing their knowledge about history can be an interesting experience which support them a lot in their future. For instance, when student go to study abroad they ought to promote their culture for friends over the world by the outstanding historical characteristics of their countries.",
        "On the other hand, history is no longer suitable to the development of the education in recent years, some history are out of date. For example, there are a lot of old festivals which are mentioned in the history books but it is too dangerous and affect children\u2019s thinking such as sacrificing god with blood in Greece. In addition, student are enable to explore the subject which is essential for their life then it motivate them to study. For instance, children are fond of many subject due to their passions which lead them to their jobs in the future such as math is suitable with who want to become business man or teacher and so on.",
        "In conclusion, history is really necessary due to it\u2019s important role but I completely agree that there are many other subjects which are more practical and bring benefits to children in their life."
