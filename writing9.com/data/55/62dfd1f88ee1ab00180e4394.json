        "In terms of advantage, travel with tourist guider is the best way to travel. The main reason given to support this that a tour guide he has a vast experience, and he knows multiple places to visit. To illustrate, if you travel with group included your tourist guide you will get a good managing time so, everything is schedule on the time also, you will get a huge place to visit however, they will learn about culture from each other. In the other hand, tourist is for helping people to keep providing to be knowledgeable. For example, tourist given information and structure about some museum, but it is not necessary to follow them. Finally, travel with people and tour guide makes your travel secure",
        "However, there are disadvantages of transporting with tour guide. First of all, there are some places most people don\u2019t like it especially young people such as, visit museums and art gallery. In addition to that travelling with different nation mostly not good because there will be a clash of culture. Also travel alone makes you discover the traditional ways in that country that you visit.",
