        "Higher education ought to accept both genders equally in every area of study. In my opinion, I agree that the university should provide admission to both men and women equally in every field as it will greatly benefit both individual and society.",
        "A good reason to have an equal number of male and female students in every subject is that it gives both genders equal rights. At present, a great proportion of female students is prevented from entering a certain subject in higher education because they do not have the same acceptance rate as male students. This is discriminatory which can be avoided by making the acceptance rate to be the same for both men and women.",
        "Another point to consider is that unfair acceptance rate between male and female students led to more concentration of one type of gender in one field than another. For example, around three-quarters of all the students in the engineering field in the UK are male students. This statistics can be lowered by issuing a law that states the acceptance rate in every subject should be equally distributed.",
        "Finally, admitting the same number of male and female students in every area of study will benefit the society in the long run, for the simple reason that it will result in increasing the number of educated people from both sides. In other words, having a greater resource of skilled and knowledgeable professionals from both genders will bring greater rewards to society as a whole. Moreover, it can bring more economic advantages to a country that shows itself to be leading in various fields.",
        "In conclusion, providing the same acceptance rate for both men and women in the tertiary education is a must and this approach will result in decreasing the discrimination between the two genders and increasing the number of educated people among them."
