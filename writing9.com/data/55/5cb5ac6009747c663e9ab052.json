        "There is a growing argument that Governments should focus more investment on education adults and in particular, people who are illiterate as there is already enough emphasis placed on the development of young people in schools and Universities. In my opinion, I disagree with this idea for various reasons which I will illustrate in the following paragraphs.",
        "The first argument is that children are our future. They will inherit this earth so providing the younger population with a quality education should be a priority for each individual nation.  The Importance of early childhood development cannot be ignored in terms of the evolution and growth emotionally, socially and physically of young children. This will have a direct effect on their overall development and on the adult, they will one day become. That is why understanding the need to invest in very young children is so important, so as to maximize their future well-being. Education counts more than ever in the today\u2019s world with rapid change and technological advancement ever more present so it is children and the younger generations who must receive the most attention and care to ensure a high standard of learning.",
        "In addition, Youngsters tend to be more intelligent and creative compared to older people. They have the advantages of more free time and more motivation to learn compared with adults so educating them is an easier task. Added benefits such as a better memory and ability to grasp knowledge in a faster and more productive way prove that young people can make the most of their opportunities and in turn contribute to society. This means that educating them is necessary for the positive growth and development of any nation.",
        "Nevertheless, education of adults is also a need as it would help to alleviate present problems. Some investment in increasing the literacy rate does help to reduce unemployment and transform an individual\u2019s lives. Governments should recognise the role that adult education can play in the economic and social development and as an example,  poverty reduction, etc.",
        "To sum up, a good quality education is one that provides all learners with capabilities they require to become economically productive,  for developing sustainable livelihoods, to contribute societies and enhance individual well-being. In my view, The rewards and positives from focusing efforts on young children outweigh those of adults."
