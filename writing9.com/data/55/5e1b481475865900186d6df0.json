        "There is an undenibale fact that gender equality is supported by many people and ladies and gentelmen are deemed equal in every field of life,while, others believe that men and women are not equal and for that reason, there can be several appropriate jobs for woman.As I am feminist, in my estimate, women's and men's rights are equal However, they have some mental as well as physical differences between them.Therefore  there are certain jobs which are not suitable for ladies or men.",
        "To begin with, Men are much stronger in comprasion with women and some jobs demand physical strength.according to  a survey conducted by The London University that women are not favoured for some occuptions such as ;engineer, master , or plumber.In addition to this, some researchers have shown  that if women do some work that requires physical activities they can damage their healt.",
        "Secondly, some proffesions are related to psychology. According to some famous scientists' opinions,women are better to control their emotion compared to males.They are also more successful to understand or analyze people and have a gopd memory.In other words, Females are more appropriate some proffesions such as; teachers, social work,examiner,interviewer, and so on. And men are not more favoured for these occuptions.",
        "In conclusion, taking all discussed factors into consideration I would have to acknowledge that males and females are equal in general.Yet they have some differences And they should be choosed not because of their sex but because of their abilities Both ot them are able to become succesfull in certain fields which are suitable"
