        "Throughout the human being\u2019s history, fossil fuels has always been the most popular source of energy. However, in recent years, with the issues causing by this type of energy and the growing need for fuels, I believe that finding a replacement for fossil fuel is needed is should be prioritize.",
        "Firstly, fossil fuels is extremely harmful when used. They emit out a large amount of toxic chemicals such as carbon dioxide or coal dust, which can cause severe damage to the environment as well as for human well-being. Carbon dioxide is the main factor contributing to the form of acid rain, air pollution and the rising global temperature; while coal dust can be highly dangerous for human\u2019s respiratory system, with their ability of prevent oxygen to be absorbed by blood cells. In many sub-urban areas of China, the overpoluted air caused by many factories using fossil fuels has forced millions of citizen to leave their homes, and make their life became unstable.",
        "Another disadvantage of fossil fuels is their unsustainable. Plenty of scientists has said that this type of energy can only last for a few more decades before completely run out. If a substitute doesn\u2019t come to available soon, an energy crisis will occur. Many factories will have to be closed, the unemployment ratio will rise, and thousands of people\u2019s live will be affect. In fact, the rapidly development of technology lately has boosted the use of fossil fuels, and the energy crisis can come sooner than expected with the lack of replacement sources of energy.",
        "In conclusion, harmful and unsustainable fossil fuels has no longer suitable for human being, and there should be an alternative soon for this type of energy"
