        "A large number of languages are becoming extinct by every passing year. Some believe that it is not significant since life will be comfortable with limited languages in the world. This essay agrees to have lesser number of languages.",
        "Some argue that fewer languages can make world more relax to live. Reducing number of languages can significantly lower the clashes happening among different speaking groups. The political leaders spread hatred and discriminate another group based on their mother tongue, hence disturbing harmony of a country. Recently, a Maharastrian politician had demanded reservation in the government jobs for Marathi speaking population rather than merit based recruitment. Therefore, it lead to mob lynching and violence in different communities. A single language can be a potential solution to eradicate such type of incidences. Though different languages are cultural heritage but it should not be preserved at the cost of human lives.",
        "Additionally, many people believe that lesser number of languages helps promote tourism. Many a times, it is observed that communication barrier discourages people from visiting unknown land. As, they face a lot of difficulties in local transportation, accommodation and site seeing. Also, this leaves behind any opportunity to make friends. North Indians mostly stay away from travelling to Tamil Nadu, a Tamil speaking state, wherein only regional language is being preferred by everyone. Thus, it is not consider as a visitor friendly region. If people try to learn other languages in this area, such situation can be prevented, but it appears far from reality for state like Tamil Nadu.",
        "In conclusion, multiple languages are important to carry forward legacy of forefathers. However, I strongly believe that a decreasing number of languages accrues high number benefits that makes a peaceful society where everyone can enjoy their vacation wherever they want."
