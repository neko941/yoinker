        "It has been common practice to interview one when he or she enters certain jobs. Hence some people come up with the idea that, this statement is not appropriate way to find out his or her position in labour market. I personally do believe that, although combining interview may be one of best ways, there are other methods that come in handy in this sense.",
        "From the one side of the angle, interviews may be best solution due to following reasons. Firstly, as this method is applied throughout the world some employees track down this as a useful test when entering a particular job. As an example, the world\u2019s seventy percent of jobs in labour market requires conversion before applying job in this sense interview is the best way to deal with. In addition to this, interviews help to find out the level of one\u2019s knowledge namely this shows how he can do his job or what position is suitable for him.",
        "From the other side of the angle, there are opposite views about interviewing someone. Primarily, while interview one can give memorized answers as he/she knows he go through from interview. In addition to this, they are highly likely to give artificial speech related to his/her life namely they can make a prepared speech in which half things spoken are wrong. Moreover, I believe during the interview which may last about 15 minutes is impossible to know technical skills namely they can not explain what they can do.",
        "Altogether, after assessing both views, I uphold the conviction that interview also considered as a best way but we should apply another method along with interview."
