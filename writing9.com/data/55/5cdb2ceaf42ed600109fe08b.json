        "Punishing people for their criminial actions is important to maintain law and order within our society. Some believe that there should be a fixed punishment for each different type of crime, whereas others would argue that the outcome of their sentence should be determined by the individial circumstance of the people and what motivated them to do so. In my opinion, i believe that the judge should consider the situation that the person is in and the reasons for why that led to the crime",
        "",
        "If there is a fixed punishment for each crime, all people who commit murder will get the same punishment. This system will certainly improve judgement efficiency. Since the punishment for each crime has already been given in law books, judges only have to pronounce the verdict. Also when the punishments are consistent with regulations established previously, there will be fewer law conflicts.",
        "Unfortunately, the above arguments in favour of a fixed punishment are not as logical as they sound. Human behaviour is almost always influenced by circumstances. Crime is no different. It is possible for two people who commit murders to have entirely different motives. Perhaps one of them committed the act with the deliberate intention to kill while the other was merely trying to save himself from the attacker while committing the murder accidentally. If there are fixed punishments for murder, both of them will receive the same punishment. This is unfair. It is also unfair to give juveniles the same punishment as adults. It is thus evident that serious ethical issues may arise if fixed punishments are given for each crime.",
        "In my opinion, while awarding the punishment the judge should consider not only the severity of the crime but also the circumstances that led to it. To conclude, it does not make sense to have fixed punishment for each crime because no two persons who commit the same crime have the same motive."
