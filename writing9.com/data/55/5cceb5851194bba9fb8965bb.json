        "Secondary school curricula have drawn major public attention to their spectrum of subjects. While an education program containing a wide range of subjects would be beneficial to some extent, I firmly believe that a career-oriented one would be a better choice.",
        "A curriculum providing general knowledge of diverse subjects benefits secondary students in different ways. The most obvious benefit is that students could gain the overview of a wide range of subjects, helping them grasp an overall understanding of different aspects of life and develop essential personal skills. Without the general knowledge of Math, writers, singers, and actors would find daunting difficulties in managing their family or personal finance. Vice versa, economists whose expertise is in Math and Finance would fail to explain socio-economic matters if they do not have a background in social sciences. Another clear benefit is that an education program with various subjects empowers students with essential orientation to determine their career passions which seldom come into shape during their teenage years. Students have the opportunities to get exposed to and engaged in various subjects to identify their occupation fields of interest.",
        "However, I am of the opinion that a specialized training curriculum is a better choice because it would facilitate secondary students\u2019 future career preparation. The primary reason is that such a training program allows students to nurture in-depth knowledge and skills in the occupation that they set their heats on, paving a way for major professional advances. In the current overwhelmingly competitive labor market, having a profound insight into a particular field would endow young students with ultimate advantages over other candidates, and, hence, provide them with brighter job opportunities. Secondly, an education program with a strong focus on profession-oriented modules can maximize students\u2019 study efforts and investment. In the era of overloading information, concentrating on a few subjects would be the wisest learning way which could guarantee the usefulness and fruitfulness of investment in education.",
        "In conclusion, while the option of teaching diverse subjects has its merits, I contend that specialized training system provides favorable education and optimal professional preparation for secondary students to lead successful career paths."
