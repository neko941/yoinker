        "Over last few years, surprisingly, young people have started showing interest in shopping. Not only that, it has become one of their leisure activities. This essay will elaborate more on the various reasons and mention if this is a positive or a negative trend.",
        "To begin with, these days\u2019 youngsters prefer to stay alone or in nuclear families. In other words, they are not socializing enough with their friends and family; this diverts their attention towards other activities which can be done alone, one of which is shopping. In fact, there is a conspicuous trend among these individuals which do a lot of windows shopping.",
        "In addition to this, the TV commercials are also playing a crucial role of turning these target groups to shopping malls. For instance, a variety of new brands are advertising through many channels by using young adults in to these videos to lure them to purchase their branded products.",
        "My view is that this rising trend is a negative development for the youth because this will make them materialistic and also make them to loose interest in their much loved hobbies or sports. Shopping now and then, will bring materialism in their lives which mean they will start valuing those purchased objects more than the human relationships. Consequently, such people are likely to suffer from isolation and depression. Furthermore, they might lose interest in hobbies or activities that they really fond of or gives them real joy like dancing or playing football.",
        "To conclude, this generation should indulge in more useful activities than shopping as it has many negative impacts in near future like loss of relationships and hobbies."
