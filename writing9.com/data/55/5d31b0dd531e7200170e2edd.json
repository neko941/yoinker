        "The rapid devolement of computers and internet in the last two decasde have changed completely our ability to communicate with others and access data. Due to these changes, it is likely that in the upcomming years more adults will work from home and also, more children will be home schooled. These changes, despite the many advantages, will have a negative effect on our sociaty and should not be supported.",
        "There are many difficulties, both personal and social, in having to work and study outside of our homes. Personally, it requires us to wake up early everyday and spend time driving our cars or the bus until we reach our working place. Also, not being present at home makes us lees accessible to our daily tasks such as cleaning or washing the dishes, things we could have done if we would have stayed at home. Socially, not working from home increase the amount of cars on the roads and this often leads to traffic jams. Further more, studying in a formal education system rather than home school requires the constant maintenance of  the establishement and studying materials, such as computers and laboratory equipment.",
        "Despite the above mentioned, I believe staying at home will have determinental effects on our sociaty. Our culture is based on social connections and interactions and meeting in person other friends or sdudying together in the same room is far more rewarding than having an online chat. Creating a new idea, such as a new commersial or a script for a movie, requires people to share thoughts together and this can be achieved much better in person rather than online. Even more, studying in front of a teacher who is present and can touch and connect to the child will make the lesson much more fruitfull and unforgetable.",
        "In conclusion, despite the massive progression of computers have done, I stronly believe that people should not work or study from home and interact personally with each other."
