        "Holding technology an individual in his life or not to depends on gadgets, it\u2019s a contradictory subject.

Numerous changes have been done in a generation which means humans are making so lazy themselves. Moreover, every sector has grown with the use of new technology increased. Each person has his own laptop and mobile to keep a record of company details and personal details, which paperwork has decreased. However, there is less use of writing skills that affect human skills.",
        "Past era, technology was developing and people were not too aware of it or they don\u2019t have enough funds to invest in it. They were good with the traditional method. For instance, Doctors, engineers and many other faculty students are using a lot of books to do studies. Todays, methods have changed, every thing has available over the internet and no need to go shop and same more money and time to buy any book. The Internet has changed human life and people should acquire to the current flow.",
        "To conclude, Technology is playing a vital role in recent days. I agreed humans are getting less intelligent but new gadgets making hi very strong owing to the knowledge of technology. I think every individual should accept, learn and follow  him."
