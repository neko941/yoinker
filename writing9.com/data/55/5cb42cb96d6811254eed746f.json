        "It is argued that television has an educational feature, but some people considering that it has only entertaining function. This essay agrees with the first statement because despite most entertaining TV content there are many educational channels and programs.",
        "Main duty of the present television is to entertain people by using various entertaining content. There is vast amount of TV shows, films and programs devoted to this only one purpose - to people have fun and relax while watching this content. It is a big industry of making entertaining content, and this content makes ratings to TV channels while been shown, and TV channels make profit by placing advertisements between shows. And the entertainment shows are dominating on the air because of its profitability. For example, there are only entertaining shows on the federal TV channels at the prime time in Russia.",
        "On the other hand, there are many channels dedicated to educational and cognitive purposes. There are programs about history, languages, manufacturing, space exploration and many other educational aspects which are shown by some science specific channels and even traditional entertaining channels are showing some educational content sometimes. For example, there is a list of scientific channels such as National Geographic, Discovery, Animal Planet, and many others, and people could study some interesting facts about nature and science while watching them.",
        "In conclusion, despite mostly entertaining function, television could teach people if they would prefer educational content. And TV channels should paste more educational programs and films on the air to make television more useful and to contribute into people\u2019s self-development."
