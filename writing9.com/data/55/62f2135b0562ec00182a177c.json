        "The act of rendering alms  known as charity to people depends on an individual's personality. While some people choose to render help directly to the community , a few others options to do theirs through national or international organizations. In this, essay both views will be analysed and my opinion will be stated.",
        "An almsgiving is an act of rendering help to people who are less privileged especial those who are handicapped or physically challenged. There are reasons why some people choose to render alms in person. One for recognition and secondly for publicity. For example , an individual who is not well known in a community and has an ambition of becoming prominent in the society uses this means to gain attention and more with the use of mobile phones video is been captured and sent to the internet for other viewers who weren't present,thus for history purpose as well. Again people do so just to get praise and do a show-off. ,Furthermore some individual feels that there could be an incomplete mission if such is given to another that is mistrust. In addition, individual wants to get self-satisfaction over what the organized for the community and positive feedback as well.",
        "On the other hand, giving alms to international organizations in other to help people at various communities ,through this means prevents people from the danger which is fear of the unknown. For example, in a country where there are lot of envy and jealousy people intend to render alms through charity organizations in an anonymous way to avoid being questioned by the government or being kidnapped. In addition, some people don't like publicity. hence,their privacy is paramount to them.",
        "In conclusion, the way one chooses to render help to people in the community  is of a personal issue and in my ,opinion I don't like a publicity lifestyle or a show-off kind of life, therefore using the national or international organizations is my best means for almsgiving."
