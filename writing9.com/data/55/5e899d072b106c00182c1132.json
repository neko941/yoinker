        "Taking a gap year is a common activity for many students around the world. Taking a gap year to go travelling or gain more experience before going to university. But, is it a good idea to take a gap year or it is just a waste of time? In the following essay, I will say my opinion about this question.",
        "Taking a gap year going to give you time to pursue your passion and may give you the opportunity to work as your dream work. If you spend your gap year travelling, you may probably need to find out how to manage your finances, it could give you a wealth of cultural awareness and a profound ability to live and work independently. And the life experience you have learned can make you better prepared for university.",
        "But taking a gap year still have its disadvantages if you\u2019re not using it in a good way. Like if you enjoy too much and forget to learn, you risk losing your academic momentum. And after you go back to study, you will be a year behind others. And it could be very costly if you are wasting a lot of cash on your expenses.",
        "In my opinion, students should take a gap year and use it wisely to get as much knowledge as possible or to discover their career interest also allows them to consolidate their finances. However, taking a gap year or not depends on each student, they can go straight to university if they want to."
