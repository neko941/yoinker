        "The revolutionary invention of silicon chip has transformed almost every walk of life, including business and consequently, more people tend to shop online nowadays. Because it is in the vogue, many people believe that orthodox business will be taken over by e-commerce sooner than later. Though some physical shops will still exist, I entirely agree with the notion that online stores are bound to have a promising future.",
        "Starting with, what people like about online shopping is convenience and easy access. A variety of products are available at the tap of a button and all this at the comfort of ones home. Moreover, online brands offer a wide range of added services like twenty four by seven assistance, free cash on delivery and hassle free returns and refunds, that add to the satisfaction of their consumers. Because of this, customers are adopting the trend of making online purchases.",
        "On the contrary, a few people who object to the potential of e-stores are either ill informed or question its novelty. The frequent claim by such people that one can not judge the quality of a product virtually is not more than an excuse because most of the stores state a clear description of the items and on top of that, buyers share the hands on experience of the goods. Additionally, people might be afraid of being deceived, but thanks to the modern security tactics, it is highly unlikely that somebody will rob them of their fortune. Thus, clearing all doubts about online business and guaranteeing a safer and satisfactory experience.",
        "The distinct advantages of online stores are twofolds: easy availability and better client services. Although it will take some time for people to get used to e-shopping, I believe that internet shops are going to take over conventional brick and mortar stores inevitably."
