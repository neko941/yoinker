        "Most people opine that giving identical punishments to all criminals is a well-organized way. This essay will explore the benefits and will also discuss harm of having a stable penalty for all culprits.",
        "To begin with, the primary merit of giving same punishments to all law-breakers is that there will be maximum decline in all crimes provided that the penalty is severe as the perpetrators will think twice before committing a crime. The secondary boon of executing such punishments will annihilate the evil in our society. For instance, a survey report submitted by criminal law of justice states that there was nearly 10-15% drop in crime in countries where they adopted this method.",
        "On the other hand, the main demerit of having fixed punishments for all captives is it will be complete injustice to some of them as there will be some criminals whose crime would not be major as others captives. The other negative of having similar punishments will not wipe off the enemy of the society but it will further create more criminals. For example, a report submitted by the justice court indicated that there was nearly increase in double of crimes after executing the jailers with identical punishments.",
        "To conclude, different punishments should be given to inmates according to the severity of the crime committed by the convict. This essay discussed the pros and cons of giving alike punishments to culprits and also discussed why giving unchanged punishments to these prisoners has its own advantages but why having inconsistent punishment for all inmates is ultimately superior."
