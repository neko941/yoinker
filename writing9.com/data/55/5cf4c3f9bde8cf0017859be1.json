As a result, some chefs often make dishes which are considered to be substandard. By consuming these types of food menus, numerous people suffer from different illnesses, for example, diarrhoea, stomach-ache.",
        "On the other hand, ready-made food is now popular among all kinds of people because of it's multiple advantages. Firstly, in today's age, all the people are busy with their respective jobs.
