        "In recent years, the deaths and injuries associated with many dangerous sports are giving serious concern to the society. Some people, therefore, think that all extreme sports should be banned, and yet I would argue that people should have the rights to choose any sports.",
        "It sounds logical that a ban on all dangerous sporting activities is advisable.After all, people relish the sports at the risk of health or even life.\u00a0It is highly possible that people get hurt when they take hazardous actions.Take cliff diving for example, it is an extreme sport that involves diving into water from high rocky cliffs. Divers can travel in excess of 60-70 mile per hour when they hit the water. Injuries, like abrasion, compression fracture, even spinal damage, are definitely possible. Hence, for the sake of safety, these dangerous sports ought to be banned..",
        "On the other hand, doing away with these sports, to some extent, violates people\u2019s freedom. People are born to be free in regards to their choices as long as they do no harm to others and the community. Engaging in extreme sports poses no risk to others. Instead, it is simply a form of exploring. As a result, forbidding these sports deprives people of the access to wonderful things. For example, should deep sea diving be prohibited, people would have to say farewell to the undersea world, let alone those various undersea creatures such as ribbon eels..",
        "In conclusion, while acknowledging the real risks, the liberty of individuals to take part in sports of their own choice should be retained."
