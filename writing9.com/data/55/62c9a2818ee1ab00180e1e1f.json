        "It is true that many residents in several countries are becoming more and more interested in survey about the history of the house and building where they living in recent years. There are a variety of possible reasons for this, and approaches people can use to research these histories.",
        "In my opinion, three main factors are to blame for the situation these residents behave in these countries at present. Firstly, modern people live in a better and better way in these countries. That is to say, they don\u2019t nervous for the lack of foods, water or other living facilities. Therefore, they will feel bored and don\u2019t what to do, then the survey for habitat history just meets them. Secondly, they are curious about these histories, because, as we all know, the mankind is a kind of creature who has strong curiosity for anything they don\u2019t know, then they will research these while they are equipped with enough situations. Finally, people all would like to know more and more themselves, even these histories about the house and building they live in.",
        "People can use several approaches to research this. At first, they can research all old buildings and house which are relative to the place they live in, this can get more information. Then, they can interview some old people who used to live in same place, these people may know more things about these old buildings. After getting so much information, they can research some materials in library and prove the information they get, this is important for us, we must be strict with history. At last, they can ask for some experts in these areas, this is history, and get the final result for the survey plan.",
        "In conclusion, people do have more and more interest for the history of their habitat and they can use a series of approaches to find out those."
