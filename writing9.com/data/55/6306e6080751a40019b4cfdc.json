        "In the current century, due to the population leap and urbanization, there has been increased in number of waste materials in every part of the world. While a lot of countries adopt recycling methods to reduce environmental impact, there are still many countries that hardly recycle their refuse, but instead, they dumped everything into landfill. This essay will discuss why this might be the case and how to alleviate this problem.",
        "The first reason for the absence of recycling in a country is mainly due to the government not adopting official programmes about how garbage should be  ofdisposed. Therefore, people generally do not aware of the importance of recycling their refuse. To tackle this situation, the government should adopt the best plan possible in accordance with their situation and encourage people to recycle. Starting with explaining to the public what economic and environmental benefits we can have if we recycle in some correct ways. This can be done via flyers being delivered to each house and advertising on television or radio.",
        "The second reason is because of the inconvenience people have to go through. The lack of space, particularly at home, is an example of inconvenience. Recycling means having to separate bins for segregating different rubbish and, understandably some people have neither time nor the will to put extra effort. For this problem, the government has to make recycling as easy as possible. On the streets, recycling bins should be placed following each general rubbish bin, hence, people do not need to drop their reusable garbage somewhere further than normal garbage disposal.",
