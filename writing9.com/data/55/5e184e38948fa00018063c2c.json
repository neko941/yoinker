        "There is a need to consider the issue of migration of trained professionals from under developed countries to first world nations. This eassy will explore the problems , which cause this situation and propose solutions which might address them.",
        "When it comes to highly trained professionals like doctors , one of the biggest reason of moving to abroad is low salary when compared to the work load. This is beacuse , such countries doesn't have enough funds to invest on the medical industries, which in return make it difficult to pay deserving doctors. Consequently, leaving no options for them other than moving to well payed countries. To avoid this kind is incidence , the government should come up with a concrete plan, which may include incentives and reasonable salaries for the health care workers. As a result , docotors may consider in staying back and serving their own mother land .",
        "Moreover, in poor countries students tend to take their teachers for granted and doesn't respect them. For instance , there have been incidence of beating school teachers in various parts of African countries, which illustrates lack of respect for education providers. Being voilent in classrooms can be controlled by penalizing the  students and imposing harsh punishment . If the teachers realize that they are being protected and treated with respect , they might consider changing their minds about immigrating from these nations.",
        "In conclusion, two of the main reasons of proffessionals settleing in foreing land ia lack of respect and low income . However, these problems should be minimised by imposing penalties and coming up with appropriate police's respectively ."
