        "The line charts illustrate the proportion of household equipment ownerships regarding three distinct devices and how many hours per week dedicate to domestic work on average in a particular nation over a decade period beginning from 1920 to 2019.",
        "Looking from an overall perspective, it is readily apparent that the figure for ownership of all electrical appliances experienced  significant growth with refrigerators and vacuum cleaners becoming the most ubiquitous. However, a reversed trend could be observed in the amount of time allocated for doing housework.",
        "According to the first chart, by the time the refrigerator arrived in 1920, laundry machines and vacuum cleaners must have already been owned by 40% and 30% of families, respectively. Over the next 4 decades, the popularity of the refrigerator witnessed a dramatic increase, surpassing two other mechanical consumer durables due to be accepted in 90% of homes. This ratio was 20 per cent higher than that of washing machine and vacuum cleaner ownership which rose at the same pace.  From 1980 onwards, almost all families installed refrigerators and vacuum cleaners, varied from 90% to 100%. Meanwhile, in 1980, the percentage of the household utilising laundry machine experienced a slight decline by 5%, but then increased to approximately 75% at the end of surveyed phase",
        "Regarding the second chart, in the starting year, each family spent 50 hours per week on household chores, which dropped a low of 20 hours in 1960. Since then, this figure underwent several highs and lows over the following 40-years stage and started to decrease to merely 10% in 2019."
