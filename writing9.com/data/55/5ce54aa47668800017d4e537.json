        "The number of overweight children has increased tremendously within developed nations. This is an extremely serious problem which is caused by a number of factors such as poor diet and affects both the children and the society.",
        "One of the causes of overweight among children is poor diet. Children are exposed to unhealthy processed food such as fast foods which mainly contain sugar, fat and salt. Research has proven that consuming these foods tend to increase appetite which leads to overeating and overeating is directly linked to overweight. Another cause of overweight problem among children is the lack of physical exercise. Physical exercise is very important as it enables children to transform calories from food into useful energy. This is very essential because without it the calories from food will be stored as fat within",
        "the body which will eventually lead to overweight.",
        "There are several effects as a result of children of overweight.
