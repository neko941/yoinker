        "The trend of taking gap of a year after leaving school and entering to tertiary education is on increase nowadays. It could be disadvantageous for students for learning extra skills and doing job. Contrary to this, students could lose their interest in studies and could waste their time.\u00ac",
        "Taking off for a year between school and university education has numerous advantages. Firstly, individuals could increase their skillset by learning any skill related to their field of study. For instance, young students could enroll themselves in the course of Web Designing or AutoCAD depending on their choice. In this way, they would efficiently utilize their time and would remain attached with studies.  Secondly, youngsters could earn money by working in any organization. To illustrate, individuals could work as internees by joining software houses or they could opt for freelancing. Thus they would be utilizing their time productively which would give them a sense of accomplishment and contentment.",
        "On the other hand, an annual gap after completing secondary education and joining professional institutes has clear disadvantages. Firstly, youngsters could lose their interest in studies, for instance, enjoying time in playing games and sports would make them forget the environment of an academic institute. Consequently, they would resist starting studies again. Secondly, a big lot of students usually waste their time, for examples, by involving themselves in illegal activities which could spoil their future.",
        "To conclude, there are numerous drawbacks and benefits of taking gap of a year after finishing school and joining professional academic institutes. It is analyzed that the drawbacks dominate the benefits as in worst case, one could never join the university again after taking off."
