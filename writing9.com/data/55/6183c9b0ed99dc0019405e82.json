        "Online shopping has become a trend in this present scenario. People prefer online shopping rather than going to a shopping mall. I considered that online shopping has both positive and negative impacts on individuals and companies.",
        "There are several reasons why people choose online shopping. The first and foremost important thing is that saving time and money because people do not need to go physically for purchasing any item. For instance, today both men and women are working and they could not spend time to shopping as they have to buy their necessary products online. Furthermore, companies provide free delivery so humans can save money. Therefore, online shopping gives immense benefits.",
        "Another point to consider buying online means it is more benefical for companies. Firstly, companies can promote their products more and more through applications and websites because buyers search of anything on websites. Secondly, companies offer the best services and discounts so they can get customer satisfaction as well as good reviews. Hence, online shopping is also helpful to companies.",
        "On the other hand, there are some disadvantges also of online buying is that, sometimes fragile products would be broken during delivery. In addition, clients lose their money during online shopping. For example, people have to do online shopping with their plastic money and the details are hacked by hackers. Apart from that, the customers return the product to the company after using because they are not happy with the product and ask for a refund.",
        "In conclusion, online shopping plays an inevitable role in everyone life and it provides more advantages, but it has also some drawbacks and should not be neglected."
