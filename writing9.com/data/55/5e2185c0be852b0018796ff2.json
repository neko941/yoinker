        "Owing to the higher requirements of job, masses go to work under the sense of commitment and stress, even when they are sick and complete their significant tasks. This phenomenon may infect others and can be cause of serious health issues by themselves. However, in my opinion mortals must not go to work if they are suffering from any kind of illness, because it may lead to severe consequences.",
        "To begin with, people should not go to work if they are ill since it can  effects of others health. In other words, if any person is ill and work with their colleagues and therefore coworkers may be victim of same sickness as they work around the ill person. For example, respiratory diseases such as cough and cold can be quickly passed from one person to another. Apart from this, sometimes a little disease can be lead to a serious health problems if someone not taking proper rest and work continuously without taking any kind of drugs.",
        "In addition, there are more reasons that why folks should not go to work during their sickness. To be more precise, when any person is ill his or her mind is totally disturbed due to the sickness, they feel tiredness and they cannot concentrate on work properly. For example, if a healthy person do work in 30 minutes but a sick person will take 1 hour for the same work. As a result, it would be difficult for the ill person to complete the task and meet the all deadlines of their work.",
        "In conclusion, it is clear from the above discussion that there are many negative impacts if a sick person gies to work. These factors may lead to thier  serious health problems as well as thier coworkers. Therefore, i think sick people should not be allowed to do work."
