        "It goes without saying that decision making is a significant phenomenon in every person's life as it has an immense impact on one's future. It is deemed that  a person ought  to take advice from others while taking any judgment instead of deciding alone. I concur with this notion. In the following paragraphs, I will explicate my views.",
        "To commence with the reasons, many alternatives are the predominant one. To elaborate it, when a person has to decide about something, sometimes it is very hard to think about future consequences of that decision. In such situations, help from any experienced individual can be helpful. In other words, most of the students, after competition of their senior secondary education, consult with their tutors to select the branch of graduation.",
        "Along with this, some decisions may have lifelong effects on the other masses\" lives, as when a person what decides something, he is oblivious about others' losses. To exemplify, in a family, when father makes a plan to leave a job, it affects the lives of his children since they are unable to fulfil their need of education or food in the scarcity of money.",
        "To conclude, I want to reiterate that despite the decision making is one's own right, it is fruitful to discuss with others before finalising the decision."
