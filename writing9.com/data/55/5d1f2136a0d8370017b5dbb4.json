        "It is often argued that people have the legal authority to use freshwater as much as they need, while others hold that ministry should control the overuse of clean water because of its limited availability. This essay will consider whether people should utilize much water by their rights, or whether governments take the necessary formula to tightly control water utilization.",
        "A growing body of research suggests that aquwater has a positive effect on human survival. First of all, people need fresh water for various purposes, in particular, cooking and drinking, which consumed a huge amount of it. Because without cleanwater may create fatal diseases, which can lead to serious health issues too. For this reason, people using loads of fresh water daily. Furthermore, individuals are paying bills for storing water, so they don't care about the availability of this resource. One important cause of this mentality is the lack of knowledge of how this natural resource produces. For example, a recent study conducted in Indian families, which shows more than 70% of freshwater they waste daily because they think they are paying bills for that so it's their right.",
        "However, state authority could tightly control the usability of cleanwater by taking essential steps. One important step is that the government should impose a higher tax on their nation for getting water into their houses. This means that every individual and their families became more aware before wasting water.",
        "Even, the ministry must reserve particular times for supplying water. Moreover, they could create awareness about conservating water and provide valuable information on how to consume this limited resource. One clear example is, Dhaka OWASHA, they provide a brochure which shows tips and tricks to save water and proper utilization process to their clients. As a result, this organization saves a huge volume of water in a single year than in previous years.",
        "In conclusion, while people may vary in their opinions, I think that effective steps and strong laws should be taken from the ministry level to regulate the use of freshwater."
