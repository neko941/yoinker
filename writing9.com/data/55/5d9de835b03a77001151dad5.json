        "Murders have become the most popular crime in the world. The societies are punishing the murderers with a death penalty. Society tells us that kill someone is wrong, and against the law. But, they do not realize that by doing this does not make them stop their action. So, in my opinion, I agree to put murderers in life prison's punishment.",
        "To begin with, most of the world's population are acting that crime is one of the worst action and need a huge punishment, but they never thought that they need to act better to make our world become more peaceful and also harmonize. However, when we put murderer to a death penalty, it doesn't mean that it will give many changes to our environment, instead it will make all the criminals tries to do something worse.",
        "Moreover, when the killer is killing people, this is mean that they have tremendous anger that that keep inside,because most of the people are stabbing each other because they needs to get their revenge on someone due to their bad habit, or debt, and many other factors. So, when we do a death penalty it will make the killers' families and friends are left behind and sometimes they will feel a tremendous anger and think about get their revenge into the society, so it will put more life in danger, and usually this cycle will happen again and again, which can make our environment become more scary and bad.",
        "In summarize, we have to put our criminals, especially murderer into life prison's punishement rather than death punishment, because they will feel more anxious and scared when think about spending the rest of their life time inside the jail"
