        "Generally speaking, it has been argued by a number of people that monumental structures be demolished to give way to the construction of new ones. In my opinion, I strongly disagree with this argument as I see preserving famous structures as being an evidence of our cultural heritage and also a means of revenue to the government.",
        "One reason why I disagree with the view of erecting new buildings in place of old ones is that ancient structures are proofs of our various cultures.  They help us rember our roots by the tales that surround their existence. Moreover, these tales have been passed down from one generation to another thus, helping to reflect, preserve and maintain our heritage. However, destroying these landmarks will only aid in the possibility of faded histories. For example, in Nigeria, the popular badagry slave house has been kept over the years and this house holds stories and myths about the slave trade which are been told to people.",
        "Another reason for disagreeing with the view is that ancient structures can be an avenue for the government to make additonal revenue. This is by making these historical sites become tourist centres which will definitely attract people from all over the world who will be more than willing to pay any fee levied to access them. For example, the famous Egyptian pyramid that has been in existence for centuries attracts miilions of people yearly.  Sales of entry tickets from tourist add immensely to the national income of Egypt.",
        "To sum up, the benefits of keeping old structures such as it addition to governmental revenue and it being an evidence for cultural existence are reasons why i strongly dis agree to their replacement with modern buildings."
