        "A large number of people in some nations are opting to have a vegetarian food. This essay argues that the advantages of adopting such diet outweigh the disadvantages because vegatarian food is cheap and harmless.",
        "The average cost of buying fruits and vegetables is much lower as compared to meat. That is to say, people belonging to different socio-economic status are able to afford and consume a vegetarian diet. It not only helps them to reduce their spendings but also makes it possible to save some money. For example, a recent survey in London revealed that some families were able to save more than 20% of their annual income after becoming vegetarians because the cost of food was low.",
        "Another reason why a vegatarian diet is beneficial is that it contains less fats and more nutrients. In other words, meat contains high levels of fats and cholesterol, which is harmful for our well-being. By choosing to become a vegetarian, people could save themselves and acquire all essential vitamins and other nutrients present in fruits and vegetables. For instance, a recent study conducted by New York University revealed  that vegetarians were at low risk of developing lifestyle diseases such as diabetes or hypertension as compared to non-vegetarians because of the high nutritional value of a vegetarian food.",
        "To conclude, more and more people prefer to have a vegetarian diet because it is low in price and it does not cause any harm to our body."
