        "Some believe that city offers better life while others consider that the countryside is the best place to live in. Although city provides more employment opportunities for people, however, I believe that better air quality makes the countryside, the best place to live in.",
        "On the one hand, it is considered that city comprises of more companies compared to countryside. That is to say, as the demand for human workforce is high in cities, there are more opportunities for people in various job positions which makes their chances for getting a job offer comparatively high. For example, in Chennai, there are nearly 3000 IT companies and still many companies are looking to recruit people. However, I believe that despite the fact of enormous jobs offers in city, people prefer to stay in countryside as good health should be paramount.",
        "On the other hand, there are less pollutants released in the countryside. This is because there are less vehicles on road , which means that the release of harmful gases like carbon di-oxide is exceptionally low compared to city side, thereby improving the quality of air. For instance, recent survey conducted by Indian Environmental Control Board showed that many places in countryside has ranked better for human survival compared to metropolitan cities as the percentage of fumes in less. I am of the view that better environment contributes to better health thereby improving their life span.",
        "To conclude, though city side is known for the job offers it provides, however I completely agree that countryside is best place because of the less air pollution."
