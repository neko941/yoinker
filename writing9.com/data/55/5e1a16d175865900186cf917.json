        "Tutors are increasingly given their students assignments. While some people think it is unnecessary to give school children homework, others are of the view that giving a child home exercise plays a crucial role in the academic growth of that child. This essay seeks to discuss why giving a child home lessons is ultimatly superior even though not giving young adults home tasks has it benefits.",
        "On the one hand, some parents believe that it is not essential to give their wards take home exercises. This is because they believe that teachers are paid to put their offsprings through the needed lessons to excel academically. For instance, guardians tend to be very busy that they are unable to provide the necessary guide to help their kids with their learning tasks. Thus, they are of the idea that home exercises for school children is unnecessary.",
        "On the other hand, some persons are of the view that home lessons is an plays an essential part in a young adult academic background and I agree. This is owing to the idea that a child who takes educational lessons home to practice tend to excel very well in his/her research skill. For example, a study carried out in some part of Asia shows that individuals with great research ability did a lot of homework. For this reason, some guardians encourage their child's instructor to him/her tasks to do outside the four walls of a classroom.",
        "In conclusion, there are varying stance on the essence of giving academic tasks to be done in a child's residence. This essay discussed why giving out of class educational lessons is better off than not giving one."
