        "With modern technology becoming increasingly accessible, some people believe that open libraries have lost their usefulness while others disagree. However, in my opinion, whether or not public libraries are relevant depends on the needs of the individual concerned.",
        "On the one hand, a growing number of people are of the view that public libraries are becoming obsolete for a number of reasons. Firstly, with the advent of recent technology like laptop and smart devices, people can now setup e-libraries with access to a collection of several books just by a finger click. They also believe that public libraries do not give room for flexibility in terms of schedule. Generally speaking, open libraries have fixed timetables and as such, access to books and educational materials could be hindered at any other time outside schedule. A prime example is Amazon bookstore where people have access to several books round the clock. It is therefore understandable why people hold this opinion.",
        "Conversely, other people argue that public libraries promote work ethics, teach time management and boost tourism. In the majority of cases, traditional libraries maintain a high level of serenity and discipline. Over time, people tend to inculcate these virtues which eventually manifest in their homes and workplace. Furthermore, people learn time management as against studying on smart phones which comes with much distractions. Finally, traditional libraries are monuments for tourist attraction owing to the fact they house ancient periodicals and scrolls. For instance, the international library of Athens has the scrolls of the great Albert Einstein and this has become a center of tourism.",
        "However, as convincing as the points raised are, i believe whether public libraries are important or not, depends solely on a person's need. People in need of quick materials would benefit greatly from online resources, while those that require older texts with no trace of them on the internet will in no doubt benefit immensely from the variety of resources public libraries haveto offer",
        "In conclusion, although public libraries instill discipline as well as ensure the preservation of antiquities they offer, it takes a longer time to access the resources. But whether or not they are still important in today's world, lies completely on the specific needs of individuals."
