        "In this modern era, where technology has become more and more to easily to access it was impacted the children. Amount of violence in computer games such as TV Programmes and leisure activities was influenced the child's to copy that. In my opinion it can develop the children to do a harm thing to each others.",
        "Firstly, the developers of games try to make an interesting game where most of the games was including the violence, such as shooting, killing or punching. The child's are interested by that kind of game, for example is God Of war and GTA. Both of the games has become the most selling games all of time, which is full of violence. additionally, TV programs such as UFC and smack down also so popular in children. These sport are about violence, in some case they are using chairs or tables as a tool to fight. In late 2006, a junior high school was dead by an accident when a group of students play a smacdown. This dead is cause when one of them try to copy what he saw in TV. In the other hand, smackdown athletes was a professional athletes which is when they fought it just an action.",
        "There are so many children was harm because play smackdown, then smackdown was banned by goverment. It works for a couple of years, but in this era with the growth of tecnology, too many access to children to get access to find violence. In 2020 the government also ban some websites where have violence contents. The websites are too many to be ban, moreover, there are many vpns which is helps child's to through the banned websites. This is why parents must be give a characters education to their children, such as to avoid the violence.",
        "In conclussion, all the violence contents can't be banned by goverment because of the growth of technolgy. Parents must explain to their child to avoid the violence."
