        "There has always been a debate on what role should a government play in the society. While one group argue that they are meant to provice defense and basic infrastructure like roads, railways, water, electricity etc. and all other necessities like health, education and social security are ought to be provided by private sector or individuals. I totally disagree with this idea and this essay will discuss both the view points.",
        "On the one hand, few people beleive that governments are only meant to provide protection and other basic needs of citizens and rest should be taken care by private firms. The main reason that they say is that money should be invested on matters that affects everyone. Their point of view is to make people independant and bear their own needs in other means. For instance, they see education as a luxuary rather than a necessity and hence it is not required to be funded by the governments. Also, since it is not true that everyone will utilize hospital facilities in a lifetime, they consider this as indivudual needs and does not want everyone to pay for this.",
        "On the other hand, others including me believe that it is a governing body's responsibility to work for the betterment of people in all aspects. Health and eduaction should be a basic necessity and should not be ignored. Not everyone will be able to bear the expences of private firms and hence government should provide these to common man. They are supposed to treat everyone equally and hence all these aforementioned necessities have to be provided. The rich may be able to afford private facilities but the poor will be the one suffering.",
        "To conclude, the development of a country and the standard of living of people depennds on those who have the authority. In my opinion, a government must be capable of doing both these there by creating a healthy living conditions for the nation."
