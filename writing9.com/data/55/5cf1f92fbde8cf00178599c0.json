        "In todays contemporary era, it should not be overlooked that due to advancement of technology average age of people has risen, which has surfaced a rational question. Due to elevation in teenagers, in some nations around the globe, ratio of inhabitants and retirees upsurges. As far as my views are considered, this scenario has more disadvantages than advantages on a global scale. Both aspects will be discussed in the ensuing paragraphs.",
        "To begin with, any ruling body across the world are being evaluated by the number of older people they are having in their border. This is because older people have not only some valuable experience, but also in depth virtuals are embedded in their nature. Moreover, mentioned attributes can directly impact on economy and GDP. To support the sentence, one of the articles in The New York Times had published that 62% of retirees had actively participated for technological revolution and globalization, whilst only 25% of youngster were the part of the same. Furthermore, Patience is the other characterstic why older are considered liquid money.",
        "Although it can not be overlooked that teenagers are having so much potential in terms of energy and enthusiasm, in most of the cases they are misdirected. For instance, a recent survey, surprisingly, gathered the data that youngsters are moody and not obeying any ritual method, which led them to miss their target. To add, discpline is the other key criteria where yonger force is lagging.",
        "To conclude, it can be finally commented that there any many downsides, if the adults will not be rightly handled, but old age people definitely help them to work out. Therefore, considering the prescribed bullet points, it can be said that disadvantages outweigh advantages."
