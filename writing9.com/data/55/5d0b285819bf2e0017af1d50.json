        "Many nations in today's world has seen many individuals from various ethnicity purchase unique hairstyles and shop for modern wares based on the current trend in the fashion industry. This could be as a result of Peer pressure or Age adaptation, which could lead to unhealthy competition as well as aid bad behaviour within the society.",
        "One major reason why people purchase wares and hair style is as a result of Peer pressure. Especially the growing youths of this days who wants to belong and won't mind to do what others do to get things done. This includes stealing so as to meet up with the current trend even when the capacity is not there. Another point worthy of note is the issue of adaptation to age, Whereby people adapt to one class of age so as to meet the current trend. Like the old school haircut as well as the old school wares.",
        "In my opinion, this is a negative development owing to the fact that such could lead to unhealthy competition amongst peer groups where by one individual will feel oppressed with the other based on their hair style or the kind of cloths worn. Some groups of individuals use this opportunity to create a sense of belonging for themselves by having a unique way of both hair and dress style. A perfect example is the cultist who dresses uniquely to identify themselves in time of trouble.",
        "In conclusion, the current trend of fashion and hairstyle also has its value in the sense that various groups use them for identification during functions and its make the group unique in all sense."
