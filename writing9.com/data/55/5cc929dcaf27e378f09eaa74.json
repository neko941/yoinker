        "A famous quip that all of us have heard is that \u2018first impression is the last impression\u2019. Few individuals believe that to bag a good employment opportunity, one must perform well during his/her interview. This essay agrees with the statement because the employer wants an employee of high tenacity and worthiness.",
        "When an applicant sits for a face to face interview, he/she is tested to check how well they can handle pressure. Due to the priority of the work, an employee is needed to have an unflappable mindset, so that they can perform well under critical situation. An example of this is a famous Indian cricketer, Mahendra Singh Dhoni. By achieving excellancy not just as a good player but also as a rewarding caption, he exemplifies that one must have calm nerves to handle any pressure. If one fumbles alot and does not radiate confidence, then he/she will be considered weak-hearted and under-qualified for the job.",
        "If a person performs well in an interview, then the interviewer will have confidence in him/her because, not only have he/she survived the pressure well enough, the person also has a go-getter attitude and consists good knowledge to fit the job requirements. Although it might seem very hard, but getting the interviewer to have confidence in one will tip the scales into the favor of the person sitting for the one-on-one discussion. And this can only happen if one exhibits well during the test. A research from California State University suggests that out of the people who gave the same interview, only 2% were able to do exceedingly great and bagged the confidence of the employer.",
        "In conclusion, making a good first impression is vital. Some people think that individuals can get good jobs by doing well in their interview. I strongly agree with the statement because, when one is interviewed, they are judged on the basis of how well they handle pressure and if one can get confidence of an interviewer by making a good impression, the chances of their getting the job will be boosted."
