        "A group of people has come up with a moot point that old buildings should not be repaired and renovated but instead, demolished and new one constructed with more amenities and stores to accommodate more number of families with extra comfort. I completely agree with the innovative idea, to support it I shall enumerate some arguments.",
        "Admittedly, old buildings are constructed in traditional ways which have one or two floors which can accommodate maximum two families. However, latest skyscrapers can facilitate more people. Additionally, properly planned and engineered new buildings consume less space thus, extra space can be used as parking or for gardens. Apartments are one of the examples of multi-story buildings in urban areas.",
        "In addition to this, modern buildings are built with many technological gadgets like fire alarm and security cameras. Nowadays, these machineries are become crucial for any building in metropolitan cities. Modern buildings are designed and constructed with these facilities. Apart from this, some commercial complex and houses are built with in-built solar system, which is again helpful to save electricity.",
        "On the other hand, repairing and maintaining heritage and cultural building is also necessary. Such buildings provide identity to the place. Also it helps in developing tourism and generating a revenue to the Government and local suppliers. For example, Taj Mahal, one of the seven wonders, is landmark for India and thousands of tourist visit there every year.",
        "In conclusion, looking to the advantages offered by modern multi-story construction, I reiterate that old residential and commercial buildings should be knock down to construct new ones more floors and security system."
