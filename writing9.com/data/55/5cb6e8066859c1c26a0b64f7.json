        "Co-education schools plays a vital role in many countries due to its benefits. Others, however, argue that single-sex school seem to screen out a lot of gender issues that affect the student development. I believe that the advantages of mixed school outweigh the single-sex school pros.",
        "On the one hand, there are two main reasons that lead to the essential of separate schools. First of all, student do not have to struggle with the competition from other gender which make them get risks. According to the analysis of many scientists, female is superior to male in the class due to their patience in any circumstance and it sometimes make male students feel frustrated. Secondly, in the single-sex schools, children have many opportunities to improve their skills equally like other friends. For instance, boys are good at some physical subjects while girls interested in art subjects.",
        "On the other hand, many reports concretely prove that the mixed schools ought to strengthen the relationship between male and female students. As a result, there are lots of harmful effects but it may prepare for children how to deal with those influences. In addition, students not only make friends with people in other gender but they are also able to learn from each other. For example, if boys extremely good at math, they may teach for their girlfriends and improve together.",
        "In conclusion, both these type of schools have their own benefits but I strongly believe that co-education schools make an outstanding contribution to the sustainable improvement of students."
