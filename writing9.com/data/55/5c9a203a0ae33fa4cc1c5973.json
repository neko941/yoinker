        "Purchasing items via internet became the most likely method for different kind of products. I see that electronic shopping advantages are much more than its disadvantages.",
        "First of all, electronic shopping leads to lower prices than the regular way of shopping. The electronic stores save a lot of expenses that considered to be essentials in the physical stores. For example, the traditional store need to pay property's rent, labour salaries, governmental fees, constructions, decorations, and electricity bills. However, electronic stores do not require these expenses which resulted in decreasing the costs and offering lower prices to the end customer.",
        "Secondly, electronic shopping allows businesses to expand their targeted customers regardless their geographical location. While logistic networks became larger and packages delivery turned to be faster, electronic stores found a new method to increase their sales by reaching customers who can not reach the physical store. For instance, offering products through electronic store or social media allow more customers to purchase the products and increase businesses profits.",
        "In addition, electronic stores are accessible anytime which saves customers time and effort. Customers usually need to plan their shopping trips to be able to visit most of the targeted shops. However, through electronic shopping the customers can explore very different kind of products anytime anywhere regardless the physical location of the store.",
        "In conclusion, electronic shopping became very popular since it provides variety of options to the customer with lower prices. Furthermore, it increases businesses revenue since it helps them to expand customers base."
