        "The average age of people getting married and giving birth is rising these days. Most people tend to settle down in their thirties which is completely different compared to the past. This essay will discuss why I believe that this is largely a positive development even though there are a few drawbacks associated with this trend.",
        "There are various compelling reasons to explain why we are positively impacted by this development and the prominent reason for this is that the majority of people will be financially ready to step into marriage and welcome newborns in their thirties as they are likely to have stable careers and income at that time which enables them to cope with financial burdens involved with marriage and children more easily and effortlessly. To illustrate, younger couple tend to struggle to deal with more issues such as increasing living costs and high children educational costs. For this reason, settling down when they are older is beneficial for the society.",
        "However, some oppose this notion and says that it\u2019s hard for some individuals especially women to go back to work after their honeymoon or maternity leave as some work domains can be competitive and fast-paced so they could miss many significant opportunities during their absence. To illustrate, a recent research conducted in Japan has revealed that nearly 80% of women will choose to get married and perceive their children before 30 if they are pursuing a higher achievement in the workplace. As can be seen, this development can be also detrimental to someone\u2019s future.",
        "To sum up, the tendency of getting married and giving birth after 30 for most people has become increasingly common. Taking everything into considerations, I\u2019m inclined to say that this is largely a positive development even though there are a few drawbacks associated with this."
