        "In today\u2019s competitive world, the higher ups desire to communicate with the subordinates even during the leave periods.  The employers follow this trend to efficiently manage emergency situations, however, I believe that such development has more disadvantages in terms of employee health risks and less social connectivity.",
        "To begin with, employees\u2019 accessibility is essential to maintain smooth business operations. Some occupations, such as, the medical demand the staff members to work on holidays too; to meet the strict deadlines or handle any sudden case. For instance, despite the fact the subordinates are on holidays, innumerable working categories with multiple critical situations ranging from doctors to treat the emergency patients, police officers to investigate the street felonies or the engineers to complete the presentation tasks beforehand, corresponds to few cases where it becomes compulsory to keep in touch with the former. Therefore, the top management bodies feel it necessary to contact their workers to smoothly manage urgent work calls.",
        "On the flip side, communicating with employees on holidays has drawbacks too. Firstly, overworking leads to insalubrious life. An Individuals\u2019 mind already gets exhausted during working hours and do not have the tendency to fulfill more tasks. When the individuals are overburdened, they are more likely to prone to various mental disorders such as the stress and depression, as the employees do not find time for relaxation.  To illustrate, the American Psychologist, John Smith, reported that 65% of his patients were taking relaxants to relieve their minds from hectic work environment. Secondly, calls from the boss, in off days, can affect the people\u2019s social behavior as they usually plan outings during the leave period to spend quality time with the love ones.",
        "To conclude, sometimes, the serious circumstances make it essential for the employer to keep in touch with the employees. However, the drawbacks of this prevalent trend including mental illness and less time for family activities rule out the advantages."
