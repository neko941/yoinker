        "Nowadays, people listen to music for various reasons. There is local music and music intended for an international audience. Both types of music are equally important to the society",
        "Firstly, music is known to reduce stress thereby improving the overall health status of an individual. It has been found that listening to some genres of music for example classical music relaxes the brain which is why some therapists use it as a form of therapy for patients with some form of stress disorders. Also music helps to improve sleep. This is evident as some mothers use lullaby to initiate sleep in their children.",
        "Local music helps to preserve culture because most are designed to depict the culture and tradition of the people it represents. Some lyrics give information about specific countries or tribe and this is passed down from generation to generation. For example is the folk music of the Hausa tribe in Nigeria which is played at their wedding ceremonies.",
        "As important as the local music is, it should not replace international music which helps to provide information about certain things happening in other parts of the world. For instance, a song by a popular American artiste who sang about the wars and mass hysteria in some African countries in 2010.",
        "In conclusion, it can be seen that music is needed to improve health and sleep and both local and international music are equally important to a society. They should be developed and encouraged to preserve culture and keep people informed."
