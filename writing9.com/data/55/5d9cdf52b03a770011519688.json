        "In today's competitive era, education plays an indispensable role in each and every individual's life and in the growth of the country. Due to escalating university fees and unemployment rates, many people think that university's should provide only practical courses rather than teaching theoretical subjects. I completely agree with the statement and will discuss in the upcoming paragraphs.",
        "To begin with, there would be multiple merits for the students who will learn practical skills or subjects in the university. Firstly, they will have great knowledge about their field as they are studying about their faculty from the university. Secondly, students will be very experienced they will not face any difficulty at workplace and would be more able to handle any adverse condition efficiency. Moreover, skills open a gateway of employment for a skilled person.",
        "Furthermore, if the graduates merely have bookish information they will not capable of working in office accurately as well as they will not have experience. Along with this, they will get depressed in intricate situations since they do not have practical knowledge. A survey was conducted on both people who did their graduation with practical subjects and others who gained only theoretical knowledge, hence individuals are more successful who has abilities and skills.",
        "To conclude, nowadays in the modern world life skills is essential as they utilize the region of work and make a person cofident to cope with the competition."
