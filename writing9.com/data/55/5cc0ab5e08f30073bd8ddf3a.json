        "It is true that young single people prefer leaving to work or study rather than staying with their parents until they get married. In my opinion, advantages outweigh the disadvantages of this trend.",
        "On the one hand, there are many beneficial aspects of living on one's own. Firstly, it brings responsibilities such as shopping or paying the bills, and these make people learn how to manage their budget. Secondly, these kinds of responsibilities push a young bachelor to get mature, and individuals develop a broad perspective for various situations. Taking responsibility brings analytical thinking together, because it requires planning and implementation for daily life. Third advantage is the freedom of development of one's own ruleset and applying them. For instance, as individuals, young people want to behave according to their own requirements instead of their parents'. Staying with parents would include the compliance of parents' rules. However, in their own environment, youngsters would adjust their rules and find their way to live, which leads for all their life.",
        "On the other hand, some people believe that there are disadvantages of bachelor living. Living on one's own means being alone at home, and previously shared housework will be required to be done alone. However, in today's world, the household appliances are mostly developed, and the housework will not take too much time. As a second disadvantage, leaving parents means earning money for a living and it is thought as early at that ages. However, for a one-person living, a part-time job would be adequate, and will not steal from the time to study. For the other case, individuals already leave home to work and be on their own feet. In both cases, the work life is beneficial for the bachelors to make their own life.",
        "In conclusion, I believe that leaving home before getting married and having one's own living has many advantages outweighing the disadvantages."
