        "In the 21st century, technology has grown manifold, resulting in easy and cheap availability of internet to all, particularly children. Here, they browse all kinds of websites and interact with strangers, which can lead to disastrous consequences. This essay will discuss the risks of children accessing the internet unsupervised, and also provide solutions to prevent serious complications.",
        "Nowadays, cyber crimes are extremely prevalent. Children, being soft targets, are influenced via online chats, and are subsequently kidnapped or even killed. Here, they learn violence, and sometimes, are radicalised to join militant organisations. To cite an example, many young children were systematically brainwashed to commit suicide via the online game, Blue Whale. Thus, it is well known that, internet is not a safe place for children, especially without the guidance of an adult.",
        "These problems, however, are largely preventable. Children should be given a device that has access to only educational or recreational websites, with little scope for social interaction. Moreover, the devices used by parents should be password protected as well. For example, many websites, such as Youtube and Netflix, filter out a lot of graphic content, if they know that a child has logged in. These steps, if followed vigilantly, can go a long way in preventing such crimes.",
        "To conclude, internet is a bi-edged sword, with a number of potential risks and complications. However, stringent monitoring and regulating the content they can view, can help avoid such situations."
