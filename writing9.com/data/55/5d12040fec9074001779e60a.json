        "Advances in technology have made  human\u2019s life easier in comparison to the past. There are two opposing points of view  in regard to the advantages and disadvantages of applying  artificial intelligence technology which is known as \u201cAI\u201d. In this essay, I will discuss that, although AI technology has brought many benefits to our life, some drawbacks should be considered as well.",
        "On the one hand, human\u2019s life has been  facilitated by  advent of the AI technology in many ways. For example, today\u2019s robots are applied in many factories, because they are more accurate and significantly precious than human. Another application of artificial intelligence technology can be seen in aerospace industries which is more sensitive than the rest of industries. The need of applying robots and intelligence command center to control all the procedures is essential. To illustrate, NASA has been utilizing many somewhat robots and AI technologies to launch their rockets successfully. However, there are some negative aspects around AI technology which influence the positive points of their application.",
        "On the other hand, human  would face with some drawbacks of usage intelligent technologies. For instance, increasing trend of human workforce replacement with robots, unemployment rate subsequently will increase. As a negative consequence of this phenomenon, the crime commitment rate will be influenced significantly by these changes. Another important point of this trend could be seen in the individuals\u2019 behavior  when they miss their job and will not have a sense of purpose to the future. The most vital concern which has engaged human\u2019s attraction is the future\u2019s power of robots and intelligence machines against humankind, which would be an obvious threat for our future. Because these  machines will optimize their generation and try to develop themselves without human oversight.",
        "Inconclusion, although artificial intelligence has brought a bunch of benefits to the world, the dark side of applying these technologies and their threats to the human being is undeniable part of this scenario. The governments should consider the future danger of this technology\u2019s improvement and have sufficient surveillance on them to prevent probable accidents in the coming years."
