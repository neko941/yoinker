        "Libraries are ocean of knowledge, where people can get all the books related to different aspects of the world. However, digital era has covered the materialistic things believed by a few in society. I would elucidate both the views in following paragraphs.",
        "To begin with, upsurge technology has changed the lifestyle of people by giving them access to internet and electronic media, through which they can read numerous soft copies. Owing tom this number of educational institutions has also launched e-books which would save the valuable time. For example, going to library will consume time and money as well, but accessing the information through internet media will save the ample of time of an individual. Moreover, it is becoming more convenient to search a printed work and reading it anywhere without going to library.",
        "Although, a library is beneficial for myriad reasons. A researcher can mark and highlight the main points and read all the related information on a single platform. Furthermore, there are some unique books which are not available on electronic media. For example, legislature books, epic and circular related books. Umpteen publications has thousands of pages, which makes them difficult to upload all these on websites; public book rooms provide all these heavy volumes to readers.",
        "In conclusion, it is acceptable that online medium can provide number of publications on a click but we can not deny the importance of library and I agree that libraries helps in storing and maintaining the authentic books which are precious and irreplaceable."
