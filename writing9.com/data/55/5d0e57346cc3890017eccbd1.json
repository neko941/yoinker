        "It is believed by some matter experts that, it is better to introduce an international language at an early school rather than in secondary school. This essay outlines pros and cons before giving reasons why the positives outweigh the negative.",
        "Learning a new dialect at tender age helps the children to gain proficiency in it till the later years of their education. It helps the offspring\u2019s to focus on it in the same way as on their mother tongue. Young pupils are innocent and they do not distinguish in between two language. Further, this would open the gates of employment opportunities in their own country as well as in the foreign land where this language is widely used. For example, a child learning French in school will be able to speak and write it easily and has high chances of getting a job in Europe. With this in mind, other country\u2019s vernaculars should be included in initial classes.",
        "Conversely, studying a different kind of language can create an extra burden on infants and this can lead to stress in them. Some kids might not be able to cope with it, as understanding these new assignments are never easy. For example, pupils have to devote extra time in coping with the new subject, which would results in less time which they devote to playing.",
        "To sum up, while there are disadvantages such as more stress and reduced time to get involve in personal activities, these must be weighed against having proficiency in a particular country\u2019s native language and ample job opportunities it offers. The prospect of broadening young kids horizon at an early stage is a positive which outweighs all negatives"
