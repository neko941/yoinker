        "\u201cWhen most people hear the term geography, they immediately begin to think of maps, but it is so much more than that. To understand why studying geography is relevant, you must first understand what it means. Geography is the study of places, landscapes, environments, and people, and how they have affected each other over time to become what it is today. It combines natural sciences (physical geography) and social sciences (human geography) in a way no other field of science does.\u201d I was 14 when I first read this quote in my class, back then, I thought I really understood what it meant. To learn and understand how the world\u2019s basic physical systems work and affect our everyday life, studying geography is essential. This subject has embedded its root deep inside every other subject and in order to discover the mystery of life there\u2019s nothing better than becoming a geographer",
        "ACADEMIC BACKGROUND:",
        "I am Taniya Choudhury. I have completed my schooling from Nayabazar High School. I scored 79% (2011) in my secondary examination and I have taken Arts as my subjects in 11th, 12th standards and secured 82% in the Intermediate Examination (2013).   Then I moved to Siliguri to obtain B.A. degree in Geography Honours from Siliguri College.  I have finished my course with Geography as my main subject; Political Science and History in Pass. During my course I have realized that this subject is an unending ocean of knowledge covering wide areas of interests. I\u2019ve learned the basics of Physical and human geography along with handling weather and levelling instruments. In the third year of my college, I\u2019ve performed a group work on \u2018Population Dynamics and Socio-Demographic profile of Toto Community in Totopara\u2019 under the supervision of my professor. There I was qualified with 62.25% (2016). Afterwards, my performance assured me a seat in the Department of Geography in the University of North Bengal. I had to submit two individual projects during the 2nd and the 4th semester. These are, \u2018Project Report on Land Capability Classification of Temi Tarku Block by USDA Method\u2019 and \u2018Morphology and Terrain Analysis of Rimbi Chu Basin\u2019 respectively, where I also learned to use software like Global Mapper, Arc GIS, Surfer, and SPSS . I maintained a consistent performance in the academics and being in the top 1% of class of 52 students by securing an aggregate of 66.5% (2018). I\u2019ve accomplished two years of Bachelor of Education degree from \u2018The West Bengal University of Teachers\u2019 Training, Education Planning and Administration\u2019 (2020) as well. Now, again I would like to pursue my Master\u2019s in Geography from University of Melbourne; however, I was forced to take a one year pause due to this pandemic situation.",
        "During the 3rd semester of my post-graduation (2017), I took part in 2nd Regional Science Congress, which was organised by the government of West Bengal and received an outstanding paper award for the paper \u2018Spatio-Temporal Variability and Trends of Rainfall by South-West Monsoon over North Bengal\u2019 and thereafter, I attended 25th Regional Science Congress (2018). In the year 2018, I\u2019ve participated in UGC sponsored SAP DRS-II National Seminar, where I presented a paper related to landslide. I\u2019ve presented my paper based on climate change in the National Seminar on CLIMSES organised by Bangiyo Bhugol Mancha in collaboration with Siliguri College (2020). A webinar was attended by me, which was initiated by the \u2018International Scientific Conference- Dendro-ecology, Forest Management and Reforestation: theoretical and applied aspects\" (Ufa, Russia on 5-6 October, 2020) and published a research paper on \u2018Habitat Destruction and its Probable Impact on Wildlife in Mahananda Wildlife Sanctuary\u2019 in the international journal \u2018Ecobiotech\u2019 (third issue, ISSN: 2618-964X, , 2020). On 27th September, 2020, I took part in another national webinar conducted by Maynaguri College namely, \u2018Emerging Issues and Challenges in Social Science: A Retrospect during the Period of Covid-19 Pandemic\u2019.",
        "As soon as I decided to pursue my Master\u2019s in Australia, I realized the need to improve my communication and language skills as I\u2019ve studied in Bengali medium, where English used to be a second language. I took the help from a few online resources to improve my command over this language. I appeared for IELTS Academic examination on 14th and 16th September, 2021. These are my scores:",

        "CO-CURRICULUM:",
        "I\u2019m a firm believer in the fact that extracurricular activities can empower learners to gain vital experience and skills to lead them on the path to a bright future. Right from my childhood, I was very active in this domain. I took keen interest in painting and sculpturing and continued till now; however, I do not have any formal education in these fields. I\u2019ve learned two Indian classical dance forms namely, Katthak and Rabindranrittya. I\u2019ve performed in numerous programs, my last performance was in an international seminar (31st IGI). I used to lead the \u2018cultural committee\u2019 of the Department of Geography in the University and successfully ran the reunion ceremony in our department. Along with that I\u2019m also inclined towards recitation. Currently, I\u2019m learning French from IILS and playing a guitar. I\u2019ve participated in various competitions and won trophies as well, like in debate competition, extemporary speech and story-telling. To illustrate, in the second year of my college, I got second position in a debate competition. I wrote poems and informative essays in school and University magazines. Since 2017, I\u2019ve developed my interest in wildlife photography and hiking. As a consequence, I\u2019ve some trekking experiences. For instance, I\u2019ve trekked to the highest point of West Bengal: Sandakphu (11,930 ft). I believe all of these co-curricular activities instilled immense confidence in me and had a chance of improving my creativity, critical thinking, leadership capabilities and communication skills to a great extent.",
        "COMMUNITY SERVICE:",
        "Personally, I reckon, helping others is the best way to help myself. Consequently, I\u2019ve joined one NJO called SNAP in the year 2017. There, I had organised and participated in number of seminars to educate local residents about the importance of preserving ecosystem and wildlife, such as \u2018Vulture conservation Program\u2019, \u2018Human-Animal Conflict\u2019 and so on. I also did some field work to reduce human-animal conflict in forest villages of North Bengal with the help of SNAP members. Even during this pandemic situation we\u2019ve assisted some forest villagers by supplying daily commodities, in the outskirts of Siliguri. Individually I\u2019ve designed a magazine (second vol., 2021) for this group. During university days, with the help of my four other friends, we raised a fund by selling dumplings to help the leprosy ward at Siliguri. I\u2019m also an active member of \u2018River Rejuvenation Research Group\u2019, which was formed in the month of June 2020, with the assistance of Dr. Rupak Kumar Paul who teaches in University of North Bengal; although, this NGO isn\u2019t registered yet. Earlier, I\u2019ve already mentioned about ASER education survey, where I participated during my graduation. In the first year of my college, I was selected from my department for a voluntary participation in the \u2018Tea Smile Project\u2019, in collaboration with the students of University of Hiroshima, where I represented my state, especially Darjiling, as it is known as the leading tea producer. Volunteering my time boosts my energy, happiness, health and sense of well-being.",
        "WHAT INTEREST ME",
        "I was inspired to commit to a future in geography. The true breakthrough for me took place in my sophomore year of college, when I was volunteering at ASER National Education Survey at Siliguri, West Bengal, which was based on quality of education and literacy ratio associated with the socio-economic status of the people residing in different states of India. After publishing their report when I was going through that, it ignited a passion inside me to resolve the issues in a sustainable manner. Nonetheless, I became more inclined towards physical geography. In my point of view, without incorporating natural phenomenon it is quite impossible to come to a solution. Consequently, I\u2019ve decided to acquire profound knowledge in this particular field in order to serve the community, before pursuing my research, which I lacked here.",
        "WHY YOUR UNIVERSTY?",
        "\u201cEducation is not received. It is achieved\u201d",
        "This statement is in fact true with the case of your university. University of Melbourne is known for providing quality education for centuries. I believe this educational institution can provide all the assistance I require to fulfil my future research. The department website showed involvement of the distinguished faculty in intensive research with lots of research experience. The presence of great minds, interested in imparting knowledge and hands-on experience to the students will help me amass sufficient knowledge to contribute my mite to the field of geography. I am eagerly looking forward to become a part of the intellectual family residing at the university; and if I become one, I will bring the best out of mine with dedication and zeal.",
        "CONCLUSION",
        "I know that studying in the University of Melbourne requires a lot of focus, discipline and dedication, which I believe I have. I am a law-abiding citizen and a very responsible individual. I wish to enrich my \u2018little\u2019 talent by gaining \u2018huge\u2019 knowledge at your esteemed institution. So, I request you to give me an opportunity to achieve great heights in this field which has been my dream since childhood and I can assure you that I will not let you regret this decision.",
        "I feel honoured and proud to be a part of your university."
