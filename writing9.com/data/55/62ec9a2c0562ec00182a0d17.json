        "responsibility. This is because public service helps students to engage",

        "their social skills, such as communication skills, problem-solving skills",
        "improve, which may be helpful in their later lives when they enter the",

        "sense of community. As students take part in community service, they get to",
        "help the community where they live. This may make them aware of",
        "the responsibility that they have with the community, helping them feel useful.",
        "On the other hand, community service should not be mandated in school.",
        "Firstly, it may stress students out even more. This is because students have to",
        "study for many other subjects, especially the seniors . Therefore, adding",
        "community service would only make students more stressed and tired,",
        "negatively affecting their academic performance at school. Lastly, mandating",
        "community service at school will make students take it reluctantly. When",
        "teenagers are forced to do something they don\u2019t want to do, they will most",
        "likely experience stress and burnout. This results in them doing it in a",
        "reluctant way, affecting work efficiency.",
        "In conclusion, community service is beneficial to students in many different",
        "ways, however, it should not be a mandatory part of the school curriculum."
