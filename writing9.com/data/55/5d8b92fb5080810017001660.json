This protects the person who is being accused of the crime.\n\nSome lawyers have suggested that this practice should be changed and that a jury should be given all the past facts before they reach their decision about the case.\n\nDo you agree or disagree?",

        "There has been a long debate about the allocation of health budget on treatment and prevention. Some people argue that large proportion of budget should be spent on treatment whereas some oppose this view point. I believe that more money should be spent on health education and preventive measures than on treatment. The argument will be analyzed in the following paragraphs.",
        "Firstly, spending more money on health education and preventive measures results in more economical situation in the long run. In such case, people will be more aware to their health and try to avoid malicious diseases. We all know that the treatment cost of the diseases like heart attack, cancer etc are exorbitantly high and common people in developing countries even can't afford to treat these diseases. Thus, it is clear that why we should give more importance to prevention than cure.",
        "The second important reason about spending money on preventive measures is that by doing so we would create a healthy and sound environment in the community. For example, there used to be no toilets in some of the remote villages in Nepal. Many people would suffer from several diseases and the environment of community was extremely awful. But after the health campaign was introduced and the villagers were warned about the potential consequences of open toilet, they built the toilets in their home. As a result, the environment of village became sound and clean.",
        "In conclusion, we should spend sufficient amount of money on treatment too but high proportion of amount should be spent on health education and preventive measures so that we can live on healthy environment with less price."
