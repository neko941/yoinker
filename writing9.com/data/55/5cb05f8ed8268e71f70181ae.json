        "Nowadays more and more people across the country driving their own car which may cause traffic congestion. It is argued that imposing heavy tax on people who own car is the solution to overcome this issue and bring improvement in public transportation system. This essay will discuss its benefits and drawbacks.",
        "To begin with, first of all implementation of heavy tax can resultant in improving public transport. While collecting tax from car owner these money can be use on different public infrastructure that make out transport system more convenient such as buses, trains and planes. In this way most of the people will choose government services for their destination rather than private serviced such as taxi. Moreover tax will help government to construct new roads. In addition the number of cars will be fallen as a result there are fewer chances for environmental pollution and traffic noises.",
        "Secondly, if we look through negative aspects so there are rare chances for each citizen to have his own so that car companies business may fall down consequently may cause unemployment. According to report in 2001 Japan government doubled implementing tax on car manufactures industries as a result 70 out of 400 industries remained close. Moreover, it is not easy for every citizen to access public transport. For instance many farmers who live in village need to travel some hours in order to reach public bus or railway station.",
        "In conclusion, even though high tax can help to improve transportation system such as roads and buses despite there are several other disadvantages such as increasing in unemployment ratio."
