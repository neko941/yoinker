        "There are a lot of teenagers that would like to have a journey and a job in their gap year in some countries.",
        "To my way of thinking, learning to be independent since childhood is important for children's development. Parents should adjust their children to eat, sleep, bathe, walk, and study alone from the late infancy. Additionally, one of the best approaches to learn how to be autonomous for pupils is to study abroad. They live and study away from their parents, relatives, friends, and motherland. At the first time, living without anyone\u2019s help seems a very frightening, boring and difficult experience. However, children adapt and become independent eventually. From my point of view, the best way to develop a promising future for children, is allow them to be completely independent.",
        "According to my vantage point, many parents are afraid of potential dangers to their children. Moreover, mothers and fathers do not allow their kids to go out alone. Many mothers follow their teenagers to school. For instance, there are a lot of towns in which parents, do not let their children go to school or return alone. It has very bad effect on children\u2019s mind. When they grow up, they may become very impatient, edgy and, bad-tempered so parents must be careful about their behavior towards them because they will do the same towards their children in the future. Therefore, it affects their next generation.",
        "In conclusion, I do not think that working and traveling alone in the gap year would have negative influence on children."
