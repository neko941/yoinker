        "In future, the average standard of well-being of people is expected to be worsened than present. I absolutely disagree with the statement, because advancement in medical sciences and increased education level lead to cure and prevention respectively.",
        "Firstly, progression in health sciences has controlled the morbidity and mortality by many folds. Compared to past, when even small disease caused prolonged illness or death, nowadays every disease can be cured. This is because of evidence based research and contemporary practices in surgery and medical treatment.  The research and development in medical will enhance further, and patients will be treated with much more ease without any significant side effects. For example, the drug used in chemotherapy for cancer patients has less side effects as compared to past and patients become healthy without compromising their hairs and immune system. Hence, big diseases are being cured with much more ease as compared to past and in future the situation will become better.",
        "Secondary, the general awareness and education about the cause and spread of diseases is being enhanced day by day. Due to awareness campaigns, advancement in technology print and social media, people now are much aware about prevention from diseases. As a results, population care about their hygiene and surroundings due to which disease did not tool place at the first place and also do not spread if it occurs. For example, In Pakistan, parents were reluctant to let their children take polio drops, but due to awareness on Television, the number of parents taking their children for polio drops has increased by leaps and bounds. Hence, in coming years more and more people will know about different diseases, which will prevent any disease to occur and spread.",
        "To conclude, the consideration that general health indicators will get worsen in future does not hold significance. This essay discussed that because of an increased awareness about the diseases among masses and research in health sciences has led to stoppage of disease to occur at first place and make its treatment much easy."
