        "Tourists are going extreme nowadays, by which some are searching for excitements and pick a country with hard conditions, such as Everest peak or the Sahara Desert. A lot of people are with such destinations while others are against. This essay will discuss both views.",
        "One of the most important values of visiting extreme geographical areas is going out of the comfort zone. For instance, in hard conditions, people discover new things within themselves. Another advantage, which usually occurs due to difficult situations, is making a deeper connection with locals. For example, an influencer on Instagram, who seeks rare animals that are only found in specific places, his slogan is \u201c I travel to meet people\u201d. This example is a summary of the advantages, where tourists not only want to see locations but also want to discover how locals live.",
        "On the other hand, not everyone who decides to go for a unique experience would be able to cope with the weather. To illustrate, some people never experience really hot temperature reaching 50+ or below zero, thus, doesn\u2019t know how they react to such condition. Adding to that, not knowing ones\u2019 limit could be risky, an example of this when signing up for an activity within a group, their physical inability to continue to affect the whole group. Therefore, picking a difficult location is challenging as one should be witty to choose wisely.",
        "In conclusion, some tourists are no longer looking for traditional locations to visit sightseeing but they are seeking experience. The pros and cons for such decisions are limitless, such as a lifelong experience. But it also can be fatal if the location was not picked correctly."
