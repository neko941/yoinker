        "It is undeniable that, authorities could invest proportion of their budget, which has been spent on the art, on more vital sectors. Adversaries of that notion, however, would put forward the idea that necessity of the art, which is on par with my accord.",
        "Above all, the arts, such as, musics or paintings, tend to have salutary effect on human's psychology and nourishment of youngsters. The art can be considered as a not only reduction of the stress levels of person but also as a essential tool to edify people's minds. For instance, as acute situations related to the psychology of person can be ameliorated through the classical musics, paintings can shed light on the history of the place, as well as, expand imaginary world of its audience. As a result, core subjects that are taught at the schools or universities, are by no means the only source of knowledge, but people will be able to acquire knowedge and develop a sense for human sentiments through the arts, parallelly.",
        "Furthermore, the art sector, which contains plethora of workplaces in it, as an artis or singer, for example, possess its share in workforce in the country, if which is abridged, copius of artists or the workforce, those jobs relate to them, would become jobless. To illustrate that, a museum that is provided by government's budget could be perfect example, in which numerous of people are working. Through allocationg fiscal aid for the art section, not only the government become ingenioun recepient via as tackling against the joblessness but also inhabitants are taking the benefit of it, as well, through provision of workplace.",
        "The conclusion to be drawn is that, perhaps the money that spent on the art, could be invested for development another sector, but the art itself is one of the vital fields that is inalienable part of the other sectors."
