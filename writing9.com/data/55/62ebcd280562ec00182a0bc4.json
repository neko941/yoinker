        "The life in 21st century is so much dominated by technology, that it is incorporated into our daily lives. This essay will firstly discuss how the technology is useful to humans and ,lastly it will also discuss the other side of technology which can cause adverse effects.",
        "Nowadays, technology has replaced the traditional methods of work in factories. For instance, the advanced pieces of machinery in the factories cause minimal labour work, and fewer errors in packaging and sorting when compared to humans. Also due to alternative  machines by humans, there are zero accidents in the factory or at  construction sites. Earlier, people used to uplift  heavy items such as wood logs, rocks and so physically but, now with advanced machines the work is simplified and people are relieved from such burden.",
        "Furthermore,  easy access to the internet has been a boon to everybody. Let us take the example of the internet replacing the newspaper. As more and more people are turning towards E-news, a tremendous amount of paper has been saved. According to a study in the United Kingdom, more than half the population uses E-newspapers which  to have led to an approximately a 20% fall in paper production.  ,this  nature is preserved making the environment clean. Another most common use of the internet is  easy communication with distant people. Earlier people use to write letters to people living far away which would take days to deliver a letter to them. But with the advancement in technology, now people can connect with each other even within minutes if they are far across the country.",
        "Also, the economy of the country is boosted due to infrastructure and advanced automobiles. Thus  trading between the countries is now easily possible. According to the statistics in the United States Of America, the trading system has dramatically improved from 1800 to 2000.",
        "However, technology does have its few adverse effects such as  replacing humans in the factories resulting in increased unemployment in the countries. Another downfall of technology is the addiction of people to the internet thus leading to less communication with people surrounding us. People often chat with those who are far away and may not meet them in future rather than talking to people sitting next to them.",
        "Lastly, the rate of diseases such as obesity and cardiac diseases have noticeably increased due to a sedentary lifestyle. People use automobiles for walkable distances or sit in front of computers for most time of the day leading to an inactive lifestyle.",
        "In summary, even though technology is a boon to people, it has its own downfall. In my opinion, if we limit ourselves to using the technology only when required rather than for instant gratification it can be fruitful for us."
