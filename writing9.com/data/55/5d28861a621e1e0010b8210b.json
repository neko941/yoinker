        "At present, global warming has become increasingly popular.It has been argued, that the developed nations are held responsible in dealing with global environmental issues.Definitely, I disagree with the above statement, both the developing as well as developed nations are supposed to work hand in hand to resolve this issue.",
        "Undoubtedly, developing countries are  also held responsible to deal with the problems . Whereas,  most of minor issues are dealt by the local government.For example, due to modernized era, most of the people are preferring for Urban lives .Approximately around 80percent of people in Bangalore travel by cars, which emitts carbon dioxide  leading to pollution. This automatically affects  the environment. So, certain measures are  taken by the authorities , replacing fossil fuels with solar energy.Even the individuals of developing nations, and government are  supposed to take precautions to protect our nature.",
        "Despite few measures,  taken by local authorities.Developed countries should address major problems such as ,deforestation and aggressive materialisation. This issues are affecting the environment ,with the rise in temperature, increased sea levels,  and glaciers are melting down leading to global warming.For instance,  to protect the environment rich nations have to implement stricter rules for deforestation ,recycling plastic,  new sources of energy need to be found that are sustainable and environmental friendly, and planting more trees.International companies should come forward to work along with underdeveloped nations. Several joint ventures are done, to protect our planet from dreadful problems.",
        "In conclusion,  not only the international nations are held responsible, even the developing nations are accountable to protect our environment."
