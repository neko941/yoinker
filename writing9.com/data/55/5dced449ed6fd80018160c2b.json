        "Many individuals are of the opinion that music is a source of connecting people from different backgrounds and age groups with each other. I strongly agree with this view point, and will explain my reasoning in this essay.",
        "Music has been an intergral part of our society, regarless of what heritage or country you belong to. It has the ability to stir up emotions in a postive way, and helps us relate to each others side of story, regardless of the language barrier. There are have been plenty of occasions when the pop culture has defused a conflicting situation between the countries. For example, when Indo-Pak border tensions were escalated, many renowned musical bands and celebraties stepped ahead from both nations and successfuly urged the head of states towards peace. Number of songs were produced from both sides encouraging the peace process and showed how similar in culture they both were. This ilustrates the immense power music has over the general populace. Also when major muscial bands perform in concerts, people from diverse age groups and cultures are there to attend it. For Instance, in an average Metallica concert, attendess from at least 23 nationalities are present, with the age group ranging from 12 to 75 years old! This also depicts its power of bringing people together from diverse cultures.",
        "However, the power of music could also be misused. As it has the ability to generate emotions, many have used it to spread hate or false propoganda among the civilians. Take the Syrian government for example. It has produced war mongering and hateful content against the neighbouring Kurds, urging its own population to take up arms in their ''Holy'' cause.",
        "In conclusion, i strongly believe that music has proved to be more beneficial for our society at large through bringing people together. Though, if used for the wrong purposes, can also instigate conflict."
