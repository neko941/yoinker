        "Some people think it is good for teenagers to obtain part-time employment, while others resist to this idea.In my opinion, although there might be some noticable drawbacks, it would be much more experience and help to gain some useful skills working as a part-time employee.",
        "It is claimed by some people that working during the period of teenage has some benefits to the teenagers in some way.Firstly, they can obtain valuable work experience which are excellent for a resume. Moreover they might attain a chance to learn how to manage their financies and learn time management skill.In addition, they gradually instill new confidence, sense of responsibility and independence . Gaining useful marketable skills such as improving communication, how to handle with people, developing interview skills and filling out job applications are significant influence to their future career.",
        "Some people have opposite belief that if teenagers get into employmet they will face a number of negatives especially related to their studies.For example, After working time they rest less time for homework. Working students may not have or make the time to complete their work. As a result of this they get lower grades in school. Furthemore, early entry into a negative or harsh work environment may encourage negative view of work. Feeling fatigue and sleepiness may appear in the routine of the student effecting to their preparation for the day\u2019s academic activities and may discourage the teen from going to school.",
        "All things considered, my subjective view on this contentious issue is that it is great for gaining valuable experiences by working as a part-time worker for teenagers while others think it is not."
