        "In some countries, It is thought by some that it is acceptable to be paid quite a fortune as salaries. In my opinion, it is more sensible to regulate amount earned and reduce the salary paid to people.",
        "Admittedly, earning huge amount of salary is beneficial as it allows for people to afford the basic needs of life. That is, people can plan their budget and execute it. For example, A consultant, in level 17, in a teaching hospital in Nigeria, worth more than 24million annually. Obviously for someone earning over 2 million per month, he will definitely acquire the basic needs of life and even more. Such a person can afford trips abroad not just for himself but for his family too. Certainly, a comfortable life for such a person is guaranteed.",
        "Nevertheless, there are a lot of challenges associated with huge amount of salaries earned. Let's look at the burden on the government. In as much as people would love to earn huge sum of money, the possibility of the government spending on salaries regular is not feasible. That is, the budget for salaries outweighs the expenditure, thus affecting the economy.  Another point to note is that, earning a large sum of money will provide an opportunity for extravagant spending by some people. That is, many people will tend to spend more on irrelevant things just because the money is available thus hindering them from saving some money in case of emergencies. For example, a senior colleague working in a teaching hospital in Nigeria, recently bought a second Bentley worth over 25 million which is not a necessity and obviously an extravagant way of spending money.",
        "In conclusion, there are a number of limitations associated with earning so much money like too much burden on the government, extravagant way of spending money, it is imperative for the government to regulate the amount earn and moderately reduce the salary to promote the economy."
