        "In this contemporary ,generation every individual has adopted to fast-moving technologies, usage of mobile phones and  electronic gadgets is growing faster in this 21st century. However, there are predominantly two contrasting views, where a section of society claims that handwriting is a much-needed skill in this era of technology, while others emphasize that mastering  handwriting is not required for this younger generation. I completely agree that handwriting is a basic skill which everyone should learn.",
        "Apparently, it is important for children to learn handwriting at a younger age therefore, it helps them to be active in their studies, although for kids it's a painful job to write  it further, improves their reading ability along with writing. For instance, pupils should first be thought to draw  drawings     as a result, they will become perfect in writing abilities.",
        "on the other hand, today's kids are riding over  technology and easy access to cellular phones provides them with any information at their fingertips. for example, present kids have been thought to study online rather than following old studying methods as a result, kids have been perplexed by writing. moreover learning from electronic devices is easier when compared to old forms of learning.",
        "I strongly believe that  kids should be thought  handwriting in their earlier days which helps them in their academics and it is very easy to communicate. And in some parts of the world Childers are judged by their handwriting."
