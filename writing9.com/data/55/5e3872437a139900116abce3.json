        "Fostering of a child is an indispensable segment for its whole life. It is believed by some individuals that taking care of the children by all members of the family instead of only parents will make good results. As far as i am concerned, I completely agree with this statement and reasons will be outlined in the upcoming paragraphs.",
        "To start with, the juvenile can adopt proper care when it comes to rearing by all family members. Since we are leading our professional life, mostly couples are working and they cannot devote their entire time for raising the kids. If youngsters are taken care of by aunts , grandparents, they will not only get familiar with complete family but also they can somehow learn living apart from the parents all of the time that will eventually help them for leading a successful hostel life. For instance, a survey that is conducted by an NGO in delhi, the capital of india about extra abilities of the students and findings were, those youngsters who are raised in a joint family have proficient knowledge about extra curriculum activities rather than others.",
        "Moreover, another positive effect of development of the baby in the joint family is that it can learn moral values and adjustments in the life. If a teenager grows up in the hands of grandparents, they will teach them how to give respect to elders. Apart from this, the family members rather than biological parents cannot provide everything on the spot to the children so it will lead them to learn how to do adjustments in the life. For example, Mr Ratan tata, a prominent businessman of india, said in his interview that he attained success just because of his upbringing in a collective family from where he learned about tackling adverse situations and doing social responsibility.",
        "To conclude, Development of the juvenile with all family instead of only foster parents is acceptable owing to get maturity and learn abilities for cope with obstacles of the children in later life."
