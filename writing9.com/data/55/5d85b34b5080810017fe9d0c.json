        "Whether state should be responsible to look after underprivileged class of the society or not is a widely debatable issue. Some people believe, government should help the needy individuals such as jobless and those who are without shelter. In this essay, I will discuss two reasons why I completely agree with this proposition.",
        "To begin with, since the government has authority and required resources to help people without job, it is the sole institution which can support them on a country-wide scale. As the authorities have finances, they can help uplift people's technical capabilities and assist them in becoming employed again. In Pakistan, for example, government has established technical training institutions like TEVTA to enhance the skillset of the unemployed and make them come at par with the current industry standards. Clearly, only state has the potential to aid these deprived folks.",
        "Furthermore, another reason why regime should be liable to aid the people without shelter is because in the modern democratic system, it is considered to be the primary responsibility of the government to fulfil fundamental rights of its citizens. Moreover, as long the government is collecting taxes from the opulent segments of the society, it is directly responsible for taking care of the deprived. For instance, one of the Scandinavian states Denmark, provides free accommodation to its nationals who cannot afford to live on their own.",
        "If we analyze other side of the picture, there are people who argue, when the authorities collect taxes, they should only be spending money on tax-payer's wellbeing and the regime does not possess right to spend their hard earned income on others even if they are poor. To illustrate, if the state is deducting around 40% from someone's salary then the collected amount must be spent on the betterment of the people who are already paying taxes in terms of education, health and transport.",
        "To Conclude, this essay explored the reasons why government should be responsible for looking after the financially dispossessed people. In my opinion, because government has the resources and funds which it collects from the working class, it is obliged to provide assistance to the poor and help them become useful member for the country."
