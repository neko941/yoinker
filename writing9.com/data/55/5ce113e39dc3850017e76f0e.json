Others, however, opine that the school is greather shareholder of this task. In my opinion, they both share an equal and important responsibility to accomplish this goal.",

Most of the time children spend with in their childhood is with their parents,they mimic their actions and  hence, they learn what they see adults behaving like. By taking advantage of this crucial learning time span of youngster lives, if adults can play role model for them, they can teach good habits, empathy, socialism and care in young ones that is essence of an ideal society.For instance, The Time repoted that scientific research has revealed, childhood experiences and events have lasting impact on individuals personality.",
        "On the other hand, school is an ideal place to make a pupil very social according to many. Because, the school presents a dynamic and versatile environment of learning and intercatig with the people of varried background, also it serves as a true role model of a dynamic society on a small scale. Moreover, opportunity is given to take part in the charity work which seeds morality, responsibilty and love for their surroundings. For example, In Japan, free community services are the integral part of their study course, which has made the Japan most sociable country in the world.",
