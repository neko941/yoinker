        "In today's scenario, the significance of car is irrefutable . Even though most of people have used their private vehicles on the road for daily purpose which create a lot of traffic congestion and pollution. Ramification, I totally agree with notion that use of cars have been steadily increased for this government should make some rules and regulations. The. Aspects I am going to Focus on are road design, safety and pollution.",
        "To begin with, all around the world main issues is traffic congestion and pollution. Moreover , when individuals have been started use of private vehicle such as cars or morst bikes in the narrowest cities. For example, in India it have been estimated that 80% people live in urban area and they commute to their workplace by their automobiles which cause negative impacts on their lifestyles such as pollution and traffic . Consequently, people must be used the public transportations to reduce the traffic problem in the country.",
        "On the other side , the immense of private vehicles have been utilized and number of accidents are occurred in each part of the country. Hence, the government should retain  some rules and regulations which must be followed by the youth .As a result , accidents case will be determined and people feel safe . For example,in India it proved that a lot of accidents are occurred every month and people lose their life. For this government must organise the car limit speed siginal in every stop . Consequently, people can be awarded about the stand-in order.",
        "In addition, air pollution is one the harzardous impacts on having too much cars in towns and cities. Furthermore, it probably car produce poisiouns pollution gas such as carbon dioxide which effects the people health and they have respiratory diseases such as asthma and lung cancer . As a result , a cities and town people must look after this issues and make permanent solutions for this such grow more plants and must utilize the better quality oil for their private vehicles.",
        "In conclusion, Although most of people live their cars because it is sight of our dependence, should make fewer use of it and give preference to public transport. Besides it make our enivornment friendly and less traffic on the road ."
