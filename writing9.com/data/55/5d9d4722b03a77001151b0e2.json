        "Quality teaching for students has become a matter of concern for both the parents and school authorities. This burning issue has created two schools of thought one considers a tutor is requisite to have a stern behavior towards students, there are others who have a notion that an amiable behavior can do all the good for students. This essay will discuss both the ideas and will reach a conclusion about why I believe a friendly behavior towards students is the need of the hour.",
        "To begin with, there are two prominent reasons that a teacher should behave firmly with students. Firstly, the stringent behavior of a tutor ensures discipline in the class and benefits the students in the long term. This is because teaching students to obey rules and regulations, instills in them a habit which they carry with them where ever they go. To illustrate, control of self helps not only in academic results but in career growth also where a person is bound to obey work under certain sets of rules. Another prominent reason is that the advent of technology is making students careless regarding their studies. An uncompromising teacher can only bring the students on track. For instance, with my personal experience, I have seen that students are much likely to complete the home-work of a strict teacher and stay attentive most of the time in the class. Therefore, it is strictness that can bring the students on track.",
        "The flip side of the coin is of the view that a teacher with the temper and disposition of a friend is more favorable for pupils. The primary reason is that the cutthroat competition begins at a very tender age. At this point in time, there is a need to boost student morale and a compassionate teacher can only do the good. To illustrate, it is a compassionate teacher who comes to rescue the schoolchild when they have lost all their hopes and have decided to give up on their dreams. Subsequently, another reason is that it helps the students to discuss their study their issues freely with the teacher. They can learn in the class without having fear of being insulted without any serious issue. Therefore, such teachers that exhibit the qualities of being professional and friendly help in the development of the student on the grounds of academic and socially.",
        "To conclude, teachers are the ones who frame the future of the nation. It is imperative to adopt a pattern to teach the students effectively. This essay discussed that stringent methods are crucial to inculcate discipline to get the best from them both academically and in a career. This essay also discussed that the more a teacher is friendly more students perform better in their academics and socially. I personally believe that it is a friendly teacher that can handly everything calmly and even the dull student will try to learn do good in the subject associated to the teacher."
