        "It is believed by some people that individual efforts can bring about a change in preventing the disastrous effect on global climate change while some others believe that a change of such magnitude can only be brought about by large scale businesses and government policies. In my opinion, large scale businesses and government policies may have the upper hand but protecting the environment should begin at a smaller level from the individuals and involve people from all walks of life.",
        "A vast percentage of the activities that has led to global climate change is preventable, the cause being our collective recklessness and incompetence. To illustrate, most people use private transport rather than public transport for comfort and ease, not bothering about the impact their reckless choice would have on the environment. Cutting trees for wood and fuel is also an individual choice that could be done with better judgement. Improper disposal of domestic waste by individuals, leaves a detrimental effect on the environment.",
        "On the other hand, people in government offices and in big commercial firms can bring about a massive change because of the availablity of power and resources. A ban on the usage of plastics can bring about a massive change, in a quick time period. Big product manufacturing companies can limit their waste production and utilise products which are not harmful to the environment.",
        "To conclude, the problem of global climate change needs to be tackled at every level to bring about a real change. Individuals need to get involved with the policy makers and the business firms in this fight to protect our environment."
