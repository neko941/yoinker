        "People have differing views when discussing about what to eat best to keep them healthy and fit. While others think that excluding meat and fish on their diet will provide better result, I disagree with the given suggestion.",
        "On the one hand, there are some great reasons why some supports this idea. For one, there are group of people who are strong advocates of promoting the rights of these species. These individuals believe that, if people eat this kind of food, they likely support the industry which promotes animal cruelty. Another reason is that, meat consumption is expensive. For example, eating stakes or baby back ribs on a restaurant will cause you an arm and leg; therefore, they think that it is practical to eat vegetables because it saves money and everyone could easily plant these on their garden or backyards.",
        "On the other hand, I do not agree with this and in my opinion food preference varied in every person. Firstly, eating food should be a rewarding experience. Not all people enjoyed eating vegetables because they find the taste as weird or bitter. To elaborate most children do not see vegetable as edible for a meal which sometimes compared to chewing a medicine. Secondly, in some race, culture, tradition or religion; the practice of eating meat is a part of their celebration. For instance, in the United States of America they held an annual national thanksgiving which is a special gathering with a turkey\u2019s meat on the center of their tables.",
        "In general, although some have strong argument to support the idea to exclude meat and fish on their diet, I disagree and believe that people should respect one\u2019s choice of food because it varied across every people, religion, race, culture and traditions."
