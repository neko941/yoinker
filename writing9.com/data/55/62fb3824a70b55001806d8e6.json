        "Nowadays, it is becoming increasingly common that more people are likely to think that the authority should spend more money on public services, instead of wasting money on arts. Form my perspective, this tendency is totally disagree with notion of the matter investing on community.",
        "First of all, it is an indisputable fact that the art contribute a major advantage in economic. To begin with many films, music videos, liveshows and performance stages are released every year that brought a large of income for investor and also for the income of a nation. For example, the USA, the richest country and also famous with the musics and films industrial, such as Hollywood which bring for the USA many benefit in every views. For example, the Avengers which movies have the highest profit in over the world, as well as on the lists top 100 grossing films in the world that 80-90% is the USA. In additional, many albums and CDs music are sold out in all planet that almost from America, by selling albums, CDs and tickets show that make many famous singer get wealth such as Taylor Swifts, Justin Bieber and Micheal Jackson. Moverover,  its convenience is clearly to be seen that the artistic field contribute a huge role in the development of the USA.",
        "On the other hand, this constantly causes some drawbacks such as keeping, saving and advertising national identities. Many movies about historical era of a countries that make people now more about their forefather\u2019s life in the past and as well as advertise with other countries about their traditional and culture. Take a good example of it is Korea, in the previous time Korea was a developing countries, when time over of drama and music industrial that make Korea progress more quickly and become one of the richest country in the world. Remind to South Korea that make people remember to Kpop, K-drama, BTS and Blackpink. Their phenomenon is a major waive for Korea, that make people know more about Korea and also advertise their foods, culture and lifestyle. After the completed of Artistic field, the number of people learn Korean language raise substantially. BTS and Blackpink, which the faces of Samsung, by the developing of them led to the evolved of Samsung cooperation.",
        "In conclusion, the matter fund money on public facilities or art form has its pros and cons. In my opinion, I still think that there are more advantages if we know and realize how to control what we do in artistic field. Additionally, we cannot deny the economic contribution of arts and the role in preservation cultural identity."
