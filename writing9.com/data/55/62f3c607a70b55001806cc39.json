        "As people live longer nowadays, they are having much more years to enjoy after retirement. However, living longer doesn\u2019t necessarily mean living happier. Negative side effects and social problems should be considered both by individuals and society.",
        "From the perspective of individuals, the crucial problem that\u2019s troubling elderly people is how to spend the rest of their life with fun, dignity, and protection. Depression among aged people has become more common these years. Some people lose their life goals after retirement as they feel they are no longer needed by others. Some feel isolated and left behind by the constantly changing world. Some are worried about age problems and diseases that cannot be covered by medical insurance and will lay financial and emotional pressure on their family.",
        "As for society, a longer lifespan exacerbated the aging problem, which gives lots of stress on the economy and the social welfare system, especially under the circumstance that the birth rate from the worldwide range keeps decreasing. Social administration and the legislative system are also facing challenges regarding how to manage so many unemployed elderly people. Systematic discrimination and hate crimes against the elderly will also be a big problem.",
        "It is difficult to give a perfect and permanent solution to such an enormous issue. But there are still a few possible means to take. Firstly, re-employment opportunities should be given to retired people by companies and organizations under legal protection and supervision. Secondly, communities can help the retired develop new interests and encourage them to commit themselves to other meaningful works such as environment protection, lifelong education, and art. Last but not least, individuals should make plans for their old age before retirement. After all, it is your life to live."
