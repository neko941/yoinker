        "It becomes increasingly common to see young people undertake important positions in the government. Personally, I think it is a good trend as the younger generation is the major force for social reform and progress.",
        "Some people would argue that young people can be underqualified for these posts, given their little experience in handling public affairs. Traditionally, one of the conditions of being promoted to a high position is to spend years working as a public servant at grassroots level. Over the years, one develops his administrative skills, interpersonal network and problem-solving ability needed for future leadership. However, most young leaders have not been through this process, and their lack of sophistication holds their competence in question. Another drawback of hiring young people for key positions is that they have difficulty coordinating with the staff who work under them. Their authority is most likely to be challenged by the elder staff who are reluctant to follow orders of someone younger and less experienced than themselves. In a word, young people may encounter quite a few challenges concerning their abilities and personnel management.",
        "On the other hand, it can be a good thing to have more young people undertake important positions. First of all, young people are more audacious in decision-making and willing to make reforms, compared with the elder decision-makers who tend to stay with safe options. In this sense, they are more likely to push forward the social development. Furthermore, young leaders can to some extent promotes equality and democracy in the existing bureaucratic system which is heavily hierarchical. Compared with the elder staff, they are less conservative and open to different voices. When making a policy, their decision can better represent collective interest rather than just their own personal will.",
        "In my opinion, young people should be encouraged to hold important posts in the government. While it facilitates innovation and reform, it also encourages young people to take responsibilities for the nation and society, and to be aware that they are the major force of country development."
