        "There are a number of arguable global issues we have to deal with or we are facing. However, it has been a really long time since I saw or heard those who talked about art, which can mean, nowadays, people barely are interested in art and turn their focus away from it. It is understandable why people do not much care about art. It is mainly because we have many other issues we take care of and there are loads of entertainment we can enjoy (For example, music, TV show, computer games and socialising with our friends).",
        "Nevertheless, It is crucial keeping our interests in art, in order to cherish it. This essay will be further discussed on this issue, based on my thoughts.",
        "To begin with, art represents our history and culture. In fact, many youth and foreigners learn our history and culture through exploring our artwork or sculpture at a museum or art gallery. Not only that, there is no doubt that all styles of our architecture are based on our traditional art. We have to remember that thanks to traditional our own art, we can live in an artistic and spectacular building and interior.",
        "Secondly, art is a quite important role of income for government all over the world. To take tourism an example, Artists have immense power to attract tourists who are one of the major revenue for the country. It is noticeable how much the French government earn money from tourists who fancy the artwork and architecture in France.",
        "To sum up, we need to be more grateful for our art and artist rather than pursuing new entertainment or our business. Government should be required to promote their own art and make a constant investment in preserving and developing it."
