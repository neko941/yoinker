        "Youngsters find it hard to focus on or put their minds to learning. The main reason for this is that they engaged in extra curricula events that draw away their attention from participating in school and a viable solution is to promote actions and also engage their parents to involved and participate in their children  learning.",
        "A large number of kids partake in events that is not contributing to their formal education and thereby diverting their attention from learning. This is despite the fact that they are expected to balance the actions they find themselves. In Nigeria today, it is  becoming a norm for every child to undergo vocational training. Most of these children have to report to the training centre after school, They stand to face loads of assignments given to them at the end of the day. In the process of solving the works given to them, they are deprive sleep and they end up getting troubled when they are unable to meet up with projects appointed to thereby making them pay less attention during teaching or other actions  in college.",
        "A solution that is proving to be successful occurs when their school teachers engaged them in discussions and prevailed in pointing out the challenges they are facing. However, their instructors can work together with the kids to make an agenda for them on how they can balance their daily activities. The parents can be involved in planning stage , ensure they understand the impact of the overwhelming projects their children are involved in and also how they can relief them from them. In Nigeria colleges, a day is set aside by the management for the teachers to meet with the parent in other to discuss the performance of their child.",
        "To conclude, kids find it uneasy to be attentive in Buinstitutions and this is as a result of them involving  in too many activities and this can be solved by ruling out plans on how they can balance their lives."
