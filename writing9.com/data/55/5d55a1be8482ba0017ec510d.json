        "Parents can sometimes want their children to take part in either group activities all the time or hope that their children use their free time alone, away from outer influences. Parents should understand that it is equally important for children to take part in a group and to be able to put their free time for personal use properly to be able to grow up to become physically and mentally strong.",
        "Children should experience what it is like to cooperate with a team for the benefit of their future career and social life. Corporate environments always want their employees to be team players as they require a team to finish their project on time and if someone on the team does not play along well, it can only delay the project and cost the company dearly. A survey on some of the big multi-national companies showed that most of the employees that have played some form of sports, which included a team in schools seem to adjust to teams at workplace better than those that did not play anything or played only one-on-one sports.",
        "To become a strong individual, children should be able to use their solitude productively or at least in a manner that suggests an enjoyable behavior. When children can use their lone time to create something or build their personality, on their own, they tend to become used to be comfortable with being alone, if they have to and not get depressed about it as an adult. To explain with an obvious scenario, it can be said that if a person, as a child, used to become depressed being alone, it is can be obvious that they could develop depressive mental ailments as they become adults and become victims to even other mental health issues.",
        "Children should be encouraged to be both comfortable as team players and also be comfortable with their lone time. It can give an all-round mental growth to become a successful and happy individual."
