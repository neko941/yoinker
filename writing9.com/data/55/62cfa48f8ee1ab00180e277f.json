        "Some people prefer living closer to their hometown whereas some prefer to live outside to experience different cultures. Living closer to where you were born has many benefits, however, it has certain drawbacks as well. In this essay, I will discuss why it is important to have your relatives and your friends around you.",
        "Living closer to your relatives and your friends you know for a long could help you to create a friendly environment. If you want to spend some time with a crowd, for example, you could go out for lunch outings, birthday parties and dinner events. This will certainly help you and your family to spend some quality time with the people around you. Or, another reason could be that, you could seek help quickly when you have people that you know for a long. In case of an emergency, they would go an extra mile to ensure about your safety which could be a great advantage. Clearly, being able to live around your hometown has some key advantages.",
        "In the modern world, due to high intense working environment, people toprefer spend more time alone or with their families than how it was decades ago. Although living in your hometown has many advantages, it will surely minimize the time you want to have yourself without any disturbances. In addition, living outside of your hometown could help you to explore different cultures, for example you can try out different food, experience different lifestyles, and learn different languages and  cultural festivals in other countries.",
        "In this essay I discussed the importance of living close to where you were born although it has certain disadvantages as well. In my opinion, even if your friends and relatives live close by or not, you could always find ways to spend some time alone. However, if you need someone in case of an emergency or if you feel lonely, living outside your hometown could have a lot of disadvantages."
