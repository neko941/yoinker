        "Nowadays, there is a progression where people are choosing to live in apartments, especially in most of the cities. Though living in apartments has it's own pros and cons. In my perspective, I have a strong belief that pros will outweigh the cons, and I am going to lay out a few of them through this essay.",
        "It has become a imperative for most of the people to leave in a house which is accessible to all of their daily needs because due to growing world there are some growing problems. Firstly, traffic has become a hectic problem, so employees are choosing their house within 15-20 minutes travel time, where apartments are the only option in that scenario. Moreover, apartments are less expensive than owning an independent home. Not only that, there is a more scope and easy for people to mingle or celebrate with neighbors, unlike staying in the independent house apart.",
        "However, it does not mean that apartments are far better than an independent house. Quality of life is much better in homes because of spacious space and also room for a garden or plantation, unlike congested space in apartments. In addition to that, people get pleasure by building their dream house as they like not just by interior but exterior also. For instance, let's take a recent survey held by the BBC in London. More people dream to build their individual houses in the suburbs but due to problems like traffic and cost, the security they are ending up in apartment houses.",
        "To conclude, It is thus clear that the apartment lifestyle has its own advantages and disadvantages. People are showing more interest to live in an apartment because of comfort."
