        "The tendency among youngster to buy used outfits is increasing. I think that the popularity and the growth of environmental protection institutions among the new generation is the main reason behind this phenomenon. In addition, wearing and purchasing clothes of famous people is in vogue, which can explain a part of this event. Although using second-hand outfits can have some disadvantages, I believe that it is a positive change.",
        "The number of environmental protection agencies is growing around the world, and the mission of most of them is informing the new generation about the importance of natural habitats and resources. One common way to reduce environmental-harmful activities is applied goods for a long time even with different individuals which reduce the need for new materials and manufacturing processes. For this reason, by increasing the popularity of environmental issues among youngsters, the consumption of second-hand outfits is rising. In addition, recently purchasing and wearing famous people\u2019s clothes, such as movie stars, singers, and athletes, has been in vogue. Therefore, the new generation, who strongly follow the fashions, are more interested in using old clothes of famous people than buying new ones.",
        "Generally speaking, I believe that the consumption of second-hand goods is a positive change. Mainly because it means that there is less demand for new products in the market, so less needs to virgin materials and manufacturing procedures, which often hurt the environment and natural habitats. For instance, the recent report published by the H&M company shows that for producing one new pair jean, 10 liter water is consumed.",
        "In conclusion, the increasing importance of environmental issues among young people and the vogue for wearing famous people\u2019s outfits are the most important reasons behind the tendency of youngsters to use second-hand outfits. I consider it as a positive change in the new generation because it would alleviate environmental issues."
