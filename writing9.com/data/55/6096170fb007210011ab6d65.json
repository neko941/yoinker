        "There is no doubt that these days the internet have indeed changed the way we learn and live. Which numerous people encounter the significant value of a traditional classroom. Others argue that these online classes have a massive impact on children's knowledge. I have to say that I personally agree with  customary education. In this ,essay I am going to discuss both views and concluded my own opinion.",
        "One obvious advantage are that Schools is the place where kids can learn manners, knowledge and new skills. For example, learning speech ,sports and communication skills ,in other words , is places for students to engage with others and learn from their mistakes as well as to discover their ability also they can implement their skills in a real life. Another benefit is , teachers can provide help to individual students. so they could learn to improve themselves For instance , give them feedback and face to face interaction.",
        "Turning to the other side of arguments, children can absorb much information through modern technology at home. In terms of positive ,side the online class is flexible and convenient  to use but not all can provide it because it is cost-effective another reason it need parents commitment to follow their children performance which is not all parents are available",
        "In ,conclusion the reasons to support the customary education is that students can learn how to physically communicate and knowing their weakness. Regardless of the value of the ,intrnet we can not get away from the long established learning system."
