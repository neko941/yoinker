        "Scholar behaviour is a big trouble in the majority of countries. This problem can be caused for many reasons such as the lack of emotion\u2019 control, immadurity and weak support familiar, which have many negative consequences. Hence, is essential to cope to this attitude with an educational focus on emotional intelligence and with participation of the family. \r\rBad conduct is more related with teenagers, because in this age is when people want to be an adult as soon as possible. Therefore, they do not have many regulation in their emotions, since hormones have a strong protagonist, due to their manage many of their attitudes. However, with this behaviour adolescents only show their immadurity and they have not enough attention of their parents. \r\rFor the previous, in my opinion, the best ways to manage this trouble is with a change in the model education. For example, student\u2019 programs should teach about the control of emotions and about the patience. Teachers should focus on the positive aspects about emotional intelligence, for the reason that this could help to decrease the bullying and the violence. Also, parents should give more attention to children, and do not be only concentrated in their works. \r\rIn conclusion, the attitudes of students are a real problem in many countries, because this has as a consequence in many cases violence and bullying. For this reason is really important to try to decrease this behaviour with the management of emotions, due to I believe that bad attitudes have their origin in a lack of patience and immadurity."
