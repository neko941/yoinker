        "Nowadays it is a general topic that purchasing individual vehicles is useful for people and affects negative affect on the environment. Some people think that it is just the trend, whereas others believe that it has merits. In this essay, I will discuss points of view and contend that the disadvantages offset the advantages.",
        "Clearly, there are serious problems for the environment by using their own cars. Firstly, the air pollution and noises are the huge effects. There are numerous individual vehicles on the roads, particular in the city. Therefore, this circumstance causes exhaust gas and also noise from conflictions. Moreover, there is the traffic congestion. Although roads developed as country grew up, it will be difficult to accept enormous cars. In specific, individual cars will crowded in the time of commuting.",
        "Nevertheless, there are also advantages of using cars. First of all, it is useful for transporting. For example, individual vehicles were used not only for commuters but also for travellers on domestic trips. By using cars, people can move easily and simple. Furthermore, using cars indicates the wealth of users. If some people want to show off their property, they can buy and customize their cars. It can be one of the several methods of revealing the wealth.",
        "To wrap up, the air pollution, noise and traffic congestion can be factors of the environment problems. In terms of merits of this situation, the great transportation and displaying the wealth are positive effects on individuals. I completely believe that the advantages for the environment is serious rather than focusing on this trend."
