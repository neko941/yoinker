        "It is argued that being a famous personality such as popular movie star or sportsperson brings many advantages as well as disadvantages. This essay will suggest that being a celebrity brings more disadvantages because criminals can target these people for their money, and their way of life can affect their personal lives in a negative way.",
        "It is more disadvantageous to being a well known personality because these people can become the target of law-offenders. In other words, popularity and recognition brings wealth along with it, and law breakers try to harm famous personalities to grab money from them. This is because, the fame of superstars or sports personalities easily exposes their luxurious lives to common men, and as a result, they become an easy target for wrongdoers. For instance, Sany Schewenzer, who is a famous Mexican movie star, once kidnapped by some criminals for ransom.",
        "The lifestyle of well known personalities can impact their personal lives in a wrong way. In other words, these people usually have a busy schedule, and many times they are forced to stay out of their homes or towns for many days or sometimes for many months. Therefore, their personal lives get affected very badly as they do not spend much time with their families. To illustrate, Shbana Azmi, who was a famous Bollywood actress, got early retirement from her acting career as she was unable to provide her time to her family.",
        "To conclude, I believe that fame and popularity brings many drawbacks along with it because these persons can become the victims of law violators, and their lifestyle can also affect their personal lives negatively."
