        "There has been dicussion on comparing people health today against future. Some people believe that average standard of people's health will be effected in the future than its is now whereas, others don't. I think it depends on the people how they manage to give importance and time to their health.",
        "Dicussion on people health had become a hot topic today. These days 80% of people work on computer continiously sitting on chair for 8 hours this tend to get disease like eye infection, obesity or back pain. Moverover, many people choose travel by car against walking or cycling this lead to obesity. For example, traveling in a car does not give any physical activity, which has high chances of obesity, and no activity many also effect health over a period of time. Bottom line is there are very high chances this trend may continue in future and may have more effect on heath in future.",
        "However, there may be a possibility due to the new technology people may improve their heath in future. Companies should introduce new benifits to employee\u2019s i.e; work from home, gym at work, concept like work on hold where people can get break from work to get involved with other activties that can keep one health. Futhermore, Instead of travel by car, one can walk or cycle to travel. If such improvement takes place in future, there is a possibility of people get healthier than now.",
        "In conclusion, there is an argument on people's heath getting lower than it is now but , it is all depends on how people are going to work on their daily routine, there are also a chances of  people getting healthier if they change they trend of comfort life which is followed now by many people"
