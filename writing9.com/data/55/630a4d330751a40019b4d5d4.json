        "In many people\u2019s life news plays a major role. As the public wanted to keep themselves updated with the information, while bad news is more published in the publications because of the increased crime rate, I believe editors should focus on both good and bad news.",
        "For so many people, the news is so crucial. Based on the published news humans get to know what is happening across the globe and make a decision in their life. So news became important in the individual's life. For instance, the public gets to know complete information like government decisions, guidelines from regulatory bodies, job openings etcetera, and choose decisions.",
        "Most of the news is devoted to bad than good content. Civilians are keen to know the bad news and wanted to take precautionary steps in their life. As crime rates are increasing day to day life, people show interest in getting information from crime news. For example, an individual can reschedule his travel plan for bad news like a terror attack, floods, curfew etcetera.",
        "Both good and bad materials are to be broadcasted to the public. As bad news can depress a few people with negative content and good news can motivate a few people with positive content. So agencies should publish accurate news whether it is good or bad. For instance, if only good news is focused general public will not aware of how most crimes modified their way by using advanced technologies like hacking, data breach etcetera.",
        "In conclusion, News plays an important part in the lives of many individuals. Because people want to stay informed while bad news is frequently reported in media due to the rise in crime frequency, I think editors should concentrate on both good and bad content."
