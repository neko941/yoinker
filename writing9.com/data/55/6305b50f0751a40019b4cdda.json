        "With ever-advancing technology and people becoming more affluent, international traveling is becoming more affordable and convenient. However, such enjoyment comes along with an array of problems to the environment and the local's livelihood. It sparked a heated debate about whether extra taxes on flights and accommodation is necessary to lift the burden of heavy tourism. Given the effectiveness and beneficial consequences, I utterly support the measure and will examine the reasons.",
        "To begin with, imposing taxes is likely to solve most of the problems as fewer people are willing to travel abroad because of the extra fees. When more people are spending their vacation in their hometown, the level of pollution and traffic jams in tourist attractions can be alleviated. Take Venice, one of the most crowded cities in the world. There is a noticeable decrease in the number of visitors after the announcement of taxes applied to them. For overcrowded is the root cause of these mentioned issues, the tactics would definitely be one of the effective solutions.",
        "On the other hand, taxes provide resources for the government to come up with better systems that can cope with the situation. With extra money, elected officials can gather around some top scientists and scholars to conduct research and innovate models that can relieve the complications. For example, countries and entrepreneurs can use planes that are a lot more environmental-friendly to reduce air pollution, while urban planning bureaus can redirect the roads to avoid traffic congestion.",
        "Having discussed that imposing taxes on commute and hospitality can bring improvements in both the short and long run, I totally accord with the suggestion. Still, educating the crowd about global responsibilities is the ultimate solution for all countries."
