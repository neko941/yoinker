        "University is the education institute in which students learn a plethora of distinct subjects. Students in university always prioritise on one particular subject only. On the contrary, a section of society holds a belief that university should motivate  their students to learn a variety of subjects, albeit students in university always prioritise  one particular subject only. This essay will discuss  both sides of the argument in detail and argue why studying more than one subject is superior.",
        "On the one hand, students who learn numerous subjects are likely to acquire more knowledge than others. They can widen  their perspectives during the learning process as every single thing that they obtain will be utilized in the future. In this ever-changing era, employers tend to hire folks with many experiences and knowledge so they can contribute something to the company. Therefore, students need to rest on their low-class mentality, supposing that taking one subject is sufficient enough.",
        "On the other hand, it is undeniable that students these days, have to desire on taking various subjects.",
        "Most students opine that it will burden them more and be time-consuming. However, they do not realize the crucial of doing so. Undoubtedly, this kind of study method will cause students to be more concentrate on their studies but there are a plethora of weaknesses. For instance, their knowledge will stagnant, as result, they will find a difficulty in creating  ideas.",
        "In conclusion, although students are able to focus more when studying one subject at a time, their levels  is still  far as opposed to those who are eager to learn many subjects. In my opinion, I completely agree that encouraging students to enrol in more than one subject will be beneficial for their well-being."
