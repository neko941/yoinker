I fully agree with later ,there are some reasons and examples.",

In some manufacturers using petrol make production or industry, this industrial trends also will cut down by human action. Meanwhile, petrol price will add taxation to government. It is extra company and individuals stress. Petrol is precious resource from nature, this way help government better control petrol using.",
        "On the other hand, only increasing the price of petrol is not enough to cut down transport and pollution problems. It should be adding more measures. Some evdence reveal transport and pollution problems are caused by a variety of reasons. Following by technology develop and science process more and more economy damand for petrol to help progressing, such as trade, travel and other economy activities. Nevertheless, extra petrol price will caused by company taxation stress.Transport system also important role in transport problem,science measure transport system, some road traffic light should not be waiting a long timein a junction. This way can reduce time in rush hour, at the same time ,pollution is caused by others reasons. For instance, industry production economy activities and agriculture pollution. The environment pollution is a big field .not only reduce petrol price can resolved.",
        "In conclution, increasing petrol price from the government can reduce soem transport and pollution problems, but not enough from this, people also need to do other measures to protect our earth environment."
