        "Nowadays, there are more and more tv programs and movies with violent scenes, some people believe that this causes violent activities, this essay agree with this statement.",
        "On the one hand, some people may copy from the scenes. People especially teenagers may copy the violent behaviours, as they are immature enough, they cannot distinguish whether the behaviours are correct or not. Besides, some films describe the characters who perform violence activities as heroes or popular students. After watching those scenes in the movies, some students may think that fighting with each other are cool, they may also bully others as they want to draw others attention and become popular at school. Therefore, they will copy from them and undergo the same activities to other people and this will promote violent behaviours.",
        "On the other hand, people tend to be less aware about violence. When people always watch people fighting in tv programs, they may feel like it is normal to do so as it is always performed on tv, this causes them not to think of the consequence of doing so. When they are unsatisfy with something or someone, instead of trying to deal with them, they immediately use violence such as slapping others. They will not realise that it is actually breaking the law. As a result, people tend to think that using violence to deal with problem is a better way and they do not think it is a problem at all, this will result in promoting violent behaviours.",
        "To conclude, thanks to the violent scene of some TV dramas and movies, there is an increase number of violent activities in the city."
