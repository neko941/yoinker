        "Many people believe that fuel should be charged more, as this decision can contribute to the reduction of traffic along with air pollution. This essay discusses the positive impact of the alleged solution and reviews other possible and sufficient measures.",
        "To begin with, the idea of increasing the price of car fuel might be effective for several reasons.",
        "First of all, such a decision might encourage companies to invest in the production of electro-cars. One good illustration of this is that more and more car-producing brands present their new vehicles that work on electricity, not petrol. Secondly, if owning a car becomes a quite expensive feature, people will be using public transport more often, which can address both pollution and overcrowded roads problems. The effectiveness of this approach can be seen in Japan, where people prefer the subway to own a vehicle, consequently making their ecology better than in other megapolises.",
        "What comes to the alternative of the decision offered, there are some interesting solutions to be taken into consideration; one of them is using bikes instead of cars. As well as it reduces the level of pollutions, it can also positively affect the health of the citizens, since they are implementing physical activity in their lives. A good example would be the Netherlands, where people use bikes as their main transport. Another alternative to a vehicle is a scouter, which became very popular among young adults recently.",
        "To summarize, there are several approaches that can improve our ecology and reduce traffics. Firstly, an increased charge can address these problems sufficiently as it can contribute to the development of electro-cars along with increasing the popularity of public transport. Besides, it is possible to use an alternative way of driving such as bikes and scooters as it is more beneficial for our health."
