        "Some individuals believe that houses and workplaces should be kept neat and clean and everything to be kept in a well-organized way to avoid chaos and disappointment. I too support this idea of cleanliness as this tendency increases productivity and creates long lasting impression on others .",
        "To begin with, keeping things organised will save our time looking for things of vital importance in our daily schedule and will allow focussing on more important tasks . This habit not only reduces stress in today's fast-paced life but also helps to complete our work according to the set deadlines . For example, important documents related to property, education, health should be kept at the right and secure place to avoid any risk . In case of emergency, one cannot waste time looking for important reports or prescription.",
        "Additionally, at the workplace keeping all files documents well arranged by labelling alphabetically or according to dates at the right place will keep the desk clean.  It also helps to avoid committing mistakes as one can easily locate them easily otherwise procrastination often leads to distraction and failure . To illustrate , an article recently published in The Tribune confirmed that 60% of companies where the employees follow good management skills in all terms starting from arranging their own desk and maintaining a yearly record of their assigned work got promoted to the higher ranks within a short span of time.",
        "To conclude , I personally feel that to lead a life of quality and enjoy a sense of deep satisfaction one must realise the importance of orderly placing the items or goods at home as well as at the working place"
