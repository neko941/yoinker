        "Education plays vital role in the life of each person. It is irrefutable that proper knowledge opens much more horizons and opportunities. However, some people believe that young adults should engage with work such as mechanics as well as builders, instead of study at college. In this essay I intend to discuss both views.",
        "On the one hand, in current century it is extremely important for school graduates to enter higher education. Furthermore, university education equips students with the skills required to become a competent professional. For example, one cannot become a doctor or an advocate without going to university because these jobs require specialist skills that can only be obtained from an authorised educational education.  Also, university education increases the knowledge and decision making skills of students. Both qualities will benefit them when they enter the job market.",
        "On the other hand , there are several jobs that do not require university education. For example, one doesn\u2019t necessarily need a degree in hotel management to launch one\u2019s own restaurant or food joint. Likewise, one does not require a degree in textiles management or garment designing to start a tailoring unit. More than any academic qualifications what these jobs require is a genuine interest in that field. Actually starting early gives budding entrepreneurs a better opportunity to establish themselves before competition gets tougher.",
        "From what has been discussed above, it can be concluded that while a university degree is a must for certain professions there are sectors that value work experience more. Having said that, university degrees certainly do not hurt the career prospects of a person. Rather it empowers them. In my opinion, it is up to the individual to decide whether they should go to university or find work after leaving school."
