        "In the past, students have tended to stay in their native countries. Today, scholars have many opportunities to study in foreign countries. Althoug living abroad is a very tempting idea to learn a foreign language and learn a new culture,  I belive the disadvantages outweight the advantages because they feel isolated and culture chock.",
        "Studying abroad is a dream for many university students because they are interested in learn a second language, such as English. This is a challenging experience to achieve because it might take several years to become a fluent speaker. Moreover, experience a culture chock is often among foreign students because they ignore rules and social attitudes that lead them feeling depressed. For instance, the university of Fullerton in California has thousands of foreign students that present a culture chock due to ignore standars of academic conduct, and they ended up failing the first semestre. As a result, many of these people feels rejected by the school. However, I believe that these students do not need to study abroad to have a successful carrers.",
        "I strongly believe that there are more benefits if these students stay at their hometown rather than decided to live abroad to avoid feel isolated. Loneliness is a common feeling among non-native students in California because they have no friends at collge. More importantly is  that they do not manage the language and this is a huge barrier to get along with their classmates. Another issue is that most of these students suffer from culture chock because they ignore the tipical college students' behaviour and this lead to confusion. feeling lost and rejected is a high price to pay for getting a higher education. For example, latino community students tend to feel isolated at collge because they ignore how to get alog with other students at their age. As a result, the percentage of droping from college  is very high. I completly believe is preferable to stay at their own countries and enjoy their families that can support them if they have hurdles i life than live alone abroad.",
        "To conclude, although dreaming to have a degree abroad is a major academic goal to achieve for many students, i believe one must consider to have a well being rather attending to a university in aforeign country to avoid feeling isolated and depressed. For these reasons the negatives far outnumber the positives."
