        "Scientific findings have clearly indicated that there are several available advantages of foreign transaction in receiving countries\u2019 economies,  whilst a group of individuals consider attractiveness of foreign grant may cause some negatives on its field as well as the social sphere.  While I accept duo of the standpoints true at relevant points, I believe the former idea has more privileges. Further on, this essay will analyse about necessary features in greater details.",
        "On the one hand, foreign financing  can lead to the creation of more opportunities for employees. In this case, investors of overseas try to open and run big companies,  factories . New job occupations may be available for the host countries\u2019 citizens due to the attracted stake by foreign investors and this may be effective to prevent from the issue of unemployment.",
        "Additionally,  I see another virtue of interest of foreign venture on increasing export rates of goods and services.  Usually, thanks to foreign capital as financing, the owner as well as foreign investors may build a strong firm to manufacture high quality products and services.  Foreign ally tries to sell their goods and services in the world market as possible and via the owner economy\u2019s export volume may increase. For instance,  if  branches famous brands as Gucci or Dior are organized by their owners in a country as financing,  there will be absolutely increase on the rate of its export.",
        "However, in the meantime, some drawbacks of appeal of foreign purchase appear over the periods. One of them can be called as modern day economic colonialism.  The reason is that investors habitually try to conquer over  internal markets. The consequence of it may lead to the monopoly in the moderator country. As a result the members of society can suffer from it.",
        "To sum up, the given issue has two sides respectively.  If the government takes control over the process of investing and afterwards issues,  attractiveness of foreign grant can contribute to owner country\u2019s economy positively."
