        "Social sites such as ( Facebook) considered to have bad influence both on individuals and society. Massive use of social sites increases the laziness, as a result, it directly hamper the health and social performance. However, while I believe it has certain drawbacks , I aslo would like to point the beneficial factor.",
        "It is debatable to discuss about the disadvantages of Facebook. Firstly, social sites has compressed the world, because of which , people donot need to go outside for basic possibilities , namely, you can order food and clothes andget delivered to your house, as a result, people are getting lazy day by day. For instance, Unlike other children, my eighty year old cousin donot like to go outside to play besides he uses facebook and spend his evening. Secondly, the participation among the society memeber is being disturbed. Some people are avoiding the major functions. Thus, creating incoordination and absence in the development of the society.",
        "Additionally, Facebook also have the clear beneficial approach. Facebook has  special deatures of creating group here you can add people that you interest. For example, our society once organized the festival with the hepl of group, the bulk message was sent through all the people, therefore each of them were engaged and made event successful. Moreover, people can now commmunicate with every individual for making plans and sharing knowledge with the commom platform.",
        "To conclude, Facebook has marginal disadvantages and advantages. Of course, it depens upon the precpective use of people. The use should be limited whereas reality approach should be formed"
