        "Today, almost in all countries, foreigners are being asked to pay more than local travellers when they visit  tourist attraction spots. There has been a heated debate among an increasing number of people about whether both international and local visitors should be allowed to pay the same amount or pay more. In my humble opinion, I do agree with the idea of asking outsiders more amount of fees than local citizens for some specific reasons.",
        "Some people might think that there should be the same access for all tourists: international and local, to attract more foreigners. However, this is not the best solution and can even make worse the situation. As tourism could be the main cause of a country's economic development, lowering the price can indirectly give a negative impact on the country's net income. For example, the main business of Cambodia is Tourism and its major income is received from avenue international tourists travelling to Angkor Complex. Moreover, the additional amount received could be used for other factors such as preserving historical spots, maintaining the environment or also updating the service and activities. Last but not least, with regards to local people, it should be unfair to give high entrance fee to visit their own country's cultural and historical spots.",
        "Taking everything into account, there could have some drawbacks of having different standard entry fees, which are not recognized, however, I strongly believe the benefits would weight those"
