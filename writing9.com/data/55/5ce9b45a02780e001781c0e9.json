        "Whether or not having a baby has been a difficult decision for parents throughout in years. It is not only a difficult decision but also a big responsibility for couples. Especially mothers\u2019 role in this process is more important than fathers\u2019 generally. Nevertheless, there are some ideas that support the importance of fatherhood as much as motherhood.",
        "First of all, the special relationship between baby and mother have to be accepted. They bear their babies in their own body for 9 months and then they feed them with their own milk by breastfeeding. Therefore, there is a magical relationship between mother and baby naturally. In addition, it has to be respected decision of women for having or not having babies because it is a big responsibility that is acceptance of a new life in her own body.",
        "On the other hand, it should not be ignored fathers\u2019 role in this process. Couples have to take some responsibilities by considering together. If a husband would like to have a baby, his partner also should think about that. In contrary, a wife cannot force her partner for making a child even if she is going to bear the baby in her body. This harmony should be sustained in the process of growing children as well. Although fathers cannot provide some essential requirements for their babies, they should always help mother. Furthermore, while children are growing up, some main duties of fathers commence in this period.",
        "In conclusion, it should be approved that fatherhood is not able to be important as much as motherhood in the most situations. However, being a good father have to be objective of every prospective father."
