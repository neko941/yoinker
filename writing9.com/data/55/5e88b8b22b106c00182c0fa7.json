        "People have different views about the destructive effects of tourism income as opposed to conservation. While there are some drawbacks to local culture, I believe that tourism is the sole method of upholding a civilization.",
        "On the one hand, tourism industry can have serious consequences for culture. When tourists are indifferent to the national and cultural beliefs of the people and show behaviours that are against the customs of that country, they can create an unpleasant feeling for residents. Over time, this type of problem can lead to a slavish imitation of the culture of tourists and a rapid change in lifestyle of the natives due to cultural invasion, which results is the loss of identity and national and cultural prejudice and pride. It can therefore be argued that tourism revenues can create cultural and social conflicts.",
        "On the other hand, studies have shown that tourism not only brings capital and income into the country but also is the best way to protect a country's culture. In tourist areas, cultural exchanges with tourists can create a friendly and peaceful relationship between races and religions, and the host community tries to accept and learn other languages to communicate more with tourists. Revenues from tourism can be spent on improving and preserving infrastructure and antiquities. The prevalence of tourism in a country, in my opinion, can revive and conserve forgotten legends, arts, crafts, and local customs. Despite all these, tourism can help people's cultural awareness and ameliorate their living standards.",
        "In conclusion, I can accept that tourism can have many positive and negative aspects of culture, but it seems to me that tourist trade is absolutely vital for identifying and exchanging culture."
