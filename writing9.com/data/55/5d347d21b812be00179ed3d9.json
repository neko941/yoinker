        "In recent days, it has been an increasing concern that self-employment is becoming a person\u2019s favorite choice instead of working as a staff of an enterprise. In this essay, I will examine the reasons behind this and point out how being own master could be disadvantaged.",
        "",
        "There are two main reasons why a freelance worker is an individual\u2019s preference. First, one can be independent and flexible in their jobs. For example, a free singer may sing or compose any songs they like, in the other words, they do not need to follow the trend which most entertainment companies ask their staff to do it. Second, to be under a lot of pressure is not a big deal with citizens. For instance, while employees have to be obligated to complete a fix-working schedule set by their employers, self-employers have the freedom to work in an appropriate amount of time.",
        "",
        "However, it is obvious that there are numerous unpredictable risks if persons choose to be self-employed. First and foremost, self-employed people may face financial difficulties.\u00a0 Particularly, calling for capital and attracting investment is a serious dilemma for startups who want to run a business. Second, working in a company means employers can learn a lot through the mistake and experience of both employers and colleagues. They can learn how to be a great leader or what is the best solution to compete with opponents, as a typical example.",

        "In conclusion, self-employment is a rising trend at a global scale as its advantage. Nonetheless, its disadvantage should scrutinize carefully before choosing to be one\u2019s own boss."
