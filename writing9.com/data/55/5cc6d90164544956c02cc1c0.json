        "Presenting gift items is unarguably a universal phenomenon amongst various races and culture of the world. The intention behind this act, however, varies and as such, debatable. While some people believe this goes a long way in showing affection and gratitude to people around them, others argue there are other means to show care than just giving gifts. I disagree, to a reasonable extent, with the former as I believe that there are better avenues through which one can demonstrate love to family and friends alike other than giving presents.",
        "To start with, showing empathy; a critical human interpersonal skill, is a more effective way to show care and appreciation to loved ones than giving gifts. This is because individuals' numerous wants are different and come in their order of priority. It is therefore important to empathise to be able to determine their specific needs. For example, an individual who is in dire need of financial support would appreciate a monetary gift than such gift items as clothing and other material gifts. In thesame vein, it is needless to give present to an individual who is highly depressed and only needs words of encouragement and emotional support.",
        "Nevertheless, some people argue that affection and gratitude can only be shown by giving presents. This set of people believe that this act helps in fostering better relationship with relatives and acquaintances especially during festive periods such as Christmas and Id-el Fitri. The boom in sales of gift items professing love and appreciation recorded during these periods is also believed to be on the increase yearly.",
        "In conclusion, giving presents to show care and gratitude is not not a bad idea in its entirety but more importantly, showing empathy better demonstrates one's genuine intent in an attempt to show  affection and gratitude to friends and relatives."
