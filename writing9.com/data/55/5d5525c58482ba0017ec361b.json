        "Despite the fact that the matter of art and culture has not caught the attention, it does not mean it is less vital. One can subscribe to a notion that government funding should not be used for art and culture, the paradox is there will be many benefits for the population and culture when supporting the cultural activities. It is justified that the authorities should pay for these activities. In this essay, we will analyze both of the views.",
        "First of all, the governments should support the culture and art of their countries due to maintaining the diversity. It is evident that art and culture are the profound contribution to make one country becomes unique. If the country loses its cultural diversity, it will be globalized as well as the others. Therefore, the authorities funding should be supported to the culture.",
        "Apart from it, cultural activities are the facilitator of sustaining the population. The more the culture develops, the more the population increases. Additionally, art and culture may help to attract the attention of the emigrated from different regions. For instance, America is a country which has an appealing culture. As a result, many people from several countries such as China, Japan, Thailand decided to emigrate to this place.",
        "Having said that, however, in a host of places, governments are focusing on developing advanced devices and equipment such as smartphones, computers, cars to serve for their own purposes. It is clear that an amount of money has been paid to improve those devices instead of the culture and art. Moreover, there are some political problems and thorny issues which need to be solved by money from the governments. Consequently, the funding from the government cannot use to support art and culture.",
        "In the light of these factors, I nurture the idea that the authorities should spend more concern about the art and culture of their countries because of the discussed benefits and the people from those countries."
