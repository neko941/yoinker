        "In the 21st century, sending letters perceives as an obsolete method in all over the world. It is generally thought by the most of the people that from writing to delivering a piece of written document is well forgotten because it wastes thousands of minutes compared to a text. Therefore, I do entirely accord with the statement of keeping an old communication method alive, especially in terms of other faster and reliable technologies.",
        "Firstly, proponents of the modern days tend to claim that writing letters is not in use anymore. Additionally, as the ancient method of sending and receiving letters has not yet been altered in recent years, competitive and lucrative technological developments in communications such as emails, texts etc. replaced many organizations related with letters. Consequently, people in both developed and developing countries will see the lettering system as just a showpiece in the museum really soon.",
        "Of my crucial importance, in my opinion, is that time taken by a letter than an email or a regular text clearly depicts a significant difference. The number of users in the fairly new methods for communicating are rising to the top because these options just not only take less time but also deliver to the correct place undoubtedly. As an illustration, an email literally takes one second whereas a letter deliveryman starts collecting after one day. Therefore, without investing much innovations in writing letter, it is barely possible to imagine it to sustain longer.",
        "All the things considered, I am inclined to restate that the letters, which were the only way to communicate, will soon be taken as a luxury item to the general citizens because of not competitive enough with the available modern technologies around communication."
