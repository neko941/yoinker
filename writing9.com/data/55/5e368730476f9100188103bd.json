        "The line graphs calculate average emissions of co 2 per inhabitants of four European countries between the year 1967 and 2007.",
        "Overall, it is clear that the United Kingdom infuse higher carbon dioxide per capita than the other three counties, which later on fell slightly.In comparison we get second highest country Sweden who emitted increasing amount of carbon dioxide after the UK, which later on drastically decrease whereas other two countries Italy and Portugal tend to arise between these forty years.",
        "In the year 1967, highest number of emissions infused by the UK and Sweden citizens which was 11 and 9 per metric tonnes. Whereas, Italy and Portugal per inhabitant we got 4 and 1 metric tonnes which were much lower. Over the decade emission of carbon dioxide emission boost in Sweden by 10.1 later on highly reduction can be seen in the following years. At the end of the year CO2 emission in",
        "Sweden has been sharply a cutback to 5 metric tonnes while in the united kingdom the fall in emission can be seen per person 9 metric tonnes.",
        "In contrast, there was significantly rising in emission of carbon dioxide in both the countries Italy and Portugal. In the year of 1967, the prior country per capita emission was 6 metric tonnes, which elevated to 8 metric tonnes per individual at the end of the year 2007. Comparably we focus on Portugal between this 40 years, dramatically rose in the emission of co2 from 1 metric per tonnes to 5 per capita, which exactly same to Sweden at the end of the year 2007."
