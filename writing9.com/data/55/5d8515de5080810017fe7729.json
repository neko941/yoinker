        "The state funds are being utilized in space exploration for a possibility of existence of life, however, some people opine that this trend is purposeless and money  should be exploited for some other critical issues of society. I completely agree with this statement and it seems to be that the preference should be given to other important issues such as poverty and uneducation.",
        "To begin with, the foremost reason for relocating the resources, is the total question of poverty. That is to say, majority of the under developed nations are living below the poverty line. Consequently, most of the people are being deprived from the basic amenities of life.",
        "Moreover, another widely observed phenomenon is the lack of education in these parts of the world. This has resulted from the lack of educational institutions which is certainly disadvantageous for the people. If the government will utilize all of its fund into some space project, than this would result in a choas among people as their basic necessities would be neglected. To illustrate, each year millions of dollars are being spent on the space projects by NASA which are merely a vanity projects. Hence, it is an uninspired trend for the government to monetize space missions while people suffer from the basic needs.",
        "Admittedly, due to issues such as global warming and the menace of exponential growth of population, it is the duty of the state to explore life into space, as this world would soon turn into unfavourable place to live. Despite this, spending money on such expensive projects while failing to deal with basic human requirements is largely disadvantageous.",
        "To conclude, it is imperative for the state to refrain from the quest of life in space, and spend money on real issues of public, be it poverty or lack of education. The onus lies on the government to deal with real issues of the society rather than focussing on the nobel projects."
