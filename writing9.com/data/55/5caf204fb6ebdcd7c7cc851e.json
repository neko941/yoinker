        "There is a noticeable trend worldwide that the increasing number of people makes their purchases for desirable products on the Internet instead of directly going to stores. From my perspective, this would bring about both merits and drawbacks on the social advance.",
        "It is undeniable that doing shopping online offers an enormous benefit on people\u2019s way of buying products. In fact, customers are likely to reach a great degree of convenience when e-shopping greatly sparks many busy people\u2019s interest by not requiring them much time and efforts to pay for their in need commodities. For example, Amazon or eBay provide Internet users with websites full of multi-brand products that allows consumers to approach a wide range of goods and make their choices without going to any crowded shops or out-of-town supermarkets.  Therefore, this enables buyers to spend their precious time on boosting their productivity rather than wasting on shopping.",
        "On the other hand, the practice of online shopping could have some drawbacks. First, there would be a reduction of people\u2019s expectation about ordered online gizmos when some of advertising agencies have exaggerate the quality of their goods through marketing images, which is the huge temptation customers could not resist. Second, with the rapid emergence of e-shopping, conventional stores would be gradually into oblivion that removes job opportunities for undergraduates or the poor. Consequently, online shopping might lead to a large waste of money as well as there would be a lack of sources of incomes for in need people.",
        "In conclusion, I would give credence that the existence of online shopping might have both advantages and disadvantages on human community."
