        "In some parts of the world, while people are gaining more weight, their physical health is exacerbating. This sensation can be comprised of two focal factors: what they eat, and how often they exercise. Measures can be made, as long as governments and individual dedicatedly play their part.",
        "People struggle hard to achieve their goals in their careers and along with this they also strive hard to maintain good health. Some people perceive that it is an efficient way to get promoted by working overtime, so in order to fit their hectic work schedule, people tend to opt for junk food rather than nutritious food. In addition, they do not have personal time to exercise to keep fit. For example, it has been found by a research that 70% of workers do not have private time to cook or exercise. As it can be seen, health problems caused by unhealthy food and lack of exercise are prominent.",
        "Maintaining a work-life balance and doing daily exercise are both critical to eradicating these problems. Exercise plays a crucial role in keeping us fit and people need to realize that balancing work and life enables us to be more successful in the work domain. A good illustration of this is that people who can balance their work and life are capable of achieving their targets more easily and effortlessly. To recapitulate, it is essential for us to exercise every day and maintain a work-life balance.",
        "All in all, such problems relating to health are currently ubiquitous. This essay discussed how these problems are often caused by insufficient exercise and junk food. This essay also suggested solutions to these problems, including maintaining a work-life balance and physical exercise."
