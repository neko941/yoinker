        "Although it is sometimes mentioned that governments allocate much more funds to protect wildlife, people believe that the focus should be on other issues than saving wildlife. In my opinion, I strongly agree that governments should not focus on protecting wildlife as it will greatly bring about more problems for both society and individuals.",
        "A good reason to reduce the funds spent on saving wild animals is that it is too costly because it involves law enforcement, research, and security. For example, to protect the endangered species in South Africa, the state allocated over ten millions of dollars to import highly functional devices to detect any suspicious poaching or illegal hunting in the natural habitat of these animals.  To have this amount of money, the government cut a few portions from the fund allocated to each sector in the country, such as education, healthcare, etc.",
        "Another point to consider is that not all animals are worth saving since some of these wild animals are dangerous and give rise to life-threatening situations to humans. To cite an example, some of the fierce wild animals in Uganda were responsible for killing around 1000 people last year, and these animals also led to an increased number of casualties among people. This will bring more negative consequences to the economy as a whole.",
        "Finally, humans ought to be prioritized over animals, and money should be spent on sectors that benefit humans; for instance, renovating infrastructure, support higher education, and healthcare. This will benefit society in the long run. For instance, if the money which was allocated by a certain government to protect wildlife was used to support the idea of free tertiary education. This will result in increasing the number of educated people. In other words, having a great resource of skilled and knowledgeable professionals will bring greater rewards to society as a whole. Moreover, it can bring more economic advantages to a country that shows itself as prosperous and leading in various field.",
        "In conclusion, reducing the allocated fund by governments to protect wildlife is a must for any country that should not be frivolous with money. Also, governments should allocate much more money to further enhance other sectors like education and healthcare instead of being spent on wildlife."
