        "While some individuals choose to give help and support personally to the needy,others would rather offer money to national and international charitable organizations. Although,giving money in person to those who need them ensures that the monies are used for its purpose,charitable organizations guarantee fair and equitable distribution of funds for needy people and in my opinion,this is the best method of rendering help.",
        "One the one hand,offering help directly to those in need ensures that these funds gets to the individual in due time.This is because it boycotts the barrage of paperwork associated with release of funds in charitable organizations.Furthermore,it prevents incidences of embezzlement of money and corruption because there is no middleman,therefore,the money is handed over to the individuals who need it.For example,over the last three months,two directors of non governmental  organizations have been probed by the economic and financial crimes commission because it was observed that while people donate large sums of money towards helping the poor,these men line their pockets with these funds,giving only a minor fraction to the less privileged.",
        "On the other hand,i think that giving monies to charitable organizations is a better way of rendering help because it eliminates bias and ensures fairness in the distribution of resources.For instance,people may decide to give money to only those who share same religious beliefs as they do or to only those from a particular ethnic group.As a result,many donors may end up providing support to the same individual therefore,while one person receives these benefits,other less privileged individuals are neglected. Also,these organizations ensure that a larger number of persons can be helped.This is because they can recieve donations and support from all over the world and reach out to people not only in their vicinities but also in other underdeveloped countries.",
        "In conclusion,while peoples opinion may vary on the choice of whether to offer help and support in person or through national and international charitable organizations,I strongly believe that the latter is better as resources can be fairly distributed amongst underprivileged people and support rendered to a much larger group of persons."
