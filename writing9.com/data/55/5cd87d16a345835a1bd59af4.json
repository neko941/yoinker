        "A person is considered successful if he has a good bank balance and owns expensive items of daily use. In my opinion, wealth and costly items do not determine the success of a person. Other factors play a pivotal role in making an individual successful.",
        "To start with, money is not the best marker of success. A rich person may be having a decent bank balance, but if he is socially isolated, that may render him psychologically deprived. For instance, a famous personality, who owns one of the biggest marketplaces online, recently split up with his wife. Although, he still owns a good amount of money and multiple valuables, he did not lead a successful married life.",
        "There are numerous other factors, which play a key role in determining whether a person is successful or not. One of the most significant factor is inter family relationships. A person having strong relationships with his family members, even having meagre amount of money, feels much more satisfied. To illustrate, a survey conducted by an NGO called Society For Skill Training And Development (SSTD), concluded in their results that the poor class in Pakistan leads more joyful life than the elite class families. When asked from the poor person, they attributed their happiness and success to their families.",
        "To sum up, it is quite evident that money cannot be the best measure of success. Other important factor is family, and relationship with family members, because it is only the family that is there for a person to celebrate success."
