        "Nowadays, movie production houses are investing huge amounts of money in the making of feature films; with the conviction that huge investments will result in proportionate returns. However, does that compensates for the lack of story or acting skills needed to gauge the audience attention? Even though, it may be required for paying actors bills, cinematography equipments among other things, but is not an independent factor to the success of a film.",
        "A movie is considered good when it is appreciated by the people. Investment of millions of dollars may not reciprocate into it being applauded by its viewers. Furthermore, it is indeed possible to make successful movies with low budget. Filmmaker these days are being criticized for adding unnecessary sequences, that may require heavy monetary invested to create, which does not add to the overall storyline of the movie. For instance, a movie recently gathered a lot of mayhem for special flying car sequence, even thought it failed to make big money at the box office.",
        "A plethora of reasons contribute to a movie's commercial success, where the choice of the choice of public plays a significant role. Since the audience these days is intelligent and are more inclined to spend their hard-earned money to view content-heavy and value based cinema. Strong story as well as solid content remains the governing factors that attract audiences to the theaters. Even low budget movies are earning 10 times more the money that was utilized to produce them, proving that money is not alone a factor in creating successful movies.",
        "To summarize, the success of a film does not necessarily depend upon the amount of dollars invested but it depends on its enriched storyline and attractive content."
