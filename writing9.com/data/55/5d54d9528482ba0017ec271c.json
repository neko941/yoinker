        "Nowadays, children\u2019s development in their educational phase is becoming a main concern in societyThe development of children in their educational phase is significantly important . Both teachers and parents share the important roles to help the children develop, especially their interpersonal and cognitive skills. However, due to the amount of effective time effectiveness that children spent by childrend in their daily life and substantive knowledge that they mostly gain get  in the school, I totally agree that teachers play much more important roles to perform and educate children to develloip their social interaction and academic life.",
        "Fundamentally, children are likely considered to spend more effective times in the school rather than at home. Hence, the school time is suggested towill provide children with the experience to build their social interaction with their teachers and friends. Moreover, the activity in the school which is provided by the teacher exertings more interactions among the class. For instance, teachers can give the peer-assignment that require expect  students to work and to collaborate with their peers. This kind of activity is believed as one of the stimulations for the children to learn how to work in a group and consult to each others in order to overcome the problem that they face together. Therefore, this activity will lead to an intense interaction among them, and it hardly happens at home due to the fact that the small amount of time and oopportunity that children can use to interaction with many people.",
        "Secondly, school teachers providimpart e  more subjece ts that substantively will boost the knowledge of the children. The subjects are projected as the constructive feedback which importantly excercise  more challenging tasks and activitiesy that will stimulate the children's brain to be more developed. For example, a language subject, such as ,like English or other any foreign language sis  are the subject that requires much effort to master. Languageae teachers should help the students by providing them the experiences on how they should study, learn, and acquire such language skills. They also can challengene their children to speak in different languages which is presumably difficult hard  for them if they doare not regularly usedoing and practiceing it. Therefore, if the children are steadily exposed by thesehis various activitiesy, time by time their cognitive ability and skills will widely expand. At the same time,,  while the disparity will be more likely happen if the students are handled only by their parents at home.",
        "As the summary, the development period especially the student's social and intellectual ability need to be handled carefully by someone who has more experience and is an expert in this field. Teachers are expectedly shoulder more responsibilities to educate the students, but it doesis not neccessarily meands parents lose their proportion in nurturing their children as one of the most important aspects in children's life."
