        "That the manner in which children behave ought to be stringently managed, is concurred upon by few parents as well as teachers, while there are others who are certain they must be given free rein to try something new and involve in activities of their choice.",
        "Foremost, micromanaging acts of offspring, will ensure they do not go astray or act indiscriminately, since they are naive and need guidance. Besides, the ideal period to inculcate best behavioural patterns in people is in childhood, and thus young ones must be handled rigorously. Close observation and management of young ones, will prod them to acquire savoir faire and mould them into responsible citizens with right values.",
        "On the contrary, if children are checked very rigidly, they become dependent, loose confidence and may even revolt later. It is often observed that children who are raised with lots of restrictions, do not attain their full potential. Furthermore, they require some respite from adult interference to discover their innate talents and tendencies. When they are let loose with little supervision, they often become more sensible and good decision makers. For instance, a few decades ago, when parents had almost half a dozen children, they generally let them be on their own, yet most of these children grew up into stalwarts, as in the case of late Dr. Kalam, the 11th President of India, who was raised along with his four siblings.",
        "To conclude, according to me, strictly controlling children would not be beneficial, as believed by some parents and teachers, since freedom in every arena would foster independent thinking and maturity, essential for the flowering of a personality. Nonetheless, guidance is significant as children are gullible and could develop unhealthy behaviour."
