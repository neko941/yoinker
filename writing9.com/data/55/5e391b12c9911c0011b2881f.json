        "Technology has played a crucial role in shaping our day to day life. Our offices and the way we work has changed tremendously as a result of computers. In this essay, I want to put forth my views to support that working from home should be encouraged.",
        "Connectivity across the globe has evolved over the years. Earlier, employees used to be in office by early morning, held their meetings and did other work only from office. They has no other way to connect with their colleagues or access their work related infrastucture outside office. This has changed completely now. Today, when a meeting is scheduled on webex or some other application, people from various parts of the world are able to join seamlessly. Workers can share their screen, display presentations or exchange ideas collaboratively without being physically present at the same location.",
        "This not only provides flexibility to everyone but also provides them teh comfort of working from their own place of choice at their own pace. This facility helps new moms to work from home without coming to office everyday. They can take care of their infants without worrying about leaving them at home. These are some of the advantages of connecting from home. Employers ares also benefitted as they do not need to maintain large infrastructure for the office. They need not maintain canteen and other facilities for their people. Companies like IBM are the pioneers in this domain and motivate their resources to work from home.",
        "Overall, this is win-win situation for both the company and the individuals. To conclude, I completely support that organizations should encourage their people to work from home."
