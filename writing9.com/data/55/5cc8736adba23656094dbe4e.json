        "Homes and workplaces are some of the most important places, which requires organisation and neatness. These are, great traits to possess, as people with these skills are often perceived as, focused. While many people may agree that homes, as well as work stations, should be kept tidy and arranged, some other persons may disagree. I, however, strongly propose, that they should be neatly arranged and kept clean, at all times. This essay, will discuss the reasons for this supportive stance.",
        "Untidy environment, is a breeding ground for diseases. Therefore, when one lives in a dirty place or works in an untidy environment, the individual is likely to contract one sickness or the other. So, for this reason, proper hygiene should be maintained. For example, my neighbour always complained, about the constant rate at which her child got sick, but as soon as she improved on her hygiene, the sickness ceased.",
        "Also, keeping a house and work stations neat and arranged, ensures easy location of things. Items can easily be spotted and as such, save the individual, time and stress of looking for things he or she needs.",
        "In addition, neat environment promotes efficiency at work places, as concentration is high when, work is done in a properly arranged room. It also, leaves a positive impression on people who visit your home or work stations.",
        "In conclusion, cleanliness at home and workplaces, are vital to ensuring good health and making life easier, as discussed above."
