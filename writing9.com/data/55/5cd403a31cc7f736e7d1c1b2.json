        "Some would argue that graduate students should study their interests, while others say that they should concentrate on subjects that will help them in the future. While allowing students to study subjects of their choice can lead to satisfying career prospects, I believe that students need to be taught relevant subjects so that they can sustain themselves in the future because of job automations.",
        "On the one hand, some believe that students should learn any subject they like because it helps them to align their interests with their careers. For example, if a student who is interested in arts and drama is forced to study accounting, it is unlikely that he will be happy, and it will ultimately demotivate him to perform well in his exams.  However, I believe that that students are better off pursing their interests as their hobbies instead of making it their career, because sometimes particular interests are not financially beneficial.",
        "On the other hand, students should be taught subjects that can ensure that their careers are not affected by the rise in automation in the last 2 decades. Many people are unable to find work as more and more jobs are being replaced by sophisticated machines with artificial intelligence, and due to this, traditional jobs are disappearing and new job roles have been introduced in the process. By ensuring that the students study the subjects associated with these new job roles, they would be able to find themselves in a better position to compete in the job market. I believe that there should be a list of mandatory subjects that students need to concentrate on, because many students are unaware of the harsh realities of the job markets and they need to be guided in the right direction.",
        "In conclusion, although allowing students to study any subject of their choice can encourage them to align their interests with their careers, students do not realize the harsh realities of the job market, and that is why they need to be guided in the right direction by assigning them the subjects that would help them to build a bright future for themselves."
