        "The trend of having different age group staff work in the same place is increasingly being witnessed these days. Although it could lead to disagreement in the team due to the existence of generation gaps, it also enables them to gain significant life experiences that will reward them later on in their life. In my opinion, the positive points of this tendency surpass the negative aspects.",
        "The crucial beneficial factor of mixing employee with various ages is that the expertise and experience in the professional domain of senior staff can show a good example for the young generation employees. Additionally, it can also help businesses flourished with fresher\u2019s energy and the older one\u2019s experiences. To illustrate, a recent research conducted in japan has revealed that nearly 80% of employee believe that they have learnt numerous necessary skills from old generations in the work place. For these reasons, these advantages has a profound impact on the future of companies.",
        "However, every coin has two sides. There are some considerable disadvantages associated with this tendency. The main challenge is that the generation gap could be detrimental to the work environment if two generations can\u2019t reach agreement. In addition, thoughts and advices of old generation can be outdated because we are living in a fast-paced changing world. Take myself for example, my peer co-workers tend to be more adventurous and innovative when it comes to decision-making compare to the old generation. As can be seen, this trend also generates negative consequences.",
        "To sum up, mixing people with different ages in the work place is ubiquitous nowadays. I\u2019m inclined to say that the overall benefits of this are superior."
