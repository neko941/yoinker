        "Economic development is the main concern of every government and it is believed by some people that authorities should not waste the money on arts like music and theater but instead should allocate that money to public services and according to my opinion both aspects are essential for the overall development of the society but government should invest huge amount in health care, education and other public utilities.",
        "Main aim of government is to provide good living standard to its citizen like education, health care facilities, public aminities and infrastructure and investing this money in music and theater does not help in solving the urgent problems of the society, so accordingly major chunk of amount should be put into public sector to help build the necessary infrastructure like schools and hospitals and provide people with job opportunities and eradicate problems like unemployment and poverty and music and drama should be pursued more as an hobby.",
        "However on the other hand, it is seen that arts like music and theater helps in maintaining the culture and heritage of the country and have many advantages firstly people are united through music and drama which builds the strong and cooperative society, secondly music and theater sector is an asset to an economy as it creates ample of job opportunities for its people and attract tourist .for example \u2013in recent survey by leading magazine it was stated that developed country which have invested and build their art and theater industry have generated 57% of more revenue through tourism, as it attracts people towards unique art and culture heritage  of that country.",
        "To conclude, according to me both the aspect art (music/theater) and public services are important for the overall growth of the society and country cannot develop in the absence of any one of it, both should go hand in hand but huge amount of money should be allocated towards the public services like building infrastructure, school, hospitals etc. to provide people with high living standard."
