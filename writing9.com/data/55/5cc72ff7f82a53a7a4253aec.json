        "In recent years, traffic block has become a major issues in both developed and undeveloped countries around the globe. According to a survey conducted by the People\u2019s magazine in 2012, showed that about 95% of all world\u2019s major cities around the globe suffer from traffic block which is mainly caused by less public transport. This essay will discuss causes as well as solutions to this issue which would involve provision of more public transportation services.",
        "There are several factors contributing to traffic jam in our society today. One of such main factor is, less public transport. Although, there are public transportations in major towns around the world, there isn\u2019t enough to reduce traffic jams. Take for instance, a state like Lagos State in Nigeria, which has a population of over 200 million people but has only about 10,000 registered public busses and well over a million plus registered private cars. The ratio of public transport to private transport is overwhelming. Thus, creating traffic blockage around the city causes people to miss interviews or appointments. In addition, more individuals reside in cities than country sides due to availability of basic amenities such as schools, hospitals. Therefore, increasing the population in the city and then increasing traffic jams.",
        "Tackling this issue involves, more public transports and less private transports. If the government, would provide public transportation systems that are convenient as well as conducive for members of it\u2019s society this would greatly reduce traffic blocks around various cities. Take for example, the first city in the world with the least traffic jam- Dubai, who in 2018 had the least traffic congestion in the world after their government provided more underground trains and buses for effective transportation. Furthermore, the development of the country sides. If every basic amenity such as schools, hospitals were found in the country side, people will be less compelled to migrate to the city thus, reducing population and in general reducing traffic jams.",
        "In conclusion, there are many major factors contributing to traffic blocks in our society today such as, less public transport and the major solution to this is provision of more public transports by the government thereby reducing traffic jams."
