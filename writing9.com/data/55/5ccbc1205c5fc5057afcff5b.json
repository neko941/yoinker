        "These days, thanks to the development of technology that allow us to watch news easily. However, there are some agruments that we should give more space for good news on the media instead of bad news. In my opinion, i tend to agree with this point of view at a certain extent.",
        "Apparently, reporting more nice information could bring us some benefits which might affect both societies and individuals in specifically ways. One of the main bright sides is that good news like people beyond their bad situation and obtain great achievements or a intelligent student take the high rank in  a competition could encourage people follow them. Owing to the fact that many people mimic their idols at some aspects, therefore, good news might be a great method to persuade people to do right things. Additionally, producers nowadays are focusing on sock news which can be aggressive users attention that could lead to rising people's depression, tension and anxiety. On the other word, giving too much duration for bad news and neglecting good news is a common tendency today, perhaps, many people are too similar to crimes on media then someone might try it as a normal action.",
        "On the other hand, less good news and more bad things still worth at some points. For the reason that we need to perceive our surrounding which affect our lives in both direct and indirect ways. Take climate change as an examplem, our wolrd are changing rapidly in a really terrible trend, the way we treat the environment which is the main reason for some horrible disasters  such as tsunamis, flash floods and droughts. Hence, people's awareness should be risen by those bad screens. Furthermore, bad news is a common way to warn people from some offensive activitie, thus, reducing criminal rate effitively.",
        "In conclusion, good news should be given more space on the media; however, bad news still remain as the majority of the media."
