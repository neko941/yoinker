        "The topic of whether or not the business activities of companies should be overseen by people who are related by blood or bond remains controversial. The major bad effects are while the advantage is. In my opinion, the\u00a0\u00a0 negative impacts of businesses run by family members are greater than the benefits.",
        "On one hand, a lot of successful companies in the world are owned by families who are significantly involved in its daily business activities. This is because they have an understanding of one another and how to communicate effectively. The end result of which is a limit in the time taken to deliberate on problems and pending transactions, owing to the fact that most often than not, they have a collective front that has been the mission statement of the company for years. For instance, important business matters can be deliberated over dinner rather than waiting to call for a business meeting.",
        "On the other hand, businesses run by families are prone to bias especially in leadership. They are susceptible to being led by members who are not only incompetent but who also have no idea of how to effectively run the business. For example, Harolds chain of supermarket stores, a prominent establishment in London, declared for bankruptcy recently. It was discovered that most of the top executives were relatives who lacked good financial judgements. They were not qualified to handle their position. Nepotism remains the downfall of this kind of business ownership.",
        "Another main disadvantage is the fact that family matters can be mixed with business. It is common knowledge, that it is very difficult for people to separate emotion from thei work, businesses are no exception. This makes it easy for them to transfer their grudges and differences to business matters. The result of which is an infringement on the progress of the establishment.",
        "To conclude, more and more businesses in recent times, are being run by family members. The positive impact of family-run companies is the fact that operations can run seamlessly. However, bias and incompetence coupled with emotional compromise are aome of the numerous deleterious effects. I believe that the negative effects of family-run businesses are more than the advantages."
