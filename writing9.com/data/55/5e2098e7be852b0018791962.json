        "Although leading movies superstars or sports public figures faces difficulties , there are many benefits associated with it. In consider, the problems of being a celebrity far outweigh the extracted merits.",
        "Admittedly, there are some advantages of being a famous personality. Firstly, they have a big wealth that provides a secure future for them and can lead a life full of luxury. They, usually, can bring many fortunes to them and their family. Expensive clothes, luxurious cars and homes, and other materialistic pleasures of life translate dreams into reality when a person becomes famous. Secondly, the noted personalities have many admirers. Fan\u2019s respect and love, very often, inspire famous persons to achieve greater success. Moreover, general public would always like to get their thoughts and opinions on their lifestyle.  Furthermore, plenty of opportunities is opened up when people become renowned. For instance, someone like Cristiano Ronaldo lead a life that is enviable by others.",
        "Nevertheless, despite the above upsides, I believe, celebs could face serious drawbacks of being well known to crowd. One potentially dangerous problem is that people instantly judge the person in line light. Magazines, tabloids, newspaper, social networks, and other forms of media are quick to criticize a celebrity on his habits, personality, and personal affairs. They are always being asked about their personal life which should not have mattered to media and public. Sometimes a celebrity is traumatized by the fake stories. Another obvious issue is celebrities often cannot do things that the common people can. They are mobbed by adoring fans wherever they go. Take Tom Cruise for an example \u2013 what would happen if he walks down to a shopping mall on a regular day? He would be surrounded by fans for selfies and autographs. Thirdly, their thoughts and words are presented negatively on current political or any other social issue which goes viral in minutes to harm their personality.",
        "In conclusion, downsides of being a public figure is more than the upsides given to the role by money, fame and career opportunities."
