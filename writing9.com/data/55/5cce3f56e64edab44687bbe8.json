        "While some people believe that art should be essential subject for children at school, others contend that art subject is a waste of time. I agree with the view that learning art is a necessary for children that can help them to improve more knowledge.",
        "On the one hand, there are some who argue that it would waste time if school enables their children to study art. They also tend to cut down time from other significant subjects such as math, physical and chemical. Besides, in order to perform well in art, the children also need to spend more time to practice. By doing it, other subject could not have enough time, thereby decreasing results. Moreover, a successful career do not have skills about art. It can be seen that those days, most artist consider their living which relate to sell work of art.",
        "Despite the above arguments, art still plays an irreplaceable role in the society as it is instrumental in balancing the life, maintaining the human part. Indeed,  when people study after a long haul, they can feel tired or frustrated. As a result, they need to do something that can help them refresh their mind. Art subjects including music, drawing, painting and sculpture allow children to enter a state of relaxation. Following this, they could be easier to concentrate their goal, as well as they would have enough energy to enhances hand-eye coordination and problem-solving skills which may assists children in achieving better learning outcomes.",
        "In conclusion, despite someone claim that it would waste time if children study art subjects in school, the positive sides of its are still more desirable."
