Although there is an empty space outside our office premises, we don't feel safe to park there because usually children ride cycles there and we fear to have scratches on our cars and motorcycles. There is a facility available in our premises too but at the moement it's not allowed for our office employees. If our authorities sign a contract between the building officials then we will be able to use the parking.",
