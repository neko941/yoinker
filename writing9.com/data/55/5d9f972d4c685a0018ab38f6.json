        "Nowadays, many individuals are becoming obese, some have suggested that an increment in the price of foods that contains high cholesterol will bring a solution to obesity. In my opinion, I disagree with this as an inflation in the price of food that contains fats will have negative effects on the economy and also brings deficiencies to the nutritional effects in the body system.",
        "Firstly, the price hike on fatty foods will bring about bankruptcy to the company producing the products which In return causes a reduction in tax that goes into the economy for the development of infrastructure. Furthermore, A price hike will affect individuals that need to purchase the products because they might not be able to afford it. In addition, when there is no more or reduction in the purchase of the goods, the company produces the goods collapses and leads to laying off of the staffs which leads to the bad deficit to the nations\u2019 economic situations.",
        "Another point to consider is the nutritional benefits of fats. Our body requires certain amounts of nutrients which vary from carbohydrates, vitamins, minerals, proteins and also fats. World health organization releases that our food requires about 14% of fats in order to live healthily. Body system depends on fats as its help to secrets our veins and blood vessels from being exposed to the dangers coming in through the outer skin layer. With an increase in price, our body will be deprived of these important nutrients which can lead to health problems.",
        "In conclusion, for the reasons mentioned above, inflation in the price of fattening foods will have negative effects on the societal health and breakdown in the country\u2019s economic system."
