        "Participating adventureous games is a personal choice, according to some, while others consider that these kinds of sports ought to be prohibited. I, personally, believe that ultimately  partcipants have the right to decide their preference and the government can install safety measures. This essay shall support my views in following paragraph.",
        "Firstly, in a demographic world, freedom of a choice is a fundamental right, nobody  can stop others until they are harm  to people\u2019s life  and things. Therefore, it has been noted that the sporting activists are made to aware the consequence and possible damages it may cause. For example, in many western countries, dangerous activities such as scuba diving, or sky diving are permitted for all, after explaining the  amount of  risks and accidents can involve in this; however, nobody stops them from doing  as it is individual decision.",
        "Secondly, while actively involving such activities can have many benefits to the person and the economy. Regarding personal perpective, he could enjoy his courage  and even push the  limit to the next level and  understand that how capable he is. Similarly, these kinds of sporting events attract millions of foreigners to fly over, eventually, the economy can be  flourished and generated income. For instance, Newzeland,  the home for bungee jumping,  has been conducting   the dangerous activity  successfully by maintaining safety rules and providing trainings to both participants and the coaches. Therefore, it is obvious that such entertainments should not be deallowed.",
        "In conclusion,  some view that  extreme games to be bnanned  due to its safety concerns. I strongly consider it is a personal choice and by  ensuring safety measures and training  this can be as  enjoyable as other events."
