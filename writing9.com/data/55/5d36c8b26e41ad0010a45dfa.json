        "Not Enough people realise the importance of natural world. What is the reason for people's lack of awarness? how can people be made more aware?",
        "Most of the people are ignorant of the value of Mother Nature. Why are people blinded to this information? What can be done to spread awareness? In my essay will elaborate more on these issues.",
        "Firstly, Nowadays, It is uncommon to know the significance of earth and its living beings. Due to the fact, that majority of the human population is concentrated in specific areas of the world. As a result, they live in large metropolitan cities which have little or no wilderness. This absence of natural environment causes the people to understand less about the earth. For example, China is a very densely populated country, they have cut a lot of their rain forests thus, forcing the animals to migrate elsewere.Consequently, and they have little awareness on the natural beauty of the earth.",
        "Additionally, something must be done to make people know more about the nature and its worth. Campaigns on our eco-system will be a good step towards spreading knowledge on the earth\u2019s environment. Posters on popular public places will catch the attention of bystanders and walkers. Furthermore, TV commercials can help promote this in a better way. For instance, New Zealand made a successful campaign last year on preserving the natural resources of earth. A lot of people with their families participated in this campaign and they learned a lot with kids games.",
        "In conclusion, more should be done to educate the humans on the value of nature and the living things that wander the earth. Preserve the nature to the full extent for the next generation to come."
