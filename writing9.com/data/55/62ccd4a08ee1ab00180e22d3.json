        "It is frequently believed that the production of green energy such as solar power wind power and wave power is unaffordable and complex. While the traditional energy sources like oil, gas and coal are cheaper for city and transportation purposes. I disagree with this belief. In this essay, I will explain that green energy is more productive and harmless to the earth.",
        "Coal and gas are largely used in various industries and power generation plants, while gas is for domestic purposes. According to a survey, these traditional energy sources cause 70% of the total pollution in the world.",
        "Climate change is a huge problem, which is not limited to a group of regions or countries. It affects each and every part of the globe. Researchers had proved that excessive usage of natural energy sources namely oil, gas, and coal results in global warming. This picture can be changed by replacing them with green energy.",
        "The production cost of alternative energy is an issue. To protect mother nature is more important than the economics of the country. As the technology is getting advanced every day the expenses of alternate energy can be reduced. For example, 20 years ago buying a phone or television set was not budget-friendly for everyone, but now it is common to have a smartphone and a flat-screen television in each home.",
        "Rather than funding the unnecessary space program, if the government will spend money on safer energy production, it will help the reduction of pollution. Instead of saving money we all should concentrate on saving natural wealth so that our next generations can experience the real beauty of nature.",
        "In conclusion, by developing better equipment for green energy production we can replace the traditional energy sources for vehicles and cities at a better cost."
