        "Organizing such sports in a country provides a lot of opportunities to citizens. It is a great help to improve the socio-economic status of the country being the hostess. For example, giving more work to individuals needed to support the participants, ensuring the safety of delegates, and ensuring the good services they need during their stay in the country. In addition, we may also be able to introduce the culture globally by showing it  and letting them feel it thru experience.
