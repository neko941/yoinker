        "Our Forefather says \u201cEvil communication corrupts bad manners\u201d which means what is in close contact with ink will be black, what is near light will be illuminating, and it is precisely correct with children\u2019s influence that the factors outside the home play a bigger part in their lives. I agree with the opinion",
        "In fact, children growing up in a small family will be influenced by their parents individually because of getting a family education every day. However, once they grew up, they would need more knowledge as well as automatically receive information from outside without recognition of quality. Besides, up to their innateness, some children like subjects from a society that their parents do not have such as literature, music or painting while others like information technology or physic",
        "Secondly, children easily learn negative manners once they unluckily contact uneducated persons.  In addition, social factors also influence  young children much more than educational elements such as online games, gambling, etc. Sometimes, we can see many students in game centres or shop centres during school time while others easily get social seduction that their parents never expected.",
        "Obviously, social factors really influence  children\u2019s development or at least impact  their life somewhat"
