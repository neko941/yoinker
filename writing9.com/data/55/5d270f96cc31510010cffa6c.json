        "A safe environment is Important for the habitation of man.  Through different means, this same  being seems to be a major contributor to environmental pollution . It is therefore imminent that both the humans and government consider different ways to address this  burdensome issue of environmental decadence.",
        "One major damage caused by humans to the habitat  is  their contribution to global warming through the use of  fuel consumption machines. Alot of mechanical aids which are used in big manufacturing industries are known to emit tonnes of Co2 each everyday, which is a major cause of ozone layer depletion. For instance,  as recorded by the National Environment Agency (NEA) UK 2014,  CO2 is the number one  factor damaging natural domain and factory plants are a main cause of this, as a result, led to several global health issues. However, inorder to put a check to this harmful outcome, individuals should invest more in producing electric machines which increases production out out and are eartly compatible.",
        "The government also have a vital role to implement in addressing and controlling global damage. Due to overwhelming influx of crowd  in most cities to get good jobs , alot of natural haitats have been demolished to build infrastructures  like housings and real estates to accommodate these crowd. However, this has led to congestion causing the spread of viral diease hence, increasing number of patients visit to the hospital this was an example stated by the  Board of National Hospital Ibad. The focus of the  government should be to provide payables Jobs in rural areas, as this will reduce populations and preserve nature.",
        "In conclusion, it is evident that both the government and individuals are significantly responsible for protecting the earth."
