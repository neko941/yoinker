        "In this concurrent world, it is undoubtedly true that public's shopping habits depend also on the youth group they apply to than any other factors. Some people concur that argue that shopping preferences of a person is determined by their life. I do not quite agree with this view.however, I quibble from them and propound that While I do admit that youngsters and teenagers tend to shop more than elderly people, a person\u2019s ability to shop is ultimately determined by their financial status.",
        "Adequate evidence is obtainable to substantiate the concept of, rich people tend to shop more than poor people. This  is not necessarily because their needs are greater.The top - notch concrete, Although I agree that ages play a vital role in making shopping decisions of many people, I still argue that there exist other factors affecting such decisions.Another rational which hauls me to patrons is First of all, it is clear that a group of people who have the same age, maturity shall tend to buy certain products that are considered appropriate to their mutual hobbies.",
        "The rearmost coherent factor to be considered which cannot be neglected is another factor that could influence the shopping habits of people is their values and beliefs. People who believe in simple living are unlikely to splurge even if they can afford it.To uphold my notion, I would quote an instance of the youngsters between six and twelve years old would like to possess toys such  as cars or Barbie dolls; while the teenagers have the inclination for the technological devices on which they can download the video games. Therefore, many companies have relied on this feature to launch marketing campaigns that bring billion dollars of profit, but they also use other factors because not only the ages could have influence on buying habits but also the genders and media, which is prima facie testimony.",
        "What is half full for some, may appear half empty to others.So the public in general tends to distinguish that, they will stimulate people to purchase unconsciously items, which is partly due to the stunning pictures as well as special effects, which has multifarious reasons. To commence with, some people deem that  is more common among adolescents and youngsters. They often follow fads and buy things that they may or may not need. They are Also more likely to invest in clothing, gadgets and personal care products, withal they also uphold that even so, not every youngster spends in the same way. Young people coming from rich family backgrounds certainly spend more than their poor counterparts.",
        "In recapitulation, l reiterate that there are innumerable strong factors supporting our squash club is made up of entirely different people, with maturity ranges from 16 to 70; there are both women and men that play from all parts of the world including England, America, South Africa and China. So again, this \u201chabit\u201d has nothing at all to do with youth. however  it's contrary can be overlooked or controlled. Consequently, I firmly agree with the given statement."
