        "Although it is sometimes thought that higher education ought to support former students in receiving a position in a company, others believe that merits which university offers is much more prevalent. In my opinion, I consider that efficiency of an educational system should correlate with an opportunity to get a desirable job.",
        "On the one hand, some people believe that universities should guarantee employment for its graduates since the vast majority of students obtain a degree in order to get a job. In other words, being in educational process is just a path to receive required knowledge which will be on demand within a labor market. To illustrate, A-marked students who sacrifice everything to produce superior results do that because they want to have a variety of options when it comes to choose a company. Furthermore, hosting career day events can be helpful for future employees, because they can familiarize with companies\u2019 requirements.",
        "Admittedly, there are numerous perks when it comes to define value of other aspects of educational curriculum. Universities tend to offer a broad range of extra disciplines which students may find worth attending. In that matter, more and more pupils are able to apply for musician classes or any other, which can be out of their primary discipline.  If educational institutes, for instance, had neglected these initiatives, they would have not received sustainable number of attendees. This is important because in some cases people are willing to have a versatile development.",
        "In conclusion, while people may vary in their opinions, I think that university should provide employment commitment by arranging career festivals where students can get familiar with business representatives for further employment."
