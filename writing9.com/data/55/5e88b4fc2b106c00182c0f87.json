        "Some people say that it is awesome to share knowledge with others in specific filed such as scientific research, business and in the academic direction while others say that some knowledge is crucial or worthy to be shared without fess.  In this essay, I will discuss the first view and second view. Firstly, I will explore the positive impact of sharing a good knowledge with people and secondly, I will explore why some people think knowledge or information is hard to share with others and why it is crucial.",
        "To begin with, participation in the information or the knowledge that you have with you to others is more than perfect due to there will be many benefits and positive impacts on others who want to learn and develop their knowledge. In addition, sharing information whether in scientific, research or in the academic direction will improve the quality of research, business and academic world. For example, working as a team to produce a treatment and sharing ideas together will result in huge critical thinking.",
        "Secondly, some people think that sharing information is too crucial or too worthy to be shared without fess. There is much sensitive information that is really hard to share with everyone. For instance, research police centers and the government business which is dealing with other countries. Moreover, there are also many published research or training courses available on different websites that required fess and that considered as their jobs so that\u2019s why everyone should pay if need it.",
        "In conclusion, depends on the information that people need. Some information is allowed to read it for everyone, and others are not allowed. In my opinion, everyone should share all allowable information that does not require any acceptance from any side."
