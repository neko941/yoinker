        "It is believed that job stability is more important than satisfaction. Although, people\u2019s first reaction is to agree with such statement. However, there are compelling reasons to refute this claim. In the following paragraphs, there are a number of reasons for a more in-depth discussion on both sides of this issue.",
        "First, stable income is very important for people with families. Take for example, my friend Talha, whose husband is an air pilot. He loves his job, travels around the world every month. However, quarantine restrictions left him unemployed. Even though restrictions are over, he won\u2019t be able to catch up with bills piled for months. From such example, its is clear that a guaranteed job is a big deal for a family.",
        "On the other hand, some people argue that professional satisfaction is more important for the young generation. Because they need to have freedom to be creative, autonomous and self-starting. So, they will devote all their hearts to these causes. For example, my little brother is a trauma surgeon. Although it is quite tedious and dangerous, he finds achievements in having an effect in some\u2019s life. So, people need to have a sense of fulfillment to motivate their energy.",
        "In conclusion it should be said that none of the parties has absolutely no benefits. However, I agree with the position that satisfaction is more important. Since we speed up most of our working hours, we need to be enthusiastic. Otherwise, one day we will be burned to the ground."
