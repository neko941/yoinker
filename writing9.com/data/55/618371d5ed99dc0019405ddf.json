        "Although the world has been witnessed  great advancements in the agriculture industry, there are still numerous hungry people all over the globe. There are some reasons for that, whereas some action which can be done.",
        "The two main reasons for hunger are population boom and over-consumption. First, it is true that agriculture has achieved great advances, yet it is not enough to provide food for everyone; and even if it was, the number of countries accessing these achievements are not noticeable. In addition, every day, a large amount of food is thrown out by people and restaurants all over the world. For instance, almost every restaurant in a prosperous neighborhood cooks food more than its necessity which can result in more throwing out food.",
        "However, some potential measurements can be done to tackle the above. Education, with long-term impacts on both problems, is the first one. It can control the birth rates in developing and poor countries; also can decrease over-consumption in the next generation. Secondly, developed countries, in which food is produced more than needed, should help undeveloped ones, with the shortage of food. In this way, the more proportion of world could have at least one meal a day.",
        "In conclusion, as agriculture has many advances, because of the more increasing population level and food throwing away, the scarcity of food still is a global issue. Some action should be done immediately, otherwise, it will become more serious in the next decades."
