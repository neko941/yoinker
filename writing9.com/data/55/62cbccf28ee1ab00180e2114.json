        "It is often argued that teenagers should work part-time to acknowledge the the real work experience and neatness. However, many people believes teenagers shouldn't oblation their time to rest by doing an after-school activities for work. Both opinion are understandable, honestly, I have to mind about this, it is a good think to give an early introducing the real work experience by taking a part-time job to the teenagers, however,  at the same time it can be a disasters for their health.",
        "In my take on this, firstly, Part-time can help the teenagers to gain more money and work experiences that will be valuable later on. For instance, many teenagers in Yogyakarta decided to take part-time job because companies nowadays are looking for an employee who have a worked experience, even tough, they are fresh graduates. Having the real working experience is precious for their career journey.",
        "On the other hand, the part-time job take juvenile time for rest. For example, many college student in Yogyakarta having health issue since they don't have a proper time for rest because they need to work after the class until in the middle of the night. Usually, teenagers who taking part time job forget their health and it can be catastrophe when they become older.",
        "To conclude, having a real work experience for teenagers might be valuable for their career journey. Even so, they need to be careful about their health issue and know the limitation for theirselves, since health conditions is also important for their future."
