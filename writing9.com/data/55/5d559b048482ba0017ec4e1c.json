        "There is an argument between people about the influence of celebrities on the adults\u2019 minds and personalities that is the social media responsible for it.  I totally agree that the media have a major effect on the society.  In this essay , I going to highlight on some of the negative results of giving  a great concern of celebrities nowadays.",
        "At first, the young children can be affected easily by famous people because they cannot judge correctly on the others behaviors. The number of teenagers who imitate the celebrities is boosting; they do not think before doing anything because they just watch them doing untraditional actions or wearing a new costume, they rapidly do like they . For example, there is a famous actor had made a special haircut trend, in a month; almost young men and teenagers just made as his hair\u2019s trend.",
        "On the other hand, the media is playing an important role in spreading the culture of the famous celebrities. If the government expresses a clear observation on the materials that appear on the TVs or social media, there will not be much more negative effect on the children. In addition to that , many families think that the films and plays which showed on visional channels have an enormous influence on their kids personality. For instance; there is an article  have published in Al-Ahram newspaper showed that 80 % of the school students are doing the same aggressive actions like a famous actor called Mohamed Ramadan.",
        "To sum up, the more positive things and actions showed by media , the more healthy minds will be grow. WE must give a huge care for the materials that shown on the media channels."
