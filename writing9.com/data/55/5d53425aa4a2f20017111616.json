        "Currently in some societies, at 18years of age, a young individual is regarded as an adult, consequently allowing the young person the right to cast vote and license to drive or enter into the institution of marriage. In my opinion, I believe 18 years to be a very appropriate consideration for adulthood because at that stage there is better development physically and from experiences gained, and also independence.",
        "Firstly, at 18, the human body and the brain which is the power house of the human body system are fully developed for such a person to carry on responsibilities as choosing a good life partner, selection of leaders and driving on public roads This means that at that stage of life, the brain of the young individual has better cognitive ability, having also gathered several life experiences and built effective relational skills that enables him function properly as a complete, fully developed adult. As an illustration, a study done by world renowned brain surgeon, Dr Ben Carson revealed that the brain function of an 18year old individual when compared to that of a younger human is able to better process information, retain memories/data and think effectively.",
        "Another important reason, why 18 year olds should be considered adult is that at that point in life, the young individuals having concluded senior high school in most cases, subsequently finds himself in an entirely independent environment either as a university student or working a paid job. What's more, these young ones find themselves living outside the watch of their parents, in far away towns as students, leaving them the sole responsibility of personal and school decision making, while those who get employed are also left to make decision concerning their jobs and also contribute positively to the workforce and output of the society which they belong to.",
        "In conclusion, age certainly is a determinant of adulthood stage of life and I strongly feel that there is not a more appropriate age to be regarded as adults and partake in all the benefit/duties that come with adulthood, as the age 18 since the individual is fully formed and already independent."
