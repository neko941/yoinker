On the other hand, the tool used in distributing information can be user friendly that is easy to use. One does not need to get stained with pen any longer. For example, I got a message same day from a friend that arrived Australia yesterday. The highlighted merits have made messaging distribution uncomplicated.",
        "Secondly, a few of the demerit can be alarming in such that discussing through the web can be insecure.  Messages sent via the web is no longer safe especially for delicate ones. Hackers can intrude people\u2019s privacy and steal such vital details. On another hand, the low or medium class individuals might find it difficult to afford paying web subscription. Average earners will prefer to use the old fashion way of distributing information because of the unaffordable high cost of internet facilities. For instance, a family friend that travelled to Nigeria last week is yet to send an arrival message to her family because of the high rate of cloud resources and low income.",
