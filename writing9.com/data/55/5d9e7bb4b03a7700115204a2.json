        "The figure's illustrate the construction and operational features of a Wave-Energy Machine  when installed in different locations.",
        "The design consists of a two chambers, one container consisting of the mechanical equipment's such as turbines, electric generator and a common shaft located above the second. The second container is to contain water from the waves.",
        "The fluid levels rise accordingly to the intensity of the waves moving opposite to their native direction. The air from the top most vent is pushed through the first turbine and then through the lower enclosure interlinked by a common shaft. Also, the air flow from the lower cavity is pushed to the lower turbine connected to the generator and on the rotation of turbine the electrical energy is generated by the generator depending upon the rotation speed of the  turbine. Although the additional air is pushed out through the exit vent present above.",
        "There are two operable locations are based on height of waves. The production output is high when installed in large waves, though it incurs huge installation cost, contrary to the other location where the installation cost is less and the output is also low. To conclude, the output is proportional while the installation cost is inversely proportional to the waves height and intensity."
