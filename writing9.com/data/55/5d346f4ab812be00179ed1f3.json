        "Nowadays, children are working in some piad jobs for money in most of the countries. Many people think that it teaches children many valuable leasons, however others are opposite to this ideology and consider ot as totally wrong. This essay will describe my own perspective toward this viewpoint.",
        "To began with, working under any job always teaches a person some great leasons. First and foremost, if children are engaged in some kind of paid work, then they can learn about the value of money. They can learn how to save money while spending it. For instance, those students who go abroad for studying, they always do part tome work and save the money for their school fee and other needs. Secondly, if the children start working during young age, they can learn about work experience as well as responsibilities. While working at any job, children are able to know about various skill such as, communication, co-operation, social ethics and so on. Children are also become responsible. They will not waste their time for non productive things such as social media. They become more dedicate to work and study.",
        "On the other hand, people consider working at paid jobs is not a appropriate thing. They think this because of two reasons. Firstly, people think that they will become money minded person, which may be  lead them to illegal work. Some children do not want to do hard work for money, so they choose the wrong path to make money. For example, children become drug deller, thief, black mailer and so on only for currency. Secondly, people think that there academics scores will be affected due to their jobs. If children do job while study, then they cannot put equal efforts in both fields. One definitely will be affected. So, because of these two reason people consider it as completely wrong.",
        "To conclude, children should do part time jobs only, so that their academics score will not be affected and they should not have motive to collect money. Instead of that, they should learn about importance of money and responsibilities from work."
