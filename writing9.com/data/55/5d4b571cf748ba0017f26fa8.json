        "Nowadays, it is clearly obvious that the number of skilled workers, living in poor countries, immigrating from their homeland to much more prosperous countries is increasing day after day. And, as a consequence, there are a lot of problems associated with that phenomenon.",
        "To begin with, people are leaving their country of origin in searching for a better lifestyle. To illustrate, professional workers will get much more luxurious services like education, health care, public transportation\u2026etc. in their new destinations compared with those offered in their hometowns. And as a result, these poor countries have to pay more attention to delivered public services in order to keep their valuable human resources as much as possible.",
        "Another essential motivator for the people to immigrate is money. In other words, a high standard of salaries is paramount factor any professional is searching for. To clarify, unless the professionals get paid fairly, they will not think of attempting new horizons. In addition to that, the immigrants will find it much more easier to develop their careers if compared with their homelands. For example, doctors, in developed counties, will find more facilities and technologies to deal with and, as a result, they will be capable of reaching more achievements with their professions. So, poor countries have a lot to do with their salaries standards.",
        "In conclusion, human resources are the core for any nation. And it is obligatory for it to pay all the efforts to keep them satisfied and willing to stay in their hometowns. Otherwise, reducing the numbers of immigrants could be insurmountable."
