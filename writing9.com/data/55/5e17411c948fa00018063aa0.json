        "It is true that children are  having many options to use their spare time during the blooming of new technologies. Although this trend has some positive effects, I strongly believe that the drawback is more significant.",
        "On the one hand, no one can argue the benefits of technology to children in today\u2019s world. Firstly, technology can create a great source of entertainment. School children are usually under academic pressures. Their parents expect them to do well at school and gain achievements in their lives, so they usually have to attend extra classes, which can drain them of energy. Hence, technologies such as internet or mobile phone can help them temporarily escape the tedium of schoolwork. Secondly, spending time on technologies is a safe way for children to spend their free time. They can avoid dangers that lurk around such as kidnapping or accidents. In addition, when they play at home, their parents will find it easier to control what they are approaching.",
        "Despite the positive effects mentioned above, I believe that they are negated by the following problems. Firstly, the excessive exposure to screen increases the risk of health problems. Spending hours one end  glued to screen makes children more vulnerable to health problems such as blurred vision and obesity. Instead of going outside and do some physical activity they tend to  opt for playing video games at home. Secondly, the lure of technology is likely to make children underperform at school. Lingering images of games or TV shows may prevent them from paying attention to lessons. Therefore, they have satisfying scores at school, which makes them more stress.",
        "In conclusion, while there are some advantages of children spending time on advanced technologies, it seems to me that the disadvantages are more significant."
