        "Residents with different culture and nationality can contribute to the growth of the country the settle in. A number of persons assume that having people from diverse countries with different cultures residing together in the same nation will quicken the country's development. However, i admit that when people from different countries with diverse culture settle in the same place, they will contribute to that country's prompt development. But then, it could also lead to an increase in crime rate.",
        "Settlement of different individuals across nations with different cultural background in one country will make the country develop faster. To illustrate, people have different ways of doing things which could yield same results thus, when different people stay together, they will bring ideas and solutions of sorts that will help speed up the growth of a nation. In USA for example, 77% of medical doctors that contribute to solving health issues are immigrants from Nigeria. Another example is having peace ambassadors of different countries settle in one country to help resolve wars which will in turn bring speedy growth to such country. Hence, people from several nations with thier diverse cultures who choose to live together will make such country grow speedily.",
        "On the other hand, settlers from different countries living in one nation can result in a high incidence of crime. To explain, offenders of the law are fond of emmigrating to another country where nobody knows them hence, they'll continue in such crime which might deter the growth of that country. In Nigeria for example, Immigrants from Islamic countries are currently instigating high incidence of killings among christians which has inturn affected the growth of the nation. Therefore, having people from different nationalities and cultures live together in one country can deter the country's growth through increased crime.",
        "In conclusion, I believe that allowing people from different nations and cultural background to live together in the same country will make the country grow with speed. Nonetheless, It can also result in high incidence of crime, but if the country is consistent in running a background check on each emmigrant before issuing visas, i believe there will be reduction in crime."
