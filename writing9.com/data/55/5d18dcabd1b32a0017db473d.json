        "The mothers and the fathers of the modern era are paying less attention to their kids as compared to the previous generation. As a result, the kids miss out on the early age learning from their parents and that could be very crucial during their adulthood. I agree with this observation. This essay will point out the reasons for such situation and it will also discuss the adverse impact of this situation on the children.",
        "Nowadays, the parents are paying less attention towards upbringing of their kids. Due to rising inflation and costly lifestyles, both mother and father are forced to work to meet the cost of living. Hence, they stay away from their children for the  most of the day and when they return, thy are too tired to spend time with the family. Eventually, kids would start living their life on their own terms and would not prefer the interfearence from the family in future. Such situation could lead many kids toward depression under the stressed situation during their adulthood. For example, the cases of suicides at the younger age have been rising every year over the last decade.",
        "Moreover, the technological advancements have also played a role of spoiler in the parents-children relationship. In today\u2019s smartphone and the internet era, parents prefer virtual connect over the real one! For example, both mother and father would spend more time on Facebook and WhatsApp or mobile games compare to the time they would spare to play actual games with their childeren. As a result, the children will get disconnected from the real world and could not be able to develop the skills which are required human for relationships management and emotional bonding. Additionally, they could miss out on learning many important life lessons like the team work or the sportsmenship spirit.",
        "To conclude, I would reiterate that rising disconnect between the parents and their kids is now a known phenomenon. Eventually, the children will suffer the most due to such situation during their adulthood."
