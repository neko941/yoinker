        "Nowadays most couples throughout the globe do not want to have babies. The main advantage of this situation is that they do not have to take care of anyone and they can focus solely on themselves. While the main drawback is the feeling of loneliness in old age.",
        "The main advantage for a couple who do not have children is that they can make themselves the center of their world, and can give major time to their work and be financially strong. They do not have to look after anybody and they can concentrate on their own growth. For example, The Times of India reported that 65% of people working in the multinational companies in Delhi are deciding to be childless throughout their lives so that they can focus on their careers and stay free from any responsibility.",
        "Despite this, most couples without children start feeling lonely after a certain age in their lives. This is because when they look around themselves, they see others of their age playing and having fun with children, and at that moment they miss having a baby. For instance, The Mother\u2019s World magazine has reported that 85% of childless couples accept that they miss having a child in their lives, and also that they want to go back in time and plan to have a baby whom they can raise and be responsible for.",
        "In conclusion, in today\u2019s time more and more couples are avoiding to have children mainly because it benefits them professionally as they can live a care-free life. This has its bad effects too because after a certain period of time the couples start feeling lonely and unfulfilled as they miss having a young one around them"
