        "Contemporary humans today tend to deviate from former customs and shift to smaller households. From my viewpoint, such modifications may render substantial advantages, if handled in according to the preservation of essential familial duties.",
        "It is evident that leading a more secluded way of life allows for ample privacy, what is rather inadequate in today's civilisation. This allows individuals to pursue personal indulgence and induce a sense of independence. As a result, living so may aid citizens in ridding of the burden of measuring up to others\u2019 standards even in the comfort of their own home, thus alleviating stress and tension. Likewise, inhabiting an exclusive manner of living may play a pivotal role in diminishing the issues of large families. Smaller households are much preferable for doing away with the burden of rent and other expenses. Moreover, it requires less effort to nurture a close-knit bond between members of a modest family unit. On the whole, it is apparent that taking on a more private way of life may render an array of advantages.",
        "Nonetheless, it would be an oversight to disregard the adverse consequences such lifestyle may have on conventional familial relationships. An exclusive manner of living alongside the hectic and rigorous urban life are sure to step by step rid of family gatherings. With limited contact and correspondence, this may engender a decline in relations with distant relatives. Furthermore, this may give rise to the scaling down of emphasis on familial bonds. The accumulative consequence of plentiful generations conforming to this way of life may render a far more substantial issue, the deprivation of ancestral significance. Regarding the loss of camaraderie between members of a lineage, in the long run, this is sure to eradicate the sense of pride and honor prevailing in each family. In view of the analysis above, the consequences of such a lifestyle on household values are much too conspicuous to ignore.",
        "All aspects considered, while leading a secluded manner of living may render certain interests to the individual, its drawbacks are too conspicuous to neglect. It is vital that citizens bear in mind the magnitude of familial relationships when settling for a way of life so as to magnify the strengths of each lifestyle."
