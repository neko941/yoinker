They may descend from affluent lineage, have married a famous or rich person or some are revealed by the gossip magazines superficially. For example, Nay Chi Oo, a widely known make-up artist from Myanmar, who is famous for inaccurate reasons. She waste lots of money in unnecessary articles and often displayed in public. The another idea is her behavior provides that spending money in popular brands, glamour and her conduct of that wealth can buy success.Hence, the outcome to youth is that they don\u2019t have to work hard then achievements will become effortlessly.",
        "On the other hand, there are marvellous celebrities whose faculties make them to the accomplished position among populace.Professionals who are able to do living in their various fields successfully are cause of their abilities and they do work hard by applying their great skills.One clear example is the model Paing Takon, who became world famous by facing the trouble ages.
