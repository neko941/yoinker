        "For each individual health plays a major role to lead a happy life in coming years and to live long. Some people say healthiness is likely to be lower over coming years  where others oppose it. This essay will discuss both the statements and an opinion.",
        "The standard living life of the current generation has changed completely when compared with older's. People fell more and more sick because of the food habits, pollution and by developing laziness.  Food habits have been completely changed, older generation relayed eating healthy food which was rich in nutrients and proteins that were made at home. Current society, citizens are occupied at their work, therefore not having time to cook for themselves and thus ending up ordering food online. Thus by consuming these outside foods regularly people develop obesity.",
        "The second disadvantage that may not lead to have a healthy life is laziness. Even though they get free time, people often spend to do their leisure activities like watching movies and playing video games over the phone. Lack of sport activities will also lead to a unhealthy life. Example: among 100 people, we only see 20 people who prefer a walk to their work.",
        "On the other side, every individual is developing interests in maintaining a good health by hitting the gym nearby to their areas. They are  many gyms which attract people by  offering great deals for a  longer course, however citizens should develop an interest in maintaining their own health to lead a healthy life in the future.",
        "To sum up, it is an individual perspective to lead a healthy life or an unhealthy life. One has to develop inside their heads to lead to great and happy life ahead."
