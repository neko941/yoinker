        "Nowadays tourism generates a significant portion of national income for many countries, but it has certain drawbacks too. This essay will examine the advantages and disadvantages of travel and provide a logical conclusion.",
        "The two main advantages of developed sights industry are boost in country\u2019s economy and a large number of new job openings for the local people. Firstly, tourists spend money on a wide range of services, including hotels, amusements, transportation, food and medical services. This way, tourism yields an additional income, greatly supporting the country\u2019s economy. Secondly, tourism increases the level of employment by bringing new jobs. For instance, the influx of tourists results in a larger demand in restaurant workers, tour guides, hotel staff and employees of retail services, exhorting business owners to hire more people for these positions.",
        "But tourism also has some major disadvantages like destruction of popular tourist destinations and development of illegal economic activities. \u0456Ancient buildings, temples and monuments struggle to cope with a vast amount of visitor\u2019s traffic and get damaged. Also, the large number of tourists can cause environmental problems. For instance, when places of interest are overcrowded, natural resources often become overexploited. What\u2019s more, the presence of a considerable number of tourists with a lot of money to spend, and often carrying valuables such as cameras and jewelry, increases the attraction for criminals and brings with it activities like robbery and drug dealing. However, proper hospitality management and correct usage of tourism revenue by the local government can eliminate these disadvantages.",
        "To conclude, although tourism can have certain negative effects like destructive impact and growth of crime rate, it has an extremely positive influence on country\u2019s economy and provides a large number of new jobs for the local people. I believe that these benefits of tourism outweigh its drawbacks."
