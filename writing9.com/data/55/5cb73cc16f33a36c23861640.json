        "It is believed by some that, it is essential for students to learn how to compete and outdo their class fellows. Others are of the view that children should first be taught to work together in groups and cooperate with others. In my opinion, being competitive and resilient in today\u2019s world is important for students to be successful later on in their life. Both viewpoints will be illustrated in this essay.",
        "On one hand, people who support the argument that schools should encourage students to compete against each other believe that the world has become competitive hence, for children to be able to perform and standout among others they should be taught in an environment which promotes competition in the form of exams and quizzes. As a result, critical thinking skills would develop in children, which may help to recognize their unique talent and personality. Furthermore, students who receive their education in a competing environment become better learners and possess analytical ability, which consequently paves a way for them to get a good job once they enter in professional life.",
        "On the other hand, some take the view that it is pivotal for young students to be taught to help and cooperate with their friends and school fellows. These days, communication skills are an essential ingredient in order to integrate within society and working in groups or teams is one of the best way to get these important skills.  Moreover, some tasks such as sports and group assignments require children to work as a unit in order to achieve a common goal, hence for these targets or goals to be achieved students must first learn how to work together and share their ideas with class members. This will both embellish the social skills of youngsters and promote harmony. Thus,students will become a better member of society.",
        "In conclusion, although learning how to work in harmony and help each other as a team may be important for students, I believe that in order to come over the rising competition and enhance the academic skills of children they should first be encouraged to compete against each other."
