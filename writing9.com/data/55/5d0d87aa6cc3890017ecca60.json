        "Tourism contributes significantly in spreading values and norms of a country to the entire world. Some people state that it will single out the English as the only prevailing language on earth. It has some advantages like better communication among nations and translator-free environment for state level delegations. However, disadvantages like cultural destruction and detachment from religious obligations can never be ignored.",
        "One of the main advantages is easier communication around the globe. Nowadays moving to an English-speaking country mandates the need to prove one\u2019s proficiency in the native language. For example, students going to an England first need to appear in an English language test. Similarly, translator-free environment is also a phenomenal advantage. A translator traveling with higher authorities to other countries does not only cost extra amount but also makes the delegation essentially dependent on his skills. Overcoming the language barrier reduces this problem allowing government officials communicate more effectively with each other.",
        "On the other hand, a common language can destroy diversified cultures around the world. A common language may damage this huge variety, squeezing the cultural values into a dull uniformity. For example, performing arts from all over the world would confine their scope to limited themes. Moreover, linguistic uniformity might result in quitting religious duties. There are several language-specific rituals despite English being used as a second language in a country. For example, the Holy book of Muslims is always recited in Arabic language. Such disadvantages are opposing the prevalence of English as a global language.",
        "To conclude, adopting a common language is good for convenient communication and translator-free environment. But some disadvantages include fading the vivid colours of culture and disintegrating from religious duties. In my opinion, the negative aspects are far more dangerous than the attractiveness of acquiring a common language."
