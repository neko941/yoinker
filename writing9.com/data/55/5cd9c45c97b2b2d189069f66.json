        "It is commonly believed that a lot of governmental spending on arts is useless, however, these finances can be better used for other productive activities. I agree that our country is suffering from many problems which need greater financial assistance, but neglecting arts is also unfair.",
        "According to one school of thoughts, government  should provide attention to solve vital public issues. I favour this opinion because  we are  a developing nation and are devoid of many basic survival facilities. Government is responsible to provide majority of its below average public with all fundamental rights and privileges. Authorities should introduce public welfare reforms providing  free education and economic health care. For example, in 2015 Imran khan launched a health care program in which 25000 people who were unable to afford their medical treatment were provided with health card using which they can have their treatment free of cost and in turn government  will pay on their behalf.",
        "On the other hand, some argue that expenditure on art activities is absolute waste of resources. However, I opine, arts like other sciences has its own importance and should not be ignored at any cost. Art galleries and museums are preserving our centuries old cultural heritage, which make us familiar to our folk customs and help to transmit them to our next generation. For instance, Taxilla museum in Pakistan is 67 year old and is preserving years old Buddhist sculpture, along with fascination display of all four provincial cultures of the country which is a source of information as well as entertainment. Hence, government should aid refurbishment and maintenance of arts and relics places  because they have deep spiritual roots in society .",
        "To conclude, fundamental necessities such as food, shelter, education and health should be dealt with more attention and resources but not on detriment if arts"
