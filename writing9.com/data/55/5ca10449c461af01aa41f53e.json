        "That choosing subjects or majors in universities is now becoming burning issues, some people believe that students should enroll in fields which have bright future prospects for society such as science and technology. However, I would agree with the perspective that learners should be free to choose whatever they are passionate.",
        "There are several reasons why University students should be forced to study some key subjects such as science and technology rather than study what they are interested. Firstly, at individual levels, Participating in science and technology areas significantly aid students to seek for job more easily in the future with higher salary, more job prospects as well as have a higher standard of living. Secondly, at society levels, science and technology are the two major industries which greatly contribute to the prosperity of a nation. In fact, as more people engage in these subjects, a country will have a well-educated workforce and have more invention, which leads to economic growth.",
        "In spite of these arguments, I believe that University students should be free to pursue their interested areas of study. The first reason is that if University learners follow their prefered majors, society will have a more solid economic growth. In reality, the development of an economy greatly depends on different kinds of industries, not only in high-qualified areas such as science and technology, but also other portions such as business, service and arts. Therefore, if society lacks any pillars, it will have a great impact on the economy as a whole. Secondly, if the gorvenment only concentrates on some main majors, it will result in the imbalance of the economy. For example, the large number of high-qualified workforce such as doctors or nurses will be abundance in the future will lead to an increase in unemployed rate of the economy.",
        "To sum up, although it may seem sensible for Universities to focus mainly on most useful subjects, I personally prefer the current educational system where people can pursue their own interest."
