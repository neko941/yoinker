        "It is a known fact that maintaining balance between professional and personal part of life is very vital for every working professional. Some people succeed in this goal whereas others are still in process of fulfilling their aim. This essay will illustrate the possible reasons for not being able to maintain this crucial balance along with plausible measures to solve this problem.",
        "The prime factor responsible for disrupting this balance is unrealistic expectations of client which lead professionals to work for extra hours to meet the unreasonable deadlines. For instance, especially in developing countries, multinational companies have overtime compensation policies to motivate people to work for long hours thereby disturbing their work-life balance. In order, to solve this issue, these huge firms should take firm stand against client\u2019s unreasonable demands, in fact, they should promote and implement \u2018No Overtime\u2019 work policy. As a result, employee would be able to engage himself in other aspects of his life like hobbies, family, friends, community service and many more.",
        "Another important reason contributing to the problem is the competitive environment in which we are thriving that doesn\u2019t allow us to focus on other parts of our life except work. People remain in constant fear of being thrown out of this corporate race if they fail to equip themselves timely. To tackle this issue, people should manage their time and priorities effectively considering the importance of other things namely relations and family, in their life. This would result in a better individual who is self-motivated and has sorted priorities.",
        "In conclusion, maintaining work life balance is a tedious task in this competitive era which is full of demands and expectations yet if people try to prioritize their work and time effectively, they can achieve their goal easily."
