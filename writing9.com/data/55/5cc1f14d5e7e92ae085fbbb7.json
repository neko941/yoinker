        "From the moment, people started living together as one unit which is famously known as family, its norms and costumes have been changing nonstop. These days, lots of mothers and fathers motivate their children to leave home when they are 18 or older, whereas some believe that their young ones are better off living with them.",
        "Leaving our hometown and family behind, has a strong plethora of promises. For one, a promise of becoming independent, both financially and spiritually. This means that, since you are earning money and not your guardians, you get to decide on how to spend your income. Whether to save your salary in a saving account for a rainy day, or go on a fashion spree is utterly your choice. Another promise would be that while living alone is an experience that undoubtedly transform people not only to adults, but also to more mature humans. Take repetitive chores as an example.By solely depending on yourself to do housework such as vacuuming and dusting, washing up and doing the laundry, grocessry shopping and sorting out mails, one can count on the fact that they could take care of themselves in addition to maintaining a stable life and home. Not being in the same home as your parents might also create an opportunity for some to see the world, experience wild and unimaginable adventures first hand which can lead to the feeling of belonging and actually being a true member of the society.",
        "However, in my viewpoint, staying with family definitely contains more realistic prospects rather than some hard to reach promises. If one decide to keep on staying with their parents, they most probably do not need to seek for a job, or they should not be anxious about paying bills or rent. This could tremendously reduce the stress level that others face in their workplace or when they are desperately trying to make ends meet. Furthermore, these privileged people could spend their time and focus on flourishing their abilities .Studying for tertiary education in high-ranked universities, making progress in athletic activities or simply following their childhood dreams without any kind of worries are just to name a few. In addition, these lucky young adults are surrounded by their loved ones at all times and continually obtain the love and support from their families. Unlike others, who unfortunately could only manage to see their parents on special occasions such as Christmas, if they could afford the commuting expenses and also, if they have met all their deadlines at work. In many countries such as Japan, people had been living with their parents for genertions.This,as studies have shown, have led to stronger cultural and family bonding, which is brutally rare in Western countries where children say goodbye to their family at a very young age.",
        "To conclude, although living independently paints a promising and a luring picture for our future, staying home with family could create a true and reliable chance for us to follow our dreams and desires in the comfort of home in the presence of our loving and supporting family."
