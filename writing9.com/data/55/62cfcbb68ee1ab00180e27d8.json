        "Some people claim that a great income for sports stars is normal and fair because their work requires lots of effort, and a few men can do that. Others, however, say that they are paid a lot of money for doing ,not an important job, and this is not justified. I agree with this point of view and I believe many individuals are industrious like professional athletes, but they don't have enough salary.",
        "There are many reasons that some people argued to prove the high salary for stars is reasonable. Firstly, Sportspeople work for a short period of time. For example, a football player who plays at an advanced level with a well-paid salary might be in this position just for 10 years. Secondly, they do lots of practice for many years without even being sure about reaching to advanced level. Although many people try to be professional athletes, just a few people could be successful.",
        "On the other hand, Some people argued that there is no justification between some crucial careers like doctors and sports stars. First, the work of athletes is not necessary for society, and it's just a hobby. For example, we can never compare medical careers to sports jobs, and also their contributions to the country. In addition, if the issue comes to comparing the income of stars with the other important jobs, there is a great gap that is not very reasonable."
