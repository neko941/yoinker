        "When it comes to quantifying the development of an area, the transport system is the first facility to be evaluated. A number of countries these days are injecting heavy funds into urban transport systems while disregarding the rural areas. This instigates a sense of deprivation in the locals besides being a challenge for the transport of agricultural produce. The reallocation of budget is the only way to alleviate this problem.",
        "The foremost effect of this practice is that it instills a sense of deprivation in the people living in suburbs. Although the people from villages enjoy visiting the megacities, they are often saddened to note that a lot of money is being spent on metropolises while nothing is being done for their areas. Another consequence of having a poor rural transport system is the lack of support to the agricultural sector. The agriculture of any country thrives in its rural areas. The lack of a proper transport system becomes a challenge to disseminate their produce to the markets.",
        "If the right amount of budget is spent in the rural areas, their transport systems can be developed helping the locals are well as the agriculture. The rural areas usually have little to no transport systems especially in the underdeveloped countries. Some amount can be allocated to rural areas for a bus service from the heavy budget being spent in megacities. This will make the locals happy and also prove to be beneficial for the agricultural sector.",
        "In conclusion, the lack of rural transport at the cost of making the village dwellers unhappy and causing issues for the agricultural industry is becoming a serious issue. The governments should reallocate transport budgets so that rural areas can get their fair share and the agricultural sector is also supported."
