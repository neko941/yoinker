        "Hi James,",
        "How are you doing these days? It\u2019s been such a long time since I heard last from you. Hope everything is well. I got your letter last week; I was so delighted when I saw your letter. I\u2019m glad that you asked my view about the upcoming camping holidays. I guess you should try on this thrilling activity. There are a couple of reasons that you would love this camping and the most exciting one is river boating which is located just in the middle of the forest. As myself,  I was over the moon when I experience it once  last year. Moreover, exploring the jungle on foot itself gives an adrenal rush and you must try this.",
        "Having said that there are some downsides of this kind of trip which you must be aware of them prior to embarking on the journey. Make sure you must carry a raincoat because this area is a rainforest, so the probability of rain is quite high during this season. In addition to that, do not forget to pack extra pair of sports shoes because the land you are going to walk through is rocky and your shoes might get damaged quickly.",
        "I would love to join because I enjoyed it  a lot  the last year, but due to my exam schedule prevents me to accompany you. If I had the chance, I wouldn\u2019t give a second thought to deciding on this matter. Anyways, no worries, we can make plans for the next and hope so we will explore this Jungle with extreme fun.",
        "Please write me back and let me know whether you make up your mind to go on this excursion or not.",
