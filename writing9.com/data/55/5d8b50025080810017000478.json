        "It is a true fact that the private lives of elected officials should be kept secret and not publicised on any media. Although this ensures that elected leaders are put under checks, I am of the opinion that this  will result to security threats for their families and loved ones.",
        "There are a number of reasons why the personal living of leaders should be published. Firstly, the public can monitor their social status in relation to their salaries. It is a known fact that politicians are paid high pays monthly, but when they start buying asserts that are costlier than their yearly cummulative salaries, then the public can officially make strong claims of theft against such a leader. Secondly, elected political nominees are mentors. They are to live by examples to both the older and younger generations that voted them to their offices. As a result, politicians will be cautious to portray a good image to their voters.",
        "However, there are significant drawbacks to publishing the secret lives of elected leaders on news platforms. First of all, the security of their families are under great danger. This is because political opponents can use information extracted from media to threaten the lives of their families. A salient example is the former governor of Ogun State ( Gov Olusegun Osoba), who declared that he was traveling with his children to South Africa on a short vacation. He and his children got murdered in their hotel rooms by an unknown opposition. In addition, every human should have the right to live freely irregardless of their position in their country. If all citizens have the freedom to live and spend as they like, then the people leading them should be free also.",
        "In conclusion, while the financial status of political nominees' can be verified and monitored, I believe that the negative effect of this initiative would be far greater than the possible advantages."
