        "It is sometimes believed that in the future, material for production from animals will be replaced by new one. This essay partly agrees with this essay for several reasons.",
        "On the one hand, animals can be out of the chain of human consumption. The first point is that humans can use sources from plants as input for production line. It means factories use the plants such as bamboo or cotton tree in the textile field, which reduce the need for using the leather of animals. These natural products can be used in diversity types of clothes and have been the idea of many fashioners in recent decades. Another reason behind my belief is that human can consume organic food, which provides enough nutrition for their body. Take vegetarians as an example, despite without consumption meat from animals, they have better physical condition than the people who are not vegetarian.",
        "On the other hand, it is hard to replace all product making of animal. Chief among these is that experiences using animal products are unique. This stems from the fact that the feeling of these products is familiar with the customers and it looks more premium than the clothes from other materials. The clothes made of leather, for example, are a luxury outlook and a choice of many buyers. Furthermore, consuming meat is one of the habits of most people. It is not deniable that until now, there are not many innovations about foods that have taste and aroma as the meat can replace them.",
        "In conclusion, all opinions mention above make me come to consequence partly agree with animal can remove from human demand."
