        "It is argued that all parents should participate the childcare training course to bring up their children with good health in society. While from my perspective, I agree that all parents should learn about childcare, but it is not compulsory to attend the childcare training course for all parents.",
        "Childcare training course is essential for teaching the parents to care of their children. Certainly, it can provide a comprehensive knowledge about their babies specially those who are new parents. In addition, trained parents can easily understand the need of their offspring in the critical situations i.e., the basic requirements of babies when growing up, the medical care in some cases and their proper feeding plan with a balanced diet. Therefore, parents must join a childcare training course for better parenting.",
        "However, although childcare is indispensable in many societies, it is not possible to attend the childcare training course for all paternities due their busy job schedule with committed other responsibilities. Moreover, mothers and fathers are bound to adapt their cultural and religious limitations for caring their children in everyone has their own society. For instance, in Pakistan, there are about more than one and half million children are born annually. It means over 8,000,000 parents should take part in childcare training course on each year. This is impossible to manage and implement for stakeholders and government to launch a childcare course in the same manner as grandparent\u2019s guide to new parents according to their traditions. Therefore, childcare courses are not practically conceivable to attend extensively for parents.",
        "In conclusion, childcare is necessary for every parent for better parenting. However, joining childcare by training course might be more effective for raising children but due ancient traditional methods and restrictions it is not feasible for all parents."
