        "Growing number of people believe that prisoners should be allotted community work without being paid for the same rather than imprisoning them. I totally disagree with this fact as this situation allows the culprit to move freely in the society. In addition to this, it also encourage others to commit crime without fearing the law.",
        "Firstly, offenders ought to stay behind the bars for serving the punishment. Law and order are equal for all the criminals. Hence, without being biased about the circumstances, due to which the crime occurred or considering the severity of the misdeed, prisoners should bear the ramification of their misdemeanour. For instance, a thief, if asked to perform the job of a peon without being paid then his propensity would be to mug other people in the surrounding area. This way, he might reoffend or become a threat to the society because of the financial issue or the habit of stealing.",
        "Secondly, imprisonment also serves the purpose of setting an example to the community. Lenient rules and regulations often lead to upsurge in the crime rate. To illustrate, if a person commits a heinous crime of vandalism and moves free in the public places then this may encourage other people to follow the same strategy as they are well aware that they would not be given any serious punishment.",
        "To conclude, lawbreaker should be confined to prison for specific amount of time according to the severity of the crime committed by them. This will give a sense of safety to the victim as well to other people. Also, it will be a paradigm to remember by the society, which will ultimately aid to lessen the overall crime ratio."
