        "It is actively argued that modern technique which used by big companies for a seling a product are contravertiol and not benefitial for a end customets. I am strongly agree with this staitment and belive that those approaches for an advertisment shoud be corrected in a near future.",
        "Firstly, some of the most efficient tools for selling a products in the internet voilate your privacy. It is very common situation when ad company collectind your personale data for analysing it for their own goal, but you even do not know this, because thay are doint in silently. Those modern techniques build your profile based on private your data, which you wouldn't share with a complite stranger. For example, there is faimost issue with the british company, Cambridge Analytics, it had collected data of millions facebook users, than build profile for an each user and produces targeting ads for a manipulation in the USA 2016 election. That's why your data in the internet shoud be protected from advertising companies.",
        "Secondly, the main goal of an industly is to increase a revenue by showing you ads for a goods which you even do not need. Moreover there are huge amout of marketing compain that are selling complitly trash, but regulat people still buying it, because of stong psychological preasure from builbords in streets, bunners in the intenten. Now you just cannot hide from a ads, which everyvere. For example. it is very common that someone because a bancrout because cannot stop bouying unnesesery products. So the main goal of marketing is to sell even if it does not need for a clients.",
        "In conclusion, I belive that latest methods in advertising shoundn't be used, because it violate privacy and does not bring value for a society."
