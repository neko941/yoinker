        "It is argued that construction of new homes should be avoided in order to protect the countryside despite the factor of availability of space. This essay slightly disagrees with the notion considering the benefits of constructing new homes in the rural areas. However, it has some consequences which will also be discussed.",
        "Globally, population is on continuous rise, which is a major concern for all the countries. Increase in population results in the expansion of cities, rise in pollution and destruction of rivers, forest and natural fields. For example, Lahore is the major city of Pakistan. The population is on continuous rise, leading to the development of new societies, but on the other side creating lots of problems to the environment. The only way to restrict the expansion is to develop countryside areas. This would result in infrastructure development and improves the standard of living. Instead of moving towards bigger cities, people tend to remain in their towns because they will be getting all facilities at their place.",
        "However, the expansion in the countryside has some major concerns to address. The countryside is famous for its lush green fields. The major source of income in this area is agriculture. Population is low as compared to bigger cities. Lifestyle of this area is completely at peace with no hassle at all. The views of sun rising, farmers harvesting crops and cattle farms are the real charm of this area. Development in rural areas would abolish this. This really needs to be taken under consideration.",
        "In conclusion, it is suggested that construction of new homes should be avoided in the bigger cities. Town development authorities are required to play their role in this regard. They should come up with the policy that is beneficial for both cities and countrysides."
