        "Taking care of the elderly population is important as they spent their lifetime serving the country and family. Some people believe that it is the responsibility of the government while others believe that they should be taken care of by individuals. However, I believe that taking care of elders is the responsibility of both parties and in this ,essay I will discuss both  views.",
        "Firstly, when we were children our parents and grandparents worked hard to provide us with food, shelter and protection. For instance, I can remember my father working continuously for days in order to provide food on the table and my mother working really hard managing the housework and business. Parents also go above and beyond to provide a good education for their children. Thus it is the responsibility of the family members to care of the parents when they become older.",
        "On the other hand. it is also the responsibility of the government to take of the elderly population since most of them when they were young worked in the either the private or public sector. Despite the job all the employees have to pay  the government  which they earn millions. So when they become older the government should either help them financially or give them free or discounted medical facilities. For exemplify,  Sri Lanka has general hospital and they also provide five per cent off on medical bills for those who are above fifty-five years old. Additionally, some children will not be financially stable to care for their elderly parents. At such times government authorities should step in and take care of them.",
        "In conclusion, I believe that both individuals and government should take care of the elderly population equally."
