        "Television is a major source of entertainment for people these days and its craze has been increasing with the innumerable channels and programs available. Watching television does not involve any physical exercise and gives rise to laziness which might also lead to health problems.",
        "To begin with,people have a lot of stress in their lives due to busy work schedules and are unable to make the time to go out for any kind of entertainment. As this is the cheapest and the most easily available source of recreation, people resort to watching television more than anything. \u2018Couch potato\u2019 is a term which has been coined for those who watch television excessively. Most people sit at home with family or friends and watch programmes all day long. Due to this, people tend to get lazy, obese and prefer to stay at home and spend most of their time watching television rather than utilizing it by doing something productive.",
        "Moreover, television means being indoors most of the time and no social activity is involved. This leads to people turning into introverts and losing social skills. People who only watch television start avoiding social situations which involves talking to people and being in their company. This can also become a problem which might result in diseases like insomnia and schizoid.",
        "It can be concluded that watching too much television can have many negative consequences like becoming lazy, putting on weight and lack of social skills. But if it is watched in a limited and constrained manner all these negative effects can be avoided."
