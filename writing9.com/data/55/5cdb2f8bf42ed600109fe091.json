        "The advancements in technology have made the world a global village. Researchers and travellers can currently visit local and unspoilt areas like the south pole. The two main benefits of this are the discovery of new vaccines and historical artifacts as well as the social benefits of learning about the world around us. However, this development can also lead to over-exploitation and destruction of the resources and natural topography of such areas during man's quest for knowledge.",
        "On one hand, being able to travel to remote natural habitats has made life more appreciable. Globally, people can experience different cultures and learn more about the history of mankind. There are a lot of hidden treasures in these areas and some of them have been the basis of the discovery of new medications and insights into solving the obstacles that have presented themselves in this generation. For example, a part of the Amazon jungle that had been difficult to travail, was recently discovered to have the plants that were later used to develop the malaria vaccine.",
        "On the other hand, the majority of the local areas are currently the remainder of places that have not been devastated by man's activities such as deforestation. The more people can reach the once untouched places, the more\u00a0 the likelihood of introducing urbanization. The resultant effect of which is deleterious to nature. For instance, researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health have revealed that within fifty years of man's activities in the South Pole, thw demographics of wild life in the area has dwindled by almost 40%.",
        "In conclusion, modern technology has made accessing a lot of places easier. It is very advantageous as we can get to know more about our heritage and also to enlighten ourselves about certain issues. This development, however, has led to a decline in the natural ecosystem and resources globally."
