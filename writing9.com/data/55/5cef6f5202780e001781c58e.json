        "Although the company advocates that the project will bring employment. However , we believe project will not only hamper the environment but also bring health hazards to local dwellers. The poisonous smoke emitted from factory will result into lung diseases and the liquid waste disposed in nearby water resources will enhance vulnerablility of stomach related diseases among residents. Moreover, the noises generated at factory site will hamper the peaceful environment of the area and will be the cause of anemia and blood related diseases ,among Old residents .",
        "In order to maintain the decent living standards, you are requested  to restrict the setup plan near our area. However, acres of land lying barren on the outskirts of the city will be best place for factory setup.Doing so ,the council can ensure development of a downtrodden area, along with ensuring healthy living conditions of our dwelling area. Thus, kindly permit the proposal keeping well being of the inhabitants at prime and refrain company from setting up a unit near by the society.",
