        "These days, we are living in the era of consumerism and advertisement plays a vital role in the high sales of consumer goods. Now a days, those goods are also sold which are not the real needs of the society and they are sold because of the power of advertising.",
        "To embark, advertisement is a reason for high sales of popular consumer goods in the society because it encourages people to buy the products and companies do everything for their sales, for illustration, they hire famous people to advertise their products. For example, in the advertisements of coldrinks, companies make the stories in which the famous actors and actoresses do acting for the popularity of goods, Furthermore, cricketers are also involved in this, like, Virat Kohli is a fitness icon so he represents those products by which people stay healthy. Advertisement through internet has also reached its highest peak. These days internet has a power to advertise and make popular the goods. For example, if we watch youtube there are so many ads between the films, shows etc. which are very intrusive sometimes so by this, people get incentive and stay undenied to buy products because they seem very attractive in ads. We can also see advertisements in our locality and streets on walls and boards, by this, people are also aware of the different products and deciding on the products, they should buy or not.",
        "On the contrary, some people think, it is not a fault of advertisement and it totally depends on consumers to buy the products because people want to stay up to date. for example, a person has a good phone instead of this he buys a phone which is new in the market so it depends on consumer's desire but I disagree to them because I think it is the advertisement which encourage people to buy new goods because if there are no ads so people are not aware about a new product and they do not buy a same thing which they already have.",
        "To sum up, there should be a limited number of advertisements and ads should be made on those goods which are the real needs of the society because ads on those products which are not profitable to the consumers are worst and its also a waste of money."
