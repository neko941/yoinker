        "Young people development is always important for the society. In recent days, there improvement has declined due to various factors like social media, spending time with peers and participating in the cultural activities. but some claim family plays a primary role for their development. In my opinion, family teaches socialism as well as good habits which enhance their development.",
        "First of all, children developments are distracted due to the high usage of social media and enjoy with colleagues. They tend to spend a lot of time on social media , watching movies and get addicted to it. For example, my cousin used to watch a comic series on TV and his behaviour changed like the cartoon hero in web series. In addition , there could be serious character changes might reflect when they mix up with unwanted friendships. This will affect their development and bad reputation in their career.",
        "On the other hand, family are major gamechanger on children development. From the childhood, family members teach a child to be socialised with other people which encourage child improvement. For instance, our parent trained us how to behave in society which made us a responsible person to this community. Moreover, family members educate a young people by narrating good stories which stimulate their growth.",
        "To conclude, young people are spoiling their life due to the reasons mentioned in here but still parents holding responsibility for their improvement to become good person."
