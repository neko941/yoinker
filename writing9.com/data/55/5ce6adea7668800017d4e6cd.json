        "The use of processed or preparaped meals or agricultual products have increased in recent years thank to the advances in the food processing technology which consiquently has a great impact on our daily life. These influces are mainly positive as ready foods enhances the quality of life, althoug some cautions might need to be considered when evaluation of these impact.",
        "Perhaps, the most obvious impact preparing food easily is more and more foods available and ready to use. As a result, it make easier for getting the meals, therefore, people have more time for other works. As we are getting busier and have a little time to prepare our meals, the processed foods can help us to avoid some boring steps as cutting or cleanning vegetables or meats which makes cooking more enjoyable. For instance, in stead of spending 20 minutes to cut, clean and add seasons for the pork ribbs, some can buy a ready to use bbq rib package with almost the same quality. Addtionally, some time the prapared foods also cheaper and easily to deliver.",
        "Besides, advanced food prepared technology also improve the food safety which is also the major issues for many countries. By better labelling products, the authories could find out the origin of the products in case of having some proplems with food posions. Importantly, as the food trade among the countries or contients increases significantly, the processed food help to trace back  cause of disease in some cases, so it help to improve the national food security and stable the citizen life.",
        "On another hand, the potential impact this change on our life might due to an overuse of processed foods which often contains some chemicals. As consequence, some diseases such as cancers or gut diseases have been reported as people rely on ready to processed food containning higher amount of consevative chemicals. Also, obesity disease has been increased at an alarming rate due to eatting too much prepared foods with higher amount of sugar and far. Therefore, it could also important to be avoid use too much processed foods.",
        "In conclusion,  changes in the processing food seems to improve our life quality by reducing the food prices and enhancing the food security if the ready meals are used in the control level."
