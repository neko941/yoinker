        "Public libraries have been operating since time immemorial. One section of the society opines that public libraries serve no purpose, whilst the other section of the society deems it otherwise. The essay will elucidate both the notions, followed by my perspective.",
        "To embark on, maintaining public libraries is a burden on the shoulders of the administration. A big chunk of revenue is incurred on it sans rendering any fruitful outcome. Supplying books, journals, magazines, etcetera require funds, which comes from the pocket of the general public, who may not resort to such places to gain knowledge or to casually read a book. As per a survey, a meager share of 30% indulge in reading or studying in public libraries. Moreover, public libraries hoard old resources rather than the upgraded one, which is readily accessible on the internet.",
        "However, the bright side of the public libraries could not be ignored as such. It is quite strenuous to find a serene place, like public libraries to study, or to nurture brain with valuable knowledge. Those who have the habit of regularly visiting libraries would be highly affected if a decision to shut down the public libraries is granted. To exemplify, as per a survey by Punjab School Education Board, wards prefer to prepare for examination and projects at a place, like public libraries and have voted in to keep libraries steady.",
        "After gauging both the sides, I deduce that although public libraries engulf a part of the national revenue and bear no major fruits in return, they hold the utmost value for the folks who have inculcated a routine to utilize time in public libraries, and such a tranquil place is arduous to replace. Hence, public libraries must be kept well."
