If people don\u2019t fit the demand, the company will not apply you. For example, being a banker who needs some business knowledge. However, there are different knowledge to learn in secondary education, we will easy to find jobs. And when we have more knowledge, more jobs that we can choose. Moreover, secondary education not only lets us know these knowledge, but also for us to learn how to practice for  exams. So that people can apply their practice to their work.",

When the environment is not good, the company don\u2019t apply new employees. It is because they need to control their price or can\u2019t open just like COVID-19. There are many companies need to close their shops or stop their jobs. So that, education isn\u2019t only a reason that make people can\u2019t find jobs.",
