        "Climate changes, and global warming have created an urgent need to find alternative sources of energy. Despite the ongoing researches, many believe that the governments are not doing enough in order to promote these projects, and should put more effort and money to finance them. I strongly suppoert this argument, and believe that the administrations should contribute much more, if we are truely interested in saving our planet.",
        "Recently, new developments have found alternative, ecologically friendly ways to harvest clean energy. Unfortunately, these methods, such as the use of solar pannels, or the oceans waves, are expensive and require large funds in order transform the current traditional platforms in major powerplants and industreal areas, so they will be able to use clean energy. To illustrate, ten years ago a natural gas source was found near the coasts of Israel, which could replace the use of coal burning completely. Despite that, coal is still being used in Israel, because it required an investment of over 100 million dollars in order to transport the gas to the local factories, an invetment which was not allocated by the government.",
        "As mentioned previously, I strongly believe that governments should put more effort in promoting alternative sources of energy. This effort can be done through both education and financial support. Governments can educate our children, through schools and national television for example, about ways to harvest clean energy, such as home based solar pannels located on our house roofs. Furthermore, through taxing, the government can force factories to convert to  clean energy. lastly, the government shoud employed a national project to build new platforms that could bring clean energy to the powerplant.",
        "In conclusion, I agree with the above statement and thing that administrations should finance and invest in clean energy. It is the only way to save our planet."
