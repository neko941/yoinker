        "It is undeniable that some offenders turn to crime soon after serving the first prison sentence. This essay will explore the major cause by this is that criminals could not reintegrate into society and that the rehabilitation programmes for prisoners as the most viable solution.",
        "The foremost problem why inmates often re-offend is because they are unable to make a living to support their family after being released back into society. This happens because they commit crime due to poverty, unemployment and lack of education. Also, any criminal record makes offenders finding a job more difficult. In addition, besides losing respect, they are isolated from their community making the situation even worse. For example, a recent survey by The Times in 2018 revealed that 55% of minor criminals, such as burglar, pickpocketer turn to crime just because they are not able to find a job and as a result, this has led to increasing in crime and eventually many criminals returned to jail.",
        "A possible solution to this predicament is that authorities should put the felons on probation. This is a good way only for those who are convicted of minor crimes. This is to say that by providing education or vocational training and embark them with a freshly in order to avoid being re-sent to prison. For instance, in the UK in 2015, non-custodial sentences were given to offenders including fines, probation orders for minor crime doers and as a result, nearly 28% of them turned to be law-abiding citizens and did not commit to crime.",
        "In conclusion, re-offending of criminals to serve a prison sentence is the significant challenge faced today which is because of the prisoners could not make their living in the society and non-custodial sentences for minor crimes would be a possible solution."
