        "A majority of individuals claim that melody is one of the brilliant sphere of intertwining people of various antecedents. As from my perspective, I utterly espouse the above belief due to how magical of that extraordinary element can be",
        "One immense power of such element is incubated in the ability of propagating and disseminating information and knowledge. In retrospect, from primordial eras of the human civilization up til our contemporary ages, there are countless musical pieces of art that instilled our ancestor's knowledge reservoir, inspired generations and generations from different parts of the world. Music has been exerted to share and influence its listeners and audiences about love, friendship, between races and ethnics; interestingly, those transcendental harmonies act as a adhesive medium regardless of language adversity from a variety of cultures. In others word, music can decipher every linguistic barrier and, still,  soundly conveying its precious information",
        "Another remarkable aspect in which music affects our life, especially in our living world is that it contributes an enormous role in universalizing our entertainment. Internet succors music artists all over the world in advertising their products, which are music in different forms such as music videos, singles and albums, to their audience more efficiently and productively; therefore, it is much less difficult for the artist to become popular and, even world-renowned with such advancement. Consequently, individuals from distinct countries might admire the same artist and grow a club or a gathering dedicates solely for that artist; thus, they subliminally form alliance as for the congeniality of their musical taste.",
        "In conclusion, I hold the aforementioned notion in which music is one of the superb choices for gregarious pursuit"
