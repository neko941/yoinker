        "Obesity in the youngsters is becoming increasingly problem in many countries, especially in Australia where a relatively more students facing weight issues. Some people argued that school should be take immediate actions to deal with students\u2019 over weight by monitoring and controlling food consumption and exercise output. I completely disagree with this statement.",
        "The main reason why Australian schools should be monitored their students\u2019 food intakes and exercise output is in generally students tend to be believe more in their teachers. Children\u2019s have grown with a strong belief of schools that what they taught. Therefore, if schools have assisted to monitor these, most students much more likely to do it by either with scarcity or willingly. Take my brother as an example who is studying in a primary class. He always has a concern about his breakfast due to being checked by his class teacher. Indeed, students have the ability to obey their schools and follow them, so that is a duty of school to monitor them.",
        "The secondary reason why schools should check their students diet plan and exercise is that most of their abilities being enforced in schools. Although school taught academic subjects, that also need to direct their students as healthy citizens to make a bride of the school. For instance, in kinder gardens, where children began to enforce certain standards in to their lives. If they guided and monitored in a proper way, they would be maintained their health. This is true in schools as well. Cleary, school should be tackle this issue to keep up their standards to represent a moral role model.",
        "In conclusion, this essay discussed why schools observe their students diet and exercise because of students that they obey and gaining attitudes in schools. In my opinion, I completely agree with this proposition that childhood obesity is a responsibility of schools."
