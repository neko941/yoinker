        "Presently, according to the revolution of modern technology, the majority of people have opted e-books replacing traditional paper books. An argument in favor of that is how convenient and available they are for readers. In contrast, dire ramifications could be caused for libraries, as a result, in the form of being abandoned. This essay will demonstrate both positive and negative sides.",
        "On one hand, using e-book holds myriad benefits. The fact that hectic pace of life which people live today may cause cancelation of many of their daily activities. Hence, readers prefer using their electronic devices instead of going to libraries; viewing books is deemed to be both easy and available anytime and anywhere. For instance, with websites such as Google Books and Amazon, one can directly download any book in few minutes while relaxing at home. Thus, it is expected that e-books will become a fundamental component in the reading world.",
        "On the other hand, neglecting conventional books has some negative implications for libraries. In other words, the growth of utilize e-books may turn libraries into abandoned places with the passage of time. For example, a study that was made by Cairo university in 2018 admitted that in the last decade there was a correlation between the growth of the trend of using e-books and relinquishing libraries. As a result, mother books might be forgotten and lost their indispensable significance. Thus, it is suggested that schools and universities should compel students to read as well as search in libraries.",
        "In conclusion, concerning the whole idea of viewing e-book instead of using its physical form not only merits it has but also it holds demerits. In the light of that, balance between technology resources and ordinary ways for reading is considered to be the key so that individuals can avoid their detriments."
