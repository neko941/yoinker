        "In this day and age, it can be said that health plays an indispensable role in human life. As a result, there is a range of employers who want their employees to hit the gym or apply for some sports clubs, whilst other employers argued that there is no use in doing this. The essay will examine both sides as well as indicate the author\u2019s opinion.",
        "There is no doubt that hitting the gym or applying for a sport club is a good way to improve one\u2019s personal development which affect working ability. It absolutely does wonders for people who have been working for a long time and was tired of solving problems at the company, employers can easily get the motivation again in order to work properly. Many researches have brought out to find out what the perks are in so doing and scientists would claim that with a 30-minute in the gym, employers can increase 10% of their productivity. In addition, not only does getting to the gymnasium have a positive influence on employers\u2019s health but it also helps employers with creating more chances in business in order to develop their companies.",
        "However, despite the undeniable benefits , it has some disadvantages. The price for being a member of a sport club can be prohibitively expensive lead to the employers\u2019s lack of money for their necessaries. Besides, at some point of the year, employers have to take responsibility for fundamental projects or events and they are not able to spend their time playing sports. As a result, they will lose their money meaninglessly on that day.",
        "In summary, the evidence for hitting the gym or applying for a sport club is undeniable but the disadvantages are worth considering. I think everything has both their sides but If I was the employer I would offer my employees hit the gym and apply for a sports clubs because of their wonderful perks."
