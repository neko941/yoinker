        "Air pollution is mostly caused by cars and vehicles. It pollutes the air as it is burning the fuel. Nowadays, there are many vehicles in most of the world which pollute the air. Some people say that the government should spend money to improve  public transportation in order to solve this issue.",
        "While other people believe that spending  money on improving  eco-friend vehicles such as electric cars or any other types of vehicles  causes less pollution. Both opinions are having advantages but I believe that the second one will be more effective.",
        "Spending money to develop  public transport is a good way to encourage people to reduce using cars and using public transportations. But some people will still use cars because they may  not like using public transportations or going into a crowded vehicle.",
        "On the other hand, Spending money to develop  electric cars will be more effective in reducing the usage of cars that pollute the air since people who may not use public transportation will find this a good way rather than using public transportations. For example, if someone doesn't like using buses so he uses a private car but if the car is turned into an electric car and this will reduce  air pollution.",
        "Air pollution is a major problem and we must try to protect our planet from air pollution. Some people say that the government should spend more money on developing  public transportation. Other people say that spending money to develop  electric cars to decrease  air pollution which I agree  with."
