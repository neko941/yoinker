        "The acceleration of industrialization  and the  prosperity  of  economy  benefit  our society  a great  deal. But with  the  speeding up  of economic  development,  people  are  facing more and  more pressure from  various aspects  of their  life. Increasing cut - throat competition and the uncontended nature are the causes for  increasing stress among people and it can be reduced by participating in outdoor activities and spending quality time with family members and friends.",
        "One of  the  major causes  is  that  people\u2019s  living rhythm  has been  promoted immensely  with  the upgrading  of  neo-knowledge and  hi-tech.  To  keep  abreast with  the society,  people  have to  work intensively  on  the  one  hand  and  improve  their  knowledge  on  the  other.  The  economic globalization  strengthened  international  cooperation and expand  people\u2019s  scope  of  activity.  The fierce social  competition in today's competitive world  deprives  people  of their  spare  time and makes their  life  more burdened and stressful.  Another factor  comes from  the never ending demands of family members .People  in  the current  society  have to shoulder the responsibility of family  maintenance. On  the  one hand,  people  have  to  care for their parents, creating for  them  a happy  and comfortable life.  On  the other hand,  they  have to  give their children  good  education. To  earn more money,  people have to  work  very  hard  to  finance  their family.",
        "If  people  live in heavy  pressure, they  will  have  problems  both  physically  and  psychologically.",
        "To relieve  the  pressure, I  think  the following  suggestions  are  feasible  and  practical.  Firstly,  people  are suggested to  pursue some  sports and games in their  spare  time  or at the weekend. Sports  can build up people\u2019s  physique and make them  vigorous. Secondly,  people should communicate with  others frequently  and  share their  trouble  and  difficulty  to  others, which  is  a very  magic  way  to release one\u2019s  pressure. Finally,  people have to  find  a balance  between money  and  health in this materialistic world.. Otherwise, one\u2019s health  will  be  overdrawn  and negatively affected  by  money  earning.",
        "In conclusion, good  life should not be obtained  at the price of  the deterioration of one\u2019s health. People should  improve their living  pattern by developing strong social ties and participating in sports and games"
