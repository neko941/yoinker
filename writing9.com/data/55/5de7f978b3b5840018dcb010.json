        "Health issues have become increasingly a major crux among youngsters in this century. Being overweight can be attributed to unhealthy eating and lack of corporal activities. This essay will discuss why the rise of exercise can lead a deplorable impact on child's and also outline some possible steps.",
        "To begin with, physical exercise is essential for individual life, but it cannot lessen the obesity by doing an excessive amount of activities. First and foremost anything with excessive is not preferable for adolescent wellbeing, but this overabundance in their curriculum can affect their mentality and overall development. For example, children have the minimal capability of bodily process so if they play or do exercise all the long they must be feeling exhausted and physically inefficient to focus on their studies. This few instances can bolster the existing concept that kids should sustain a balance on their regular basis, however sports and games are also required for physical fitness.",
        "Parents should be more compassionate and meticulous towards their offspring to determine the cause of obesity. First of all infants are mostly influenced by the television ads to eat unhygienic food. So, parents should constitute the list of their kids meal and nutritious product. Moreover, health awareness should provide on educational system. For instance, most of the masses in Japan do not face any major health issues in their lives because they are taught health related lessons in their schools. In short, alone parents can't tackle this problems without informative conscientiousness.",
        "In conclusion, this essay discussed relying on practice and sports cannot ensure the child's healthy live. To infer,  I'm convinced that people and seminary should be cooperative to take preventive approaches towards infants hygiene."
