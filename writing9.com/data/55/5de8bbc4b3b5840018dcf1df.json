        "Some would argue that the ultimate way to happiness is to have abundance of wealth. A lot of money in hand make people happy because they can buy anything as per their interest. Good family relationships also bring contentment into one's life.",
        "Saving a large amount of cash enable people to buy whatever they want. In other words, people not having enough money have to think twice before purchasing a thing of their interest as it may adversely affect their budget. This limitation in spending money leads to frustration, which is not happening in the case of wealthy people as they do not have to look at the price tag of a product. For example, a billionare  in India bought a peice of land on moon from NASA and got it registered in his name. He tweeted afterwards that he is the most happiest person in the world. Thus, these kinds of purchases, which are unable to do by poor people, make people happy.",
        "Family relationship is the other thing that can contribute happiness to a person. A successful family life represents a successful person in terms of love, care, and support. This provides him the motivation to achieve success in whatever field he works in. As a result, he experiences contenetment throughout his life. For example, in a recent study by Cambridge Analytica among wealthy people in their older age, around 52% responded that they missed family life and its warmth during their run behind wealth.",
        "In conclusion, While accumilation  of large amount of money provides happiness as it gives opportunity to buy  anything they want, a successful family relationship provides happiness throughout one's life."
