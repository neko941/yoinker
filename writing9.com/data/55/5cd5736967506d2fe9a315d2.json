        "In recent years, advance technology has greatly increased. Many individuals  share the view that computers has improved the quality of life while others are of the opinion that they have made life more difficult. I am of the opinion that they have improved life qualities mainly because this technology has reduced work load in different work sectors, as well as, improved studying among students.",
        "There are two major reasons how computers have improved life quality. Firstly, Retriving information in work places has become less stressful. In other words, storing and retriving data has never been more easier. Take for example, a hospital with well over 5,000 outpatients, bringing patient's record would be harder without the use of computers whereas with the use of such devices patient information is easily accessible with less time required. Hence, use of these devices has in recent times made work more bearable than difficult.",
        "Secondly, university colleges, as well as, grammer schools have employed the use of these devices, which, has reduced and improve efficiency among students. For example, a study, carried out in 2017, by the National Open University, showed that about 70% of students in computer using schools performed approximately 10 times better than those without computers. This was mainly because, these devices helped in making reading more easier for students, thus, making life more relaxing and bearable.",
        "In conclusion, these devices have made life more beneficial and profitable, as well as, productive, rather than, complicated and this is mainly because increase data storage and retrival."
