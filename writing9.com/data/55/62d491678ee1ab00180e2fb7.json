For example, some people spend their vacation in a different country every year, They think discovering new places and new cultures are enjoyable. Also they do not hesitate to try unique foods like rabbit leg or duck. They say that these kind of foods are interesting and extends my knowledge.",
        "On the other hand , some people especially those who have different kinds of preferences do not prefer to go to new places and try new foods. They feel safe when they repeat the action that they always like. In this behaviour, there is no chance to dislike. For example, some people make reservations in the same hotel that they had stayed in every year. They say that  we do not want to take the risk of dissatisfaction with the new one. Also, some foods do not fit everyone in different aspects. Some people suffer from food allergies and high blood pressure. Because of ,this they feel confident when they stick with the same diet.",
