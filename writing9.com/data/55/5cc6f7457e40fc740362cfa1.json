        "In recent years, leisure time spent by the younger generation has become debatable. Some individuals share the opinion that time spent on activities such as watching television, playing video or computer games can be profitable while others are of the opinion that these activities causes more harm than good. I am of the latter opinion. This essay will discuss both views as well as state the effects of these activities on the younger generation.",
        "On the one hand, individuals are of the view that time spent on activities like television, video and computer games are beneficial mainly because these activities keep the youths occupied during their leisure time. The belief is that instead of younger peers joining bad gangs and associating with the wrong crowd they would rather benefit from such activities. Take for instance, a high school student after the day\u2019s activities join friends in smoking and drinking instead of going home and enjoying a TV show. Thus, it\u2019s believed that such activities keeps the younger generation occupied. In addition, these activities relaxes the mind and body. According to a research carried out by the famous Dr Odumosu Bunmi in the early \u201880s which suggested that children are likely to excel in school activities, if they engage in activities at home that relaxes the mind and body such as watching TV shows or playing games.",
        "However, despite these undeniable benefits I am of the opinion that the cons outweighs the pros. The main reason for this is addiction. Young individuals these days get addicted to such great activities. A research was published by the National Health Institution in 2017. This showed that about 80% of youths are addicted to both video games as well as computer games and about 20% to television. Furthermore, these activities makes the youth very lazy. They would rather than help their society or communities and parents, watch or play video games. These cons have overshadowed the benefits of these activities.",
        "Overall, while there are great benefits such as relaxing the mind and body and occupying time, there are also great consequences. I am of the opinion that the cons outweighs the pros and that youths should instead of watching tv shows and playing video games can engage in other productive activities such as feeding the homeless, cleaning the communities and public awareness of illegal drugs."
