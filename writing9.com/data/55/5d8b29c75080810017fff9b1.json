        "In the modern world, with the help of advertisements, most of the people receives the knowledge regarding the new products in the market along with the promotion on various household items. People have different viewpoint regarding the advertisements of new products that whether those new products would be useful to them or spending money on them is just waste. I agree with the statement saying advertisements aware us regarding the things that will ultimately improve our lives.",
        "According to some consumers, TV become the main reason to drive them towards the new products through the advertisements that they actually do not need in their lives. Their believe move towards living life with simple means instead of looking something expensive and unuseful. For instance, instead of purchasing smart phones, their preference always would be the simple mobile phones as the main function to make and receive a call. Moreover, the old people does not want to understand the generation gap resulting in poor impact on the studies of teenagers. To illustrate, having a laptop becomes the necessity for the college students but the parents always want their children to spent the time in the library that ultimately puts negative effect on the minds of their children. In today's era, not all the things that advertised on the social medial proved to be unuseful.",
        "On the other hand, with the help of technology or the advertisements newspapers and on other social media acknowledge the people regarding the new products in the market that we actually need to improve our lives. Scientist explore the whole world and put the life of every person on ease. For example, there were various biological disorders that results in death of a person because of no treatment, with the help of social media, people in India came to know regarding the open dispensaries nearby and the physiotherapy being given to those who are physically disabled. I agree with this statement as with advertisements, most of the people would be able to get physically or the financial benefits.",
        "To conclude, advertisements have the positive or the negative impacts on the mind of people remained debatable.While some people assumed that buying the advertised products would make them financial weak, others have strong opinion regarding their easy life because of advertisements on the TV and newspapers."
