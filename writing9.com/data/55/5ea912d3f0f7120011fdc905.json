        "Some people believe that the tourism industry have a positive impact in the country, whereas others believe that it have bad impact in the local resident and the environment. This essay will argue that the benefits of global tourism are heavier than the drawbacks, as it helps to boost the economy of a country and promote and exchange the local culture and tradition.",
        "One common disadvantage of international tourism is that it has adverse effect in the environment of the host country. This is because when large numbers of visitors come to relax, it requires more accommodation, food and other amenities which will impact on existing resources. For an example, land, water and air pollution will increase due to the improper management of the garbage generated from the large volume of foreigners.",
        "Despite this, one of the significant benefits of international tourism is that it creates more employment opportunities. This is because in order to accommodate and facilitate numerous visitors, jobs like tourist guides, taxi drivers, and hotel and restaurant staffs are in high demand. This helps to in economic development of the country.",
        "Furthermore, foreigners help to enrich the culture and tradition of the local country. This is mainly because culture is the set of knowledge and skills transferred from generation to generation and when tourist comes they share this with the host country and also takes back to their country. This will also help in globalization of the culture and helps to minimize the conflicts in the world. For an instant, countries like Australia and New Zealand are multicultural countries and very successful.",
        "In conclusion, although there are drawbacks of having international travellers which can be easily fixed with the revenue generated from the tourism industry. I am convinced that international tourism has a significant contribution to the economy of the country by providing various platforms for the employment and also barters the culture and tradition of two different places."
