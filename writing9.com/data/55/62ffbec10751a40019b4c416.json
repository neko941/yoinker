        "Today , advertising of businesses for their goods is underlining being their Produccts new in some way often. There are some backgrounds and reasons that Companies are using this type of advertising now. One of them is in the near Past, Products development, Companies Patents and individuals invents rate was much higher than now and busineses were prosperus back then but with slowing down in Products expansion, their profits decreased dramatically and they had forced to affectation in their advertising . For instaance, in the recent decade, Smart Phones did not have any significant improvements from generation to generation, So, they had to show they had some every year.",
        "In these years, this development had many impacts on the people . A Positive one, which is the target of this kind of advertisement, is that society gets used to this process of changing Products and they continue and companies get their profits . This effect had a minor Positive impact on people; they change their stuff and of course, changing Products would bring Comfort with it. In my opinion ,the negative side of this development is more than another side . The most important change that this situation Caused is companies do not have to be creative to sell their goods and the creativity that brought Nowadays Comforts people is dying out and in the near future, we have to face Problems that should not exist at all. For instance, with this amount of smoke which cars are producing these years , We are going to have breathing problems ,especially in crowded cities like New york .",
        "After that, people are having fewer options or even no real options for almost everything these days and they have an illusion when they are shopping now . For example, when you want to buy a car, your standards and reasons to choose one from your options are limited to the colours and the names of them but, it should be about the performance and Comfort that you would get.",
        "In Conclusion ,this is a negative development. with destroying creativity and having minor changes in Production of Companies they worked on their advertising to say our new products have a new feature but they do not have any different from its last model . Because of this people do not have real options in their life and would have big problems in the future. So,"
