        "As,in a society it is paranoia for individual history to been know, it give a general overview of ailments that run in family such as diabetic, sickle cell disease and ABO incompatibility, allergies is not to be left out.these are illnesses that can be transmitted from generation to another . For instance In 2018 a team of researcher in Ekpan general hospital, Doctor's and Nurses, A details information gather from a particular patient help to sevage the crisis that would have occur. In addition knowledge of one's ancestry allow people to avoid some inherited diseases.",
        "Furthermore, in my own perspective it is a welcome idea because with this understanding people are able to detect this disease early and prompt attention could be done to prevent the complications urgently. A research carried out by Gyaen department, it was noticed that following the awareness program on the significant of family line,there was 45 percent decline in the number of ABO incompatibility as more people began to seek appropriate medical intervention.",

People need to be educated in other to have understanding about their health and how to manage it on time. In many opinion it is a positive growth as it will encourage people on earlier identification of illness and a quest  for prompt attention."
