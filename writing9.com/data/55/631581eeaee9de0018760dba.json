        "Nowadays , telecommunication and transportation by air are increasing dramatically rather than in the past , which is  vital for today so this essay illustrates the reason for the above statement.",
        "First of all , it is time-saving activity and also it completes 1 day's journey in 3 hours without any kind of difficulty , for instance , due to advanced technology , we can talk with every corner of the person in the world , consequently , it can reduce time and distance because of it.",
        "Moreover , we can easily call our family member , who lives abroad and talk to them as well as video conference , for example , a number of students study overseas and they never feel they live without a family due to  telecommunication. Furthermore , air travel is safer than others , in light of the fact that a range of facilities never makes accidents, for instance , every day, thousands of people travel by aeroplane but accidents never happen during a journey , as a result , people give priority first to it.",
        "On the other hand , travelling by aeroplane is  more expensive rather than others , however , it provides a huge range of facilities , which we cannot get in another transportation , such as , during a journey , passage get a wide range of food items so they can relax during this period. Secondly , the crowd cannot use it without recharging their phone number and it is too expensive to call abroad , such as  many tele companies make profits from the international phone call, consequently , we do not talk to them for more than a few minutes.",
        "In conclusion , due to the negative side , we cannot avoid it , which is as important as the other facilities they are the reason a plethora of people travel by fly."
