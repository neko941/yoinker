        "Happiness is extremely important part of people's lives. While many people believe they were very happy during their adolescence, others find that adulthood was more pleasurable. This essay will examine both points of the view before arriving at a reasonable conclusion.",
        "As many agree, young age brings much more happiness for them. There are several merits to this position. For one, most of the people would have enjoyed their teenage days because of the greater freedom they had in their college and school days. In fact, they spent larger part of their time with their friends in various types of recreational activities. For example, needless to say, get together parties during college time were great moments to have fun together. Moreover, teenagers have much fewer responsibilities than adults, due to the fact that, they are stressless.",
        "Other people, however, feel adulthood is the age to enjoy a lot with great responsibilities. This is because most of the adults remember their joyful moments such as the company of their partner and later look after their kids. These type of responsibilites make them more mature, and a responsible person of the society. Furthermore, adult people also enjoy the freedom of taking their own decisions. For instance, they can choose the job they like which is not possible in case of youngster and also not appropriate for them.",
        "In conclusion, despite the fact that both the ages group have their own ups and downs. In my opinion, it is extremely tough to choose which stage of life is more better or happier than another stage, therefore, it depends upon an individual according to their taste of life."
