        "In recent times, it has become incredibly difficult to discipline a child. Some people believe that child spanking is the greatest form of enforcing discipline. In my opinion, I completely disagree that corporal punishment is the most appropriate form of child upbringing.",
        "The people that believe that smacking is the only way to instil morals in a child are of this opinion because they believe that inflicting pain on children help them to take on corrections more easily. For instance, a research carried out in some areas in Nigeria has shown that children whose guardian",
        "adopted corporal punishment for their training are more well behaved. For this reason, people in this region result in punishing their offspring physically to correct their behaviour.",
        "However, the idea of sanctioning a child physically to uphold good values is completely unacceptable. The purpose of corporal discipline in coaching children are most times defeated because they tend to become used to these pains and as such, do not take heed to corrections. It also make these young ones distant themselves from people who administer pain to them. For example, there are instances of children causing pains to others because of their experiences at home. Also, children raised by being penalized physically end up suffering from psychological traumas in their adulthood. As such, these retribution end up doing more harm than good.",
        "In conclusion, despite varying opinion on the bes way to chastise a child, I believe other ways of damnation is the better choice as corporal punishment has its negative effects outweighing the positives. As a result, it shouldn't be the adopted for use in training a child."
