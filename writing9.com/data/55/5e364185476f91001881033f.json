        "The issue of whether citizens should have the freedom to design their accommodation or not is certainly a contentious one. While there are some advantages of this trend, I would argue that its disadvantages are more significant.",
        "On the one hand, having less oversight on building has some benefits. The first advantage is that it will give scope for creativity. Since people are allowed to construct their house of new materials and to experiment new designs, it might eventually be the arrival of more innovative and unique erects. Secondly, due to the freedom of construction design, owners have an opportunity to fulfil their personal preferences which may vary significantly from people to people. Indeed, individuals usually have different styles which could be traditional or contemporary, and therefore, it will be satisfied to be able to translate their personal style into their home.",
        "On the other hand, I believe there are drawbacks of this development. In the first place, housings which are built without any strict building codes may be vulnerable to serious damage, particularly natural disasters. Typical example of this is houses in central parts of Vietnam, where there are few government regulations on their constructions. Whenever a fierce storm strikes the region, these houses are easy to lose their roofs, and even worse, sometimes completely collapse. In the second place, without strict control on the housing design, the uniformity of city can be distorted. This may, in turn, damage the look of the city because the consistency in the building is often accompanied by the beauty.",
        "In conclusion, I believe that the disadvantages of having freedom to construct building is heavier than advantages, and this should be controlled by government."
