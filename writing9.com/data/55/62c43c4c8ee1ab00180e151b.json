        "Productive citizens give lots of benefits to their country. To support this, every country allocated health budget for their citizens. There are two ways in which this this budget can be allocated: Illness prevention and Illness treatment. In this essay I will explain why health budget should be spent on treatment instead of prevention.",
        "Funding on illness treatment provides more benefits. To begin with, not all disease can be pr evented, but most of them can be cured. Cancer, for example, is known to be undetectable until it has grown. Cancer cell is a parasite that can be found in most parts of your body, but it is not dangerous until it is activated. To this day, we do not have any knowledge of what activate it. Secondly, some diseases are a result of an unexpected event. For instance, car accident can make a person with a very healthy lifestyle to have severe illness.",
        "On the other hand, many people believe that preventative measures are useless due to a lot of reasons. Firstly, some unhealthy habits are hard to quit. Even tough cigarette box has a picture of diseases caused by smoking; people keep on doing it anyway. Another example is the increase of fast-food consumption despite the healthy diet campaign. Furthermore, money spent on preventative measures are not as targeted that of treatment. Budget on illness treatment will only be spent when people are ill, while budget spent on prevention may result in people having the diseases that were prevented anyway.",
        "In conclusion, despite the high cost of treating diseases, I strongly believe that the money spent for illness treatment is a better use than for prevention."
