        "The importance of child caring for women which were always debatable has now become more controversial with many people claiming that it is beneficial while others reject this notion. The substantial influence of this trend has sparked controversy over its potential impact in recent years. In my opinion, women are more suited for children.",
        "Analysing the statement and explaining further, the first and foremost reason behind this is that as women give birth to a child and they have more attachments with kids than men. Another striking benefit in this regard is that with the help of mothers infants can get breastfed which is most important to the child. Categorically discussing, men don't have much knowledge and time to spend with children, which helps them make a public opinion.",
        "Probing ahead, one of the main underlying reasons stems from the fact that the",
        "both parents are equally responsible to raise a child. Moving further, it is pertinent to mention that maximum men are busy with their work because in most cases  they are the sole bread earner of the family. Moreover, nowadays children are more focused on women because she is the one who full fills the basic needs of their child. Apart from the reasons mentioned above, it can clearly state why many favours this trend.",
        "To recapitulate, according to the arguments aforementioned above, one can reach the conclusion that the benefits of the mother are significant to raising a child ,especially who spend more time apart from working with children."
