        "Indigent nations usually receive monetary assistance from affluent countries; however, poverty could not be resolved. Accordingly, various solutions apart from financial support should be applied by wealthy authorities. This essay will illustrate the subjective perspective that agrees with the given topic.",
        "Notwithstanding being helped in financial issues by rich countries, indigent nations can not eliminate poverty. Deficiency of money causes many problems to poor countries; noteworthily slow development, hunger, and falling education. Take the USA, Japan or Australia for instance, they attempt to donate many places in which poverty dominants. Developed nations offer to loan them a considerable amount of money in such a way that can cease deficiency. By virtue of that benevolent action, many trials have been passed; nevertheless, it remains poverty in the entire world. Human concerns about Nepal, Syria which are suffering from severe hunger.",
        "Hence, the emergence of useful solutions is urgent; especially volunteering to erect buildings, cure deceases, and provide food. Firstly, poor countries will derive benefits from having recovered shelters, which should be supported by wealthy constructive companies. Moreover, talent doctors may make a trip to indigent nations to cure their sicknesses and guide them the way to protect their health. Additionally, they should develop fresh culinary provision, which is invariably ignored because many people support the view that everything can be eaten.",
        "To put it in the nutshell, poverty is arduous to be annihilated despite the attempts of rich countries. Nonetheless, there are plentiful types of support listed by many rich governments, but it seems not to be carried out."
