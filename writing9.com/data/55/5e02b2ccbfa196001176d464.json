        "Transportation has become an essential part of life for reaching one place to another place. Certain individuals understand that for road safety the speed limit should be lowered, it is the best way to stop accidents, however others think that some different way to make safe road. I will discuss both views and give my opinion.",
        "Firstly, there are huge reasons, why people should drive vehicles slowly. The main reason is comfortable. In past time, the number of cars was less on roads. People could  easy drive and the accidents, chance was less. While, in modern era every family has own vehicle for travelling. They use vehicle reach immediately on their target. As a result, they drive very quickly, which is harmful for their life, besides those masses how are driving vehicles, who are going on the same road.",
        "On the other hand. Government can only do it. Building big and wide roads. Hence people can drive according to their speed. In this way the traffic conjuction will also decrease. People never blow horn. But another negative point is pollution, which is increasing due to automobiles, it's burn a lot of fuel and emission of chemical gas. Namely carbon monooxide, it is harmful for srrounding. For example, when cars are not come in market. The pollution rate was very low as well as people did not suffer with asthma and cancer diseases.",
        "In conclusion, although cars have some negative points, but it is useful for human's lifespan. So people limited use it."
