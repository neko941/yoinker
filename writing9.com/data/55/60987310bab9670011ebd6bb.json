        "Nowadays, according to the development of the internet, virtual learning has become popular more and more; thus, some individuals reckon that this distance learning can be a suitable alternate for classical education. However, some others believe that traditional learning has no replacement. As an outstanding issue, there are some experiences in the education that any pupil have to face and virtual environment will not be able to provide them; nonetheless, online learning can have some advantages.",
        "In the modern era, in this advanced world, most of the people tend to utilize online services instead of traditional ones but about the education it is controversial. There are something tangible in learning process that students should face then get the point. Additionally, education has several aspects besides the academic learning; for instance, children will learn making connection with others in schools or they can make a lot of friends among their classmates.",
        "On the other hand, there are some people who think there is no replacement for the classical education. Firstly, I will be agree with them but remember we had better not be narrow-minded; in other words, I reckon that e-learning can be a help hand for upgrading our traditional education. For example, virtual environment can help teachers monitor assignments of their learners; furthermore, in some crucial circumstances such as the COVID-19 pandemic we can consider a blended learning which includes virtual education besides offline learning. Needless to say, the education that has been based on the internet will not be an appropriate alternate for face-to-face learning on account of its limits.",
        "Eventually, distance learning never cannot be accepted as a new education method instead of classical learning but can be considered as a helpful assistant that will contribute us to upgrade the previous version of education. Meanwhile, do not forget there are some experimental lessons that a teacher will not be able to teach them virtually."
