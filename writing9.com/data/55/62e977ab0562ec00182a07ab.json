        "In this modern era, it is increasingly common that people are willing to take risky actions and they are ready to face the consequence of risk in their professional and personal lives. I am generally in agreement with this contention due to the potential for better growth and advancement.",
        "Firstly, people who take risks in their life\u2019s are often called \u201cInnovators\u201d and more successful in their lives. Risk taking is an ability which one should have and helps in expedite career\u2019s goal. In early stage of life, risk takers create their own path and never settle for less in professional as well as in personal lives. For instances Risk taking ability is common among all the successful entrepreneurs and achievers such as famous cricketer M.S. Dhoni quit the government job and started his career in cricket from the scratch. Moreover, individual who has risk taking ability are much more experienced, sharp, dynamic, mature, ambitious, and above all successful in their life",
        "However, in today\u2019s world everything has their own price. Therefore, individuals who took risk in the early stage of their life they need to struggle and quit their comfortable life whether professionally or personally. For example: Many families are not in support of those who took harsh steps in their life to do something big. Individuals do face challenges and struggle financially and emotionally. Nevertheless, all the hardships and struggle are worth enough and At the end of the day, what matters is the output not the process.",
        "To conclude, one should be open for all the options in our life and should not be rigid and scared from the difficulties and challenges come along. Thus, giveaways of risk taking will outweigh its drawbacks for sure."
