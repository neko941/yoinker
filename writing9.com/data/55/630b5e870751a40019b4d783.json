        "The invention of newer technologies made communities around the world  connect.Along with  newer technologies evolved newer social  media platforms which allow us to explore and talk to others.In spite of others arguing that this tech world connects younger people and others together, I agree with the point it will have a degradable effect on  teenagers.",
        "Social behaviour can only be achieved by practical experiences such as meeting newer people and personalities and this can only be achieved by attending get-togethers,family functions,vacations with friends and many more.These activities not only build the appropriate behavioural instincts in them but also make them feel protected and not  abandoned as they are surrounded by live human beings ,unlike on social media where they communicate with bots or strangers.",
        "Having advantages like connecting everyone together the dark side of social media is, that it can easily influence the kids by making them see inappropriate videos and posts etc.For instance,a game called blue whale which is available  online is the cause for the loss of lives of many children,by giving them dangerous tasks and activities.Eventually giving them suicide as their final level of the game,these sensitive unmatured younger human beings were the most affected by these kinds of dangerous platforms.",
        "For summing up,  social media has both bright and dark sides  and introducing this kind of online platform to younger generations is not the right age for them,so at this ,age the effects that social media causes on them outweigh the advantages it provides."
