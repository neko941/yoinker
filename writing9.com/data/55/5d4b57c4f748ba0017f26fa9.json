        "It has been very obvious recently that both genders , men and women, are having a full-time jobs, so they could save the fundamentals of life. Therefore, sharing chores together has become an urgent demand to improve their life's quality. I entirely agree with the previous statement.",
        "Firstly, neither men only nor women only can afford life requirements alone. That is because of the unprecedented boost in prices due to global inflation. Therefore a genuine cooperation should be exist between the two poles of society. For instance, to establish a decent house in order to live in ,both genders have to share the responsibility equally to achieve such goal.",
        "Secondly, chores is a crucial duty, which is not less important than outdoor work, requires a wise collaboration between men and women. Unfortunately in some cultures man never give a hand to his wife in householding and females are to work outside and inside the house. Thus they are more susceptible to psychological and physical issues such as pressure and depression, which reflected on the family and consequently, on the whole society. As a result men should assist their ladies in chores to incline the quality of life in the main.",
        "Eventually, better quality of life is expected through such cooperation. When women are given a hand in householding, they will have a plenty of time to take care of their marriage life. For example, they could spend more romantic time with their partners, go jogging together, or even watch some movies, these activities could enhance the relation between males and female.",
        "In conclusion, many women have to work side by side with men to be capable of  earn-living fot sustaining their families, hence men must participate householding with them to ease multiple tasks they perform. Personally, I encourage men to play this rule."
