        "There is no iota doubt that a lot of people keep long hours work in daily and they getting very little time for their entertaining activities. This phenomenon offering multifarious negative impact of the people\u2019s life. However, sometimes a couple of benefits emerge due to the same following paragraphs would cast cons and pros of people works continuous hours having less time for their leisure activities.",
        "To begin with the dark side, these some nasty consequences as well firstly, if they do continuous working, it will help to get stress frequently and its always bad influence to health to take the numerous health problems. For example, recent research concluded that stress is a common reason for the diabetes and cholesterol. Secondly, they have very limited time to stay with their children and family. Therefore it may badly effect on their kid education and also some negative side of their life.  And they have a lack of time to enjoy their life together.",
        "On the flip side of coin, either there is some positive side, such as if they work long hours automatically they can increase their production capacity, it will directly help to grow the country's economy. For example, some food manufacturing companies in Srilanka, the employees have work more than eight hours with the overtime work, they are giving a big capacity of production daily and  it positively increases in their monthly income as well as the country's economy.",
        "In conclusion, I personally believe that demerits outnumber the merits. However efforts should be made to minimize fair hours of working to daily overcome the issues."
