        "It is true that a new employee after graduating do not have sufficient interpersonal ability, for example, doing teamwork. This leads a team to have a poor performance in front of their boss. In this essay, I am going to examine the causes and how to solve this problem.",
        "Initially, it is almost certain that most pupils, sitting in front of their lectures, always wonder what they are saying, or is this subject relevant to their career in future? This is because both a school and a university has been focusing on theory than a practical, an internship is unable to catch up with the experienced workers in teamwork. Moreover, students teach what they should do to get high scores in the final term examinations; as a result, they lack confidence, will, knowledge, and skill in solving a group project, as well as, another interpersonal abilities that a company looks for.",
        "What should we do to solve this problem? The first approach is that an experienced employee should help the students structure the work that they have to do, for example, define the task, determine the steps necessary to achieve the goal, and so on. Secondly, before the group begins, the old one can have in mind that he/she gives graduation students an opportunity to role-play how they might respond to problems within the groups. It is able to give a hand new employee realizes the situation and familiarizes herself or himself with that, which makes a teamwork environment be more in accord.",
        "In conclusion, new employees can lack basic interpersonal ability such as working with others as a part of a team because of the reasons I mentioned above. However, an experienced worker can provide direction and build conflict-solution skills for the new are the best solutions for this problem."
