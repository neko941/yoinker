        "In many growing nations, the main issues are with the standard of air and water which are released from both production house and building site. This essay  will first suggest that biggest problem caused by this phenomenon plays significant role in harming human\u2019s  health as air and water are polluted, and to overcome this both of them should not dispose polluted water and are directly into environment.",
        "The foremost difficulty caused by polluted water and air results many diseases such as lung cancer, typhoid and breathing related problems. This is because air and water are basic requirement of humans without it human cannot survive. From polluted air that is released from factory and when it comes in intake of human it will effects to respiratory system and makes them weak. Moreover, if contaminated water is used by people for drinking then they will suffer from water releated  dieseas like typhoid.",
        "A possible solution to this problem would be to dispose impure water and air after purifing it. Although refining impurities costs more money, it will save human\u2019s life. This is because thesedays  there are certain methods are developed to remove impurity from air and water but to save money industries are not doing that so government should keep eye on them. To illustrate, in India, the study based on 2 years of close observation discovered that 80% of industries are disposing water and air as per officials guidelines. Due to this medical issues are reduced.",
        "To conclude, impure air and water results to human health strightly where as there are certain methods to prevent such impurity."
