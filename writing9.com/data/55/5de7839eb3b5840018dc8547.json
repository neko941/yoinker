        "In the modern world, advanced technologies are changing the world more quickly than before, and it is true that the greatest number of people have become addicted to new devices. However, after pondering this phenomenon, I believe that living in computer age has more privilege, and modern people have more opportunities than their ancestors.",
        "On the one hand, modern technologies are useful tool for coolborating and communicating with other people as well as with colleagues, especially when people live far apart. In this case, smart phones, personal computers or laptops can connect the people through the internet, leading to further communication among the friends and realitives. Moreover, new technologies give a wide range of probabilities such as carrying out experiments, searching the information and publishing scientific resarches to the public. In addition, they are extremely useful in people's lives, as people use them in various aspects of life.",
        "On the other hand, living in computer age have certain disadvantages too, as many people are addicted to technologies. These days, people are not willing to  communicate with people face to face because they spend time on the internet. Moreover, people have become physically weaker that past people. Because of convenient life and shortage of mannual work, individuals are not keen to work out outside of the buildings. To illustrate, according to UN report in 2017, modern people on average spend their 21 hour a day in offices and accommodations. Furthemore, such kind of lifestyle can lead to poor health and problems with communication.",
        "To conclude, although new technologies are the cause of many probems such as poor health condition and lack of interpersonal skills in individuals, I believe that living in modern life have perfect opportunities and chances to the people."
