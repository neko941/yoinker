        "In the last few years, cooking has been completely transformed. People of the previous generation used to spend a lot of time kitchen, whereas modern families are using a variety of methods to make the process easier. I believe it is an exciting development and the one that has made our lives better.",
        "Nowadays, most ingredients are easily available in the market. Such varieties were previously difficult to prepare and used to take longer durations. The off-the-shelf products have led to time savings for a majority of people, who can now spend the time in their own areas of interest. For example, preparing Indian spices was one of the most effort-intensive activity a homemaker can take up. But with the modern methods, it has become as easy as buying a toothpaste from a supermarket. Alternatively, if such mixtures are curries are to be made from scratch, then it will result in many days of planning and labour, thereby consuming most of the leisure time a person may have.",
        "Along with that, techniques like frozen-food have saved time and resources by increasing shelf-life of various food products. This has also resulted in less frequent trips, for an individual, to the grocery store. As a consequence, people may feel less burdened and frustrated, which improves their quality of life. Furthermore, the frozen-food makes cooking an effortless endeavour, as the food only needs to be warmed, to make it edible. An excellent example of this is an Indian delicacy called \u2018Daal Makhani\u2019. A dish which normally needs hours to prepare can be served in few minutes by the virtue of frozen preparations.",
        "To summerize, technology, as well as innovation in food processing, has made cooking considerably less taxing. This led to better utilization of the time, thereby allowing people to pursue what they enjoy. Such a development has definitely improved our quality of life."
