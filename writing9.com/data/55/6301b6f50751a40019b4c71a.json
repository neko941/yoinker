        "Colours can affect how people feel this known to psychologists for many years and based on this we should choose the ideal colour scheme while decorating places such as hospitals and offices and now in this essay, we will discuss how true this statement is and how colours influence people's health and capacity for work.",
        "People, in general, Do well when they are in a good environment and this will usually depend on the colour of the surrounding places a crucial role in this as it has been proven that people working and recovering in hospitals with bright colours tend to be more efficient and recover faster although this not only factor as other things such as work-life balance and seriousness of the injury also factors into recovery time.",
        "People who come out of a dark room feel instantly refreshed after seeing some bright colours and tend to work more enthusiastically and the opposite can be said true for dark colours as they send people into a depressive mood and this decreases their productivity and put them at risk for various health factors. It has been observed that people who spend more time in light or bright colours tend to be more healthy and productive and people who spend more time in dull or dark colours are less productive and unhealthy compared to others.",
        "We can conclude that colour schemes play a role in how people feel but it is not the only factor contributing to how people feel in places like offices and hospitals and this could also be true about colour influences people's health as the type of colour they spend more time around plays huge role in their health and productivity."
