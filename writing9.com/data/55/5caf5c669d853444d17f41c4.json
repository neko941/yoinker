        "Nowadays, people have forgotton that \"Health is wealth\" and instead they are more focussed on earning money. Long hours of work and unhealthy food habits have led to more diseases. Rather than trying to prevent the disease, treatment has become more common. In my point of view prevention is always better than cure.",
        "Researching and treating a disease take alot of money and efforts. Even if there is a medication available for the disease still it takes time to heal. Also, the medication available will always have some side-effects to it. Either you will be feeling dizzy all day or will not be at your fullest energy levels. Excessive intake of some medicines can also impact your liver and your appetite. Instead of going through so much of trouble, it is always advised to prevent the diseases in advance by taking proper meals, exercising and improving sleep habits.",
        "On the other hand, there are some times when you can't prevent a disease. For example, if there is a communicable disease, we can try as much as possible, but the chances of getting it becomes very high. In those cases all we can do is rely on medication and then wait for the body to get cured. There are many times when we are busy with our work, or family, or just daily routines that we don't get time for taking of our health, at those times only treating the disease is the only way left.",
        "To conclude, however prevention is the best way one has, to lead a healthy life. But, due to the busy and fast moving life, sometimeswe have to rely on medication."
