        "Technical development and competition put more pressure on human beings to be responsible towards the work. Nowadays  people tend to spend more time at work and impart very  attention on their free time. Although working more than regular hours provides financial security, it may lead to health related issues in later life. This essay will discuss why it is important to balance working hours and leisure time to maintain sound physical and psychological health.",
        "Being involved in work for longer hours will make a person more financially stable.  Because, working for longer hours may lead getting higher paycheck, which help to fulfil the rising needs of the family.  Moreover, having more money makes a person happy as they purchase the thing they want to buy and can give better lifestyle to the family.  For example, one of my friends wanted to get admission in the university for his higher education and was running short on the money to pay for his fee. He worked 16 hours continuously in the day for 7 days a week, which helped him to accumulate those amounts of money and pay his fees. Although, giving up leisure time gives a e person satisfaction in terms of money, it disadvatges overweigh advantages.",
        "The prime disadvantage of not giving free enough time the body is that it may cause a detrimental impact on the health. According to 'Worksafe BC' a human being should be working 40 hours a week for 5 days of the week and rest of the time they should participate in the activity which make them happy and healthy. Avoiding free time and spending more time on completing work may lead to physical and mental strain and may reduce the capabilities of certain organs of the body which may dangerous in later life. This illustrated by the research report from the World Health Organization, which suggest that people who allocated most of their time working and rarely involved in leisure activity may have higher chances of develping dementia- a psychotic disorder in which a person loss ability to recall and memorise thing are higher.",
        "To conclude, health and family is the primary requirement for the happier life, and people should understand this truth. Working for longer hours and earning more money is beneficial in some situation but it is more important to give some free time to ourself to enjoy the life longer and happier."
