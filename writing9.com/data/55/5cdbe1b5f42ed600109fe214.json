        "In the recent times, there has been an increase in the number of travellers willing to explore places with difficult conditions like Sahara desert or the Antarctic. The foremost benefit of travelling to such places with difficulties in terms of weather especially, can be the awareness about the effects of climate change happening in these parts of the earth. However, on the downside, travelling to these places can be highly dangerous and risky. This essay will discuss both the advantages and disadvantages of travelling to places with difficult conditions.",
        "On one hand, visiting to these less explored places with extreme weather conditions can be helpful for realization of the ongoing climate change and the adverse effects of the global warming particularly on the drastic change in the lives of the animals living there. For instance, the dessert lizards are on the edge of extinction because the weather does not suits them. Similarly, the polar bears living in the Antarctic are facing a challenge surviving with the melting ice. More and more people travelling to these regions can be helpful to spread the awareness and finding some solutions to mitigate these problems.",
        "On the other hand, travelling to such places is indeed very risky and it can turn out to be truly dangerous. The conditions in such places are quite varied when compared to the living conditions of the normal cities, towns and villages. Recently, there were reports that a Japanese travel blogger lost his life in the desert area since his car had broken down and there was no help around. He ran out of the water that he had stocked up and lost his life after two days.",
        "This essay discusses both the sides of travelling to places with such difficult conditions and concluded that it can be helpful only when tourists are well informed and well prepared."
