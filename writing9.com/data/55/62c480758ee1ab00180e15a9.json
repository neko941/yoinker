        "Learning does come with a continuous effort, and mode of learning could be endless. However education is classified into two broad categories : distance learning and attending colleges or universities. Through this essay, I disagree that learning from traditional way will be a more beneficial than distance learning.",
        "To start with, most crucial benefit I see with distance learning program is that students can enroll themselves in other online/distance learning program, wherein student can earn dual program within the specified time period.For example, when I was student, I enrolled myself into distance learning program,one in bachelor in computer application from Delhi University, and second in bachelor in data science through pune university. It helped a lot in a professional growth.However such dual degree cannot be obtained if student pursue through  through classroom learning. Distance learning program can be completed in a minimal cost, whereas  hefty fee need to pay to the college/ University, plus there will be a living cost if a particular college or university situated in other city, rather than home town.",
        "Furthermore,distance learning curriculum distributed across weeks,followed by weekly and monthly test. With this roboust learning structure ,students will complete their course week wise and tried their best to obtain good score. However, such learning path is missing in traditional classes room learning.For example, during graduation time I had to work hard to get at least 65% in overall weekly test ,otherwise I was not eligible to write for monthly test. Distance learning would be more effective if student is working professional and pursue course in the same field. For example ,when I when I was working in Zee technology,I pursued distance program in master of computer application, and working experience helped me a lot in understanding topics covered in syllabus, plus submitting practical projects.",
        "To conclude with, as per my opinion the distance running could be more effective than classroom learning, where students can take maximum benefits if student has clear vision towards carrier path."
