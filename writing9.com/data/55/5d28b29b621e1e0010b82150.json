        "More and more students are opting to study abroad as part of their university curriculum. Although studying abroad might lead to an increase in student expenditure, the benefit of being better prepared to handle unexpected situation outweighs the disadvantage. In my opinion, having students exposed to overseas education, as part of university curriculum, will be advantageous.",
        "Resilience to changing environment, which is the most important skill required for a promising career, can be only learned by moving away from the comfort zone. By staying away from home country, students will be forced to go through life changing experiences during their time abroad. For instance, a research paper done at Harward university concluded by stating that international students, who were exposed to diverse culture during their university years, were able to adapt to changes easily than those who never got a chance to experience different culture. Therefore, early life experiences, such as studying abroad, will make an individual comfortably adapt to changes.",
        "The main challenge that students face will be the additional cost they will have to incur during their stay abroad. The extra cost comes from the additional expenditure, which can be avoided back home, from staying in a country which is alien to them. For example, during my stay in Italy for my higher education, I had to manage my own finances, which was challenging at times. This led to increased cost, which could have been avoided if I had stayed back in my country. Although international education might lead to extra cost, this can be easily avoided by proper planning and budgeting.",
        "To conclude, there is an increasing trend of university students opting to have their education abroad. Even though studying abroad will be costlier, overseas experience is beneficial for future job perspective for students. Hence, my vote goes for international education because of the benefit it provides to university students."
