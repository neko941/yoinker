        "There is a controversy among the topic of personal role towards the surrounding medium. While many advocates contend that citizens are helpless in developing their communities,it seems to me that they have a key part regarding such development.",
        "People have a remarkable impact on their environment. Firstly, they could rationalize the utilisation of pollutants and contaminants for example, avoid using pesticides and insecticides and use the old and traditional ways such as yeast to get rid of insects. Secondly, finding alternatives of plastic pages, which became a very critical issue that should be addressed as soon as possible because it represents a non-biodegradable and sustainable pollutants. Implying that it's lifespan could lasts for millions of years, and replace it by organic paper bags that can be decomposed easily. Finally citizens are to use distinct approaches to maintain their environment Clear in other words, they need to avoid utilizing disposal items and replace them with long lasting items consequently, the ratio of litter will be significantly plummeted.",
        "Government and large companies also could help by implementing and financing novel environmental friendly procedures. This means that, applying new strategies that focus mainly on the favour of the environment. For instance, manufacturing organic fertilizers as opposed to chemical fertilizers. Moreover, release verdicts and apply sentences to deter people to contaminate water or throw  garbage  in the streets via paying fins or spending prison times hence, all individuals will think many times before polluting their environment.",
        "In conclusion, although some critics argue that society members are disabled  to help their environment and make it a better place to live in, personally, I am convinced that individuals do have a serious influence on the surroundings."
