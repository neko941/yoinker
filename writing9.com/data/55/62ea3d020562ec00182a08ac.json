        "Dear Professor,",
        "I am writing regarding my poor performance on the past project given in class. This was a very unpalatable experience for me. However, I would like to justify the reasons why I failed my paper.",
        "First,  My co-partner had a situation at home. One of his family members got sick as a result he was the only one available to cater for him till he gets better. which balls out to having to attend to all the house chores like cooking, doing laundry, cleaning the apartment and running some outside errands as well as tending to his needs.  This was extremely overwhelming for Him and he did not have enough time to participate in the project.",
        "This really reduces the pace at which we study as well as research for solutions for our assignment at the time. And as they always say, two heads are better than one. Though I tried all I could to fill in his space given the unpleasant events he faced but I presume my best was not enough.",
        "However, We apologise for our poor performance and We would appreciate it if you could give us a second chance by reviewing our scripts and giving us enough time to work on the project again.",
        "Best regards."
