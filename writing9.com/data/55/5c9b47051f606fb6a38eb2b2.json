        "It is often been argued that the best way to get a job is to complete university education. However, some people argue that it better to work and gain enough experience. While it can save money and time , in my opinion, it helps a person to earn more salary and a better job prospect.",
        "On the one hand, one of the primary objectives of university is to help students find better job opportunities. Institutions are hoping that the curriculum, projects and course modules may help and guide the students in the work place. Besides, universities are the best place to learn about team building aspects by playing team sport or team activities. So, these students develop a valuable set of skills such as interacting and cooperating with others. This, in turn, will either benefit them in the workplace or in the social life. Moreover, it is mandatory to have a university degree to get the job in multi-national companies and earn a sizeable salary. A recent survey published by Queensland University which was conducted across the US in Fortune500 companies showed that more than 80% of the high-ranking employees at least had a Master's degree. Thus, making university education more important in personal growth in the company.",
        "On the other hand, practical life experience can be an excellent teacher. For example, a marketing sales person can sell any product by conviencing the opposite person and this skill does not require any classroom training. because a person can develop this skill only by going in to the world and having a face to face conversation. So, if an individual is good at words, it will be easy for his to secure the job and need not go through the hassle of studying for a degree. Thus, this approach saves not only money buts also time and energy. Moreover, some companies choose their tenured executives as middle-level and above mid-level managers because they feel that they have better knowledge about the company and its products rather than hiring a university graduate and training them from the scratch. However, most of the senior and high-level jobs such as CEO, COO, CFO, General Manager and so on are only offered to people who are educated and graduated from the universities.",
        "To conclude, although working directly can help a person achieve mir-range jobs, I believe that a university degree is one of the essential factor in order to obtain high positions in the company."
