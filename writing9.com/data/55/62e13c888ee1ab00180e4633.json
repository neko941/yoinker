        "It is hard to deny that using robots to do tasks at work would take away jobs from some workers, and such a fact leads impressionable people to generate the opinion that using robots frequently is a negative development. However, such a statement suffers from both logical and factual fallacies, and it should be examined meticulously. As far as efficiency, safety and employment are concerned, I hold that it is a positive trend to use robots to finish tasks at home and at work.",
        "First and foremost, robots are more efficient than people when doing tasks. With the rapid development of technology, robots can address some different tasks at the same time or produce products in a large amount in a short time. However, people only can produce products by hand, which means that it would take more hours for them to finish a job compared with robots. As a consequence, using robots to replace workers in some jobs may boost the efficiency and productivity of the whole company.",
        "Furthermore, more and more people use robots to do tasks at home and at work may avoid people get injured. There are some dangerous tasks in housework, such as cleaning outside windows on a high floor. We often hear that someone fell from a high apartment because of doing window cleaning tasks. If robots can be used for this task, fewer people would get injured.",
        "However, a voice arises that more and more robots being used at work would take away jobs from workers, and the unemployment rate would incease. Ironically, with some dangerous jobs disappeared, some innovative jobs will appear, which would help more people be employed. For example, there are significant demands for engineers who design robots, and such a trend can improve the employment rate.",
        "In conclusion, as far as efficiency, safety and employment are concerned, I maintain that more and more robots being used at home and at work is a positive trend."
