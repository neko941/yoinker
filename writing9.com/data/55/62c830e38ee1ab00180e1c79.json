        "From our old days, space exploration is considered as a new way to communicate with the lives outside the Earth. However, its strong development in our society at the moment puts a question mark for the government as well as citizens, is that the purpose of space research is to contribute to a specific country or for a global effort. Personally, I would say that it meets the two aims rather than responses to one.",
        "It could not doubt that a successful space exploration mostly brings various achievements as well as compliments to a particular country. And that would be easily understood mainly because of the effort that nations put into the project, it is their own scientific research, their time spent through years to years, and many more. In contrast, if the launch had not been fully accomplished or had unexpected trouble during the process affecting astronauts, they will take all the responsibility for their life.",
        "\u201cThat's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind\u201d-goes the saying of Neil Armstrong, who was the first human landing on the moon. Through that quote, I believe that every single success from any individual as well as their country at least contributes to the international effort.",
        "Furthermore, the development in researching space many years after will be widely extended. Instead of sending a human into space, the robots will take that responsibility so as to collect precise data as well as work in an exact way. And I would say, space exploration now will be turned into a space tour that opened for every type of citizens."
