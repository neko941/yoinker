        "It is true that nowadays, it is quite difficult for many people to socialise in many day-to-day communication situation, especially in the meetings where they have to socialize or talk to each other. In my view, this phenomenon is attributable to several deciding factors, and it could be addressed by a number of appropriate solutions.",
        "There are many reasons why this problem is happening all around the world. The first and most obvious explanation could be the development of modern technology, including the introduction of computer, the Internet and social networking websites. It can be argued that the maturity and expansion of network technology, together with the popularity of mobile phones and computers, may allow people, especially the youngsters, to communicate with their peers, mentors, and family members in a completely different ways compared to the past because they can simply use their Facebook or Twitter account to send a message or to make a phone call, a video chat with their friends, which will lead to the fact that they are more familiar with chatting via social network instead of having a face-to-face conversation. For example, rarely can we see students share their stories, feelings or perspective with their classmates in the gatherings and as a result, they will find it difficult, inconvenient and uncomfortable  to talk to each other. Moreover, life tends to be increasingly stressful and people have to pay a lot of time, effort and all their attention to their work, which might wear them out, therefore, it is nearly impossible for them to arrange some quality time to have a meeting, a chat or go out with friends or coworkers. Consequently, they will not engage in any verbal confabulations (conservations) and gradually consider talking as a time-consuming, embarrassing social situation.",
        "Notwithstanding the above mentioned causes, a number of measures can be taken to improve the situation. Firstly, it is important to raise public awareness of the importance of socialising. The possible solution could be holding competitions challenging people to abandon their phones, stop using social networking websites for as long as possible and instead of it, people will be forced to communicate more to get information. For instance, there was a challenge where they decided to award the winner, who could turn off his or her mobile phones and log out all their social network accounts, a gold medal and 1000 dollar. Many people participated in this competition and the report showed that all of them confirmed that they enjoyed talking to others during this contest. Another possibility to handle the problem is for the government to enact a law stating that it is compulsory to stay away from their phones or computers for at least one hour a day/ on a daily basis so that people will definitely have time to cooperate, communicate or verbalize in the face-to-face gatherings. Moreover, to control the overuse of these websites, it is necessary for the producers/ founders of it to have an application to help the users keep track of the amount of time they spend on using it. Besides, the governments can also offer some interpersonal skills classes so that their residents can be likely to be well-prepared for daily conversation and consider it as a comfortable, convenient and useful way to share their views with others.",
        "To sum up, a growing problem plaguing people in many countries, is mainly caused by the development of information technology and the modern lifestyles. Negative consequences have ensued, although there appear to be several prescriptions to curb the situation."
