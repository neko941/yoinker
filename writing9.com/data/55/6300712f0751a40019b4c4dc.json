        "It is certainly true that the availability of each food product across the world has changed the eating style of people entirely. It is stated that imported food items are eaten by masses significantly as compared to the local food in today's time. However, I personally ponder that these eating habits of people have more drawbacks than benefits that will be elaborated in detail in the forthcoming clauses with suitable instances.",
        "To commence with, there are multifarious reasons why consumption of imported food is regarded as disadvantageous for public. The preponderant demerit is the disappearance of cultural food. To explain it, unquestionably, if people tend to eat foreign food regularly instead of locally produced goods, as a result, native food of that place may loss their existence somewhere. To exemplify it, take an example of Punjab where people use to eat varieties of food products that come from other countries instead of own one, as a result, cultural food of that region is at the edge of extinction currently. Thus, eating more imported food may proven threatful for the preservation of native food. In addition, the another striking con of eating foreign food is the contamination of environment. It is a matter of fact that usage of the ships, aeroplanes and trains are done by the individuals for the sake of food importation, as a consequences, not only water, but air pollution also spread Continuously on the earth.",
        "On the other hand, despite having various demerits of eating foreign food, it also provides few of the benefits to public. The first and foremost advantage of eating exotic food is that it strengthen the interpersonal relationships among nations. In other words, undoubtedly, when all the countries deals with each other for the importation of food, then it is obviously that they become dependent upon one another thoroughly, as a repercussions, their relationships may never be broke at any expenses. For instance, the kiwi which is known as a native fruit of Newzealand and now every nation import that fruit from there, as a consequences, it becomes possible for that country to build better relationship with well- developed nations as well. Thereby, importing food from other nations also eliminate the chances of conflicts among regions.",
        "To conclude, unquestionably, having overseas cuisines is not that much outrageous for folks, it should be eaten by them in at some limit; otherwise the consequences may be unimaginable as the contamination of environment and existence of cultural food may lose due to overconsumption of it."
