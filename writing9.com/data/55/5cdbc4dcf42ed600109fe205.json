        "The act of teaching a child can be cumbersome. However, engaging them creatively, rather than reading a book, helps to develop their skilful ability. I totally agree with this point of view and its benefits will be discussed in this essay.",
        "For a youngster \u2013 especially children below four years- to learn effectively, the teacher has to be tactful and creative by incorporating several fun activities while impacting them with knowledge.\u00a0 This is due to the fact that, they are easily distracted. In addition, they are restless and full of energy with which they are ready to explore. Therefore, in order to catch their attention, the person teaching them ought to get them engaged in funny academic activities which will soothe their fancy, instead of reading a book to them as this can be boring. For instance, studies have shown that infants respond to funny videos by giggling or laughing and this is because their central nervous system is designed to identify more with fun-like events.",
        "Moreover, acquisition of skills by these young ones is easy when they partake in creative activities because it lingers in their brain for so long. Thus, it is difficult for them to forget it. Whereas, reading them a book or asking them to read can be boring because the fun center in their brain is most active. Consequently, reciting a book to a child will switch on the sleep center and at the end of the day, nothing will be learnt. It is no surprise that a lullaby hasten sleep in children.",
        "In conclusion, childrens\u2019 instructors should be encouraged to develop various concept to make learning fun-filled as this improves their skills better."
