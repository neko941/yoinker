        "In recent times, the number of young people who follows news is decreasing at an alarming rate. They neither read newspapers, nor watch TV news. The main reason for this is the change in attitude they have towards society. In my opinion, the ideal solution for this is to incorporate general knowledge in school curriculum and make children aware of the importance of knowing what is going around the world.",
        "There are multiple causes for this of which the most important one is the attitude today's generation has towards the world. They don't care about what is happening around them and they are not interested to know the day to day activities of their own country. Majority of the youngsters spent most of their time in social networking sites such as Facebook and they find watching or reading news as a waste of time. At the most, what they read is sports related articles, which they find amusing. Besides this, many often find reading serious articles as boring and uninteresting.",
        "One solution that can help to cater a change is to have general knowledge as a mandatory subject in schools itself. This will ensure kids grow up knowing about the world affairs and they will try to make this as a habit when they grow up. Once we are used to reading news, it will become a hobby and will benefit in the long run. Another way to make sure this is to create awareness campaigns in schools and local communities so that children as well as parents know the importance and benefits of news. For instance, if someone is not ready to read, they even have the option to watch television which is much more entertaining and serves the purpose.",
        "To conclude, as a responsible citizen, we are ought to know about national and wordly affaires and news is the best and only way for this. Lack of interest is the main issue that we see these days and in my opinion, authorities should make sure people have the right guidance and means to be knowledgeable."
