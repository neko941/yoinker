        "Industrialisation has resulted in the generation of many new jobs. As a result, the employment rate have greatly increased worldwide. The economic growth has a huge positive impact on the modern society. Not only, it has helped in greatly reducing hunger and poverty, but also, has improved the quality and standard of living. In contrast, some people also beleive that the development and economic growth is having a negative impact on the environment as it must be stopped totally. In this essay, I will discuss both views and will also highlight that even though the economic growth might have some damaging effect, but the positive side of it, has overshadowed all the negatives.",
        "Firstly, the economic growth have made lives easier worldwide by generating a variety of jobs. Unemployment rates all over have greatly reduced. By investigation, researchers have found out that the unemployment rate in developing countries have decreased by almost 30% in the last 30-40 years. Such as, in China, modernisation and economic developments have led to the rise of the number of people employed by 40 million. Different industries and job sectors have opened up which are employing more and more people. The IT industry and the management sector have given jobs to over 10 billion people worldwide. For example, in the United States alone, the IT industry has hired over 10 million youngsters from developing countries and have thus boosted their quality of life.",
        "Secondly, this economic growth has resulted in globalisation. Therefore, it has reduced the long standing problem of racism and bigotry. People of different cultures, religions, nations and races now work together under the same roof. They work with each other, hand in hand, to achieve the desired, common work objective. As revealed by, some of the big companies like Apple and Microsoft, where they have hired people from over 100 countries like France, US, Canada, Philippines, India, China, Israel, Morocco, South Africa, Australia, Thailand and Mexico. Economic growth has given birth to a healthy, multicultural work environment and thus, it has impacted the society positively.",
        "However, some people might argue that the economic growth has damaged the environment and so, it must be stopped. Even though, it is true that increased industrialisation has lead to deforestation, pollution and has caused global warming, it can be controlled by the government and hence, these problems can be minimised.",
        "In conclusion, I strongly support the rise of economy and I think, boosting the economic situation worldwide is the only way to fight hunger and poverty. Economic growth has benefited the society in many ways. As revealed by, the improved infrastructure and technology, significant development in the health sector and meeting health challenges, and the growth of education. On the other hand, some people oppose this development as they highlight the negative results it has on our environment. However, the governments and people can help in tackling these issues by switching to eco-friendly alternatives and reducing waste production. In my opinion, economic growth is essential in the development of a nation and shaping the future of the world."
