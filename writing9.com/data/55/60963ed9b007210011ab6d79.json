        "Since ancient times, humans have had an impact on nature. Recently, such intervenes in the environment are on the rise, and this process can lead to horrible consequences, but what can the government and individuals do to prevent this?",
        "There are some harmful human activities which can be tackled by state. For example, factories that pour their waste into the rivers and the oceans, it causes growth in the level of pollution. Another example is increase in the number of constructions reduces the fertile land areas. Governments can suppress these issues with the several policies. Taxes and restrictions can be implemented on pollution, moreover, government can encourage entrepreneurs by giving the financial aid in order to decrease the wasting level or it can apply some fines against littering. Additionally, improving the level of education leads to a more developed society which is aware of their negative effects on the nature. To go down the number of apartments, it can build the skyscrapers in order to protect fertile soil.",
        "On the other hand, people individually can prevent particular problems such as exhauste fumes produced by cars or littering the ground. Exhaust fumes result in the poor air quality, for reducing it, the number of cars should be cut down, but how? Habitants are able to use bicycles instead of the cars. Littering the ground results in griminess and so person can be thought from childhood about their effect to the world. For example, parents can explain to their children why they should not pollute the ground.",
        "Taking everything into the account, there are such harmful damages of the humankind on the environment. Some of them should handle at the state level, but individuals' behaviors are also important, because big revolutions start with small steps."
