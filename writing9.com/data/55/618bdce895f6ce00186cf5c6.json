        "The bar graph summarises and compares the annual number of rentals or sales of films in various formats from one particular store between 2002 and 2011.",
        "In 2002, people preferred to rent most of the films with more than 1,80,000 rentals in the same year. But, over the next 10 years, the number of rentals has seen a persistently downward trend with just above 50,000 in the year 2011.",
        "As far as the VHS sales are concerned, 80,000 was the highest number over the decade which were sold in 2002. Since then, there has been a dramatic fall in the demand for VHS. They were taken off the shelf from 2006.",
        "The DVD sales in 2002 were less than 50,000 in 2002. Its purchases skyrocketed in the next 5 years and the most number of DVDs were sold in 2007, which were a little more than 2,10,000. After 2008, there has been a slight decline in its sales with about 1,80,00 being sold in 2011.",
        "Lastly,  Blu-ray sales were non-existent before 2006. People started buying films in the Blu-ray format after 2007. Its purchases have shown a small increase up to a little above 10,000 by the year 2011.",
        "To sum up, film rentals have been steadily decreasing over the years, VHS has become a thing of the past, Blu-ray sales are picking up the pace while DVDs are still holding the fort strong enough."
