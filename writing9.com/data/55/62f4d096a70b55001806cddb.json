        "In modern society, people tend to eat at fast food restaurants because of the fast pace of their lives. There are both advantages and disadvantages to choose fast food as main meals. However, in my opinion, peolpe have more negative effects compared to the positive ones in terms of healthy.",
        "Fast foods are loved by many people around the world. One of the biggest reasons why they are willing to eat is spending a little time. Junk food is always available at anywhere. For example, Macdonald's place a lot of restaurants on the earth. Thus, people are able to access to the food whenever they want. Moreover, people would have their meals in less than 10 minutes since they ordered.",
        "On the other hand, in comparison to other meals, it is clear that fast foods are unhealthy. It usually uses high calories ingredients, such as cheese and meat. In addition to that, all restaurants use tons of oils to cook. So, it gives more calories to meals. For instance, when eating at Macdonalds, if people order their meals, which includes humbargers, sugary drinks, and french fries, the calories must be beyond what people usually must take in one meal.",
        "In conclusion, because people's modern lives are in a fast pace, many people are rely on fast foods for their main meals. I believe  that, though it is easy to take and eat in a short term, fast foods are unhealthy foods compared to the other meals."
