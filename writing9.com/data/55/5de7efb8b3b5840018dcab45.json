        "Up to this era, gay marriages are not yet  fully welcomed by the society. Conservatives sees the homosexual as \"abnormal people\" because they deviate from the original and natural gender identity which are either female or male. Whereas, other people who are open to this new trend welcomes the idea of gay marriages.",
        "Gay marriages are still controversial up to this date because not all country legalize it. Some momentous events for the homosexual began when  part of the EU and America  started allowing gay marriages. In return, other parts of the world are also following. One example is Thailand who just recently held a first gay marriage despite the outrage of the public. Allowing gay marriages in the society just like the man and woman marriages bring equality in all genders. It means the community accepts, respects and regards them as human too.",
        "In contrast, the Conservatives strongly argue that gay marriages should be banned and will never be allowed.They believed that their sexual orientation is of that immorality. Moreover, the religious sector strongly opposed on the same-sex marriage or gay marriages and it should not be given a status of \"married\" but rather a \"union\" only. They argue that marriage between a man and woman is sacred in the biblical context, because God designs sexual intimacy between a man and a woman only. Lastly, man and woman are procreative,compared to the homosexuals.",
        "In conclusion, I strongly agree that gay marriages should be legalize for them to have the same equal rights as to man and woman marriages. Furthermore, it will decrease stigma to the homosexuals and may prevent social isolation. I believed that being happy to someone you choose to marry matters most over the sexual orientation."
