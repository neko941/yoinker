        "Nowadays, in most countries, there are numerous the TV sets channels which the community is interested in and they spend day and night watching their favourite programmes on it. It is undeniable that sports channels are more popular among young folk and adults, but this popularity results in laziness among young folk and prevents them from participating in sports.",
        "It is unfortunate that the majority of the crowd prefer to spend their free hour and weekends watching the TV sets following athletics such as cricket, football, golf, etc. instead of taking part in it. However, spending plenty of time watching sport programs has negative effects. For instance, laziness and inactivity.",
        "In my opinion, young folk are energetic enough to not stay inactive. As I have seen teenagers in my neighbourhood, playing cricket, and football outside or spending their weekends in swimming pool clubs, which demonstrates that they take part in sports. Also, watching their beliked sport programmes encourages them to emulate their endeared athlatic star, so they follow their way.",
        "By contrast, it is noticeable that older society who spend most of their moment at work, are more interested in spending their evenings and weekends watching sport programmes broadcast on  TV sets. Moreover, they don't consider athlate as a need for their body and remain indolent.",
        "In conclusion, I would argue that sometimes the sport programs broadcast on TV set cause laziness, but not always. As well as that, it is the most popular program that everybody is interested in and they prefer to spend the majority of their time watching it."
