        "It is common that resumes include individuals' private details, for example,  marital status and favorite pastimes. The reason why  they contain  this information is because  companies believe that it will give a fuller picture  of the person. Based on those  details , the human resources department can know whether the person is what they are looking for or not. However, there are a large amount of people who argue that  this personal data should be protected and even if it exposed to employers, it won't help to recruit  better employees.",
        "In my opinion, the information about interests and hobbies is not  beneficial to companies  and it is difficult to know the people's passions from the information. Although knowing employees' characteristics enhances the possibility to recruit the people who meet the requirements  of the company. Even the most used characteristic test is not perfect to tell people's personality. How can the simple message about interests can give you more accurate information?",
        "Besides, the best employees are not chosen  from the messages, and the messages do not always really show the person. For instance, the resume  I uploaded always included that the instrument, erhu is one of my hobbies. I played Erhu for 4 years, when I was in elementary school. Even though I played it for a long time, it is not one of my hobbies. The instrument  was chosen by my parents. Playing it for a long time doesn't show any of my preference.",
        "To summarise, releasing people's personal information doesn't give any more details  about the person, and it is still hard to sketch the outline of the person. Therefore, it is better to protect private details, and not share them with every employer."
