        "English is a universal language that every individual strives to learn. In recent years, studying English at various institutions is often perceived to be more important than studying traditional languages however if such languages are not taught, many are at the risk of fading out. This essay will discuss why I am of the opinion that everyone should learn English, as well as, traditional languages and how this languages can be preserved.",
        "Firstly, English is a universal language with tremendous benefits such as efficient communication as well as fostering global trade, and thus every individual regardless of age, gender or race should learn this language. There is no where in the world one would go that wouldn\u2019t find at least one native English speaker. Take for instance, a month ago, I traveled to Paris where their first language is French. I generally would have been lost except for the simple fact that most individuals regardless of being French natives have learnt the universal language \u2018English\u2019. This simple fact emphasizes the need to learn English.",
        "However, while I agree that English language should be taught, I also believe that we should try to ensure the survival of traditional languages because this would preserve our culture and prolong our heritage. One of the many ways this can be done is by public awareness. Publicly educating the younger generation. Take for example, the \u2018save the language\u2019 campaign that aired for approximately 8 months in the early \u201890s. The show brought light to our cultural beliefs and ways. In addition, this will keep alive the heroes of our past.",
        "In conclusion, learning traditional languages in institutions should be as important as learning English language as this would not only aid in our communication but also provide a sense of community."
