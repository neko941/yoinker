        "Sun energy becoming more popular as producing energy to the houses in many countries. Solar energy can produce electricity without the need for power distribution companies. The advantage of this energy is free of cost and disadvantage is it cannot produce the radiations in cold countries.",
        "Solar energy is available free of cost because this energy directly comes from the sun and there is no paid for this energy. when I went to my town after a long time and there I saw the solar panels are installed on the top of the roof of their houses. Then I asked my uncle why have you installed the solar panels and then he said there is a power cut in our town and then we decided to keep the solar panels in order to get the electricity for many hours.",
        "The advantages are this energy is free of cost and we know that the sun is a natural star which produces the solar radiations and then we convert these radiations to electricity. In many areas, due to the increase in electricity prices, some are installing the solar panels in order to get the power generation free of cost. The cons of solar energy are that it cannot produce the required radiations in colder countries. In colder countries, the sun will not produce the much radiations required to produce the electricity. So the solar panels cannot support in the cold weather nations. For instance, in colder countries like iceland, there will be less available of energy in order to use in the household.",
        "In conclusion, without the need for power distribution companies, we can produce electricity by using solar energy. The pros and cons are free of cost and the radiations are not much available in colder countries."
