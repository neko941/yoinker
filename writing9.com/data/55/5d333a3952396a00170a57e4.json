        "The best solution suggested to eradicate traffic and pollution is to increase the cost of petrol. Although, an increase in the price of petrol does not promise a decrease in traffic or pollution created by vehicles.",
        "Petrol is a fossil fuel and must be used sparingly. In such a case, the increase in price to preserve the fuel seems noteworthy. However, rise in the amount of petrol won\u2019t stop people from commuting with their private vehicles. In turn, it won\u2019t stop traffic on the roads and eventually there will still be pollution. People will crib to shell out extra money from their pockets but will continue to drive their vehicles instead of opting for a public transport. The luxury of personal vehicles and space is far more important to human beings than the cash to be spent. For example: With a private vehicle one does not have to wait for the bus or train.",
        "Instead of focusing on a price increase to curb problems like traffic and pollution, a green way should be thought of. For example: the use of bicycles in London in some parts of the country is the reason for least traffic. In India, public service advertisements catering to switch off the engine while at the signal helps to restore fuel and stop emissions of various gases. Automobile companies are now seeking solution through electric cars, which run on electricity.",
        "",
        "To conclude, I am of the opinion that price increase isn\u2019t the best way to solve traffic related problems instead a wide range of other activities like cycling, frequent usage of public transport or mere walking should be encouraged."
