After reading your instruction book, I tried to open the door of the store on the first floor for a tool kit. However, the door got stuck and when I pulled with a lil force, it fell upon me.",
        "Pal, to be honest, I accidentally damaged the door otherwise I had no intention to break anything. Nonetheless, to mend my mistake, I have talked to a carpenter for the estimation of the cost for the replacement of hinges and it was $40. I would like to suggest the carpenter's name and number which is Mr. John and 7822313225 and I am ready to pay the cost of repair.",
