        "Past years people have started spending more time shopping, which increased number of malls and markets and increased the rate of production of goods. This could lead to multiple collapses in economics and business and environment pollution, and while it has some benefits for the society, I think that benefits do not overweigh drawbacks.",
        "Problems related with shopping could be harm of the environment and investment bubbles. An absolute value of unrecycled waste correlates with a popularity of the shopping. For example, more people buy plastic bags \u2013 more of them would not be recycled. Therefore, the production of different products will lead to more damage for an environment due to increasing demand. Moreover, increased demand constructs unsustainable bubbles in economics which can blow up due to decreased demand. For example, people, who invested money will lose them, consequently many people will lose their jobs and society will suffer from the collapse.",
        "There are benefits from shopping simultaneously, but they do not overweigh drawbacks. Spending time with friends or a family, for instance, is a main benefit of shopping. However, time surrounded by family could be spent by different ecofriendly activities which does not construct business collapse simultaneously like hiking or volunteering, therefore, society does not suffer from the ecological on economical crisis. Thus, environmental damage and risk of sustainability of the economics overweigh spending time with family.",
        "In conclusion, shopping is a leisure activity that is a normal leisure activity, which is a phantom menace for people if it grows up."
