        "In most countries the affordable alternative have been dominated by fast foods. This situation is threatening the public health in many countries, as intake of junk foods per capita has been rising. I absolutely agree for an urgent increase on taxes imposed on such goods, in order to effectively reduce numbers of chronic diseases, as well as an effect of nudging fast food industry to change their prospective.",
        "Fast foods are often line ups of food with high level of fats. Consuming such products daily could seriously effect the health of individuals, with the consequences of getting a chronic diseases such as type 2 obesity. Furthermore, illness such as obesity could cause problems in patients daily life, but it would also detoriate the chances of survival when fighting against other diseases. The effect of obesity is unfortunately seen at young ages too. Infact in the UK, there has been rising numbers of children who suffers from obesity. Hence, immediate government intervention is requried to push consumers away from junk food products.",
        "In addition, by placing higher tax rate on such products it sends out a signal to fast food companies to change its field of competition. With higher taxes consumption of fast foods would drop, and in order to avoid further downfall of the market leaders would be nudged to shift there market strategy to a service that would have higher demand in the near future. Hence, in the long run it would reduce numbers of junk foods provided by the fast food market. A prime example of a company changing its competition field is FUJIFILM company in Japan. Originally the company sold film camera products, however seeing the fall in there market, they have shifted its market to medical equiptment.",
        "In conclusion, examining the detrimental effects of fast food products, I strongly agree for governments to raise taxes on such goods. This way, it would save people out of unhealthy diets, but also create an opportunity for junk food markets to redesign their bussiness model."
