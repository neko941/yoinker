        "Education plays a vital role in everybody's life. Some communities say that people are working in some workforces without wages to get  experience. They are thinking that  experience is also important along with education. In this essay, I will discuss both advantages and disadvantages. Let's see whether the advantages will overweigh the disadvantages.",
        "On the one side, Students will get work experience through Internships. Internships will provide training related to education which gives empirical knowledge on the student's subjects. Students are trying to get work experience before the completion of their graduation because there are plenty of opportunities for  students with empirical knowledge. For instance, In BTech colleges, students are getting placed based on their internships. And another admirable example is, based on experience workforce is increasing the wages of employees. In this way, In the IT sector, people are getting opportunities based on their work experience.",
        "On the other side, along with ,advantages there are some disadvantages to working in an organization during their education. Firstly, It is better to get work experience but without ,wages there will be some impact due to financial problems. Secondly, students will think about their work and neglect their studies which will lead to less scores in their education. Without a proper percentage in ,graduation there will be no use in having experience in the work.",
        "To sum up, In my view, the advantages will overweight the disadvantages. In this competitive world, it is better to have experience and enjoy the fruitfulness of the opportunities provided by the workforce. And students should take care of their education along with their work."
