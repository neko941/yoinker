        "Construction industry has become a booming one and received a great deal of public concern around the world in recent years. Although the outside beauty of a building is an relatively important factor to be considered when designing a new one, a building\u2019s function should still be more highly valued than any other elements.",
        "On the one hand, it is true that exterior appearance plays significant role to a building itself as well as its surrounding area to some extent. First, in an increasingly competitive market these days, a building with good-looking appearance will draw people\u2019s attention and therefore induce them to pay a visit. For example, if a new commercial centre is erected with a structure of full-glass walls that displays a variety of merchandises inside, people will have tendency to come over to make a purchase, thereby gain more profit for the owner. Second, the outside look of a building also makes great contribution to the scenery of its surrounding,  especially in metropolises. For instance, unique structures in Italy act as an incentive for stunning landscape of the inner city, thereby attracting millions of people flock to for tourism annually and benefiting the overall economy of this country",
        "On the other hand, the planned use of a building is still regarded as a key factor to consider when it being constructed. First, since the chief purpose of erecting a building is to facilitate humans\u2019 needs, its function should be prioritized in order to accommodate people\u2019s demands. For example, so as to improve the standard of living of city dwellers, a number of run-down areas in the urbans were demolished to make way for new high-rise apartments which are better to live in, even when those buildings are not designed in a magnificent appearance. In addition, many buildings such as well-known churches or museums had an unusual looking structure due to their special functions. These designs could not be judged in terms of appearance because function is crucial, much more significant than any other factors.",
        "In conclusion, it is reasonable that the use of a building should be taken priority to its outward appearance. I recommend that the significance of function to a building will be increased in the future."
