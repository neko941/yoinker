        "Instead of spending money on roadways, authorities have to spend it on railway system.  I totally agree with this opinion because railway system is budgeted option than roadways and inbuilt l WC and refreshment system makes it more convenient for all age group of people.",
        "The main reason why I believe that government should invest in railway system than roadways is because railways are inexpensive, therefore, moving round the nation with limited budget makes highly possible for poor and middleclass traveler. To illustrate, my husband and I had traveled Mumbai to Chandigarh for our honeymoon by train, saving on traveling had helped us to spend more on food, accommodation and shopping, as we had very limited budget.",
        "Another reason why I support the notion, that built-in WC and refreshment system allows more comfort for all age group of people. For example families with youngsters as well as elders can easily travel by train as it makes more convenient for them to use inbuilt WC and refreshment system whenever required without waiting for vehicle to stop at appropriate place. Additionally, it saves time and one can reach the destination faster. Whereas, roadway travelers have to stop for fuel, food and toilets and it consumes more time hence takes longer to reach the final destination. Also, roadways have few other disadvantages for reaching late to the finishing line, like traffic conjunction, bumpy and clumsy roads.",
        "In conclusion, I completely agree that authorities ought to invest more in railway system instead of roadways. This is because railways are comparatively reasonable than roads and much more convenient for all age group of people. Given this situation, it seems that government should keep aside some extra fund to invest in railways."
