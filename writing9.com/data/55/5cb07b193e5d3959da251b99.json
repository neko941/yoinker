        "Since old times, big mass of society has been in a rat race of looking fitter and younger than they actualy are. This essay will explore reasons for this obsession and explain why we should welcome this trend.",
        "Of all various reasons which made people to do the things that make them look younger, one is youth obsessed mindset in society. The reason for this is that physical appearance is so crucial that it decides people\u2019s social status; therefore, to make themselves presentable and convivial, they try to look younger. A/The second factor is that they do not want to get old. So, they hide the signs of aging to feel as young as a teenager. For instance, many people often visit gymnasium to overcome ageing effects and feel young.",
        "In my view, this trend has positive ramifications on society as well as on economy. Firstly, as explain above, these folk take better care of themselve by visiting gymnasium, doing yoga and eating healthy food, which help them to prevent efftects of ageing. As a result, overall healthiness of this class of people improves, which is good sign for society as a whole. Secondly, these people often buy cosmetics items like dye and anti-ageing cream to diminish effects of  age on their body. This consumerism helps to strengthen the economy of the country, thus it should be welcome.",
        "In conclusion, two of the major factors that influence the drive for fighting against ageing are forever beautiful mentality of society and self desire for everlasting youth. To my mind, this trend has advantages like increase in healthier population and impetus to cosmetics industry."
