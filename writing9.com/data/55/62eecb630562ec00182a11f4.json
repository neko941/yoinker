        "There are different kinds of public transportation in the world. They have important rules at transporting  people in the cities. On the other hand, they have some disadvantages, too. We talk about both of them in this essay.",
        "The decrease in traffic is one of the main advantages of public transportation. As we know, a lot of people use  public transportation instead of their personal cars, especially in the big cities. So, fewer cars come to the streets. As well, this happening leads to other profits. For example, when the number of cars decreases, we will have less fuel consumption and following it, less air pollution. The management of time is the other advantage of it. The vehicles of public transportation often have their specific ways. For example, the subways have rails and they are under the streets, usually. Or the buses have their own lain. they aren't in traffic most of the time. Thus, they arrive at their stations at a certain time. For all of these reasons,  people can manage their time better than when they are with their cars.",
        "At first, crowding is a disadvantage of public transportation. So many people prefer going to work or anywhere else, whit public transportation because of their advantages. Hence, they become busy and there aren't enough seats to sit on. The latter problem is the lack of enough facilities for use of all people. There are many stairs in some the public vehicle stations. For this, it's hard for old and disabled people to use public transportation.",
        "In summary, there are some problems besides the advantages of public transportation. the profits of it are reduction of traffic and better time control. On the other hand, overcrowding and the absence of enough facilities are disadvantages."
