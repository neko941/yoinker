        "In recent years, environmental pollution has become one of the most severe problems that the human race has to face due to the hazardous impacts that this phenomenon can have on people, society as well as the ecosystem. A mass array of elements relating to industrial manufacture and deforestation are believed to be the prominient reasons of the increasingly issue of environmental contamination. Therefore, in order to successfully address this predicament, it is necessary for the government, industrial firms and individuals to put in a large amount of effort.",
        "To commence, one of the predominant factors of pollution is the tremendous amount of industrial waste discharged into the environment by factories. One good illustration of this is the hazardous effects that industrial effluents can have on bodies of water such as lake, river or the ocean. This is due to the fact these aforementioned effluents have not gone through proper treatment, meaning they still remain incredibly toxic, which can result in the contamination of water and the demise of many aquatic lives. In addition, it appears environmental damage can also attributed to deforestation. To be more specific, the act of removing forrests and jungles in order to make rooms for agriculture and infrastructure can be detrimental to a myriad of fauna and flauna species, as a result of their habitats being wiped out. This may lead  to an imbalance in the ecosystem as a whole.",
        "Therefore, the authority, industrial firms as well as individuals should take appropriate measures in order to tackle this predicament. First of all, the government should promulgate decrees that prohibit contaminated material being dumped into the environment and encourage manufactories to find an alternative in disposing their waste, which can greatly alleviate the amount of contaminants released. Furthermore, policymakers should enact laws that force manufactories to thoroughly treat their waste before discharching them. While the impacts might be smaller in comparison to the aforementioned remedies, each individuals can help to ameliorate the situation by performing simple daily activities, for instance, recycling plastic bottles or planting more trees around neighbourhoods.",
        "In conclusion, it is evidenced that aspects associating with industrial manufacture and deforestation can be detrimental to the environment. As a consequence, it would be advisable for the authority, corporations as well as the citizens to conduct practical measure in order to improve this situation."
