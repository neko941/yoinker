        "Recently, crime has been increasing out of control. Some hold the idea that in order to deter crimes, criminals should be given proper education while in prison. Personally, I partly share the same view with this.",
        "It is my belief that nurture, not nature, is responsible for malignant and antisocial behaviours. That is to say, everybody is born with good personalities and what turns some into criminals is parental neglect and lack of education. Many studies have shown that children who are not supervised by their parents on a regular basis are many times more likely to go off the rails, commit acts of selfishness or to behave aggressively against others. This rationalizes why I think a good number of prisoners after being released will not repeat their offences if they are given education.",
        "In addition, while being in jail, inmates have plenty of time which can be misspent. For example, some of them spend their time on gambling with their cellmates or accessing materials with objectionable contents. Thus, giving them the opportunity to be educated translates to the reduction of time which can be potentially frittered away or used for malicious purposes.",
        "Nevertheless, there are objections to this perspective. Those who oppose claim that the potential program of giving education to criminals can cost a huge amount of money from the Government budget. However, considering the result it can deliver in the long run as far as societal stability is concerned, this program is not a waste of taxpayers\u2019 money.",
        "What has been discussed above has effectively corroborated my view that education can reduce participation in criminal activities and inmates should receive education while serving time."
