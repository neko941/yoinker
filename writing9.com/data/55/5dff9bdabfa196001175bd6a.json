        "It is a quiete debatable issue, that when children should be sent to schools in order to start their education process. While it is common for some countries to start to educate pupils from four years old, but I tend to agree with other states' regulations, which allow children to begin their education at seven or eight.",
        "To begin with the positives of starting education at an early ages, it is clear that earlier children start to go to school, earlier they will graduate. As a consequence of this trend, more and more teenagers will may benefit from finishing school at an younger ages than in other countries, whose legal systems for education purposes do not allow pupils to begin to study at four years. For example, if a young person has finished school a couple of years earlier than others do, he or she will have more time to hace a search on a job market or start to earn money for living. As a result, the governments that implied this system would gain a greater benefits than those which did not.",
        "In contrast, the approach of forcing children to study at younger ages might cause severe health problems for them. This is because, when pupils' brains are not capable to manage a bulk load of information, they will may be demotivated and depressed. In a consequence, this may have weaken their immune systems, which will may become extremely vulnerable for diseases. Unlike with states' regulations which allow students to start their education process at younger ages, children who do begin to go to school later will be prepared better for great data load, and they will probably outcome these difficulties with less effort. As a result, their healt system will have not been damaged because of this issue, and I believe that children's healthiness are much more important than benefits for governments, which may become to receieve benefits from teenagers who are able to work at an earlier ages.",
        "In conclusion, although permitting children to go to schools earlier could bring some benefits for governments in terms of increased labour force, but I will give my preference to protection of children's health rather than governments' budgets, as starting to study at an four years may have detrimental effects on pupils' health."
