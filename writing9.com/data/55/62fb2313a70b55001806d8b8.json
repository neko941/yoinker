        "It is observed that the number of people who depends on their own cars as the main transportation is significantly increasing. There are some problems that can be caused by this phenomenon, but there are also some solutions to tackle the issue.",
        "such phenomenon results in many problems. the first problem would be the environmental issues. The more private cars are used, the more air pollution can be caused. For example, every transportation releases carbon dioxide when they are moved, and it causes the air pollution. Moreover, if people choose not public transportations but their own cars, the number of cars which moved has increase. Therefore, the more CO2 would be released by it. The second one is traffic jam. the number of the private cars which are used is too much compared with the limited road and in the end, it causes traffic jam.",
        "Nevertheless, there some keys which can solve it. The first solution is that encouraging people to use the public transportations. It reduces not only air pollution but also traffic jam, rising the independence on private one. The second key is that encouraging people to use the electric cars, which utilize electricity for the fuel. It makes air pollution be reduced, reducing release of CO2. The last key is that widening the road. It decreases the traffic jam as increasing the amount of treating transportations.",
        "In conclusion, although relying on their private cars makes lots of problem, it can be solved by doing such things mentioned above. Thus, people should be encouraged to do such things."
