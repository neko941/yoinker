        "My name is John Smith, a resident of A street from fifteen years. I am writing this to express my concern towards the news that I heard from the A street council about selling the Japanese park to DLF builders.",
        "My family shifted here because of the cleanliness, silence, greenery and the proximity to the main city. My children go to the park every evening to play and people use this particularly in the morning to jog. We already just have 2 parks in our surroundings and converting this amenity to build new dwellings is concerning all the residents.",
        "Nobody in the colony has been informed or consulted in this decision to be made. And we heard that this land has been reasoned residential. We have petitioned this council, and I hope this letter reaches a wider public.",
        "Our website, SaveJapaneseParkCom lists a number of protest activities in which we hope your readers may join us. Too few green and tranquil public spaces remain in this overdeveloped city. Save Japanese Park before it is too late.",
