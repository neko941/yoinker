        "Environmental problems, for instance, water, air and sound pollution are giving government great pressure as it deteriorates the people\u2019s health and decrease the country\u2019s reputation in the world. It is considered by some that governments should raise the price of fuel for transport to eliminate the environmental problems. In my opinion, I disagree that rise in cost of fuel is an effective solution. However, I believe that there are other better and long term solution such as using renewable energy and improving public transportation.",
        "Raising the fuel price will only be a short term solution because people will continue the use of transportation as there are no other viable options to run the vehicles. In fact, people will eventually accept the high fuel price for their own convenience to travel everywhere they wish with their own car. Besides, due to increase in petrol price, the transportation costs increase causing price of goods to rise, creating a detrimental domino effect in economy and increase the people\u2019s burden. For example, shipping fee for online shopping which is free before, now is charged due to higher transportation cost.",
        "On the other hand, I believe that a more effective long term solution is using the more sustainable energy such as solar energy, hydropower and wind energy to run both private and public transport which emission of harmful gases, for example, carbon monoxide and sulphur dioxide which contributes to deteriorating of air pollution. Furthermore, vehicles using renewable energy often engines produce lesser noise which can enhance the sound pollution. Government should take actions in improving public transport to engage people to use as well as older transports usually are not eco-friendly.",
        "In conclusion, increasing the price of fuel is not the best way to resolve the environmental pollutions. Thus, I believe that use of the sustainable energy and new, high quality public transport can significantly improve the environmental problems."
