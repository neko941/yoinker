        "Genetics is known to be the original makeup of all human beings from existence. It is argued that this is responsible for the different personalities of all individuals, hence  a person's character cannot be changed neither can it be altered. This essay will argue otherwise, as personas can be developed and also be learned.",
        "Firstly, personalities and individual behavior can be developed. people who believe that one's  attitude is as a result of their genes, accept such because according to science genes are usually passed down from generations to generations and as a result, whatever character a child  displays is most likely to be traced to the family. Despite  this,  characters can be imbibed. For Example, if a child is been trained in a certain way of life. from his or her early stage of life, the child is likely to develop such attitude into an adult. This indicates that genes are not a factor of a person's nature.",
        "Secondly, the way a person act can be learned. For example, my friend has become very cautious since she came back for South Korea after her post graduate degree. She revealed that in South Korea, courtesy is important to their culture and as a result, she learned to be very warm to  people around her. This in fact  debunks the concept of genes being responsible for people's attitude.",
        "In summary, despite the fact that genes can be passed through time, a person's composition is more associated with what he or she has developed and learnt over the years."
