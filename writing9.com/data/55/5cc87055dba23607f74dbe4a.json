        "Nowadays, some countries offer a free-of-charge healthcare service. Although some expensive modern treatments will not be covered, I believe that every country should provide free medical services.",
        "The main reason why countries should offer free health services is the financial factor. This is because not all people can afford treatments in hospitals. For example, a recent survey, conducted by a team of German statisticians, has revealed that one in every twenty people in Africa cannot pay for the medical services provided by the government; since the salaries are not in a balance with the cost of living. Thus, the governmental authorities should financially cover not only the medical treatments, but also the visits of diagnostic purposes.",
        "In addition, the high-end modern cures are only necessary in the minority of medical cases. Furthermore, most people go to hospitals for minor treatments, which do not require complex equipment, nor expensive treatments. To illustrate, a poll, made in 2016 in Cairo, showed that approximately eighty percent of patients visit public hospitals for check-ups, in which no special devices are needed. Therefore, making the medical system free of charge does not affect the financial stability of the country, nor create a burden on the governmental funds.",
        "In conclusion, due to the fact that not everyone can afford medical treatment, and free-of-charge health system does not create a negative impact on the country's finance, I strongly agree that every country should offer free medical services."
