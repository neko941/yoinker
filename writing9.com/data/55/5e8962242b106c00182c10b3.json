        "In several nations, children are being able to do some sort of remunerate job. Although certain demograpichs of society consider this as unfair, others believe that this is a great oportunity for learning about responsibility. From my point of view, kids should not run any kind of work, because their main duty ought to be the school.\r\rSome people think that is important for children know the value of things, hence a good way to learn about this is across of the job. The possibility of teenagers get their own money, it would help to understand the parents\u2019 effort. Besides, in some families the father\u2019s salary does not reach to bought basics needed, therefore, it is fundamental that their sons obtain a remunerate activity, although they be under-age. \r\rOn the other hand, the majority of people consider that child labor is an activity that does not happen, for the reason that adolescents have rights that are defended for international organisms. Also, a younger should do things that belong to persons of their age such as studying, playing and socialize. If they would start to job, likely they would be living an adult\u2019s life, hence this could affect them psychologically. For instance, in Thailand is typical to see under-age working, however the works for them, overall, include prostitution or drugs, so this does not the better options.\r\rIn conclusion, the child labor likely always will exist, because this topic has split opinions about the negative or positive. In my opinion, I disagree with younger working, due to while this has an economics benefit, with long term this will be negative for the mind of child, because will be living a adult life."
