        "In this contemporary era, technology has increased at an alarming rate . A number of new technologies have changed the way of style children spend their speare time. In my prespective, it had merits outweigh the demerits.",
        "On the one hand, there are some merits of new technologies such as mobile phones, computer, laptop etc. The first and formost is that new technology play an essential role in every children\u2019s life.

For example, a survey was taken by The time of USA newspaper , in America 2018, was that 87% of the youngster were spend their quality time with different kind of technologies things.",
        "One the other hand, there are few demerits of new technology . Firstly, it gives a negative impact on children health and body. A numerous children spend their long hours on technologies gadgets such as , computer and video games. which gives a side effect on their body like, eye side week, back and body pain and headache . Secondly , it also gives a bad effect on their study and behavior. Most of the children waste their full time on using it and they do not concentrate on their study. Moreover , they like to live alone in their room and they do not spend a spare time with family. Due to this, they have some changes in their nature, they become depresse, aggressive and irritate . For example, a survey was taken by The time of New York newspaper, in 2019 was that new technologies have decreased 87% to more 74% in past 6 years.",
        "In conclusion , I want to reiterate my words that new technologies are more beneficial for research, study, gain information and entertainment , but it is also gives a negative effect on children\u2019s life."
