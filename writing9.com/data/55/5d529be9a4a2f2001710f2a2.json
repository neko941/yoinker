        "Confidential matters, of some individuals, are being transmitted these days by some means of mass communication. Although this essay will firstly discuss the views of the section of the society that favours the above trend, it will also further elucidate the reasons of why I stand with the other demographics, who presume that there should be a proper check to put a halt to such activities.",
        "Admittedly, the connection between the celebrities and media is symbiotic, as both depend upon each other for existence. As some famous personalities can use media to fuel their growth, so it is fair enough for the vice versa to happen. Moreover, by watching disasters happening in someone\u2019s personal life, others might get aware about the repercussions of certain wrong steps and can avoid taking these.  This will lead to less unsuccessful decisions for the viewers.",
        "On the other hand, demeaning anyone is unethical. Everyone has flaws; this trend must be condemned. Imagine a group of photographers or camera-men chasing an individual everywhere 24/7, would he feel safe? This immense power with some corrupt channels can be misused, for instance, for providing undue benefits a political organization by continuously sharing negative personal issues of opposition leaders.",
        "Further to support my view, if the lavish lifestyles are over shown by the media, normal people may suffer from inferiority complex. People try to imitate the dressing, eating and celebration style of rich people, which may result negatively for their own future. To exemplify the same, a survey, by Fashions magazine, revealed that 50% of the recent female models were suffering from malnutrition in the pursuit of having zero-figure. Media\u2019s extra coverage on the excessive dieting of winners of last year\u2019s beauty contest is found as a prime reason behind the same.",
        "In conclusion, while people vary in their opinions, I strongly condemn the view that media should be allowed to enjoy authority to share details on anyone\u2019s private life because not only it is immoral, but also occasionally leads to misinformation leading to adverse effects on common people\u2019s life."
