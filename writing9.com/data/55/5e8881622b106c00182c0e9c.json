        "The line graphs depict the trends of how much a petrol, eatables and good are produced by one nation and transmitted to the other nation between the period 2000 and 2005.",
        "Overall, it can be clearly vivid that the total value of fuel falls in the year 2002 as compared the previous span, but after the year 2002 the entire value of fuel increased rapidly over the period. Meanwhile, the worth of fuel has fallen slightly. Whereas, the export of food has fluctuated considerably.",
        "In the year 2000, the total value of petrol exported to other nations was 3, 00,000 and it is falling slightly from 50,000 in the year 2002 but after year 2002 the value of total exports of fuel rise dramatically and reached to the nearly value of 4, 50,000 in the final year. On the other hand, there was a decline of fuel in every year starting from nearly 50,000 in the year 2000 to 30,000 in 2002 and slowly it is felled down to 20,000 in 2005.",
        "Coming to the meal exported, there is a variation in the value of food exported every year compared to the petrol exports. In 2000, roughly fifteen million food are exported and in 2001 and 2002 it is increased by ten thousand while in 2003 it was decreased to 20000 million and from 2003 the value of eatables exported increased slightly. Similarly, also value of goods produced is going under fluctuation compared to the food and less value of the good is exported over the period contrast to crude oil and food. In the period 2000, 2004 and 2005 roughly only 3000 goods were exported and from 2001 to 2003 there is slightly fluctuation."
