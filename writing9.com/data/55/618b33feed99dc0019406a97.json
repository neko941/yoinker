        "At present, the old houses remain unaffected, but the green area to the northwest is all gone to make room for a new high road, with surround by a new house and connected to the main street. a dame is constructed on the north side of the river. The shop is replaced by an enormous supermarket. Similarly, where the farm stood there is a petrol station and a cafe\u2019 nearby. However, the main facilities of the town remain unchanged."
