        "There is a common belief that affluent countries should help poor ones that are suffering from natural disasters. I agree with this viewpoint because these problems disable some countries to provide its inhabitants with even basic amenities and rich nations know and can help them properly.",
        "In the majority of cases, countries are not likely to accommodate people living there and cater enough food during disasters, such as earthquakes, hurricanes and floods as long as they are impoverished. These types of calamities result in disastrous damages that require a huge amount of money, making it almost impossible to fix them for a poor nation. Not only should the international organisations, like the UN, endeavour to help them, but also developed countries can and should assist them during a period of recovery by contributing money.",
        "Wealthy nations tend to succeed in helping people who live in poor countries damaged by disasters. Developed countries have dramatically stimulated almost all fields, including healthcare, and so they can treat injured people appropriately. Moreover, they can afford to provide many people with enough food and build suitable places to live for some time. Some affluent states have undergone disasters many times and thus know how to fix problems efficiently. The USA, for instance, which is considered as the tornado alley since tornados are too frequent there, is implementing various methods to prevent devastating effects, and some of them have worked very well even in other poorer countries.",
        "In conclusion, during a period of natural disasters, rich states should help developing nations as they have enormous potential to do so and can take the most suitable measures to treat people."
