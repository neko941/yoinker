        "Nowadays youngters are choosing sports persons as their idols, so the majority of the people belive that they have greater resposibility in carrying  good mentorship all the time for young children. However, I completely agree with this statement as it helps in building childs' future in a positive way.",
        "Firstly, atheletes with a positive image can inspire many children in developing a career. As the majority of children follow their hero's in various social medias and not only that they, always try to mock their idol's. In this way they can build their career in the foot steps of their role models. For example, we all are aware that the currect sports person's like Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma, Yuvraj singh, etc are big fan of Sachin Tendulkar, inspired by him they became professional crickters and living a luxurious life.",
        "Furthermore, sports person can help children not only professionally but also personally. In other words guiding children to do good things and teach them benifts that comes from  doing good. For instance they can ask their young fans to plant trees and explain the benefits that comes from plating trees like fresh oxygen, fruits coming from the tree etc. In this way they can help the teens to become responsible citizens.",
        "In conclusion, role models play a crusial role in youngsters life both professionally and personally  so it their responsibility to maintain good reputation all the time."
