        "Critics of this trend suggest that  people without acepting risks do not have any opportunity to make progress in their careers. This argument rests on the fact that the rate of the productivity and creativity are decreaing in some well known compoines due to the fact that emlpoyees are content with their position in society. As well as , Most of the young  generations have faced problems in their personal relationship.they do not have a tendency to recognize people and establish relationship with peers because of lack of accpeting risks .The result of this is that vast majority of adults are faced with psychological probles such as deprresion , anxiety .",
