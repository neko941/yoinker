        "Watching movies is an entertainment for a lot of people. However, it has always been controversial that if it is necessary to do it in theaters. Some people believe it is more entertaining than watching the films at home. As far as I am concerned, I opine that there is no need to see movies in the cinemas. In the essay, I am going to discuss these two viewpoints and my opinions.",
        "Decades ago, going to theatres was a recreation for people at that time. Without the internet, it seemed to be a good way to expand horizons or see popular idols. Also, the speakers and projector made the films even more exciting and stimulating. However, with the technology improved, the benefits of going to the cinemas can also be gotten at home. Thanks to the internet and online platforms such as Netflix and Disney plus, people can always search for movies and watch them anytime and anywhere. It is no longer necessary for the audience goes to the theatres for appreciating the films. Moreover, due to the development of applications, such as notebooks, stereo speakers and high-resolution screens, people are able to enjoy movies at home without reducing any joy nowadays.",
        "Furthermore, during the period of the pandemic, it has become a better choice to watch movies at home. In addition, people can have more privacy and freedom when being in their own spaces. That can not only reduce the risks of getting Covid-19 but also makes it more comfortable. Take me ,for example, I really don't like sitting beside kids in the theatre because they often can not stop chatting or giggling which always irritates and anxieties me. Without interference, I can really enjoy this entertainment comfortably.",
        "All in all, it is more convenient, and comfortable and lower risk of getting ill to watch movies at home. Hence, going to the theatres is no longer necessary for people to appreciate the films."
