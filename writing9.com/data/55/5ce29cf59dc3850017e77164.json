        "Most of the people's argue that anti-social behaviour  is increasing day by day and people become disrespectful to others. The primary cause of this phenomenon is the structure of family and internet. the most viable solution is to educate their young about this issue.",
        "Many people are living in loneliness and bow families are not nuclear.becouse of too much pressure of work  parents do not have enough time to check their children activities or talk to them. So, youngsters and teenage spend their most of the time on internet and social media  they don't have any real communication.they talk rarely to others they only messaging. Furthermore, In their loneliness, they start consuming drugs and alcohol which contribute anti-social behaviour. Even, if someone tries to advise them then show very less respect towards them. For example, A local survey carried out by welfare society reveals that 96% working parents feel that their kids are having anti social behaviour habits.",
        "A long term solution to this predicament is to educate younger about the dangers of overusing the internet, less interacting with others and consuming more drugs. Moreover, children in schools could be taught how to behave politely with others as well as parents should spare some time with their children and talk to them share with them there experiences and tell them about right and wrong . For instance, school children in Germany are taught about the consequences of Bad behaviour and overusing of the internet which results kids start sitting in groups and there is a notable increase in behaviour politeness.",
        "To conclude, people start behaving in Bad manners due to lack of basic upbring .so,the children must be taught that good behaviour and respect for others is the only key to live better life."
