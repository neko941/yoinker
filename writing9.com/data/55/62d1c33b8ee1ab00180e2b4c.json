        "It is irrefutable that technology has an indespendible part in people's life. There are those who believe that education ought to be online, traditional teaching way become redundant because of technolodical advancements which offer an online training. I am of the opinion that, even though the online training has a variety of advantages it is not substitute for face-to-face education mainly because traditional education offers social environment and it is necessery for practical teaching.",
        "Firstly,\u00a0many students perceive a college or university to be a social environment which motivates them mostly. Students have a chance to sociliase in social facilities like library, sports center, and canteen in their break time. Taking into account that the online training includes just sitting on the screen instead of interaction, it will be likely to less preferable for students . Regarding to tutor, to dominate the class and include them to lesson are much more easier than online education in which students can easily turn their cameras off.",
        "It is appears to me, a practical teaching cannot be maintained online. For instance, a chemistry entails a lot of equipments, substances and appropriate place for carrying out an experiment. Such lessons should teach face-to-face to reach a success. Not only the chemistry but also a sports demands interactive education. Hence, online education cannot replace with face-to-face training in such lessons.",
        "In conclusion, some people claims that education should be maintained based on online rather than traditional way. I think, online education has some drawbacks to displace of face-to-face education which are explained in this essay. As a recommendation, online training can be applied as a support for subjects that people would like to improve themselves."
