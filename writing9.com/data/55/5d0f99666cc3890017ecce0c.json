        "In this technological era, it is widely believed that Science and technology should only be options to study for the youngsters. However, other people advocate that students should choose their field as they live. This essay will discuss both the views in detail.",
        "Every individual is free to do whatever he feels, as long as it is allowed by the constitution of the country. This justifies that young adults should have freedom to choose the stream of study as per their passion. If a person follows his passion, then the chances of his success is much more than studying a field which is forced upon him. For example, a student of business mind will prove to be good businessmen but if he is forced to follow other fields them he might flunk.",
        "On the contrary, if all students are made to study scientific and technological subjects then it would create for scientist and technical experts. However, many of them would be heaving a lot of superficial knowledge. This would lead to more quantity rather than quality. There would be jobs available but dearth of high potential candidates. For example, teenagers who are forced to study science will memorize the concepts rather than understanding it. Thus, freedom to choose their line of study is important in making one\u2019s career.",
        "To sum up, young minds should be allowed to study whatever inclination they have and should not be enforced with decisions regarding their academics. I, believe that this freedom would help the students to unleash their true potential"
