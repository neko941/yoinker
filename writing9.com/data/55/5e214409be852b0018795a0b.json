        "Water sources are an indispensable part of every indiviual's life, nobody can sustain without water. nowadays, majority of developing nations are confornting with the problem of declining quality of water. In this essay , cosequences of impure water and measures to overcome this issue will be demonstrated in subsequent paragraphs.",
        "First and foremost, primary reaction of this problem is that it would be hazardous for marine life. Palethora of aquatic creatures are unable to survive under unsafe water resources. As a result life of some oceanic animals is on verge of extinsion. Moreover, contaminated water is equally harmful for human life too due to the lack of pure water, people nned to cope with distict ailments. For Instance, mosquitoes are easily attracted by dirty water which become the biggest cause for illness therefore, diseases like malaria, dengue and food posining is quit common. Even polluted water is also reasponsible for disturbing cultivation of specific region. consequently, this is becoming a major challange for human health because absence of good nutrients will give adverse affect on persons well being.",
        "The most practical solution to this issue is the goverment should sponsor awareness campaigns. An effective advertising could warn people aboung danger of poor water resources and hopefully, it would motivate public to protect their resources from unnatural human activities because, great part of water resources have distroyed by humans only. Industrilisation is taking higher participation to this issue. Significant knowledge of problem would lead many people to take pro-active procautions to keep water resources clean. For example, Indian goverment has established number of sanitation schemes to promote the issues of water regions and people are taking great involvement in these programs this resulted, slight decrease in water effulents in the society.",
        "In conclusion, it is evidently proven that society is awfully influenced by unsafe water parts. Now, it is a high time to take some stringent steps to keep world's water resources to safe. Otherwise it will demolish the future development of earth. Everyone needs to do work as a team to eliminate this issue from society."
