        "Mobile phones, nowadays,contains features with entertainment also. There has been a lorge growth seen in usage hours of smartphones among youngsters.There are several reasons behind this situation and I find this development more beneficial than negative.Both the reasons and my view is elaborated further.",
        "The first reason for overusage of smart devices by youngsters is the social benefit they provide.The smart phone connected with internet opens up the large possibilities.from creating new friends to communicating with them over social media. For instance,a child in my neighborhood chats for hours with his school friends over Facebook (a social media) and also spend time over online video sharing phone application.Moreover,the mobile gaming,specially multiplayer games,is another majoy reason for the situation.Children plays different kind of games over mobile for the entertainment purpose and they involve themselves in games in such a manner,that they forget about the timing and other work to do.",
        "However,I believe that smartphones have also increased the knowledge of pupils.It had developed some important social skills,such as communication skill,team work and many more,by allowing them to work and play in groups, without the restrictions of distance.In addition, children can learn through internet by watching online videos and reading articles,which ultimately helps them in their studies as well as language skills.For example, whenever my niece require to know about something,he searches it over the internet and learns from it.Moreover, multiplayer online gaming improves their multitasking ability and it also gives them a competitive environment.",
        "Overall,I agree that overusage of smartphones on regular basils is harmful for them,but if given proper guidance ,mobile phones can help them in learning some life-long skills."
