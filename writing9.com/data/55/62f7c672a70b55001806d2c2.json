        "The three graphs provide information about  the gender-wise admission in three courses in the U.K during the period from 1980 to 2010.",

        "In terms of the male admissions, although the number in business studies doubled, it became the least preferred subject by end of the period despite being the most favourite subject in 1980, with enrollment above 200 thousand. Whereas science and arts had witnessed a significant growth though out the period, and by the end of the period, arts became the second most popular subject after science, with a figure of 600 thousand which was slightly lower than science by 100 thousand.",
        "In the case of female students, a different trend was observed, and by far the biggest growth was in this stream. More number of girls opted for this field compared to boys in 2010, even though in 1980, the ratio opposite. The number of students in Arts increased by only 100 thousand despite being the favourite subject in 1980, while business continued to be the least preferred subject throughout the period, with an increase of 200 thousand."
