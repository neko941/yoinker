        "Nowadays, tourism is becoming a vital aspect of life. And, countries tend to bring as much as tourists as possible to enhance their economy and culture. And there are so many spots on earth that tourists increasingly visit, in spite of the harsh conditions of those places. This essay will be addressing the pros and cons for those places to the tourists to visit.",
        "There are so many advantages for tourists to visit the attractive places which are in difficult conditions. And, a reason for that is those places are mostly very beautiful and tempting. Also, those places are too rare on the planet and are not easily accessible. Furthermore, those places are often quiet and peaceful, especially for the tourists who seek for clearing their minds and releasing the stress. So those are very valuable privileges for tourists to have from visiting such spots.",
        "And with all of the mentioned advantages, there are some drawbacks for tourists to visit the places where conditions are hard. First, the majority of those places are very remote areas. And that means it is too difficult to get the essential needs, such as comfortable resident, fresh food, and basic groceries. In addition, there are too few people in those areas which would expose tourists to the danger of potential criminal acts. Another reason is that in many cases, the weather is either too hot or too cold which makes it too difficult for the tourists to move around smoothly and enjoy the views, not to mention the rough geographical conditions too in those areas. Unfortunately, these disadvantages are capable to sabotage the pleasure of some tourists who would not expect all of the dark side of visiting those areas.",
        "Eventually, with all of the mentioned advantages, there is a price that tourists have to pay in order for them to enjoy their visits. And, in my opinion, I think it really worth the burden to enjoy all of those tremendous places that the Mother Nature has."
