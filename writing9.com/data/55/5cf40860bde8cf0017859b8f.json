        "Ageing is a natural process, which all human being pass through. Taking help of caregivers has become common nowadays. People use their services in order to take care of their family members and relatives.   To hire a professional to take care of older adults, and shelter homes for them should be considered as a positive development.",
        "Hiring professionals for older adults is becoming necessary in the recent century. At this age, most people suffer from different kinds of social and medical issues, like loneliness, depression, guilt, overthinking and other kinds of medical problems like diabetes, BP, heart problems and neurological issues. They think in such type of satuations; mild negligence can lead to a bigger problem. For example, for the paralysed patient in developing countries, it is impossible for a family member to give them proper care and attention. They always need some professional to provide them with appropriate care. In, old age houses, all facilities are available, an adequate diet with care and substance to keep them busy.",
        "But there are mild adverse effects which can not be overlooked. In this age, older people want love, care and attention from their families. They can not trust anyone else. They want to share their experiences, memories with their people and if the family is unable to give them enough time they may suffer from more anxiety. In 2007, a research published by Asian times showed that the recovery rate among older people who are fully supported was higher, than people living in nursing homes.",
        "In conclusion, I firmly believe that positive effects are more than adverse effects. We are living in the 21st century, and all of us are dealing with our problems. So, in this busy schedule, proper care, time and attention cannot be given to them."
