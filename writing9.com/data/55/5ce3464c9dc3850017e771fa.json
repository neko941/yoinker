        "People hold different views on whether the main function of films is to do what. While some argue for entertainment, some are of the opinion that educational value should be the only purpose of films. I am inclined to agree with the latter opinion.",
        "On the one hand, many people watch films only in order to be entertained.  In fact, some audience watch movies so that they can reduce stress and relieve depression after a busy day. Besides, by concentrating on films, they may temporarily forget difficult troubles in their lives. This requires filmmakers have to be creativitive to make attractive films. The result is that they need to time to build scenario, make vivid pictures and sounds.",
        "On the other hand, I am inclined to believe that the only purpose of films is to have educational value. Firstly, historical films provide valuable lessons for people. This may lead to the fact that human can learn from mistakes in the past. Thanks to this, they can give useful solutions to tackle proplems in life. Secondly, scientic movies contain a wide range of knowledge about natural world. By watching this films, people have a tendency to love plants and animals and look for some ways to protect them against extinction. For example, the \u201cAnimal word\u201d series bring viewer a lot of animal knowledge, such as: wildlife, ecosystem, extinct species, habitat and so on.",
        "In conclusion, although it might seem sensible for purpose of films is to entertain, I personally prefer education value is the only function of movies"
