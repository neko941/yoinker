        "Owing to a plethora of immature individuals leaving school and the share of jobless people is soaring on a daily basis, which affects community in various ways. The objective of this essay is to discuss how this tendency can enhance.",
        "On the one hand, I understand that certain measures should be taken by governments in order to improve. First and foremost, in today\u2019s world, a vast majority of young people dropping out from school since they may face challenging regarding finances. To be more specific, these people fundamentally come low income family; therefore, they tend to work so as to gain money. If governments endeavour to assist them financially, this issue can be solved. young people are also convinced that nowadays, the contribution of unemployment is surging on a regular basis. To elaborate, an overwhelming majority of immature people are observed to hardly find descent job, which authorities can also deal with. If government educate adolescences in terms of job opportunities, and authorities ensure with a more chance regarding work, this issue may be tackled.",
        "On the other hand, another convinced argument for the young people is that these issues have numerous detrimental impacts on society. The first point to note is that dropping out from school and increasing of unemployment rate can increase the contribution of crime. For instance, according to the researcher of Baku State University, students who leave school without acquire enough discipline and behaviour are certain to commit a crime. Furthermore, unemployment also attributed to increase crime and robbery rate. In other words, because of poverty, people tend to theft so as to gain revenue. \u0130f government provide individuals with descent job, this tendency can be solved.",
        "By way of conclusion, leaving schools and the rate of unemployment being increasing can be enhanced by authorities."
