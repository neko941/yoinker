        "Opinions differ as to whether it is better for students to study in groups or individually. From my perspective, it is impossible to say which is better, since it pretty much depends on the learners\u2019 preferences and characteristics.",
        "One clear advantage of studying alone to busy people is the fact that they have total control over their study schedules. Since each student has different interests, tasks and concerns, their timetables also greatly vary from one another. Studying alone, therefore, enables them to plan a schedule that works best for them. This is particularly advantageous for students who have part-time jobs, or those who have to take care of smaller family members. Studying alone also benefits those who have special needs. Personalised learning gives slower students more time and efforts to be more focused on what they have yet to understand when they are at school.  Faster learners, on the other hand, are able to challenge themselves with, say, trickier maths problems, when they are already done with their daily homework.",
        "However, there are some kinds of learners who are more inclined towards studying in groups. Learners who have good interpersonal skills may find group study more compatible. They find learning most comfortable and effective when talking to people, listening to how they response, and engaging in activities that require teamwork. Also, those who usually procrastinate also reap many benefits from this learning strategy. Since studying in a group requires a certain degree of responsibility, it gives people who are not really self-disciplined motivation and efficiency. Knowing that people around you are also studying may, to a certain extent, reduce personal distraction and boost study effort.",
        "In conclusion, I believe that each learning strategy has its own merits. Whether group study or individual study works better is greatly dependent on students\u2019 learning styles and needs."

Prolged life is,  the e hand, a welcome change for many individuals, yet I believe this is completely not a good idea for old people to ctinue to work due to several reass related to their deteriorated work performance and capability to adapt to new technologies. Breakthroughs in medicine and heightened awareness of nutriti are the two key factors leading to lgevity. For example, nanotechnology, with tiny robots being injected into patients\u2019 body and mending all their damaged organs, are believed to the e of the secrets to obliterate any currently incurable diseases such as cancer. Additially, people nowadays are better aware of the importance of a good diet, and such wise csumpti can ensure good health and csequently extended age. However, extending people\u2019s working age can be a catastrophe to both senior citizens and companies. The majority of people at the age of 65 or over, especially in developing countries, are unable to maintain the same degree of performance as their younger counterparts. This would eventually give rise to many unwanted repercussis that affect the company\u2019s overall profits and the persal life of the aged workers as well. Also, the fast-paced life requires quick adapti and adjustments to new technology, and this is something that the elderly may never be  par with the younger es. It is not an overstatement to say that it is a torture to work in a place where you are both physically and technologically inferior to your younger co-workers. In cclusi, my firm cvicti is that old people should not be involved in work any lger than their designated retirement age now. If the need for workforce is urgent, old people can, to a certain extent, work as csultants or mentors rather than the main labor force. 30 minutes \u2013 323 words \u2013 computer-delivered",
