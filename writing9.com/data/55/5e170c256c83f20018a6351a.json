        "Modern technological inventions such as computers and smartphones are demolishing the need of handwritten documents. Globally, some people opine that with the rise in technical growth, typing softwares installed in laptops and mobile phones should be used rather than manually typed material. Although, such softwares are beneficial for avoiding typographical error, but in my opinion, improving longhand skills is more crucial in order to a child understand the concept of formation of letters.",
        "On one hand, latest technology has introduced new portable and intelligent enough softwares for preparing academic and professional documents. Individuals prefer to use those tools, because they are incorporated with the techniques for checking grammatical errors. For instance, research conducted by IEEE journal has shown 90% less typo grammatical mistakes in digital documents in comparison with the manually typed scripts. Therefore, typing tools in devices such laptops and mobile phones are advantageous for important business and academic writing.",
        "On the flip side, handwriting skills are essential in giving a child basic knowledge about the alphabets. Children can only learn the making of various letters, connection among them and their structure by writing them on sheets with their hands. To illustrate, according to a survey conducted by U.S department of education depicts that the pencil writing abilities are important in learning alphabet\u2019s formation.",
        "To conclude, although the usage of pen and paper is vanishing with the introduction of new typing tools and techniques in professional and academic writing, but in my view, the importance of handwriting capabilities cannot be ignored during child\u2019s early education."
