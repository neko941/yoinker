        "In the era of globalization, people from different countries enable to buy same merchandise. I think it is a positive development because it reduces the incidence of crime in the world, and more time can be allotted to certain merchandise according to the interest of people.",
        "To begin with, when people from all the nationalities and religions enable to purchase same artefacts, crime rate such as theft decreases. People feel a sense of inferiority when they see expensive things with others and as a result, they try to buy it or still it. When they do not have enough money to buy, they include themselves in major crimes such as theft or sometimes murder. On the other hand, since the general population from all over the world have enough money to spend and purchase national and international stuff, they feel a sense of satisfaction and do not even think about crimes. According to the survey of The Sunday Times, the crime rate has been decreased to 60% as people have everything these days that they need.",
        "Furthermore, People buy the same products, so more time can be given to improve certain things in order to improve customer satisfaction. When the majority of the world population show interest in the same products, people do not need to manufacture materials other than those. As they produce the same product over and over, they try to upgrade it to get ease in customers' life. One of the most popular examples is Apple iPhone. almost everybody in the world owns the iPhone, so apple company upgrades phones constantly and launches a new model every year.",
        "In conclusion, the economic revolution is definitely beneficial because it plays a vital role in reducing crime from the world, and due to this, customers are able to get products upgraded with advanced technology."
