        "There are people who believe that we need to accept and adapt with the culture of a nation when we visit there.In my point of view its not mandatory to adapt to any culture as part of our travelling,however, it is good to have an appreciation about every culture. Culture and language are deeply linked to each other, understanding a culture without knowing its language may remain incomplete",
        "Adaptation to civilization whenever we visit is impossible and not mandatory as well,  even though tasting every bit of its uniqueness for example, food, art, and linguistic expressions provide us an overall idea of how it is. Eating traditional food and wearing traditional dress cannot be considered a cultural adaptation. Subsequently partaking in a particular locality's entertainment may make us feel the vibe of unique style of living but adaptation is something more than that. Further more, adaptation is something we carry ahead as part of us in contrast to sharing and partaking.",
        "Language is the womb  and backbone of culture and vice versa. Dialect is learnt from culture, even though culture is defined by speech. First of all, learning a way of living without its language is possible, however it will be partial. For instance, the best source to learn about a society is to know more about its literature. Although , the core theme of  every writing like novels, drama and poems might be the values, conflicts along with other styles of living. In addition, usages of language communicates cultural orientations of each place,  in some speech there are different phrases to address people in different age groups while others keep only gender differences.",
        "In conclusion, while we travel across different countries we may make use of the opportunities to experience its uniqueness rather than adapt with it. Meanwhile, mastering language makes perfection in knowing about culture as well."
