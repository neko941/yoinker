        "It is argued by many that student should be separated by their level of intellectual. Whilst others rejects this suggestion and persists on the idea of unseperated schools. I do believe that all pupils should be taught in the same group that will be discussed in the detail in upcoming paragraphs.",
        "On the one hand, it is thought that separating children could have better consequences. To be precise, if the students being segregated, teachers have more capability to teach subjects in higher levels and this would not make classes monotonous for good students. Moreover, they would learn with better understanding and high level. For instance, a survey was conducted by national news channel and revealed that 90% of intelligent students fetch good marks when they are taught in a separate group of intelligent peers. Ergo, owing to these reasons students who are intelligent should be given a this kind of atmosphere.",
        "On the other hand, pupils of different intellectual level should be taught with the intelligent one's. In other words, they would not only excel in their studies but also would lead to increase their confidence level when they will learn something with them. For example, in China students with all the levels are taught in the same group of intelligence and due to their they do not get demotivated and feel low which is actually a good way of teaching to those students.",
        "In conclusion, although I believe an educational environment for young learners should promote equal opportunity, I honestly think that creating a more liberal environment which enhances the learning capabilities of intectually gifted children will not only benefit individuals careers but future society as a whole."
