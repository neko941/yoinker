        "Charging with entrance tickets in museums has enjoyed increasing popularity in recent years. From my perspective, it has both positive and negative sides in equal measure.",
        "Payment for tickets when tourists go to museums can be deemed disadvantageous for some reasons. The most obvious drawback is that many museums are not enough budgets to survive for long-term period. If museums are not belong to governments or international associations, they will not receive funding from policymakers as well as revenues from travelers in order to pay for upgrade facilities or spend for salary of staffs. This can lead to degradation of facilities or employees leaving museums to look for other jobs bring more benefits. Another pitfall is that entrance passes of gallery can lose a number of visitors, who have demand go to building to understand about historical sites or historical figures though they can not stand for fee of tickets. Instead of complimentary entrance, it helps people of all walks of like to get a chance to explore useful knowledge about culture and history of nation.",
        "Despite these aforementioned disadvantages, some significant advantages of selling tickets to visitors in museums do exist. The most prominent benefit is that gallery will receive a amount of profit in order to upgrade facilities as well as improve better customer services with the aim is attract visitors. If museums offer high product qualities and good services, visitors are ready stand for this expenditure any at costs. That is why famous artists contribute their products in celebrity galleries. Another compelling point is that sense of security to museums at a certain cost. This is because some violence or thief will take advantage this opportunity to enter in take some items, which display in exhibits to show for visitors admiring.",
        "To sum up, my firm conviction is that is detrimental for its tight on budget and loss visitors, but it can be a useful distance and safety for building very  as well."
