        "It is commonly believed that educating children at home is best for children's personal and professional growth. While others argue that children must go to the schools for studies in order to improve their development. In my point of view, Educational institute paves way for children's evolution. This essay will analyze the facts and elucidate my views on the same.",
        "To begin with, A few section of people argues that teaching at the residence is beneficial for children because parents can understand their child's errors and rectify them. To illustrate, Parents can notice their children\u2019s response in person and cope up with them in order to achieve their goals.",
        "On the other hand, Students get personal attention from parents when they start studying at home. This not only leads to dependency on parents but also it reduces the team activities. For example, Students studying at their residence cannot perform team sports like football because they are accustomed to their parents and they do not have partners to play with them.",
        "Moreover, School education encourage team competitions and moral activities along with studies. For instance, Educational institutions conducts team activities to cultivate task completion skills, work division among team members and also to develop innovative ideas. Furthermore, this develops friendly nature among the students.",
        "In conclusion, even though teaching at child's residence has some benefits, Academic education has a significant role in children career as well as individual growth by providing group activities as well as moral exercises. So, education at schools are better for children."
