        "It is true that in the modern age , media shows a considerable amount of violence which can affect negatively the behaviour of persons . Some people believe that  violent content in the media can  increase the level of assault in societies . In my opinion , I totally disagree with this view .",
        "On the one hand , it is evident that that programs that show a high level of violence can affect the attitude of individuals , such as violent movies and video games  because the unconscious part of the persons' mind catches up the negative scene ,  but it is not the major cause of people's aggressive acts , there are other reasons that cause brutality in the community .",
        "On the other hand , parents and families have a significant impact on how can act their children in the future . If they ensure a calm environment that contains much love and peace , their children will be not affected by the violent content in the publishing and can choose only the good shows and programs for their futures . Moreover ,  the individual  decides whether to be violent or not. Their attitude, mood and behaviour play crucial roles in encouraging brutality in  society.",
        "In conclusion , despite that violence in the media can affect sometimes negatively the attitude of individuals , I strongly believe that it remains not the major cause of assault in the community and there are other strong reasons that contribute to this phenomenon ."
