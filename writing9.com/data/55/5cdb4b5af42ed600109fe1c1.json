        "In recent years, supermarkets, now operate almost 24 hours a day in both developed and undeveloped countries. This has resulted in major effects on both individuals as well as, the society as a whole. The major merit to this is, the provision of job opportunities and also, easy assess to items such as, food products and drugs, while, the major demerit to this would be, increase in crime rates in the society.",
        "Availability of job opportunities can be partly attributed to the opening of supermarkets with lengthy work hours. In other words, different complexes being open at night and also during the day strengthens the economy which in turn helps the individuals in the society with jobs. Take for example, the opening of 7/11, which is, a 24 hour store, all around the United States. The first 7/11 stores opened approximately 11 years ago and according to the People\u2019s magazine, a study carried out in 2017, revealed that 7/11 provides about 200-300 thousand jobs yearly across the country. Hence, resulting in a drastic decrease in joblessness across the nation.",
        "The major disadvantage to this would be, increase crime rates across the neighborhood. This has become a persistent issue for members of the society. Take for example, a research, carried out by crime stoppers in the United States, in 2016, suggested that most theft related crimes were more common in the overnight stores with about 5.5% occurring at night and, about 1.2% resulting in the death of either, the store clerk or, the perpetrator(s). Thus, supermarkets opening for lengthy hours may result in increase crime rates in the society.",
        "In conclusion, there are many merits to stores opening for more hours than usual such as job opportunities for members of the society, however, there are also major demerits to this, an example, is increase in crime rates."
