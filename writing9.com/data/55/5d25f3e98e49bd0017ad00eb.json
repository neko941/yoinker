        "Money plays an important role in a person\u2019s life. While many believe that money can be a solution for all the problems in the life, others feel that true happiness can only be found with other means. This essay will discuss both the sides.",
        "In the material world, money can bring superpower to a person\u2019s feet. Having a lot of money can enable the person to buy anything in the world. With god money at service, person can avail better healthcare facilities. In short, money improves standard of living of the person. Moreover, having a lot of money, brings respect in the society. Society usually respect and follows a person with huge money ignoring their background and the way they might have earned money. For example, many criminals become politicians in their later days. People even elect them ignoring their criminal background.",
        "On the other hand, there is a saying that says \u2018money cannot buy everything\u2019. True happiness can be achieved by peace of mind and satisfaction. For example, a person cannot have goodnight sleep if he keeps worrying about earning more and more money greedily. Similarly, sound health and love are also the important factors to achieve true satisfaction in the life. For instance, money can pay for the treatment of the ill health, but cannot save a person or their loved ones from a terminal disease.",
        "In conclusion, although money plays an important role in the person\u2019s life, there are many other factors to achieve true happiness. Therefore a balance of money and other important factors such as peace of mind, self-satisfaction and sound health is essential to achieve a happy life."
