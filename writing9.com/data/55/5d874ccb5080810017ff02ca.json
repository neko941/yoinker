        "These days, the number of endangered species are progressively increasing worldwide, thereby it requires us to increase our efforts to protect them. While it is possible, spending more money can lead to a better outcome, it is likely for money to be more urgent across other sectors. This essay will discuss why protecting endangered animals should be one of the top priorities no matter the cost.",
        "Mans lifestyle changes over the years have led to many animal types to go extinct; therefore, humans have the responsibility in protecting the endangered breeds and maintaining the biodiversity of the world. The survival of the human race is dependent on the existence of many species. For example, it is believed that the extinction of killer bees will ultimately lead to the extinction of human being. For this reason, we must increase our efforts to ensure the survival of endangered species.",
        "Conversely, the need of funds is felt across many sectors, some of which being more urgent than the protection of particular category of animals.  With a growing population, the issue of poverty and hunger is one of the main concerns that affects a wide range of people. More capital could be spent into these urgent matters in order to better the life of the human race. For instance, there are increasing number of projects in Africa in order to supply clean water for them. For these reasons, we must carefully consider how to utilise valuable money.",
        "The protection of animals in danger is in dire need for more funds. More expenditure can ensure a better outcome in terms of survival of these mammals; however, the need for cash will be felt more across other sectors. Ultimately, despite the high cost, the human race has the responsibility in protecting all animal species in the world."
