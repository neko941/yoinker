        "It is commonly known that evaluating both students and employees is beneficial for both the organizations and individuals, where this procedure can upgrade their quality of work. Some poeple tend to associate feedback to critism. Therefore, it is recommended for both schools and companies to spread awarness about this critical subject.",
        "The main reason of why individuals dislike the assessment process is due to the fact that the idea of evaluation is linked to the thought of being tested and judged by others. In other words, certain people fear the idea of getting feedback and assessed by their superiors where they believe that the opposite person will only indicate and points on his faults. For instance, the majority of companies either distribute the annual bonuses or breach contracts based on annual appraisals. Consequently, employee get scare and anxious of the fact that they are not up to the standards where they will fail both themselves and their families.",
        "Thus, one of the main solutions may be that superiors and upper level managers to make sure that individuals acknowledge the benefit of the procedure. To state this solution in other terms, people in high positions, who are responsible about the evalutation should emphasize on the methods that a person should act upon to improve his weak points. Moreover, evaluation should not only be constructed on the negative aspects rather managers should congratulae and point on the positive impact an employee offer to a company. This fact is evidenced by a recent research that showed employees gradually getting promoted and satisfied once they take advantage of the feedback of their appraisals.",
        "In conclusion, evaluation should not be considered a judgement, on the contrary it should be a motivated procedure to help people achieve more by shifting their negative qualities to positive qualifications."
