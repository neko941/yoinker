        "It is undeniable that happiness is key to a good life. While money can make life easier but it cannot guarantee happiness. In this ,essay, I will discuss why it is challenging to define happiness and the possible ways to achieve it.",
        "Happiness is hard to define due to two major factors. Firstly because it is a subjective matter depending on an individual basis, for instance, for some, having social connectedness such as, family or friends, defines their happiness, such as during festive seasons where people prefer to spend their time with their loved ones. On top of that, happiness is very abstract, it can't be measured objectively and there is no one size fits all. While some people crave  material things such as big houses or luxurious cars  to measure their happiness, others prefer having positive emotions such as peacefulness, tranquillity or contentment. So there is no one way to describe happiness.",
        "However, there are simple ways in achieving happiness and one most important thing is having met the basic needs in life such as food, shelter and company because these are important factors to human survival, without it happiness cant be achieved. For instance, in refugees camp where there is a scarcity of essential goods and this makes people suffer. On the other hand, living on one\u2019s own values may help in attaining true happiness because it is a purposeful living that is meaningful, such as accomplishing life goals and having psychological wellbeing.",
        "In conclusion, it is not easy to have one true meaning of happiness as it may vary from one to another. However, one may still achieve it by having their essential needs met and living a meaningful life."
