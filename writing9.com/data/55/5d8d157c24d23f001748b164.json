        "In discussing whether a zoo is a good habitat for wild animals, one should bear in mind the complexity of the issue. Some people think that zoos are a good way to save and protect rare animals, because they provide a secure environment for them to thrive. Others, however believe that zoos are a cruel place due to the fact that it keeps the animals in a small cages and prevent them from traveling freely in their natural ecological system. In my, opinion zoos are a good solution to save rare animals from extinction. In this essay, I will provide reasons and examples to support my opinion.",
        "One argument in favour of my position is that zoos are required to maintain wildlife because their natural habitat is decreasing rapidly as a resut of industrial expansion. For example, the natural area of forest monkeys in South America has dcreased by 20% over the last century. As a result, over 10 different types of species have been extinct. In order to protect the rest of the endangered species, several Brazilian zoos captured monkeys, allowed them to grow in captivity, and then released them in a new and safe location. This example shows that zoos can act as a safe place for wild animals, and can help retrieve wild life back to nature.",
        "Another point supporting my opinion is that zoos can serve as a place where people can learn about wild animals. To illustrate, a Cobra snake, which is fiercely feared by most men avoid confrontation at any cost. This fact was seen by Indian zoologists who observed the animal in captivity. As a result, a state education program was done to educate children how to approach the snake, and this led to a 15% decrease in the incidence of snake bites in the last 5 years. This demonstrates that zoos can be a place where one can learn about wild animals and their behaivor.",
        "To conclude, I maintain that zoos are useful in protecting wildlife and help our society in saving rare animal, as well as ways to approach them."
