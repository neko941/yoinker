        "Many organizations finance sports to promote their products. There is much debate whether or not this is a positive or negative development. This essay will, discuss both these views, followed by a reasoned conclusion.",
        "On the one hand, when a business such as, Nike, invests in the Olympics, they create a very beneficial effect on their audience. This is because, viewers may be inspired by their items of clothing, shoes or gadgets. In turn, they may be encouraged to participate in physical activity. For example, in the 2014 winter Olympics, Nike dressed the USA skiing participants in their brand new outfits. Consequently, 2000 athletes bought these clothing items. Resulting in a 12% increase in people participating in winter sports. Overall, the media can have a very good influence of people, globally.",
        "On the other hand, despite the many health conscious organizations sponsoring sports, there are also unhealthy organizations. It is also very common for Fast Food joints to use sporting events for advertising their new dishes. In this case, this trend is disadvantageous. The reason being, is that these foods are detrimental to one's health and wellbeing. Therefore, using a healthy event, for instance, the FIFA World Cup, to draw attention to these foods, communicates mixed, conflicted messages about health. Moreover, through these advertisements people graviate towards bad eating options. Undoubtedly, companies may have a negative effect on the mass'.",
        "In concusion, although there are many benefirs to the use of sporting events to advertise products, they are not without drawbacks. However, I firmly believe that the advantages of this outweigh the disadvatanges."
