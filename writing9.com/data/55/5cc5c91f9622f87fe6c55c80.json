        "In our industrialised era, growing rubbish and waste management have becoming pressing issues in today\u2019s society. The reasons for such a situation and the measures that can be introduced by the government to eradicate this menace are discussed in forthcoming paragraphs.",
        "To embark upon, there are plenty of reasons for more and more garbage pilling up these days. First and foremost is the staggering overpopulation which is a major culprit in producing a greater amount of domestic waste in the form of plastics and things of like nature. Secondly, a larger number of industries are being set up which further aggravates the problem in the form of industrial waste which, in turn, pollutes air as well as rivers. Lastly, the purchasing habits of people have changed and they tend to create more waste by buying unnecessary things and throwing them later on.",
        "To counter this, the government must encourage the citizens to adapt recycling practices. For instance, rather than purchasing new items every time, people must be emboldened to use refurbished goods instead, which will decrease the waste production to a larger extent. Moreover, the use of biodegradable items and other such things must be supported and non biodegradable products such as plastic bags must be substituted by more environment friendly alternatives like jute bags. Further, the individuals must be educated about the potential plans to combat the ongoing issue of increasing amount of junk through mass media and advertisements.",
        "To conclude, albeit ballooning of garbage is an alarming issue, the solution of which can, however, be achieved through proper and systematic planning by the government and through cooperation by the people as well."
