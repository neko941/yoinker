        "Newly constructed residential buildings are required in several areas however,there is availability of land mainly in the rural area. It is thought by some people that it is better to preserve the country area rather than use it to  erect houses for people to live in. In my opinion, I disagree that remotely populated districts should be conserved as this will lead to high cost of accommodation and pollution in existing cities.",
        "Firstly, protecting the environment in rural areas by not allowing developers and private individuals to build there will lead to high cost of residential apartments  in the metropolis. This is because  as the population of people living in the society increases daily, conservation of the hinterland will lead to increased cost of housing .For instance,in 2010, 60% of the  people living in Ekiti State, were unable to pay their rent because it increased  astronomically, due to the  decision of the Ministry of Lands and Housing to whom placed an embargo on the sale of land in the outskirts of the state,so as to maintain it.",
        "Another reason to consider is that protecting the countryside  will  increase pollution in the cities .If the countryside environment is preserved, it would cause noise and air pollution in the urban centres. This is because  there will be incessant pollution from human activities such as noise from generators, fumes from cars when it is emanating from a   specific area  which is harmful to health. For example, a study from University College Hospital in Ibadan, showed that air pollution causes lung cancer and other related respiratory  diseases, even though the patients do not smoke cigarettes.",
        "In conclusion, people should be allowed to erect homes in the hinterlands and not protect it , in order to forestall high cost of accommodation and pollution which are detrimental to the health and wellbeing of people in the society."
