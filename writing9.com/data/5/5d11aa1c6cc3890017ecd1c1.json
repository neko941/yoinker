        "Children are dependent on adults to learn and adopt a lifestyle involving healthy food beahvior. It is often argued that largely, the onus of inculcating a healthy eating habit lies with the parents. However, another side claims that school has obligation to train the kids. This essay supports the view that primarily parents are responsible as they prepare childern\u2019s meals at home and children look upto their parents for adopting behaviour impacting their lifestyle.",
        "At home, parents are buying groceries, preparing food at home for the whole family, and packing lunch for the kids. This presents ample opportunities to involve and teach kids about the importance of consuming nutritious and wholesome meals. A recent study from FDA suggested that 67% of the kids responded that their eating habits have been shaped by their households and family meals.",
        "In school, teachers have the opportunity to instruct and demonstrate the importance of eating food that is good for health. However, it is not possible for a teacher to follow and pay detailed attention to every single child regarding what they are consuming while they are in school. Children only spend 33-35% of their daily time in school and teachers have limited influence on parent\u2019s decision making regarding their food choices. A survey conducted in a county school among teachers suggested that teachers had limited influence on the children\u2019s diet.",
        "To conclude this, children\u2019s palette is influenced and developed around their household food choices which are essentially made by parents. Therefore, teachers or school play very small role as compared to parents in shaping up their diet, making them responsible for eating habits."
