        "Owing to the growing number of vehicular movement in the big cities , these increase has caused  several difficulties that has raised a proposal by some state to ban private cars from the central cities. In my opinion, the banning of private cars should be implemented as there have been increase of human fatigue caused by everyday traffic congestion we encounter on the city road.",
        "Firstly, in the city we have almost all the major businesses running day to day activities that has caused congestion making it difficult for everyone to access , as a result of these, other road users often encounter traffic caused majorly by private car users hence fatigue has been their significant complaint. These has caused decrease in human output in their Jobs or various businesses.  For instance ,companies these days have gotten negative reviews due to their sluggish customer representatives which is totally not their fault but due to the long time spent on the road before getting to work.",
        "On the other hand, banning private cars will help increase usage of other means of transportation that will generate more revenue for the state and encourage the state to create more means of transportation in the global cities. These will be highly recommended for the growth and orderliness of the city. For example, the Metro Station has been left redundant for a long time because of the increase usage of private vehicles , making the train means of transportation go unnoticed as one of the fastest means of getting to the cities which can also significantly help in reducing the number of private cars we have on the road.",
        "In conclusion , the banning of private cars in global cities will help increase human output in their various place of work and decreasing the number of negative reviews many companies have gotten  as well as increase the growth of using other means of transportation that will help the efficiency of day to day activities in the city."
