        "It is indeed a fact that digital revolution has transformed the lives of billions of people around the globe by changing the way they learn,work and communicate. It is true that being a first to buy a gadget of a renowned brand give  customers a sense of enjoyment of having it before others. However, I believe, there are some demerits of this notion of purchasing  similar  electronic product as it is squandering of money and also deleterious for environment.",
        "unwanted products possibly ends up in landfills or in oceans. Toxic pollutants produced from a factory is injurious to both people and the environment.As demand and supply are directly propotional to each other.By purchasing new devices, individuals discard the old items into trash, which eventually ends up in a landfill site. Landfill sites are full of non-recyclable and toxic matter that can harm flora and fauna; hence, the more amount of careless disposing of components leads to a disturbing fact of destroying eco-system. Moreover, according to the Times survey report, around 90 per cent of animals, habitat is affected by the dumping grounds. Therefore minimizing the garbage, we produce would benefit the environment. A simple solution is to repair goods so that it lasts to its maximum life, rather than dumping it.",
        "Excessive shopping leads to spending on unnecessary goods, which s mostly spotted in developed nations, and it indicates that people of this nation are satisfied with their standard of life, simultaneously there are other countries which are struggling with their daily necessities. Furthermore, even wealthy nations have many homeless and people living in a derelict condition. Perhaps, instead of repeatedly purchasing similar and updating goods, wealthy individuals should start to contribute towards social upliftment and act responsibly.",
        "In conclusion, people are hooked to purchase the latest gadgets and devices which pleases them; but then again it leads to spendthrift and has detrimental consequences of mushrooming rubbish. I believe that money should be spent on social development, and people should minimize the amount of scrap they throw out."
