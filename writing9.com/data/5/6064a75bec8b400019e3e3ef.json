        "Nowadays many people preferred to crime this world. People are more addicted to do miscellaneous activities.This can be done in some circumstances or with an intention.In this I will look at both the sides of the argument and give my opinion.",
        "It is generally believed that the culprit should be punished for each type of crime. Some people prefer to harm others and they pretend to crimes  such as murder,kidnap,robbery etc. For ,instance a criminal named jack killed a huge number of girls just to experience the thrill and pleasure while they scream during the murder. Although this felon is suffering from a mental disorder,he should be punished for his actions.",
        "On the other hand, some people commit crime because of their situation and apart from ,them some are forced to perpetrate crime. For example, a survey conducted in India revealed that many young people are trapped and encouraged to join in terrorist groups. While deciding the punishment it should be always taken into account that why the individual violates the atrocity.On the other hand, some people commit crime because of their situation and apart from ,them some are forced to perpetrate crime. For example, a survey conducted in India revealed that many young people are trapped and encouraged to join in terrorist groups.",
        "In conclusion,having manifested the aforementioned point of views and examples, It can be recapitulated that the people who committed crime either by intentionally or by circumstances. They should be punished, However, in my humble opinion in both cases, criminal should be punished and the motivation for committing a crime should be taken into account when deciding on the punishment by the government.",
