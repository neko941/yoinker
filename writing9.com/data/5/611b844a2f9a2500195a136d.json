        "Some individuals believe that living in a vertical city is comparatively much better than living in a horizontal city.",
        "In the earlier days, people used to live in a horizontal city rather than in a vertical city. Whereas ,they use to have a large house , a place to have a fun time in the evening and a garden. Which helps them to have some activities like gardening  and playing games. Nowadays, we can see that the population is growing drastically which is leading the city to become a vertical city development.",
        "People living in a horizontal city have a place to do some activities which benefits them to have a good health and motivation. Here we can innovate our houses as we like. A small population will not lead to more pollution.",
        "Living in vertical cities is more expensive compared to a horizontal city. Separately we have to take care of our water supply, electricity bills and other facilities like swimming ,games need extra pay. As the population will be so high which leads to pollution, as the tall buildings cannot to innovated frequently and will have less space for anything to do like celebrating on an occasion. Children will not have enough space to do extra activities but we have the advantage of starting a new business that will help us to create more income than compared to starting a business in a horizontal city.",
        "I believe that living in a horizontal city will make our life easier and healthier."
