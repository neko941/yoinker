        "It is undeniable that in our modern world and age many people opine that public academies do not pay attention to pupils especially, understanding and value of health.Yet, others believe school tutors and teachers teach young people about health perfectly as possible.I also completely agree for this issue.I think instructors of schools always show their bests in all type of educating.In this essay, I will discuss both sides of this trend,then I will give my own opinion.",
        "First of all,public education centers,such as schools, kindergartens, colleges, institutes and etc play vitally important role in people's life. In my view, especially, schools are the most important one, because, children spent main part of their life that, over 11 years in their school. They learn dominant things about society, life,nature and so on. It is true that, in every country all around the world, each school starts educating first about health, and this process continues until the school students graduate. Especially, teachers pay more attention about health subjects after high level pupils.Let me give an life example, in our school, teachers educate students very good in all industries, especially, health. The  thing is they know health's worth unequal, that's way this industry very popular,also our government equip  our school with all kind of equipments,which are necessary for experiments.For thus reason,majority of our school students have full knowledge about first aid.",
        "On the other hand,if we look at another side of this issue,there are may be some schools in rural areas,which are not suitable for children and these school's teachers have not enough experience and knowledge to teach pupils.There is the only way to solve this problem, authority should attract some experienced tutors to these school or create a new method of teaching.",
        "To sum up,despite some schools, which are situated in suburban areas,majority of school and their teachers have enouh skill, ability and knowledge to educate young people on health."
