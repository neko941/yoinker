        "Every individual have their own prospective. The way the person thinks diverse from each other. Many mankind thinks, what all the information their want should get them free. And many thinks all information is not easy to share. In this essay I would be giving views and will be giving my opinion after addressing both the views.",
        "Let us start with the individuals who really thinks, one should get the information their need for free. As these days we all can find basic information related to our daily lives. It could be information on Health, Education, Society and many government related information. We usually get this for free on social network sites and on Google. So, basically we are taking advantage of this free information and we all utilize that in our daily lives. This is quite beneficial to all mankind.",
        "When we see the other side of this discussion, we can analyze that all information cannot get for free. Because sharing all information it\u2019s not easy and it has its known values.  Especially the information on business and research can\u2019t be given just. As it has its own value and can only be sold. For instance, one can find free information on as simple as weight loss, but to start with proper guidelines the one need to meet dietician or by taking proper course, where an individual need to pay. On the other hand, when it comes to study all research information you cannot find for free. Person has to read plethora of books to do their proper research. Where there will be using library and other sold books.",
        "In conclusion, I want to state that everything in this era cannot get for free. What all information available in this contemporary era for free is more enough for an individuals. But, one\u2019s has to pay in order to get the information which has its own value."
