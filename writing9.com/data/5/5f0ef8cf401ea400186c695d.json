        "A portion of the society assume that the funds used for arts by the government is futile and this could be used for a better purpose. Based on these points we shall discuss in the essay the different opinions expressed by the people, with various instances and take my view on this subject.",
        "Arts from the oldest times has been a source of information, delight for those who find them amusing, a means of entertainment and of National importance. Firstly, we cannot blame the government in spending millions on preserving these forms of splendor such as ancient monuments, paintings, sculptures, relics etc. In addition to it, they make sure that the community can benefit from them, for example, Some states take this initiative by building exhibitions and maintaining the oldest data which can be used for education purpose and especially create awareness among the younger generation about their country's history.",
        "However, the administration keeping the interest of the people, must not forget to expend in other areas as well, for instance, the contributions made to keep the environment clean, the use of renewable resources, the investments made in protecting the wildlife etc. Sadly, not much action has been seen in these areas. Consequently, the views of a section of the society cannot be dismissed, these should be taken into consideration.",
        "Henceforth, I strongly believe that art should be given equal significance as any other field, it is a form of expression and brings in creativity and vitality which gives each place a unique culture."
