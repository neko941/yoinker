        "Mobile phones have certainly become ubiquitous, especially in the hands of children. Some people hold the opinion that it is advantageous, whereas others say that it is not advisable for children to have cell phones. In this essay both views will be discussed. I believe that if used wisely and within limits, the advantages are more than the disadvantages.",
        "There are many reasons why some people say that it is good if children have mobile phones. Firstly, parents feel more at ease because they know that children can contact them if need arises. Secondly, children learn a lot about technology by using these gadgets, and these gadgets help in education also. For instance, most phones today have applications such as dictionary, through which people can find the meaning of any word, which is difficult for them. Cell phones can be used to submit assignments, or to set reminders for study.",
        "On the other hand, those who are opposed to children having cell phones assert that today's cell phones are not just phones, they are smart phones. They give too much power in the hands of the children. If misused, they can play havoc with the children's lives. Most parents cannot keep an eye on what their children are using the cell phone for. Secondly, children get distracted when crossing the road while texting on the phone and this can lead to accidents.",
        "I believe that the merits of cell phones outsrtips the demerits if parents make a conscious effort to choose the right phone for their child. They can block unwanted calls, set time limits for phone usage, prevent access to certain websites, and locate their child with the built-in Global Positioning System (GPS). To sum up, for the safety of the child and to keep parents' mind at ease, children should have a cell phone but the duty is on the parents to make the right choice of phone."
