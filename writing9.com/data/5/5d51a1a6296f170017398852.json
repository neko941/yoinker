        "Smoking causes more harm than it benefits people. I agree with the view that it is illegal to smoke in public areas and people who wish to smoke should have to leave the building.",
        "People should enjoy public places with fresh air. Smoking causes unpleasant smell and pollutes the air. When many people smoke, the air quality is much worse. I am a parent of a three years old daughter, and I do not want her to have any problems with her health. If she is in the smoking environment, it can happen.",
        "Myself, I think smoking causes a lot of health problems. For example, lung cancer, breathing problems. Many people from my country have lung cancer, and I think it is because of smoking and being in a smoking environment. I tried to be away from people who smokes. And I am really happy when I came to Canada because I learned that people need to leave the building when they are smoking. I am not as worried as before for getting lung cancer from smoking environment.",
        "In my country, many people smoke in restaurants, on the street, in houses. When people talk, they smoke a lot. With small places, one person smokes can cause the air to be much worse. I can not stay for long and talk to people because I can not breath. I love speaking to people and I wish to stay longer. My friends do the same thing. I think it is fair that the person who wants to smoke should leave for few minutes. The air could be much cleaner.",
        "I do not like smoking at all. I love fresh air, and I want my children to enjoy it in public places. Because of that, I wish all countries ban smoking in the public areas."
