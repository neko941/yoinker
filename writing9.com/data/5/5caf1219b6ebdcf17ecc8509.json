        "In this developing day, there has a different view of homework. Some people say that the teacher must give some types of exercise to children, they are done in their home, while other groups of people say that the tutor does not provide any work, it can be done by a child in their home. I will discuss both points of view before reaching my opinion, in the ensuing paragraphs.",
        "There is a plethora reason why homework is most important for child development, one can go to the list. First of all, it is true that without any types of study repetition, people cannot perform very well in their stander, as well as most of the students do their work with family, so parents should be known about their child education. For example, the recent survey from the United States, the researcher says that almost 90% of student in around the world, who are the very intelligent student in this day. All the students were studied in schools where homework are compulsory. That\u2019s the way it would still important for child development.",
        "On the other hand, all folks know that only education should not important for the child. But, if a tutor should not give any types of work, which is completing in the home, so all kinds of student who cannot study in their daily schedule except they do in their class.",
        "Agglomerating, all the points elaborated above, it can be concluded that the teacher can provide homework to the student, but it is a very little bit."
