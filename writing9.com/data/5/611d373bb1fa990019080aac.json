        "Nowadays, there are many different methods to discipline the offenders who commit a crime, putting them into prison is considered to be the most common way. However, some argue that providing better education to all the people can prevent them from being offenders. The problem of which one is more effective remains to be discussed.",
        "On the one hand, prison plays an essential role in the system of social justice. It is generally accepted that almost every country has prisons to keep the offenders. Prisons not only provide a place for offenders to realize how serious their crimes are by the sentences, but also a place for them to rehabilitate. Also, prisons help making the society safer since the people who commit crime were put into certain places. Meanwhile, they can obtain certain skills to make a live after imprisonment.",
        "On the other hand, providing people with better education is important, but I doubt that even with better education, the criminals on earth would not disappear. In other words, better education should not necessarily lead to a no-crime-world. Generally speaking, well-educated people may understand the importance of law and social justice and less likely to break the laws. However, there are still many offenders with high educational background. For example, some cyber crimes require the offenders a higher ability to manipulate the datas or some financial crimes can lead to a huge lost to a society.",
        "To conclude, I believe prisons is an indispensable part in our social justice since it could help educating the offenders as well as keeping the society safer. However, it is undeniable that providing better education to all the people is significant, still I believe it is not the most effective way to minor crime. Both education and prison are necessary when speaking of crime."
