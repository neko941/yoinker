        "Many people argue that the only way for having a safe and secure roadway is to dicrease the limit of the speed for drivers. While some others believe that, there are a number of ways, which can lead drivers to drive more carefully. Personally, in my opinion accidents can be prevented by some other practical ways.",
        "There is belief among people, many accidents are happened due to the lack of suitable speed limit. Many roads have created in cities and between cities which are demands more speed attention and people must decrease their speeds compared with speed limit suggestion. As result, many cars will be crashed without any personal mistake.",
        "On the other hand others said that there is a wide range of practical ways which can lead drivers to be safe. For example, one of the most productive things that can help drivers is traffic signs improvement. Many roads are without or no traffic signs, which have played a crucial role in people's drive. Many of them, more specific at the night, drive based on these important signs and because of none traffic signs they get into serious problems.",
        "In conclution, based on my experience there are some other important ways for reducing the number of roads accidents. Some rull and regulation must be set by the government for drivers. Heavy taxes should be more practical and brings more attention to drivers ,Also I believe that development of people awareness can be effective. Some Tv programs and advertisements can have a significant impact on people, which can prevent any accident by themselves."
