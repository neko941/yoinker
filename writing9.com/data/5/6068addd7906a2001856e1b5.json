        "Nowadays education institutions are relying more than ever on electronic devices such as computers to assist educating their students. Some individuals believe that this is a positive aspect, because it offers the student the opportunity to study from anywhere in the world. Others,however, believe that not being in physical contact with the teacher or other students will lead to negative consequences. In this essay, I will discuss both views and give my opinion way I think computers is a vital device in educating students.",
        "Some believe it is important to be physically present in the classroom because it strengthen one\u2019s social skills, which can be used when interacting with one\u2019s peers and co-workers in the work environment. In a recent study in London, they viewed two groups of students. The one group was distance learning students and the second group of students physically attended classes at the university. Both group of students completed the same course. The study indicated that the one group who attended lessons in a classroom environment climbed the cooperate ladder much quicker and ended up in senior positions,because their social skills was much better then the group of students who studied from home.",
        "On the other hand, and my personal opion, being able to use your computer for studying purposes is a wonderful advantage, because it offers one the opportunity to study at a time that is convenient for you. In this day and age a lot of people are working full time and studying part time. In addition, being able to study from home limits one commute time which students can use on their studies.",
        "In conclusion, attending classes physically may lead to better communication and people skills which could boost one career. However, thanks to the internet and technology those who can not attend classes have the opportunity to study online."
