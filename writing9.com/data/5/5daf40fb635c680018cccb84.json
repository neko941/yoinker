        "When there is complete lock down situation, nobody is allowed to leave their homes, followed by special condition for children. Some people think that youngsters go outside with an adult at night. While others believe that a child should be allowed freely to move where ever they want. However I belief that there has to be an elder with them in worse situation outside.",
        "People who think that during curfew, teenagers can move freely after sunset. The reason behind such paradigm is, public believe in equal rights and they think everyone including children have same excess which elders have. Another aim is, after 17 years teens are considered as an adult and they have right of every information so that they can take decision. An example is, in Yamen above 16 years children started movement against corrupt government and their protest forced them to step down.",
        "On the other side those who believe that during stiff situation young individuals can go outside along with an elder because they want them to avoid unlawful condition as they have tendency to get influenced and depressed early. Also teens are soft targeted and they can easily be harmed in this war like atmosphere, so there must be a senior person accompany them to handle the situation. For instance, in Swat Pakistan when there was curfew, terrorist initially killed many innocent children who were alone just to fear the army, civilians and government.",
        "Therefore, In conclusion I emphasize on saying that during lock down condition less than 20 years old individuals should have someone guardian with them because they can be harmed easily as they are more sensitive and emotional than rest of the public."
