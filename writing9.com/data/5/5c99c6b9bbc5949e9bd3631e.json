        "Even in developed countries a degree of poverty exists. However, in many developing countries poverty is a major problem, and the number of poor people continues to increase. There are various factors that cause poverty and these need to be addressed.'",
        "The first factor influencing world poverty is the current global economic system. This system reinforces inequality between rich and poor people since it allows resources to be distributed unequally amongst people. In addition, the global economic system can favour the investment strategies of large transna\u00adtional corporations, which often pay their workers sub-standard wages.",
        "Another reason for world poverty is illiteracy. Many people around the world do not have access to education, and as a result do not learn to read or write. They are, therefore, precluded from well-paid employment and so can not improve their living conditions.",
        "In order to provide help for the world's poor these problems need to be addressed. Firstly, the interna\u00adtional community has to establish a fairer economic system in which the wealth of each country can be shared equitably amongst its people. Moreover, all countries around the world should make it a priority to eradicate illiteracy by providing comprehensive education for all citizens so that everyone is equally capable of improving their living standards via access to education.",
        "To conclude, it can be said that poverty will probably always exist. Nevertheless, countries around the world can take actions to reduce poverty by ensuring that there is a fair distribution of wealth amongst people, and by making sure that all people have access to education."
