        "Some people believe that to have a fixed retirement age for all variety of profession is unfair and they believe that certain type of workers deserve an early retirement and pension. I do agree with this statement. In this essay we will discuss the which type of workers deserve it.",
        "Firstly, not all profession involves same level of risk, stress and obligations, some profession endures high grade of risk and not everyone wishes to choose that profession. As profession like serving in military includes extreme range of threat to one\u2019s life, since it requires people to work in combat roles facing death anytime. It is more like standing on a ticking bomb, for personnel involved in protecting the country, it is utmost important to provide them required additional benefits.",
        "Secondly, people working in radioactive zones such as nuclear power plants, which supply uninterrupted power supply to the households and industries. During the crisis times involving nuclear accidents in places like Chernobyl and Fukushima, even though their lives were in danger, it is the brave scientists and physicists who saved the world from a dreadful contamination spread. Therefore, it is essential for these professionals to be honoured with early retirement and pension.",
        "To conclude, it is of great importance for the professionals who selflessly work in high risk area to be granted an early retirement and pension for their sacrifice and it would also be ethical for an organization to do so, since most of the time the life expectancy of them would be less when compared to national average due to multiple reasons discussed above."
