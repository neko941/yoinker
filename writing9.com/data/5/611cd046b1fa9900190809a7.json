        "The importance of employments and replacing it to other which was always debatable has now become more controversial with many people believe that it is beneficial while others reject this notion. The substantial influence of this trend has sparked the controversy over the potential impact in recent years. In my opinion, the above stated proposition is undoubtedly rational. This essay will further elaborate the positive and negative  effects of this trend including my opinion and thus will",
        "lead to a logical conclusion.",
        "Analyzing the statement and explaining further, the first and foremost reason behind this is that some individuals love to work and enjoy other company facilities and want to experience the working strategies of other organisations as they fed up and not fully satisfied with current job because he or she is missing content work rights and some requirements according to them. Another striking benefit in this regard is that he or she will get a peaceful environment of new job as well as they get new team management to work  and also learn new skills or experience new work that may help them to further success in their life. Categorically stating, it cannot be ignored that the main reason behind this is that increament in salary compare to last job.",
        "Probing ahead, critics state that including me is one of the main underlying stem from the fact is that the swaping jobs shows that he or she is not stable and serious with the work they are in and not obeying company rules and trust. Moreover, interchanging jobs is a bad thing and he or she who practise this is not tagged them  as most experienced  and patience person in particular work they do as it leads to give a bad name in employment field. Apart from the reasons mentioned above, it can be clearly stated why many are against to this issue in this trend.",
        "To recapitualte, according to the arguments aforementioned above , One may reach to a conclusion that the advantages of switching jobs outweight it benefits  which are indeed too great to ignore."
