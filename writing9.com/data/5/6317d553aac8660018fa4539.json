        "It is an extremely hot topic regarding how people are medically treated. Basically, there are two approaches: the first one is to solve health problems on the early stages, the second one is to deal with the issues when the desease is already in progress. I think that it is a better method to detect health problems as soons as possible and I will explain my points in the scope of this essay.",
        "First, it is less expensive to do some regular check-ups than to treat a complicated deseases on the latter stages. Moreover, it is less time consuming. As some medical organizations advice, ideally, an individual needs to visite a doctor about once a year, if he or she is about thirty years old. If the person is older than that, it would be better to have appoitments more frequently. Some of the checks are free or partially covered by governments. This is nothing to compare with what people would have to pay if they had cancer. For example, it may cost hundreads of thousands of dollars to deal with cancer, but, on the other hand, regular checks may help to avoid this kind of expenses.",
        "Second, the more we invest in preventation medicine, the more developed it is. Doctors hone their skills, medical companies produce better equipment and it is more popular amongs patients. This process can be a long-running, but it is really hard to underestimate all benefits. For instance, in some european countries it was possible to minimize cases of some dangerous deseases only by starting health programs.",
        "In conslusion, it is cricial to start investing resources into preventation of health issues. It might not only save uncountable amount of lifes, but, on the flip side, save us a lot of money, that can be spent in other areas."
