        "These days, whether young adults should obey the orders of the aged people or not has become a controversial debate all over the world. According to some people, carrying out the regulations of previous generations has a number of advantages for youngsters, while others opine that they should question the age old notions. I personally believe that the latter view is more reasonable which will be discussed in this essay.",
        "On the one hand, it is argued young individuals should take the advantages of elderly\u2019s rules. Firstly, those of a mature age possess the valuable knowledge and experience that has been tries and tested. Not only do these experiences help young people in doing things easily, but also save precious time. For example, when I was a child, my grandfather taught me abacus, it helped me to do mathematics assignments with ease. Secondly, old people strictly commit to respect the ethical values, if children can adapt to this single traditional values, the world would be a better place. Thus, it is reasonable to see why youngsters should follow the   advice of their elders in some areas.",
        "Yet, on the other hand, some individuals believe that there are valid reasons for challenging the views of older people. The chief cause might be that with the development of science, many ideas that older people believe them have become less relevant for young generations due to lake of belief to superstitions our forefathers. For instance, older generation in china think that stars affect people\u2019s lives and destiny, while it is a superstition. A subsequent factor would be that the modern generations do not agree to take the fact that a student has to study to become either a doctor or an engineer. With the time, study and career have become completely different and old generation no longer acceptable now.",
        "From what has been discussed, both sides of view are to some context reasonable, however, in my perspective; although following old generation has a number of benefits for both people and their society, I believe that young individual have to be ready to embrace the changed of modern era and try to correct the misconceptions of previous generation."
