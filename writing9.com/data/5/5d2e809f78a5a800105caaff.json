        "The population today in some nations consist a huge proportion of young adults in comparison to the number of senior citizens. The advantages do outweigh its drawbacks, although it would mean there are more competition for jobs, I believe it helps to build a country economy due to vast number in the workforce.",
        "Large number of young adults would result in higher competition for work. This is to say that the jobs in the market are limited and with the enormous number of young adults struggle to secure employment will be intense as many young adults would have to fight for the same job. As a result, companies will have to release older employees in order to path way for the younger workers because companies does not have to pay higher wages for an employee to do a similar job. For example, in the Singapore, job competition is intense due to the limited jobs available for young adults. However, I believe with vast young adults in workforce it would improve a country\u2019s economy.",
        "The huge number of young adults in workforce ensures an improvement towards its economy. This is because with the large number of young adults would lead to higher employment by most companies in order for the companies to generate revenue to improve its business and this in turn will contribute to the development a country\u2019s economy. For instance, in the Japan the country has the biggest workforce consists of young adults and it has seen an improvement towards its economy by 10% due the jobs being employed by young adults. I believe, it develops a country economy due higher employment by young adults.",
        "In conclusion, higher number of young adults would increase job competition among other young adults, where as, I believe its benefit of reinforcing a country\u2019s economy clearly outweighs it's demerit."
