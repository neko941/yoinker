        "Undoubtedly, a substantial increase in travellers has made whopping demand for air travel. Though this is a boon to this generation, it certainly has some adverse effects. However, ways of resolving this upfront perilous situation has become a moot point.",
        "Ostensibly, the rapid technological advancements in the recent past has made the travelling much a convenience factor. The substantial increase of air travel is making an impeccable loss to the environment. Humongous emission of carbon dioxide made by the flight is spurring for the depletion of the environment, this is much greater when it is compared to road transportation. Furthermore, to maintain the social status, travellers are commuting in cars to the airport which is intensifying the burning issue. Additionally, air travel is causing hindrance for the migration pattern of the birds.",
        "On the other hand, several measures should be taken in order to restore the harmony which is an arduous task. Firstly, it is the onus of the government to formulate the stringent rules with regards to air travel by encouraging frequent travellers to consider road transport for a few hours of journey. By the same token, citizens who opt for flight to travel must glean for the airline prices, which involuntarily make them choose the road for travelling. Also, with the aid of technological advancements, a solution can be derived to alleviate birds from being extinct.",
        "That being said, though there are many proponents causing this atrocious situation to the environment, a balanced approach will restore the ecosystem."
