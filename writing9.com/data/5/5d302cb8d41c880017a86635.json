        "With the advent of technology, owing to the advantages of telecommunication, the usage of mobile phones has increased to a great extent. It has also affected the way people used to converse with each other; whether it is about business, work or personal communication, this technology has significantly modified the way of living in the present era. However, its sever use has resulted in health and social issues among people. This essay discusses both the upsides and downsides of using mobiles and will conclude that this technology can act as a boon for society if and only if used appropriately.",
        "To commence with its detrimental impact on society, extensive dependency on mobile phones has made the society vulnerable to many critical health diseases and social problems. Firstly, in the fast pace of life where everyone is busy with their gadgets doing vocational work either by doing work from home or by doing overtime at office, people are deliberately inviting chronic health diseases such as eyesight problem, backache pain, headache, and migraine. Consequently, they take their health for granted. Secondly, children now has become isolated as they do not interact with their parents and friends as either they play games online or they use social networking websites more often such as Facebook; hence,  they suffer from physical illness and this also badly affects their school grades.",
        "Despite its disadvantages, advanced wireless telephones also have numerous advantages. With the invention of the telephone brings many benefits to the decorum of society. Firstly, it has made communication cheap and easy. Gone are the days when men and women used to talk only for a few minutes either over standard cellular phone or local STD phones. In addition, many of them used to send letters to communicate with their closed ones; however, at present, they can talk for hours from their latest android or IOS phones. For instance, a businessman can easily either just message on WhatsApp, drop an email or call his colleague about the change in meeting\u2019s timings which was, dubiously, impossible in old days.",
        "Secondly, it has made office work much easier than before. With the help of a plethora of applications installed on mobile phones, for instance, Microsoft Office, Skype, G-mail and many more, humans can simply use their mobile devices to continue their work effortlessly anywhere and anytime. Consequently, it also has greatly helped to replace the trend of paperwork with electronic work. For example, earlier employees used to store every record in files; nevertheless, in this technological era, humans can now do all the calculations, do the work analysis, store the company\u2019s data on the cloud and can access it anytime using their mobiles. For instance, instead of noting down the everyday expenses, people can now use application available in Play Store such as \u2018Day-to-Day expenses app\u2019.",
        "To recapitulate, the invention of mobile phones has made the communication among family, peers and colleagues convenient and simple as it provides many options to complete any task anywhere and at any time. Nonetheless, its mushrooming use in every field has made men and women vulnerable to critical illnesses. I reckon that this invention is a blessing for the society if it is used wisely."
