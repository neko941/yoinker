        "Every country on this planet wants to have a good economy. However, only a few countries have been able to achieve the same. Economic development helps a country in getting rich and give their people a good standard of living. Some for the economically developed countries are Australia, USA, UK etc.",
        "There are several advantages of economic development. For instance, most of the people living in China were poor and when the economy of China started growing it helped the poor people in China. The government of China has helped more than 70 million people to come over poverty. Today China is leading the manufacturing industry and even the people of China are living a good life. Hence, economic development can help any country in improving its living standards.",
        "In my opinion the disadvantages of  economic developement could be, unequal distribution of income. For example- a few years a ago rich people in India were getting richer and the poor people were getting poorer. However, the new government of India has taken some initiates to stop the same. Hence, it is very much essential for a country to divide it's income in equal parts. Along with that the country should take care of the money which is coming into the market. The money should go in the right hands and should be utilised for the benefit of the people living in the country.",
        "To recapitualte, the advantages of economic development over weighs the disadvantages. In my opinion, the government should look for a steady growth of it's economy and also take care of the cash flow coming into the domestic market."
