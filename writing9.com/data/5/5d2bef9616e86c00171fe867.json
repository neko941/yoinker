        "There has been a debate regarding the benefits and drawbacks of televisions for countless years. Although the tv has many non-beneficial characteristics, it is very hard to imagine a modern world without its existence. Hence, this essay discusses how televisions are both advantageous and disastrous for the society.",
        "Undoubtedly, there are various reasons which makes television a boon for humankind. Firstly, it allows children to acquire various knowledge staying at their home. There are various shows and programs telecasted in the channels which helps children to learn different things. For instance, the nickelodeon channel, which is very popular with kids, presents many educational shows that focuses on science and facts, which is very helpful for children for their study. Moreover, it aids people to acquaint with the things which would be impossible to know in their whole life. There are various channels such as Animal planet and Discovery channel which show things related to flora and fauna and new technology which people might not be aware of without televisions.",
        "On the contrary, the drawbacks that the television introduce in the society could not be ignored. Primarily, it hampers the health of people in a very disastrous way because they become more passive and less physically active if they watch tv to pass their time. As a result, they suffer from many diseases such as hypertension, heart disease and obesity. Likewise, there are many programs in tv which portrays violence and immoral activities and due to this many youngsters and teenagers are influenced by it towards criminal activities. In U.S.A, for example, there are many cases where youngsters try our shop lifting and even fighting with random people because they are most of the time motivated to this behaviour by their favourite programs in the television.",
        "In conclusion, while televisions may have various good things which is very important for kids to learn and people to familiarize themselves, I also think that it is harmful to spend more time watching it due to its harmful effect on health and mind both."
