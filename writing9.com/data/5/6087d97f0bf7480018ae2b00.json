        "Many organizations have terms and conditions that their work force must put on selective identical dress during their office time. The main benefits of these are staff do not need to spend time to select which dress to wear before office and they can save money from their budget on clothes; however, the key drawbacks are the work force find it monotonous to carry same attire everyday and might grow dissatisfaction on specific color.",
        "Wearing same dress everyday helps personnel to save time because they don\u2019t need to think about which dress they should wear. They can use this time with more productive work and get adequate time to spend with their family and friends. Furthermore, uniforms save huge amount of money because for regular office wear employees don\u2019t need to purchase clothing. Although they need to put on office dress every day, identical dress saves their money by not purchasing huge number of formal dress. For example, Harvard University published a recent survey on corporate outfit that female staff of an organization spend one third of their income on office outfit.",
        "However, employees are disappointed by wearing same dress everyday because they find it monotonous by covering themselves with same dress. That is because they find it uninteresting to wear repetitive dress everyday but due to company practice, they have to maintain that. Moreover, wearing same color regularly make a dissatisfaction on that specific color because nobody like to carry same color every day. For instance, in my school days I deter blue color because my school uniform was blue, although blue is a beautiful color, for regular usage it became my less favorite color.",
        "In conclusion, wearing uniform is good practice in office because it saves employee from unnecessary expense on clothing and save time, however, same dress everyday might bring some mental dissatisfaction like fatigue or devours on specific color."
