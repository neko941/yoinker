        "There is no doubt that there are many people who sift lot of efforts to excel in education and occupation. They believe, by doing hard work only, there is a possibility to get recognition in terms of appraisals and academic scores and it is a good to prove oneself as efficient.",
        "To embark on, people who give their best so that they can be rewarded and meet the expectations in order to obtain required marks in exams. This is because there is no shortcut of getting sucsess other than making lot of efforts. Additionally, it will make them unique amongst all of their competitors. For instance, there are many people in my organisation who spend sleepless nights just because of getting good progression in their career. In contrast, no efforts or less might lead them to be lagged behind in their life.",
        "Moreover, Efforts usually returns positive results, the reason of this is there would be some learning from one's attempts, if made to fulfil an objective either in competetive examinations or in office and the efficacy of such people would improve.",
        "For instance, people learn from their mistakes manier times and these mistakes are nothing but a result of the efforts made to achieve some goal.",
        "In conclusion, working hard is one of the bset way to meet an objective for many people which in turn would add feather in cap to themselves. The productivity of people will be enhanced by making efforts, hence it is really beneficial for one's growth."
