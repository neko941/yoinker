        "Being multilingual or knowing at least more than one language has gained recent popularity, and those who are expert in various vernaculars are appreciated in the society. While it is a positive development, when it should be introduced to the children is a topic many experts advocate on. Many believe that it should be incurred at early stages of learning, others argue otherwise. In this essay, I will outline why I consider that teaching foreign language at primary schools takes precedence over secondary ones.",
        "From the children's perspective, their early years of life are very crucial and their minds are growing exponentially at this stage. Indeed, whatever skills they learn in their initial development, tends to stay for life with them. Linguistic skills are no different to this phenomenon. Studies have also shown that children who are multilingual are tend to be more sharper than those who are not. Additionally, learning multiple languages at an early stage, stimulates the cognitive abilities of young ones. Hence, it is not only easier, but also beneficial to learn the foreign languages at an early stage.",
        "On the contrary, many people believe that it exerts burden on the little ones and is a waste of time. While, this could be true and I am aware of the potential pressures on small children, I strongly believe that even this downside can be turned into an opportunity. Not many would agree, however, studies have proven that children who learns to handle pressure early in their life are less prone to depression and anxiety in later life. Moreover, learning foreign languages not only improves their linguistic skills, but also make them aware of the culture and customs of multiple demographies, and teach them to respect everyone, which is also essential in today's world.",
        "In conclusion, in my perspective, even though learning multiple languages at tender age may increase a bit of pressure on the little ones, but in the longer run it will be way more effective and its benefits have definitely taken precedence over its disadvantages."
