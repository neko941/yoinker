        "The modern society is generating an increasing amount of garbage and the waste management has become one of the pressing issues both in developing and developed countries.With the inevitable rise in population and industrialization, this problem will be further aggravated. The government can help decrease waste production by educating the public and by promoting recycling.",
        "To begin with, the rapid growth of garbage is directly linked to the overwhelming number of people. To elucidate, as the number of people grows the number of products they consume also rises. This, in turn, inflates the waste production. Moreover, to meet the growing demands, new industries have to be set up which aggravate the situation further, modern life is practising throw-away culture. As the name suggested, people are less interested in using repaired commodities. Instead, they dispose old project and buy a new merchandise.",
        "To counter this, the government can play a major role by monitoring the objects manufactured by the companies. In other words, they can enforce these organisations to produce durable items which can be used for the longer duration. As a consequence, disposing of products will be minimised and hence, the amount of waste produced will also be reduced to a greater extent. Along with this, legal entities should concentrate on educating society about the negative effects of excessive population and work together for controlling this growth.",
        "To recapitulate, the rise in population is the primary factor for an increase in littler. Another prominent attribute is the fostering of the throw-away culture. The government can take many measures to fight this problem. Few of them are banning eco-unfriendly products, applying stringent supervising on factories and encouraging residents to keep the community clean."
