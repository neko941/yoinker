        "I hope you are doing well. I\u2019m sorry for not being in touch with you from last six months. I\u2019m writing this letter to let you know that I have changed my job recently and moved to Bangalore city from Mumbai.",
        "I hope you remembered our last conversation when we spoke last time over the phone where I mentioned that I need to look for new job as I was looking forward to settle down in Bangalore city. Moreover it was difficult for me to balance professional and personal life in previous organization due to long working hours and also the pay was not great. I started searching for new job, attended many interviews and finally I got job offer letter from the current employer on 15th of last month. So I had resigned from my previous job immediately and accepted the new job offer.",
        "My current company is an amazing one to work and it is the one of the fortune 500 companies in the world. I got a good remuneration which is 30% more compared to previous company offered and there are many employment benefits being offered by this company. I have been given job designation as Tech Lead and I\u2019m leading 8 members of the team on technical front.  I\u2019m extremely happy and excited with my current role in the organization which would allow me to grow in people management area along with technical skills.",
        "I would like to inform you that I have purchased new car last week and I have started making youtube videos on stock market investments to share my finance domain knowledge to others.  I\u2019m planning to take a vacation with my family probably on next to next month.",
