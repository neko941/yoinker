        "The modern lifestyle has led to an alarmingly rising rate of abortion, especifically in Southeast Asia such as Thailand, Vietnam. Obviously it is morally wrong to conduct such action but whether it should be banned legally is yet to settle. Both sides of the argument will be presented below with a conclusion of the writer\u2019s view.",
        "In favor of the prohibition against abortion, this will certainly make people more careful with their lifestyle and use protection before engaging in any sexual activities. Since people are aware that there is no way out once they get pregnant except bearing the unwanted babies. This, in a way, will help with people\u2019s health due to reducing chances of the reckless sexual encounters as well as post-abortion impacts on physical and mental well-being. Secondly, the law against abortion is in line with moral and religious standards all over the world. Henceforth, governments which pass on this law will receive a lot of support to create a better society.",
        "On the other hand, it is argued that the prohibition of abortion would do more harm than good. Firstly, it will lead to the appearance of illegal medical institutions because whenever there is demand, there would always be supply. The unacceptable operation of such institutions will rip off people\u2019s money and health as we can see from various heart-breaking examples. The women who suffer from underdog treatment can never get pregnant again or even die on the operating table. Secondly, it is true that sometimes abortion is necessary in certain situations. For instances, the mother\u2019s health is not good enough to endure 9-months\u2019 pregnancy, and it may cost her life if insisting on giving birth. Or the babies are prescribed to be disabled. In those circumstances, I believe it is better to conduct abortion for the sake of both the mother and the babies, as well as the whole society in the long run.",
        "All in all, while I agree that abortion is morally wrong, we should not ban it totally due to some special cases. However, we can pass on the law such as abortion would only be applied and approved to valid medical reasons so that people should be more aware of their lifestyles. It should also be noted that sex education starts from young age since \u201cpreventation is better than cure.\u201d"
