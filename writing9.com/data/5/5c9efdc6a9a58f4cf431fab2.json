        "The chief function of universities is to educate students for the demands of complex jobs in the labour market. The skills required, however, can be narrow and relevant to a particular profession, such as mechanical engineering, medicine, accounting and law. Other skills can be more generic, such as those required by managers, journalists and designers. Some members of society ask for more that universities impart wide general knowledge.",
        "It is an age-old complaint that the younger generation is ignorant. The education system and high school curriculum are often blamed. These complaints usually focus on certain skills such as mathematics and literacy, as well as general knowledge. The issue of whether it is society\u2019s responsibility or that of the individual and family to teach keyboard skills, driving or finance and money management, needs to be addressed and resolved.",
        "Some universities force their undergraduates to take one subject from the Faculty of Arts and Humanities. This is rather a token gesture. In the American system all university students must complete a general undergraduate degree before being able to proceed to a specialist degree, such as medicine or law at Graduate School.",
        "There is much to learn in life and a few years spent at university cannot possibly impart the wide general knowledge society sometimes demands. The importance of education is to teach not just the skills for a particular profession but also more generic skills such as logic, organisation, verbal and written communication of complex ideas, and management so that efficient learning can continue through life."
