        "Nowadays there are more and more malls and everyone, especially younger people spend a lot of their free time in these places. For the researchers, the increasing of this trend could bring significant problems to the future society. I am not completely agree with this statement because shopping centers are evolving and some of them look like small cities where youths can find not just entertainment but interesting activities like cinema and library too and have the possibilities to stay together. It is obvious that would be better if young people would spend their time outside or doing other activities but sometimes, especially in big cities during the colder seasons, shopping centers are good options.",
        "Malls that are developing in these years are not simple groups of stores where is possible buy everything, but are places where meet people and stay together. Almost every shopping centers have a cinema and a big foods corner with every type of restaurants, kid areas and bars. Especially in the metropolis, shopping centers have become like new neighborhoods of the city, inside is possible do everything, there are hairdressers, beauty centers. Concerts and meetings with fans happen every week in these locations. There are many experiences that is possible discover and try, for example inside the mall of Emirates, at Dubai, in the middle of the desert, is possible to ski.",
        "I think that spend free time outside, for example in a park or doing a walk across the city would be certain more stimulant and fascinating for young people. But in some city is arduous, for example for the safety: in a mall there are always cameras and guards, so I guess that a parent is a bit more quiet knowing that his son is not alone in the street. If the government thinks that spend a lot of time in a shopping centers would be a problem it should do more for youths. Building more spaces where boys and girls can be together and make these accessible to everyone, or free tickets for students for museums or cinemas, improoving the green areas with sport courts, playgrounds, panoramic paths or organizing free music event in dedicate spaces, squares or theatres.",
        "In conclusion I think that spend free time in a shopping center is not a considerable problem for the future society as long as during the day younger do other activities more construcitives for their future."
