        "Nowadays, there is proliferation in environment degradation due to human involvements. Owing to this ideology, some people think that one person can do nothing. So, it is the responsibility of the governments and large institutes to save it. According to this view point I am totally disagree and this essay will describe my own perspective toward    this ideology",
        "No doubt, flora and fauna are damaging day by day and consumption of natural resources are also increasing due to which our environment is exploiting. To improve it is not only the burden of higher authorities as everybody knows a single step can change a lot. For instance, B.N Sharma from uttarpradesh planted 400 trees in his home city and that was a mass contribution toward environment. So, nothing can impossible if a person has determination and enthusiasm to protect environment. In this planet all human beings live together and this is the only hone for everybody. So, the burden to save it also comes in everybody\u2019s shoulders.",
        "Moving on, the governments also doing various efforts to conserve flora and fauna. As they also make policies such as SWACH BHARAT ABHIYAN, under which everybody should protect the environment. But, it depends on person that how many people do not violate this law. So, it totally depends on person intentions. Big companies also donate huge amount in various campaigns, which is organised by governments, again it depends upon how many candidates apply for such type of campaigns.  At last governments and companies only give path to protect the environment and to follow it depends upon individuals.",
        "To encapsulate, although governments and institutes have responsibilities to protect environment. But, they are not only living in this planet every human being has duty to save it because this is our home"
