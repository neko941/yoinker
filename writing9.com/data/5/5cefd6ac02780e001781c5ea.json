        "In this contemporary world, renting of an apartment is considered a better option in a few countries, rather than owing it. In my opinion, renting of a house has more apparent benefits in the form of less financial strains and smooth relocation for a job, than the negligible deficit of economic insecurity at the retirement age.",
        "One of the reasons that renting is a more practical option is that tenants have to pay fixed amounts of rent every month irrespective of any fluctuation in property rates or maintenance costs.  Also, any surge in mortgage rate or taxation has no direct impact on the renting person, enabling him to make his monthly budget, even with fixed monthly income.  For example, recent figures published by the Canadian Immigration Office have shown that most immigrants have rented apartments in Canada to avoid bank interest rates and taxation. Secondly, in this era of advancement, everyone wants to excel in his field, and they have to switch jobs in this regard but possession of a home can prove the biggest hurdle in their relocation. People have to turn down opportunities of their lives, just because they are not able to shift to other cities, leaving their property unsupervised. For instance, statistics from the Punjab Health Department have shown that 60% of recruited doctors have refused to leave Lahore and join in peripheries as they own houses and not willing to go to their families.",
        "Those who oppose this idea state that it is always better to have some savings for the old age, and nothing can be more satisfying than possessing a home. It is everyone\u2019s dream to have a peace of mind in retirement age, and the personal property instills the sense of financial security. For instance, The House Building Finance Cooperation Pakistan has seen a remarkable increase in house loans in recent years, indication interest of people in building their personal properties.",
        "To conclude, although buying of a home can benefit someone in old age it cannot overweigh the advantages of renting a property in the form of the less financial burden and freedom to pursue a career in other cities."
