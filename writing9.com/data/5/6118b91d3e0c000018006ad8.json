        "With the development of the urbanization, many big cities are facing the serious problem of air pollution, which is harmful to people live there. In the following passage, I will discuss the reasons that cause air pollution in big cities and give a suggestion about how to deal with this situation.",
        "The primary reason for the situation of air pollution is the harmful gas missioned by the vehicles. Generally speaking, the rapid increases in their level of urbanization are also with an increasing number of vehicles. Those vehicles are usually those with high emission of greenhouse gases and pollutant. Those gases not only contribute to air pollution, but also is the major cause of climate changing. The air pollution would lead to asthma and lung cancer, is extremely harmful to health. For example. Beijing is being stuck with the problem of PM 2.5, and the situation even convened to South Korea. In order to reduce this situation, the government should introduce new policies to solve this problem.",
        "From the perspective of the local government, the first and the most effective thing for the government to do is to reduce the number of vehicles in street. The most direct way is to limit the vehicles by government and make some reward system for those vehicles that use environmental-friendly fuels. For example, many cities in China has begun the system that Vehicles are restricted one out of five weekdays based upon the last numbers of their license plates. By doing this, the cars on street become evidently less than before, and the air condition has been much better than before. What\u2019s more, the governments should encourage and promote the citizens to use public transportations or eco-friendly cars.",
        "The min conclusion to be drawn is that the air pollution issue is considered to be a serious problem that every individual will face in big cities. Although there are several causes for air pollution, the most primary reason in vehicles. To alleviate the issue, the government should do some restriction to the vehicles."
