        "In nowadays english is one of Neccesry language in World but learning English at school is often seen as more important than any other languages I'm not completely agree with this statement as well. Why should other local language are far important like english as well I mentioned in below with respective example and benefits.",
        "I would like to give my opinion with why we improve local languages and what we would try to improve our  education system. In education system are gives some basic knowledge about the local languages and gives all the importants about the other languages preference, Although schools are taught english very well to childhood. But this should be dying out of other languages. In all schoola are also giving to preference to other local languages to children and get awarenes about those languages.",
        "Like we all are giving knowledge to our child about some basic knowledge and importance to our languages then they will also succed in future  with respective field as well, between standard 1 to 10 teachers and schools are teach them their basic languages. If some students are interest in Gujrati , marthi or Bengali etc then they also get succeed in these field. But english languages are Neccesry to all standard",
        "In conclusion, english are important language but respective other local languages are alos important as well. In future the all child are know very well with his/her local languages for business or communication that's why we all are try to improve  the  use of local languages like english."
