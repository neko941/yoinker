        "It is thought by some that using technological devices for education is more advantageous than studying in books and other hard copies materials. The trend of students having access to tablets and computers would certainly improve the methods of tutoring but it will also lead to various drawbacks in different aspects.",
        "One evident benefit in providing technical devices to students for educational purposes is the easy accessibility to international informations. In other words, students using laptops and tablets will navigate the browser and will develop an advanced research skill much faster than using regular books. For instance, a student having a report will not be constrained with materials provided by local libraries, rather, he will be able to access more than ten thousand websites that contain e-books and global libraries. Another reason on why using computers is more advantageous than using books is the flexibility in both location and time for a person to study. For example, packing soft copies materials is much more easier than taking 10 books on a trip.",
        "On the other hand, there a obvious disadvantages of the increasing rate of using technology as a mean of educating the current generation. Firstly, consuming gigh amount of time in front of a large screen will gradually affect the physical health of a person. To state it otherwise, a student speding more than five hours per day infront of a laptop will not only hurt his body posture but also the health of his eyes. Secondly, most students nowadays lost interest in reading books and writing by hand which is leading to a decreave in the level of spelling in addition to a bad handwriting. The fact is that due to the auto-correction option in most of word programs made people dependent on those devices.",
        "In conclusion, the development in the method of educating the current and future generation is benefical in reasearch and material accessibilty nevertheless it might lead to a drop in physical health and various important skills."
