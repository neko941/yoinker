        "Nowadays, people\u2019s eating habit is changing considerably. For many people, especially young adults, fast-food is becoming increasingly popular than home-cooked food. However, there are both pros and cons to deciding to do this. In this essay, I will discuss some of the reasons why people eating pre-cooked meals and some of the drawbacks.",
        "Let\u2019s begin by looking at the advantages of consuming readymade meals. One of the main positives of using pre-cooked meals is convenience. What I mean by this is that today in most families both parents work and neither has time to cook proper meals at home and ready to eat meals that can be bought from stores are hugely popular among these people because it helps them save time.",
        "Secondly, in some cases, packaged meals are less expensive than regular home-cooked meals. In addition, they are available in a variety of tastes and flavours. All of these factors encourage the consumption ready to eat meals.",
        "Turning to the other side of the argument, regular consumption of readymade food leads to various health problems in people. This because they contain high levels of preservatives and additives that can cause various diseases like cancer and kidney trouble.",
        "Another issue is that fast-food is full of calories and deficient in nutrients. If it is consumed on a regular basis, this often leads to obesity and diabetes. It is also addictive and makes people want to consume it again and again. For instance, every single day in the United States, an estimated 36% or approximately 84.8 million adults consume fast food.",
        "To recapitulate, eating fast-food is become more and more popular today. You need to weigh up the pros of convenience, and cons of health problem. Personally, I believe that the drawbacks in terms of eating ready meals eventually outweigh any positives."
