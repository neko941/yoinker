        "Bicycle is mostly use for exercise and it does not produce any emissions. So,it is also eco-friendly mode of transport. However, in some countries cars, buses and trains are more popular than cycle. There are myriad reasons for this situation. Government and manufacturer companies of bicycle should motivate citizens to use more cycle. Bothe the segments are analyzed further.",
        "To begin with reasons of unpopular of cycling activities, there are no specific bicycle lane in some countries. In other words, almost all roads often brimming with cars, buses and motor bikes. So, less numbers of bicycle riders commute by bicycle because they afraid to road accidents. Another reason is traveling by bicycle is time consuming. In this fast paced world, people have not any time to travel by cycle. As a result, they prefer other modes of transportation such as buses, cars and trains instead of bicycle. Because these modes are more faster than cycle. Moreover, bicycle is not convenient and relax mode of transportation. People cannot work while traveling by cycle. On the other hand, cars give private space and people can work on their leptop while commuting to and from work place.",
        "There are plenty of steps that can be taken by governments and manufacturers of bicycle to motivate local people to use more cycle. The foremost one is, government should build separate bicycle lane. As a result, riders feel more safety while riding bicycle. Next step is taken by manufacturers company of cycle. They produce cycle in different colours and also include gears and graphics to attract riders. Government should organize campaigns on bicycle is healthy and environmentally friendly modes of transportation.",
        "To sum up, cycle is healthy and eco-friendly modes of transportation but it is still unpopular due to time consuming and no special bicycle lane in countries. However, government should encourage riders to use more cycle to obtain healthy life style."
