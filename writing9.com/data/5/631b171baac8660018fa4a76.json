        "Despite daily reports getting traction on the public domain, newspapers would persist as the most crucial means of information for many. Newspapers inculcate the traditional feel of walking through a bulletin as well as impart reading comfort and contentment to a reader whereas the internet driven news provides real time and easily accessible content.",
        "Paper based news would lose its essence for the current generation with the advent of interactive and user-friendly device based reports, which is easily adopted by youth in the contemporary era. Additionally, this emerging trend engages the youngsters with an interesting nature of content, which enhances the artistic, lingual and cognitive skills. Moreover, the accessibility and time sensitivity of the content accounts as a pivotal factor in the growing propensity of the news readers towards this drift which proves internet news as an essential means of gaining regular knowledge of world affairs.",
        "On the other hand, the experienced generation would still reap the benefits of newspapers to a larger extent due to their lack of technology adaptability, which would leave them with paper based news as the only alternative. Furthermore, reading newspapers satisfies the elderly,  transmitting the required comfort and convenience, which assists in inculcating a daily habit for the same, thereby leveraging the leisure time to its best. Although as per study, news adoption through internet is approximately 80% whereas the same through physical articles is nearly 20%, veterans would resist this proclivity based on their niche requirements.",
        "Having argued whether public domain driven news or paper based articles would act as a pivotal source of knowledge, I believe the younger generation would adapt easily to the internet specific news due to the engaging, interactive and readily available content whereas the veterans would be inclined towards newspapers based on the comfort and convenience attained in reading the same."
