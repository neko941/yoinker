        "I definitely agree with the perspective that every youngster should expose to carry out community work, for a compulsory period of time. In my opinion, this aspect bundles with more benefits, in terms of providing the young adults a platform to cultivate essential social norms and understand the reality of the society that they are going to live.",
        "This period would be a definite incentive for young blood to understand the disparities in the society and work on alleviating the same. For example, the community consists of varieties of income levels. In developing countries, it always a 20% of super rich and an 80% of low and middle income earners. Unfortunately, most of the young children belongs to these super rich families, unaware about the existence of people who need help in economically and socially. Community development activities open a door for a critical social study lesson for those young children; which is invariably drive them towards creating a fair society when they grow up. Today young generation going to be the leaders of tomorrow's world. Thereby, such comprehensive knowledge and understanding towards the society, would assist them designing the best suitable program to eradicate poverty and disparity in distribution of resources.",
        "In addition to that, such time would instill the essencial civil attributes in youngsters. Consequently, they become more sensitive about people with special needs, such as older people, children and differently able people. What is more, they learn and begin to work on social responsibilities. For instance, payment of taxes is an inherent social responsibility of a civilian, as part of such money is being utilised for welfare work by the government. This understanding directs individual avoid paying taxes or criticising the tax system.",
        "To coclude, even though, the unpaid peiod of work might rise the economic pressure to a certain extent, on the other hand, this time span blesses them with life long advantages."
