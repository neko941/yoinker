        "Nowadays, the new generation tends to eat imported food. It is often argued that shops should sell local foods more than imported foods. I totally agree with the statements on the basis of some compelling reasons.",
        "Firstly, the main reason is that local food are healthy for body because it is organic and without chemicals. Moreover, organic food is rich in nutrias. So, informing sellers about the detriment of imported food and encouraging them to sell fresh and organic food help social healthy. For instance, exporters add more chemical to the imported food to protect from small animals and increase the expire date. Consuming imported food leads cancer and untreatable diseases. Advertising could be effective in absorbing people to consume local food rather than imported food.",
        "Secondly, offering local food could improve the economy of the country. Making a competition between foreign companies and domestic producers enhance the quality and standard of local products which lead to improve the economy. In addition to economy, domestic production let us to control the process of food production system from producing to consuming. As an example, small farmer producer could struggle to improve their business with concentrating on quality and standard. The most important action which local producer must pay attention is packing. Packing is really important in attracting young generation to buy.",
        "To sum up, there are clear benefits of selling local food instead of imported food. However, I totally agree with selling domestic food because of healthy and also the price."
