        "The outfits people wearing nowadays trend to be more fashionable than the past as a result of the technological development and the change within the fashion industry.",
        "To begin with, as the technology has been improved over time,The world becomes smaller And much more convenient in the sense of communication.There are many social media platforms where we can use to connect with other people from everywhere around the world such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter etc. From that we can not only talk to our friends and relatives or see the picture I uploaded from them, but also Receive all news I am the latest fashion trends as well. Consequently people have been absorbing the up-to-date clothes from multi -ways; therefore, adapting themselves become more fashionable.For instance, dressing nicer and going to the on- trended caf\u00e9 to take a photo and post it on the social media.",
        "Corresponding to the way social media has been used, it created the fast -fashioned trend. As people always post a picture of themselves along the Internet and they don\u2019t want to upload the repeated outfits.Hence, they have to purchase new clothes more frequently than before. As an obvious example, there are a huge number of the new low-end boutiques providing the lower quality clothes with the cheaper price among the city center like Siam Square.Therefore it is even more encourage people to dress in a fashionable way.",
        "In my point of view, They are both positive and negative things among it.  The positive side is that by wearing fashionably is not only make he or she become more attractive for other people but also can create the self-esteem  as well. However I found it is the way of wasting money since we have to buy new clothes all the time to be on the trend. Therefore, it is essential to set up the limitation of the amount of money that we can use to purchase these unnecessary items.",
