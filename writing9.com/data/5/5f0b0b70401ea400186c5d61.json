        "Time is changing and so are individuals\u2019 attitudes towards food choice. Whether should be put tax on junk foods or not has sparked a heated controversy. Although it is true that making them costly can be profitable, in my view, other more practical solutions generally are at disposal to be proposed, which will be meticulously scrutinized throughout the paragraphs.",
        "To begin with, taking taxes into consideration as a remedy for the alleviation of costumers\u2019 willingness to harmful foods is probable to be an effective approach. In other words, if fast foods fans are compelled to pay extra cash for having such nutrition, this strategy is bound to cease them from being obsessed having enjoying the health detrimental meals frequently. More specifically, not only may this payment gets particularly unaffordable for the unprivileged families, but also this could be a strong motive for a vast majority of people to increasingly cook home-made foods.As an example, this circumstance appears to be existed in the Middle East countries, including India ,in which obesity rate for this reason is on the rise. This glaringly apparent instance exemplifies the fact that imposing tax on the health-deficit cuisines in all likelihood has essential potency to tackle ever-increasing consumption of such dishes.",
        "In addition, authorities can play a vital role to curb the popularity of prepared foods through raising clients\u2019 awareness in this regard which means that unless the mass media and publicity campaigns collaborate effectively for the sake of alarming consumers regarding dangerous consequences of taking these foods, this is inevitable that they are likely to suffer from relevant health complications. Furthermore, one of the major contributing factors in this matter is long working time due to the fact that in most cases women face a scarcity of time to provide meals at homes; as a result, providing the facilities for expending less time in the workplace by employers such as cooperation with them in terms  of hourly leave absence requests can be another potential step to be taken.",
        "To recapitulate, after careful situational analysis, it seems that despite the undeniable far-reaching impacts of setting tax on the low-nutritional products like cutting the temptation of such foods lovers, I believe that the responsibility mostly lies with authorities and employers to offer better education and make better work conditions for females respectively."
