        "In this era of freedom of speech and democracy, restricting information for the vague sake of public security and the national interest seem irrational to some when other opine that information should be made public when authority deem fit. I personally believe that, scientific, academic arena and business can greatly be benifited with easy accessibility of data.",
        "To begin with, the sensitive information that could penetrate the public security, leads to public outcry, hands over technologies to terrorist groups and facilitates corporate monopoly desevre to be scrutinized before making them available to common people. In this digital era the news spreads like a wildfire and to maintaine global peace we need to put a check on every peice of sensitive information. For instance, if nuclear data is shared with all the nations for the purpose of research, the world will soon be on the verge of extinction, no matter it has a potential for the betterment of human race.",
        "Secondly, researchers, rely heavily on the easy availablity of relevant data and past discoveries, if access to such a resource is prohibited, newer discovries and inventions will stand still. The history proves that human race has advanced through discovries and invention of new technologies and their free access to masses.For example, the internet is probably the most useful invention of the modern age, and if the US millitary had not made it public, we would still been living in pre internet era.",
        "In conclusion, information has limited value when it is curbed and not shared with great minds. For the true global progress, restriction on important information souces should be debarred."
