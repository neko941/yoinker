        "Due to a remarkable increase in global tourism, it is believed by some people that foreign tourism brings positive impacts on local people and thus ought to be supported. In my opinion, international visitors should not be promoted owing to a number of problematic issues related to economy, environment, and culture.",
        "A good reason to ban international tourists is that it creates an extremely economic dependency which can be harmful to the locals unless it is sustainable. Since, for instance, tourism can boost country\u2019s economy by bring a vast number of new jobs for the local people such as a larger demand of restaurant worker, tour guides, and hotel staffs, if there is a considerable number of natural disasters occurring regularly including earthquakes, wildfires, and flash floods, the number of foreign visitors will decrease dramatically, leading to lower level of local employment and consequently lower income for the indigenous people.",
        "Another point to consider is that encouraging foreign holidaymakers can result in environmental degradation in a term of pollution. To illustrate, there has been continuously noticeable that foreign travelers usually throw garbage in their surroundings irresponsibly which in turn increases the amount of litter everywhere. This leads to the larger amount of air, soil and water pollution. Furthermore, if several landmarks are bustling, natural resources will be overexploited which therefore causes destruction of well-known tourist destinations.",
        "Finally, global tourists have a detrimental impact on traditional customs and indigenous practices of host countries since foreign travelers are careless and insensitive of the emotion of local people. In Thailand, some holidaymakers are inappropriately affectionate and wear unsuitable clothes when they visit a scared place including archeological sites, ancient temples, and monuments, for example. As a consequence, this results in some negative attitudes and conflicts to the local population.",
        "In conclusion, local people should not support international tourism because of leading to unsustainable economic growth, having negative impacts on the local environment, and causing friction between locals and tourists."
