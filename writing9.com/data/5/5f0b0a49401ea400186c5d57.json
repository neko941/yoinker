        "It is believed that investing funds in arts is not advantageous and  there are more pressing issues on earth that are needed to be addressed by the higher authorities. I completely disagree with the above statement and believe that art is worth every single penny that are spent on them. This essay shall present pertinent description and instances of the view.",
        "There are several reasons why government should spend money on art. The most preponderant one lies in the fact that Art reflects the culture of the country and promotes better understanding of the culture and it's heritage among people. There are numerous museum all over the world preserved by the government and people who are intrested can visit there free of cost as maintenance is undertaken by the government. For instance, canada, USA, Australia have arts museum all over the country that exhibits ancient artefacts.",
        "In addition to this, allocating money to the development and sustenance of art boosts country's economy. Art galleries can attract tourists from all over the globe and in turn generates huge revenue. Morover, the art sector employs many people. For example, artists from various genres have huge fan followings and they are a vital part of various art shows which in turn provide employment to hundreds of people. Without government funding many art form will die and this will be a extreme loss of the country.",
        "To conclude, though infrastructure and sanitation have enormous benifits and needs to be addressed but not the expense of art because art has its own value and profits to both people and the country."
