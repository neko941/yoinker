        "In 21st century, nuclear power plays a very important role on earth in providing efficient, cheap and clean energy. On the other hand, nuclear weapons are the major factor in maintaining the world peace. I strongly agree that the benefits of nuclear power are far greater than the disadvantages, if only safely used.",
        "The discovery of nuclear energy in 20th century changed the way the humans lived ever after. At the same time, subsequent invention nuclear weapons also posed a greatest threat to the existence of humanity. There are handful of countries that poses the nuclear weapons technology, because of which the scare of use them in conflicts has been haunting humans forever.",
        "There were some high profile accidents in nuclear power plants in the recent past, like in Chernobyl, Russia and Fukushima, Japan. These disasters are posing as a grave reminder to the humanity on the destructive power of nuclear energy. However, since the technology is rapidly evolving, harnessing of a nuclear energy is turning out to be safer than ever before.",
        "Earth is running out of natural resources, humans are extracting the fossil fuels in huge amounts like never before to power the people\u2019s life. This can\u2019t continue forever, ultimately destruction of earth leads to destruction of humans. Nuclear power is one such technology if safely used, it can help humans to preserve the earth to the next generation by supplying clean, reliable and cheap energy.",
        "To conclude, I agree that advantages of nuclear power out number the disadvantages. Nuclear energy is like a double-edged sword, it can be used for both good and bad. Only by people\u2019s collective effort, the benefits can be harnessed to the maximum extent."
