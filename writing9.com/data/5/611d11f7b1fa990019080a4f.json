        "It is often argued by some that the best present for teens to give is cash, while others think that there are other things can be given as a gift for them. Whilst the discussion of both the views is worthwhile, I am a supporter of the former view.",
        "To begin with, every people better known what they need and want exactly for them. For instance, majority of youngsters prefer to be closed towards parents, avoid to talk with them and have lot of hidden wishes. This leads to the fact that parents being confused with choice of the gift and give to their child useless present. Therefore, giving money to adolescent and permission to free spend it may help with getting used to adult life. In other words, when parent give cash to his child and explains the amount of work spended to earn this money, child begins understand the value of the money.",
        "On the other hand, other people are of the opinion, that money is not the best gift for young adults.",
        "They believe that, teenagers not responsible for money and may expend it too fast or to purchase something useless. For example, numerous lads wish to buy game console, game currency or type of gadjet that have not practical benefit resulting in unnecessary wasted time and money. Additionaly, extra money for some of these youngsters develop a bad habit like smoking, drinking an alcohol and doing drugs, simply because they have payment to buy whatever they want. Moreover, kind of gifts, like guitar, footbal bal, hockey stick, tennis rocket can give birth to a new hobby.",
        "In conclusion, although money has to guarantee that person take with pleasure your gift because he have a chance to choose to the kind of souvinire they want. However, there are groups of people who still argue that giving a cash may have bad aftermath and purchsed or handmaded present are better."
