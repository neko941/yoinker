        "One point to consider that many of us as a parents or teacher we believe that children should spent their free time to do more schoolwork. We always concern about our  child\u2019s studies. It is likely because after coming from school children spend most of their time to play or watch tv.",
        "Children are the age group can consider roughly 5 years to 10 years old.  This age group do not concern about their studies. After coming from school they either Play video games or watch tv.  if its not supervised by parents or caretakers, child influenced with certain type of programmes or games which is harmful.  Almost all of the above if child is not supervised, he/she might be influenced by his peers or friends with the wrong things.",
        "Nowadays schools also carry lots of studies. Competition is so strong among with school and students that children must study. By having school worksheets, projects and homework a child needs to complete in order to stay in track. Wasting time in games and watching television make loss of physical and mental development. Children are the quick learners. They grasp things quickly hence its always advisable that their free time should be productive in positive way.",
        "As I strongly believe that children free time should spent in extracurricular or in school activities which help them develop mentally and physically. Secondly activities should be interesting which keep them engage and motivate. There are variety of potential ways to keep child busy. Physical games like playing badminton, basketball, football keeps children fit and active. Chess, board games and puzzles are the good examples of mental development. Music class and dance help them to relax. On the other hand, some of those games can be played by accompany of parents. By that way Parents and child can enjoy creative time together.  As a mother of two, Me and my elder child share same interest of doing art and craft and as well doing science experiments. When I look this, I feel that we both enjoys and learns new things out of that and share the strong bond in free time of my child.",
        "In conclusion I strongly believe that children should spent their free time either doing recreational activities or schoolwork."
