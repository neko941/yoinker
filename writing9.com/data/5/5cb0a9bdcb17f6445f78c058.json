        "Nowadays, the computer system becomes an essential part of our education system and a group of people believes that sooner or later, there will be no requirement of mentors in the classroom. Students will have the facility to learn everything online.",
        "In general, a computer is a very good resource to learn new things but tutors play an important role in our education system. In this essay, we will discuss the significance of a teacher in the classroom to strengthen my point of view.",
        "A good teacher taught the topic after understanding the level of the students because every student in the class can have a different level of understanding and only a human being is able to understand this issue. For example, if an undergraduate student searches some specific topic on the internet by using a computer, there is a high probability that student finds the exact topic but that topic might be written for graduate or doctorate students which, will be very complicated for a bachelor\u2019s student. But a good teacher understands this issue and can recommend some specific websites where the material is written for undergraduate pupils.",
        "Certainly, a teacher can evaluate the progress of students better than a machine because a computer or any online resource can only mark the correct or wrong answer but a mentor can even check basic concepts behind his/ her written logic. However, in this modern era, these intelligent machines are using artificial intelligence based software those worked faster than a human being. Although, we still need a good tutor to train the algorithm of such software.",
        "After discussing the role of the class tutor in our life we can conclude this discussion by stating that computer system, internet or modern technologies used in our educational system can raise the level of the education system to some extent but all such facilities are still depending on methodologies of a good teacher. Machines can give marks but cannot understand the mind level."
