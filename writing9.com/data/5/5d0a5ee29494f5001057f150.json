        "These days, skin lightening products is becoming increasingly profitable. More and more people opt for these products for various reasons. In this essay, I will discuss that while adverts and people's personal decisions are causes for this upsurge, there are also potential dangers of using such products.",
        "The main cause of the rapid increase in the market for skin whitening creams and soap is advertisement. Some people are susceptible to the manipulations that adverts present, aiming to persuade them that buying these creams will make them look more presentable and live happier lives. These adverts are often aimed at young people, especially the female folks. Furthermore, people use bleaching products because to them, it is trending. Some ladies are pressured by their peers and some celebrities they see looking whitened on social media. Thus, They want to look attractive, acceptable and glamorous.",
        "The effect of this have been and will continue to be very serious. Firstly, there is a potential health risk involved when this products are injected into the skin, especially cancer of the skin. For example, a recent statistics carried out in the University of Benin Teaching Hospital, has it that over 80% of patients diagnosed with cancer was traced to habitual use of skin lightening creams and soaps. Not only this, the entire society will be given a false impression of such a fellow who has changed his or her complexion all of a sudden. People become posed with a negative perception about persons who bleach their skin. More so, the skin suffers from irritation, becomes worse if users are not able to cope with maintaining the high cost of purchasing them.",
        "In conclusion, as several as the reasons for the boom in the bleaching skin market are, so also do such people risk the danger of cancer and being portrayed in a bad light."
