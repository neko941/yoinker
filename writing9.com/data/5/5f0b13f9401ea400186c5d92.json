        "Nowadays there are many food from overseas and other countries in almost every country. I support that some of producers can import from other countries. This essay will support this idea.",
        "Chain of food is really important and popular in globol trade these days. People want to reach many different food or product which is not belongs their countries. If there is a food import from different countries, people can reach and buy what ever they want to buy. For instance, If a person want to cook a meal which belongs to tropical area and it include tropical fruits, the person cannot find these kind of food in own country. Therefore, the meal cannot cooked by the person. Unlike, if every food can import from other countries, people can buy and know new food products. Furthermore, if the new food liked by people, it can promote to have a new economical side about food industry as well.",
        "Countries should not sell only their products in own countries. Because import opportunities may support producers who want to earn more many,so they can improve their economical position and they can grove new products thanks to these occasions. Moreover, the people who want to discover new taste can reach new food types, imports support these ideas.",
        "On the other hand, food import can reveal lack of  food trade precocious and thanks to import, food import can improve. Finally it could have not almost any problem with food import, so people can support it. Also it can create own market and price own countries or in others."
