        "To illustrate, that the conversies over whether college students or university living at home with family or hostels have not yet been determined ultimately.Alternatively, home living caters really affective, peaceful and tremendous facilities along with convenient life and family has to bond. According to my opinion, I observe that accommodation should be at own home is immensely superior and has essential experience.",
        "Firstly, there is no doubt living with family at home children are exclusively safe and secure. They are under parental support and liable to punctual of the time.Even, they do not create such chances to become popular in immoralities and out of control. Frequently, these adolescents can prevent from adequate traffic jams on road. Whenever they are leaving from home. Afterwards, time is crucial for students and has protected. Consequently, despite of that personal budget can survived and health issues abstain them from enourmous various sorts of serious disease. Although, to enure that they are completely independent from such part time jobs.",
        "Secondly, it has assured that, the adults living at home rather than hostels, because these children are hands of their parents.However, parents better understandable for their growing. Parents are always associated with their children and with have correlations. Moreover, these sorts of children obsequious of their parents forever. In order to, that schooling well at schools for their performance and their results are rewarded zenith marks in exam. The whole credit encompasses their home living with parents. Myriad children want to live at home due to disterbance at sharing room with others in which they study lonely and derived preparation for exams.",
        "On the other hand, those children who are living at hostels for some their personal issues unfortunately. Simultaneously, either their hostels are on distance and they need significant role of life which is not possible at hostels as they have to follow school necessary general rules in which they are bound. myriad of them are involved in impermissble affairs with laddies candidates.",
        "By way of conclusion, although it is a common belief that accommodation should be at home. Personally, in my view that children are children. Fundamentally, they have to accommodate at home instead of far away from home until they mature."
