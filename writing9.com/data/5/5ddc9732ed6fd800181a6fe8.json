        "At current juncture ,travelling by air is a major means to move around, chosen by many. But many people argue that this trend will revert and the number of air travel in the future will be reduced .As per me it is an unfavourable development because of multiple reasons.",
        "First and formost, dip in air travel rate could lead to increase in the travelling time. Air travel is the fastest means of transport and the commuters opting for other means of travelling can cause profound time lose to them. As it is told that time is money, it can adversely affect world economy. For instance, to travel from Mumbai to Dubai by air ,it takes only 4 hrs ,where as by other means like a ship takes 24 hrs and for a high profile businessman each extra minute he spend in long journey will be causing a humongous lose of money .Furthermore ,people choosing other means for travel can adversely affect aviation industry. Around the world aviation is a billion dollar business, employing millions directly and indirectly .Reduction in number of passengers will force flight companies to reduce the number of flights operated by them in turn cause job loss associated with them and can have insidious effect on profit of the company. For instance, a recent study conducted by Indian aviation ministry showed that Indian aviation industry is on a turmoil as the number of air passengers in the country drastically reduced in the last couple of years as a result of overall global economic slowdown.",
        "In converse ,people choosing other means of transport can reduce air fare to a great extend. If the number of travellers are reducing gradually, flight company may sell tickets at a discount rate in order to attract more customers. This will make air tickets affordable even to low income earners. For instance, in tourist off seasons ,it is quite common among many flight companies selling ticket at a discounted rate.",
        "To conclude, decline in the number of passengers is detrimental to aviation industry. Choosing other means of transport is more time-consuming to passengers. So considering both these reasons, the reduction in number of air passengers is a negative development."
