        "Over the past few decades, the economic growth in a number of nations has contributed to the noticeable gap in the living standards of people living in rural and urban areas. This essay will outline several main consequences of this situation, and also two possible counter-measures we could take.",
        "Firstly, the biggest problem is probably the overpopulation which is attributed to the massive immigration of rural people to big cities for a better living condition. For instance, in search for tempting job opportunities because they find it hard to get a plum job in communities where have experienced slow economic progress and few jobs. Furthermore, this problem will probably lead to other serious consequences, such as environmental pollution, rampant diseases in overcrowded cities which are caused by massive construction activities to cater for growing house demand of new immigrants, the increase in the levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere from both city\u2019s public and private vehicles. The economic gap between two social castes may concern society as a whole because the rich will probably become richer and the poor may be poorer. This has become a common phenomenon that has been seen in manifold countries, leading to growing number of crimes, and more seriously, social and political unrest.",
        "Turning to what can be done to address these above-mentioned issues, it would need involvement of both government and organizations. Firstly, the governments should implement more projects such as infrastructure, hospitals, schools for the purpose of raising rural living standards. Secondly, a number of incentive policies should be applied by administrations to encourage enterprises to relocate their factories, plants to the countryside, creating more jobs for local people.",
        "Overall, the consequences in this situation are both social and environmental. Potential remedies may involve stronger government interventions and enterprises\u2019 strategies in order to find a way to raise income of people in the countryside."
