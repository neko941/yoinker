        "In current decades, many students work at companies as an intern during their higher degrees. In my opinion, the advantage of this trend outweighs its drawbacks.",
        "To begin with, I believe that the benefits of working as a part-time outweigh the disadvantages. One of these is students will get an idea about their field of study as well as they would get an experience for the job which will ~definitely~ consider *during* their campus placement. Although *~(,)~* they are not getting any salary for their work *(,)* ~at the same time~ they learn how to behave with their clients, colleagues and *boss* . For example, *a* magazine named as employment news published ~a~ data which clearly states that students who worked as a part-time in a different organisation during their studies 65% of students have more bright future in the fields because they have prior knowledge about the job.",
        "Admittedly, one can not deny there would be certain drawbacks , Which can arise due to long working hours. Because there is no any terms and conditions specified for working as a part-time Thus, Students are forced to work for long hours which have a direct adverse effect on their studies. Even, sometimes due to challenging work environment and pressure of studies ,most of the students feel devastated and demotivated.or instance,A survey in companies reveals that 78% of intern think that during their internship training in companies they have very less time for their studies as well as for extracurricular activities.",
        "To conclude, even *~(,)~* though  *~(,)~* there are many disadvantages to working part-time.  I believe that students get more practical knowledge and idea on how to work in an organisation and stay motivated during some critical situations."
