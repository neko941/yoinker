        "It is believed that celebrities such as movie stars and sports personality enjoy the privileges provided by the media. Being a celebrity has its own pros and cons. However, I am of the opinion that celebrities have more drawbacks than benefits.",
        "Firstly, A celebrity has an image to portray. One negative impact can be devastating. For instance,  on the television show Lodger with Karan Hardik Pandya commented a negative remark about women. This led to the ban of Hardik Pandya from the ongoing Australian test match series in Australia. Therefore, it is necessary for celebrity to be careful on national television.",
        "In addition,  fans of a particular celebrity are interested to know the life of their favourite stars. Due to which the media is always there to cover every detail of the celebrity's life.For example,  Salman Khan an actor in Indian film industry also known as Bollywood.The media covers every detailed information of his private life,  parties which he attends even the negative incidents such as his break up with his partners and road accidents which he committed.This leads to stress for celebrities as they need to be on their best behaviour when camera is focused on them.",
        "Moreover, there is a recent trend wherein, famous, celebrities are becoming politicians.They stand for elections to become a member of legislative assembly.The public always question their knowledge about politics. There are celebrities who were asked by the media about recent topics and what changes they want to implement. But, these celebrities are never able to answer these questions correctly. This means they are not aware of the current scenario.",
        "In conclusion, celebrities such as film stars and sports personality have an image to create in front of their audience.Once if its been tarnished they will find hard to get it back. They have to be very cautious in front of media.Even if they change their field and enter politics they have to maintain awareness and win trust of the people."
