    "question": "In some countries, small town-centre shops are going out of business because people tend to drive to large out-of-town stores. As a result, people without cars have limited access to out-of town stores, and it may result in an increase in the use of cars. Do you think the disadvantages of this change outweigh its advantages?",

        "The bankrupt of numerous small stores in town are occuring in some nations because of the remarkable growth of bigger malls outside the town. However, it is said that this development will not only create lots of difficulty for people without car to reach the final destinations but also encourage the number of cars being used. But, I still believe that this transformation will bring back more pros than cons.",
        "It is easily to figure out that the larger the mall is, the more products are sold. Specifically, the large stores will corporate with lots of entrepreneurs and companies in differents areas from overseas to national, from food and drink to toys. In other words, these stores can import not only a huge number but also a variety of products to serve their customers. Therefore, people will have more choices to buy than in the smaller one.",
        "Moreover, some large malls outside the town is a complexes. To be more clearly, some will include restaurants or playgrounds to meet the customers\u2019 needs. Therefore, people come to these malls just like a trip for their families to escape from the daily pressure and have more time together, or even these large out-of-town stores is a place to stop during a long road trips for some families. In conclusion, not only does it sell tangible products but also sell intangible one, love and fun between people, correspondingly.",
        "Last but not least, the purpose of building large malls outside the town is to limit the pollution may happen. To illustrate, a large mall always go with noise pollution since it witnesses the regular and dense of not only the influx of people but also the flow of containers come and leave, which will lead to numerous health damages such as hard hearing, cardiovascular disorders and high lever of stress Consequently, allocating massive stores far from the city is necessary and compulsory to make sure that citizen will be safe.",
        "To sum up, the large out-of-town store is definitely the best choice for people because of the benefits its provides."
