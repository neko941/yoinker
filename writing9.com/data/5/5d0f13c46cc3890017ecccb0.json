        "Recently parents are debating on weather they should push their childrens towards reading more often than other activities. I think reading is as important as other activities like playing outdoor games and watching eductional videos, but reading may not be as much fun for the offsprings to initiate it themselves.",
        "The students in school often wait for the games period as they enjoy the rush of dopamine, which they get while playing games. The parents role is to nurture their children so they can develop ablilities like, team spirit, co-ordination, leadership, etc. and games like soccer, basketball help in acheiving it. For instance, as per the research conducted in New Zealand the kids who played Rugby felt more self confident, stronger will power and had higher brain activity which help them in having creative ideas to solve problems.",
        "Not every person is the same, and some youngsters just are more visually influenced, which means they can  learn faster if they see a process. Education nowadays has moved from the chalkboard to the phones or laptops, which makes it very convinent to just type on Google and get a video explaning every detail for it. This eventually can increase the kids memory and due to this at time of exams they can practically make their own answers, which is way better than memorizing it. For example, as per the study conducted on students in Australia, for a first aid lecture found that  60% of the pupils incorparated the technique better when they physically saw the procedure than the ones with had just theoretical information.",
        "In conclusion, the parents should do more activities which the childrens like, as it will benefit them in the long run. This means that all the other skills are as important as reading and are better if are taught to the children."
