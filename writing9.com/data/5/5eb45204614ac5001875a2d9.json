Other people believe that it is important for children to make decisions about matters that affect them.Discuss both these views and give your opinion",

        "Some people think that letting children choose what to eat, what to wear, and how to spend their time may create self-centred individuals who are only rotating around their desires, needs, and wants. While others see that allowing kids to make free decisions about these minor affairs in life would help them deeply in their future and would affect their personality.",
        "On one side of the argument, When kids are allowed to make free or loose choices, they will rarely care about others as they would feel that what is always accessible to them is available to others too. To support this point of view, this side advocates present the results of research, done by social scientists, claimed that 50% of the selfish individuals had a history of making loose choices about their lives during their childhood. In addition, The study claimed that there is a healthy percentage of imposing youngsters on doing things that are supposed to be left for their personal preferences to enhance their social intelligence and social reliability. That\u2019s why it is crucial for parents to have some control over their children\u2019s lives.",
        "on the other side, Others do highlight that giving children the freedom to choose is helping them to build a strong character and independent personality. Also, this would lessen the burden of taking care of of the kids as they will have to manage this level in their life. For example, when the parents allow their kids to choose, they will be able to make choices in the future on the level of education and marriage, and they would never be in need for any body to manage their lives. That's why this side supporters are encouraging caregivers and parents to give the youngesters the freedom of choice.",
        "In my opinion, I believe that there should be a balance between the two point of view. It is true that Kids should take the liberty to choose, but they need to choose among the available choices that parents or guardians already approved. In that sense, we can achieve two objectives which are building a strong and independent kid who is able to make choices and making sure that our kids or not making such loose chioces that may make them not responsible.",
        "To conclude, I would say that bringing up children is not an easy matter, and the debate between allowing kids determine what to have and what is not will continue. However, our role as guardians, parents, and caregivers is to comprimse to make the best choice and take the best decision."
