        "Poor countries always receive fund assistance from rich countries to get rid of poverty and backwardness, but some argue this form of help has little effect. Personally, although the wealthy countries can donate money to solve some emergency problems of poor countries, it is not a long-term solution.",
        "It seems that rich countries give financial aid to the countries who have no sufficient money in social development can solve the a proportion of poverty in short term. Having these money, those who have difficulties to solve the problem of food and clothing could have fundamental security, then they can develop other aspects of construction. However, to a large extent, the fact that the root reason for which they cannot afford the routine expenditure is the lack of the capacity to make the social economy work rather than such money. Following this look, even if they receive fund from wealthy countries, they still keep poor for the long term.",
        "Instead of giving money to help the poor countries, rich countries can provide other sorts of help like establishing subsidiaries of mature companies, which can broaden the job market. As the development of the job opportunities, more and more people can be willing to dedicate themselves to their country. If the countries should achieve national prosperity step by step, they would be easy to strength the country from any aspect. Therefore, it is farseeing to help the poor countries by bringing multiple economic and social benefits to the local people.",
        "In conclusion, although give financial aid to affluent countries is a direct way to assist them, I still believe that wealthy countries have more methods to help them."
