        "Education is considered one of the most significant issues to pay a great attention on in upbringing our children. There are many views on what educational perspectives we should adopt in order to gain successful results. While some prefer students to work as a team, others choose to work on alone on their assignments. I, personally, believe that teamwork is much more meaningful in the educational process.",
        "Working in the class as a team should be encouraged as it works in the favor of the whole community. Students, when performing in a group, usually come up with a lot of innovative and untraditional ideas that result from a process known as brainstorming. These ideas can benefit not only the students themselves, but also their countries later on. Additionally, group work creates the concept of \" we rather than I \" which fosters cooperation and integration between people.",
        "On the other side, some people believe that when students have the chance to work on their assignments alone, it would be better. By doing so, every one will have the ability to think independently and make decisions on their own. Furthermore, working individually will avoid the repetition and replication of thoughts which is preferable for the coming generations. Egypt, for example, support that direction in a lot of schools and it seems satisfied in many ways so far.",
        "My point of view is directed towards enriching teamwork as it proved to be beneficial on both personal and professional sides. When children become adults, they will be more responsible, productive, and cooperative persons.",
        "To conclude, some viewpoints promote acting as a group in the educational institutions, however, others adopt the idea of working alone on school assignments. Personally, I consider that teamwork is more promising for the next generations on various aspects."
