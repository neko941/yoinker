        "In recent days, people are giving so much importance to their clothing sense as they believing in cloth make a huge effect on their personal, social and professional life. In addition, moving towards globalization, people are adopting new trend of wears from different countries into their routine lifestyle. Some people argue that this is a very critical situation for our own heritage for classical cloths and one should not forget own culture\u2019s part. I totally disagree with their statement.",
        "Generally, a person gets differentiate and get identified for their nationality by their skin, clothes, language, and food. In which, the cloth is playing an important role. Although traditional cloths provide respect to one\u2019s nationality, it makes people to discomfort to have these clothes all over time. For example, in India, wearing Shervani for men and Sari for women in marriage or in Hindu festival gives them the opportunity to get respect and makes them connected with social but having same suite whole day at work unable them to work efficiently.",
        "Moreover, here in India, some culture has special kind of cloths like wearing a special type of cap in Maharastra, India which make them proud in their religion or feel superior in their tradition. It may happen that people from other culture could not understand it in out of India and make fun of them while traveling to a different country. In this case, they might feel depressed while pursuing own tradition characteristics. It is there for necessary to understand different culture with their clothing sense to get mixed up in their society.",
        "To conclude, I must say our traditional are well known and people are always keeping them alive in different counties and in our own country too but sticking same traditional clothes makes people inconvenient in the day to day life."
