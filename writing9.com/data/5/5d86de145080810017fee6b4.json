        "It is often argued by some, that we are allowed to enjoy watching movies through electronic gadgets like phones and laptops, while others opine that , it is not necessary to watch films I\u2019m theatres as it is available to enjoy at home.However, in my opinion, going to theatre is much entertainment than at home.",
        "On one hand,  some people argued that watching films on their smartphones is the best as it is more convenient . In other words, most people are busy with their work schedule as they not find time to enjoy film in theatre . Furthermore,watching a movie on a mobile device is a lot less expensive than going to theatre. For instance, some entertainment websites like Netflix and amazon prime  makes movie lover to watch their preferred film at home.",
        "On the other hand, although there are myriad benefits of enjoying film at home , it could not replace the enjoyment get at theatre .That is to say,when a movie is watched at theatre , the audience can enjoy its visual and sound effects . For instance, a survey conducted that 70% of people preferred to watch film at theatre as it provides 3D effect. Additionally, enjoying at theatre makes family and friends to get together as they restricted to have fun because of work stress .. This will enable to enjoy together without any thought of stress.",
        "However, for all of the above mentioned reasons,I strongly agree the statement that seeing films at theatre is more preferred to enjoy at fullest with family as well as the film effects.To illustrate, 80%of film lovers enjoyed films at theatre as it entertains them lot rather than at home.",
        "To conclude,watching a movie on a smart gadget is certainly more convenient as it saves time and money. nevertheless, watching it on a big screen makes more enjoyable experience ."
