        "Since the introduction of tv there has been significant changeover in the life of human being. Although it leaves some drawback compared to advantages, there is no doubt that watching box of screen brought plenty of benefits for children.  From my point of view every coin has two sides, so do this lovely activity of many people. Yet, the beneficial sides of watching tv overshadow any disadvantages.",
        "First of all, not every child has an opportunity for gaining wide range of educational knowledge. On this occasion more and more children tend to replace this chance by getting educated in front tv. No surprise that it is one of the most important beneficial sides of this activity. Mainly because, now there are lots of educational television programs like language learning or couch surfing who suffers with lack of chances to do these. At the same it leads to another advantage called snapping out of emotional barrier. More accurately the more kids watch cognitive tv programs the more they get open-minded, and it is a perfect characteristic for future life of child.",
        "On the other side of argument, it is often said that spending a lot of time in front of television may cause impairment of action called metabolism. Take physical inactivity as an example, pay deep attention to winding streets they are empty, what I mean by that is more and more children get addicted to blue screen nowadays. Eventually it will cause obtaining more weight or disease like obesity. Losing contact with real world is another but not less important disadvantage of watching tv. Because of misusing this activity majority of children today are losing their connection with family or society.",
        "All thing considered, tv has already become a vital part of our life. And broadcasting wide variety tv programs is spreading and sharing pay-off educational and cultural knowledge. Yet, still there is an argument that it has much more drawbacks than benefits.  Personally I believe it is just an item on the hands of human, and it has tons of advantages in comparison with drawback."
