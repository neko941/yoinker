        "Although protecting children from unfavourable outcomes arising from different forms of physical and intellectual play is a natural instinct, it is also equally important that they face such situations in order to know how to manage them. In my opinion, it is necessary that a child is aware of both a winning and losing situation.",
        "On one hand, parents are afraid that that children may become upset after losing and throw a tantrum which would be insconsequential for the parents. Morever, they want to protect them from developing insecurities about themselves where a child may lose confidence in themselves. For intance, if he/she works really hard and loses to a game of chess. The child may become depressed and at times may require therapy.",
        "On the other hand, a child needs to be prepared for the corporate world where they will face situations which may or may not be in their favour. In such cases, their behavior show depict gratitude when they win and show sportsmanship when they lose. Such qualities will need to be inculcated at an early age. For instance, allowing children to play in games such as cricket and football which encourages team building and leadership skills results in everyone taking home a prize. The winner also gets the first prize and the runner up also receives a small token as well. Furthermore, no one goes home disappointed and parents aren't discouraged from sending their children to such activities.",
        "To sum up, as parents or caregivers we want to prevent any harm from affecting our child. However, we also want our children to become functional adults in society who are able to cope with every situation life throws at them; one that goes in their favour and those that does not."
