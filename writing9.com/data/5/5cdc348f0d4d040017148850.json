        "Global warming is one of the most terrifying issue which we are facing worldwide.Global Warming is the main factor to fluctuate the temperature in several areas and this issue increases drastically and can be harmful to human being and wildlife.",
        "Nowadays, people want a lavish lifestyle. They wanted central aircondition and can emits carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide which can increase the amount of carbon dioxide in an environment. Due to emission, the normal temperature has increased. Secondly, we wanted easy transportation facility; to get that, we cut bunch of trees to make bigger roads or to make railway or sublines. We all know that trees are the main factor to absorb the carbon dioxide and can emit oxygen on behalf. In addition, people want to travel in their own public transportation rather than public transportation. we know that our vehicles need petrol or diesel which has methane and it is very harmful to the environment. In our routine life, we are using plastic bags and it can not be reuseable product and it is not friendly with environment.",
        "We can follow some basic steps to reduce global warming effect.One can use public transportation rather than private transportation. It can resolve emission problem and traffic issue as well. Government can establish some offers to civilians to use public transportation. Secondly, one can grow more trees, not only on world environment day but on special occassion which can enhance public awareness and can help to reduce carbon dioxide emission. Government can publish some policies which can promote compressed natural gas or electrical vehicles and can reduce petrolium vehicles in the market. One can use reuseable products like, paper bags or paper plates which can reduce the use of plasic products.",
        "In a nutshell, one can prevent an environment by charging the habits and by adopting new and improved products which can help our enironment and can help our wildlife to be disappeared."
