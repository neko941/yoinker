        "Today in the world of people who seek the new place for travel. The juvenile people who love to travelling outside their own contries for more way memories. While others suppose that they can lost the money and spend more time with. I would argue that juniors should go outside to find the other world for their own way.",
        "On one hand, the travelling of young people going to other countries explore their life value time. Firstly these is life age range to learn something new. Moreover, when they meet people or new culture different from they live that might give some inspiration back. For example new expirence with foods which they try once at the local restaurant will inspirate and north them to be a chef. While other lauguage could attract them to be interesed for studying diplomacy.",
        "On the other hand, cost from travelling may the big problem in some family. When go outside everything are the cost. Furthermore some young people choose to stop their student life when they have gone outside and have trapped from the temtation which they got and can lost the time to treat thier health form injured they got. For stant some people stay in the hospital between trip from the food poisoning and while some people may moveout and get married with the rural girl who they met.",
        "In conclusion, even going to forieng contries can lost time and money but in my opinion, I suppost that these more positive to make thier life experience that can not replace by anything"
