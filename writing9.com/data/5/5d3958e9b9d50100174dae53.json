        "Modern world today spending time with family has been reducing day by day, according to many. Workaholic lifestyle and social networking are the main reason for the same; however,this can be easily tackled by having work -life balance and  by insisting significance of family life on people.",
        "Firstly,One  argument of having less family time is that long working hours.This means that family are working extra hours  to bring extra earnings to family for better financial stabily and economical status among others ; therefore,employed family members away from home as a part of their job and related matters.This would, especially, children could feel that they are abandoned by their loved ones.Moreover, child may ends up with some wrong friendship and apparently ruin their life forever.",
        "Secondly, excessive use social networking causing reduction in family time.Online users feels that they are connected with other people and enjoying company of  good friendship but,they do not realise that reality and virtual reality are entirely different.To illustrate,a recent research findings shows that an average adults spend around  3 to 4 hours only on social networking site ; consequently, eruption of family relationships happening eventually, leading serous relationship breaking.Thus, something has to be done to return mankind to back to home.",
        "Issues of less family time can be effectively handled by providing  compulsory family vacation, restrictions on extra working hours and educating people of having more offline relationships.In details,every employee must be awarded with paid  vacation to spend quality time in order to understand the significance of family ties and relationship by these gathering.secondly minimise giving extra working hours to married workers instead encourage them to go home.Finally,educate yougsters regarding real life relationship rather than social networking.",
        "In conclusion,these days most of the people allocate less time for home but this can be managed by effectively by adopting certain strategies.I hope by this entire world become better place to live."
