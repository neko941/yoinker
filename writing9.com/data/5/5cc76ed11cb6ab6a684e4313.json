        "It is the responsibility of the government of any nations to optimize transport by investing state funds into the sector. However, there arises a controversy that the funds should be allocated to improving the railway system other than the roads. In my opinion, both forms of transportation, when improved upon, are beneficial to any country so one should not be neglected in favor of the other.",
        "Admittedly, railway system needs to be made more effective by spending money on it. This is because it is an alternative means of transportation that people should be encouraged to take so as to reduce traffic congestion on the roads. It is obvious that individuals prefer their private cars to commute which has invariably increased number of cars on the roads, however if trains are made more functional and effective, they could be motivated to park their vehicles and ride. London city, for example, boasts of an efficient rail system which has translated to cleaner air due to less congested roads.",
        "However, despite the above, the roads also need to benefit from state funds. No matter how efficient trains can be, there are places they cannot connect to hence the need for automobiles. In other words, cars are still needed to commute some distances. Therefore, it is imperative that the city should have good road network and infrastructure in order to ease traffic and make journeys smooth. Moreso, this will result into lesser fuel combustion and reduced greenhouse gases emission. For instance, United States government spend more on roads because the geographical distribution of its dwellers do not ultimately support rail transportation.",
        "In conclusion, the advantages of an efficient rail system do not outweigh the benefits of a good road network hence the need for both to be improved upon. I suggest therefore that the state allocate funds evenly to both to ease traffic volume and help to save the environment from damage."
