        "In recent years, with the advancement in education,there has been an increased need for teachers.While some individuals believe that people can enroll in some seminars on how to lecture,others think that a good tutor does not need to study how to become one.In my opinion, I think that for someone to be proficient in educating others,they have to be taught how to do so.",
        "On the one hand,some people believe that education is needed on how to be a lecturer and I agree.In other words,if someone enrolls in a teaching institute, the person can learn the basics of how to become a teacher and a good one at that.In Nigeria for instance,there are several teaching programs that train people on how to become teachers. These facilities and their courses are made compulsory for intending tutors.So it can be seen that training can make any person to become a lecturer.",
        "",
        "On the other hand,others believe that enrolling for a course cannot make a person to be an efficient instiller of knowledge.This is because they think that a person has to be interested in teaching as a whole before he can be be able to impart knowledge in others. Although interest and passion play a role when educating others,especially children, however, one still needs to learn the basic skills  of tutoring in other to be good at it.",
        "To sum up,while people have different ideas about teachers going for training,in my opinion, I believe that  they need to gain knowledge about how to be proficient and efficient in their career path."
