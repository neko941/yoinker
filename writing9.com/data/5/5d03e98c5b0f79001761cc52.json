        "These days, young people are graduate, but they are unemployed for a long time. This topic is becoming more and more popular in developed cities. It is not surprising that the issue of youngsters unemployment has attracted many heated debates because of its impact on society on the whole. This essay will discuss the main problems associated with this topic and try to suggest some possible solution to reduce the issue.",
        "The main problems caused by unemployment is increasing the crime rate, and the growth of the country may fall rapidly. Nowadays, many educated young adults are unemployed, so for their survival, they perform online fraud using social media since they have current knowledge about technologies. What more, countries growth is depending upon the youngster's talent, but due to limited jobs available and increasing unemployment, and individual and the society is impacted heavily. For instance, a recent report of the US unemployment and crime rate shows the majority of the age group of 25 to 35 years were unemployed due to an economic recession and those people are involved in online crime.",
        "There is no doubt that there are many solutions to tackle these problems. In my opinion, the best solution is if the government encourage companies to give opportunities to young adults. The government could also create employment policies for the employer and provide a tax reduction benefits if they employ young adults. It could be a win-win situation for both societies as well as companies. Another solution is by generating employment in the government sector and use the additional fund to educate youngsters to perform administration work. This way, the government could find the right young talent to run the country.",
        "To conclude, there could be many practical measures for the government and companies to actively participate in the reduction of the unemployment rate."
