        "Across the globe many nation involve their young ones in some kind of salaried work. While many support this idea considering the fact that it contains valuable life lessons, a few people still believe that it contains no value at all. I support the first notion and regards early working experiences with some financial remuneration as fruitful and healthy for adolescents\u2019 development.",
        "On the one hand, a few people argue that early work may cause distractions for young children, since this takes their focus of the main goal, their studies. When adolescents are paid for work, they generally classify it as more rewarding than normal studies, consequently effecting their studies. For example, if a young child is involved in hourly labour at car work shop, they might start to spend more time for extra money. In contrast, their chances of ending in engineering school could be much higher, if they only focus on their school work, resulting in a brighter future.",
        "On the other hand, I believe that early involvement of children skilled work polishes, strengthens, and groom the personalities of individuals. All children need to understand the reality of life, especially the importance of money. Only then will they understand how much hard work was behind the purchase of their favourite toy, for instance, a PS4. Furthermore, due to less leisure time at their hands might curb them from indulging in numerous ills of society, like, drugs and bad company.",
        "In conclusion, despite the fear of children neglecting their studies due to work, it is my firm belief that early work for children will help in their mental, physical and sociological development and turn them into better humans in the future."
