        "In this day and age, life expectancy has greatly become the growth the aspect of senior's lives due to  developed medical systems. Few individuals believe that developing excellent medical technology and medicine could be provide elderly people living the actively. In my perspective, I totally agree this premise.",
        "First and foremost, if we are, how can older people make a useful  in modern society, consulting teenagers or adult that under their age is a good way to contribute to all citizens. Because, the majority of children and adult today have got more under stress than in the past for several reasons such as a study or work performance. In this regard, given elderly people help them consult their concerns, for example, give some beneficial advice or listening their trouble with sympathy, it would be great for solving the social problem like depressed, suicide. Additionally. as a result, with the increase of the aging society, many elderly people were passed away alone, which mean they exporse independent without their child care.  For this reason, these problems also might be a great method for young people by sharing  and talking their worry because they had already experienced and they had had a decision. On top of that, the charity makes a campaign the way older people contribute to our society. For instance, being caused by lack of work employee gives career such as taking care of baby or helping handicaps in an orphanage. In this way, our society needs to be changing  suitable aging people.",
        "In a nutshell,  communities should consider some solutions for ever- growing population of older people.  Government must-do homework for elderly people offer work opportunities and plus expand retire average norm."
