        "Nowadays, there is an ongoing debate between people believing that at present,we cannot learn anything from the past while some believe that it provides valuable information about human life. It is possible to claim that past experiences play an important role in human\u2019s on going life cycle.",
        "There are several reasons that history of human life teaches a person, on how to deal and behave in situations and arising conditions. For example, I had commited a mistake by unknowingly throwing books outside the window which was a regretful decision, while I will see to it that the same mistake will not be repeated in future if I have to scrap any book. This tells that if any incident has occurred in their life previously, people tend to take care of not repeating the same scenario in future.",
        "Those who argue that today the people cannot learn from their past has a different point of view. They generally think that people do not remember as they are busy in the current social world and fall prey to do the same thing again and again or they do it purposely. This depends on person to person as well as on situation. For example, my friend continues to write a wrong spelling always, even after he is told the correct spelling. this happens with him because he had ignored when he was been corrected.",
        "To conclude, while there are stong arguments on both the sides, my personal opinion is that an occurred incident should be remembered and the decision must be taken accordingly. I strongly recommend that people should learn from their past life."
