        "In the recent years, many companies in different nations are coming up with the policy of letting their employees work after retirement age. While some opine that letting people work beyond their age of employment is beneficial to the society, a few others are completely against this viewpoint. In this essay, I will discuss both the opinions and highlight the advantages and disadvantages.",
        "As various multinational companies have encouraged their employees to work even in their 60s, many have shown a positive approach. Employing older people is beneficial, as they are highly experienced and can help the younger generation in many fruitful ways. They contribute to the nation by increasing the revenue. Many a times, elderly are dependent on their children for financial assistance. By working, they can feed themselves and be independent. Studies have proven that elderly individuals tend to become dull and lethargic when they are idle at home. This makes them more prone to diseases. Thus, this problem can be curbed by letting them continue their work till their health and state of mind permits.",
        "On the flip side, there are quite a few drawbacks too. In today\u2018s competitive world, it is very difficult for an individual to secure a job.  With the senior citizens still being allowed to work, it would make it even tougher for the fresh graduates and less experienced to get a job. This might push youngsters towards unemployment, consequently leading to poverty and an increase in crime rate for thefts. Also many companies do not provide proper medical facilities to cater to the needs of their older employees. While most of them may work according to their will, however some may be forced to earn an income for their family. They may also do so even when their health isn\u2019t in a good state. This would deteriorate their health faster than otherwise.",
        "In conclusion encouraging employees to work in their Golden period would definitely be worthwhile to the society, but only when the disadvantages are kept in mind and proper measures are taken to eliminate them."
