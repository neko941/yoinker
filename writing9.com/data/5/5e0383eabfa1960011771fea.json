        "Should savings take precedence over immediate consumption or vice-versa is an often asked question.\u00a0 The need to find a proper balance between the two is getting ever critical in the face of growing economic uncertainty.\u00a0 In my opinion, creating reserves for a rainy day is equally important as addressing immediate consumption needs and one can find a right balance between the two via proper planning and budgeting.",
        "Spending can be classified into voluntary and involuntary spending.\u00a0 Expense against basic consumption needs like food, clothing, shelter, healthcare and education is inevitable while spending on recreation, entertainment, personal well-being is non-essential to survival.\u00a0 A budget based approach to rationalizing spending can help one identify opportunities to cut-down on discretionary\u00a0expenses while minimizing the impact of the actions on the quality of life.",
        "Savings is critical\u00a0as it acts as a source of provision for meeting essential needs in times of economic difficulty as well as it provides for peace of mind during prosperity.\u00a0 A hedonistic lifestyle aggravates financial adversity in times of loss of income and one is forced to make rapid and harsh adjustments to one's lifestyle which can be quite painful, adequate savings help in ensuring that this impact remains manageable in case of a change\u00a0in fortunes.",
        "To conclude, spending and savings are equally important and a balanced approach to these via prudent financial budgeting is the best course of action."
