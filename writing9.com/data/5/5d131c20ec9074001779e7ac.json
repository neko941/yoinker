        "In this era of smart technology some people are concerned that sooner or later the artificially",
        "intelligent programs and machines will take care of all the jobs which are now done by humans. In this context, I believe, on one hand, not all but a big portion of the jobs will be done by artificially enhanced machines, on the other hand, lots of new jobs will be created simultaneously that requires human touch. This essay will discuss why all the jobs will not be taken over by robots.",
        "The robots or computer programs will mostly replace the repetitive and structured jobs. Jobs such as data entry, listing and filing office works, order fulfilling, answering calls, creating work schedules etc. non-decision making and mundane, but very structured jobs will be replaced by machines to reduce cost and enhance productivity. For instance, Amazon UK has created several smart retail stores without any cashier by making the payment completely online and automated. Hence, artificially intelligent machines will hopefully take care of these unskilled to semi-skilled jobs that do not demand any strategic decision making or complex thought process.",
        "Although there are still so many jobs that demands emotional intelligence that only a human being can provide. To accomplish numerous jobs human touches, such as using gut feeling or intuition to make decisions, interpersonal skills, negotiation skills and other emotional attributes are needed that cannot be completed by robots. For example, to convince a client to close a business deal in good terms needs a physical human being, where good interpersonal skills and some specific emotional intelligence come in play which the machines would never be able to replace. Therefore, many new jobs will be created in future, which will need more human feelings and emotions to get the works done properly.",
        "In conclusion, I believe, on one hand, many routine and too much repetitive jobs will be lost to the robots. While a lot of other jobs are there and many more will be created where a human participation and emotional intellect are a paramount to get it done."
