        "Over the last few years, there has been significant increase in the number of people travelling to new places where climate conditions are extreme like Sahra desert or Antartica. They want to explore such places where tourists are less comparatively and are fine with risks that comes along.",
        "Travelling to such places have both advantages and disadvantages.  One of the biggest benefit is to experience the untouched beauty and having the thrill to be able to successfully complete the tough journey. For a lot of people, travelling is a passion and it gives the immense happiness. Instead of travelling to common / touristy places, they prefer to explore the unexplored and are totally aware of the risks associated with such places. It has resulted in tourism industry to grow like anything and they come up with attractive offers.",
        "On the flip side, difficulty journeys can be extremely dangerous. Things can go against the plan. Since the nature is unpredictable, one might experience extreme weather conditions for which he/she is not prepared. So many travelers have lost their lives while trekking and a lot go missing and they could never be traced. Tracing the missing people is an expensive affair in itself. Another drawback is that they might unknowingly destroy the habitat like polar bears in antartica are experiencing heat because of the rise in number of tourists.",
        "To conclude, difficult journeys are dangerous so proper care / instructions needs to be taken. People have to mentally and physically strong. No doubt that completing such journeys is an experience in itself."
