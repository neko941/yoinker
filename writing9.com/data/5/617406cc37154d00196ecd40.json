        "Furthermore, another advantage is it also keep human being fit physically and mentally. Travelling to any place on cycle burns our body fat apart from this it also keeps us energetic too. In the office we all the day has sedentary seating due to which there is chances of damaging the posture. in that case, at least we can do some cycling while arriving to the office and it also motivates office colleague to do cycling.",

Sitting on same position more than hour may also mentally disturb you.",
        "To conclude, riding a bicycle will help our physical body and nature also at the same time by not harming it as well there are minor disadvantages."
