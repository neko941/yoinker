        "The newspaper and television are source of information, it  gave us information about whole world. broadcast on television and write in newspspers are decided by news editors, many factors influnce these decisions, which i explain in following paragraphs, i think good news should be reported.",
        "First and the foremost factor is ,that the age of audience , the editors have noted that the age group of those who read the newspspers and those who watch television, the generation prefer to audio and video that is available through television and the old generation prefer to read which  is provided by newspspers.Further more, the political pressure , the editors have to under political parties, they are controled  by powerful groups hence they could not write and telecast the truth.",
        "Moreover, the people are living in information era, they impact with the daily news including good and bad from multimedia, some times the media companies use the stories of people's personal life and they telecast the images , violent and adverse content which affect the teenager's behaviour, it might be changed , they shows jealousy , violence and some time they adapt cpoycat phenomenon. However, the role of the editor in reporting good news such as achievement of persons about their life, it should be aknoeledegable .",
        "In conclusion, while editors are inspired by the several factor to make a decision about news, the good news can more effective than bad news. print and broadcast those news that is benificial for human beings."
