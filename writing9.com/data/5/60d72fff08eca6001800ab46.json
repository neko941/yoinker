        "A lot of people think that the best way to resolve the unemployment problem in the world is that the government provides cell phones and access to the internet to everyone who has lost their job. But access to the internet and having nothing to do should bring some problems, such as addiction to online games and social media.",
        "Nowadays people are used to having phones and using them for work. For example when they are out of the office and they have  a meeting, or reading emails when they are on vacation. But giving cell phones to people that do not have a regular job could  increase unemployment even more.",
        "Addiction to online games is a development problem that starts from the lack of activities in people's lives , especially when they do not work or study.Those people might spend 8-10 hours a day playing games or using their social media and doing nothing at all.",
        "On the other ,hand could be some people that  spent their full access to the media finding available jobs on the internet or maybe creating content for social media. For example, there exist some platforms such as Facebook, youtube, tik to, among others that pay some  influencers to make content on their platforms and that is considered a job.",
        "Having said that, cell phones and the internet are important for work because they facilitate things but when people do not have anything to do this might cause problems. For that ,reason the government should not give them to unemployed people."
