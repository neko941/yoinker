        "It is a common belief that to find a job in a foreign country impacts the kids in a bad way, however another belief supports its useful. I will briefly discuss two viewpoints believing by advantages.",
        "In the modern life, many people have a better change to life in more industrial countries. Because of this, they often abandon their raising lands to follow a job opportunity. Thus, the children can not learned mother tongue or they can face with some racism from real rezidents. Therefore, it impacts pupils with drawbacks. On the other hand, even if kids suffer with some issues, in the future they would have an good change to living more modernize locality. For example, some student who have a scholarship their own governments have studied in the United Kingdom, when they will have returning their neighbourhood with high qualified, it would be great development both of them, including host land. That is to say, in Uk, there are incredible high technology devices, learning hubs, libraries with free access for everybody, not only their citizen, also the people who come in ther all around the world, particularly underdeveloped ones.",
        "On the other hand, whereever we are living, we can exposured some issues, including our nation. That is to say, it is not so significant where you have been, some problems every single time can appear. For example, brutal children is common approximately all city, no matter major cities or small towns. Due to, we should prevent to this situation, all people can be aware and consciously.",
        "In conclusion, I restate that developed western countries have great opportunity all people, so they never give up to move there. In my opinion, the world is getting small, and all people should engaged to it, so adults should educate their kids who bad-tempered against other ethnic children. In other words, living a more modern country has positive effects both sides."
