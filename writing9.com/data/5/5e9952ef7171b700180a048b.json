        "These days, mnay people have different perspective about the curriculum of theri children. According to some people, children should be participanted additional classes after school. There are many drawbacks but it will also have some advantages. I will elaborate both two views and give my opinion.",
        "In the first place, having extra classes after school is the best way to learn more. children can improvement at their studies and it lead to give children high social status. However attending too manmy extra classes leads to lack of time for children. they may do not have enough time to relax by doing some their hobbies such as playing instruments or playing sports which can be helpful to reduce the stress and make their mental health strong. To add more of that, they may not experience to communicate or hang out with friends. In the childhood, it is essential to make friends and they can learn relationship skills themselves otherwise they may lack of communication skill or lack of relationship experience.",
        "In the second place, they may have too much stress because of their the expections of their parents who want their childten always to be top in class. According to some articles which is addressed the healthcare of children, children who are under a lot of pressure are likely to have high level of depression and another article about children said that over studying does not mean they becom an intelligent or genius hence having too much extra classes may be wasted of time of children.",
        "In conclusion, attending extra classes has some benefits in aspect of studying but at the same time it has negative impact on their studing and increase the high level of stress and anxiety."
