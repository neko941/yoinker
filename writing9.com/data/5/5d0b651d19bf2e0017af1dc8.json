        "It is irrefutable that being healthy is of utmost worth in an individual\u2019s life, especially in the fast-paced modern world. Hence, inculcating the habit of being fit and fine should be practiced starting at a very tender age, particularly at schools; however, few opine that schools are not putting in much effort to make teenagers aware of the blessing of being in good shape, and I completely accord to this notion and put forth my stance in the following paragraphs.",
        "To embark on, only involving a health subject in the curriculum does not serve the whole purpose. Until the wards are not demonstrated the pros of being physically fit, all other efforts are futile. It has been seen for a long time that \u2018physical education\u2019 is just another course for the mentees as it is being taught theoretically almost all the time. It has been rightly said that al work and no play makes Jack a dull boy. To exemplify, as per medical report by experts, most of the obese populace has been found to be school kids. Moreover, schools burden tutees with so much of homework that they are left with meager time to even take a sigh of relief, forget about indulging in sports or other physical tasks.",
        "Another profound reasoning to back my stance is that the canteens are rupturing the health norms and have been doing fairly well in the school premises. School management does not even bother to keep an eye on the way it operates; consequently, adolescents buy unhealthy, junk food that depletes one\u2019s body and mind. If authorities regulate the practice of such food courts, then schools would not be blamed for playing with teenager\u2019s well being. To quote an example, as per a survey by a medical team of SPS Apollo, children often binge on fast food in the school recess rather than after school hours, as believed by the school.",
        "To encapsulate, undeniably, schools are the one that needs to cater to the prosperity of the learners by apprising them the long-lasting results of partaking exercises and nutritious diet; however, much input could not be gauged from their end as they run courses and food courts sans keeping in mind the welfare of the offsprings."
