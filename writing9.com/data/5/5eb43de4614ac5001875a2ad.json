        "It has been commonly debated that in modern society a number of metropolises increase on a daily basis. This essay will firstly analyse principal complications and later submit solutions to this trouble.",
        "Firstly, in today\u2019s world there are an overwhelming majority of people who live in rural areas tend to visit to major metropolises in order to gain jobs which offer good salary and provide highly living standards. In other words, in several suburban areas individuals face certain difficulties, such as unemployment; therefore, they move to this type of big cities. Secondly, nowadays, almost all metropolises can provide a myriad of people with enough education. In other words, in urban areas there are numerous schools and universities which offer high education level for entire learners; therefore, people move there in order to increase their knowledge and worldview.",
        "In order to overcome this trouble, government can do certain things. Firstly, government can provide subsides to company that works in rural areas in order to increase job satisfaction and attract young people to work. For instance, in agriculture sector a great number of people who are jobless and cannot earn money to living better should be offered certain works. Another possible resolution is that government should create more grassroots community organizations which reach out and help immature people in order to get experience so that they will be more employable. In other words, government should teach young people for adopting good job skills.",
        "By way of conclusion, a myriad of metropolises grows day-by-day because o certain individuals who want to assume advantage of those; however, government can tackle this issue in order to pay attention rural areas a lot. I recommend that government should take certain responsibility, like establishing more workplaces in suburban areas."
