        "Nowadays, sport has a huge impact in our lives and advertising is a crucial part of every sport activities. Many prominent sport personalities advertise different kind of sport related or other products for money. In this essay, we will throw some light on the advantages and disadvantages of this trend.",
        "On the one hand, some people severely supposed that, advantages of this trend surpassing negative sights. Firstly, players can promote certain products in a better way because they use this kind of things in their line of work. For example, a well-known Dutch energy company Gatorade bought sponsorship of UEFA for 5$ million and a huge increase seem that in their sale numbers and the ingredients in the drink keep players vigilant throughout the game. Except this, this kind of advertises could increase the sport players fame and may be a fringe benefit for them. Who says no to more money?",
        "On the other hand, in some cases negative sights could oughweigh the advantages and dream of the sportsmen could be turn into nightmare. First major reason could be deficiency of quality in brands which sportsmen be an advertisement face of this company and this phenomenon will lead to the reduction of reputation. The second vital problem will be lack of concentration on their daily life which happened due to the he was featured in myriads of advertisements at that time. The result of this could be devastating for the players and ruin their game play and it may turn them to the money minded",
        "In conclusion, it obvious that in our society it is impossible live without money and therefore I think that, attendance of them in advertises is normal. But the major part is do not let vanity destroy your career."
