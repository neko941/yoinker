        "In some parts of the world, children are faced with the increase of advertisements which encourage them to buy foods and entertainment gadgets. There has been some objections raised by these children's parents about the impact on their kids while other people working in advertising field claimed that their works bring knowledge to customer. This essay will discuss both opinion and give own perception of writter.",
        "Firstly, there are concerns that the increasing of advertising can pose a threat to a children mind set. On a daily basis, too many advertisements can result in making children to think that the procession of the product is an absolutely must. For example, children watching a advertisement about a new Lego product with many cool benefits day after day is likely to make tricks so as to force their parents to buy the thing that they see. This can be the root of children not obeying to their parents if these kids don't get what they want. Besides that, one of the result could be inequality among children in their school. With young children's friends keep buying snacks, toys that are introduced on advertisement, this will make other kids feel intimidated and less confidents as they don't process what other have.",
        "On the other hand, advertisements can enrich children with knowledge and offer them a better tools for their future. Young children who watch advertisements related to technology such as new mobilephones, the development of microchips can gain usefull information which can be used in many subjects at school. They will be equipped with knowledge that are not being taught at school and get a chance to know more about the world they are living in. Other benefit can be listed is that these advertisements will notice children with the retail price of the products and the way it is introduced to customers. For those children who show interest in marketing and sale jobs, this benefits can set the foudation of young children mind set which can eventually helping them in creating marketing strategy or sale campaign lately.",
        "However at the early age without guidance from parents, children can easily be attract to many products that they see on advertisements. This will create pressure not only on yound pupils but also on their parents. If demand is not meet, it may cause these children to experience some drawbacks that have been discussed above",
        "In conclusion, there are still arguments between the benefits and drawbacks impacts of the increasing advertising on children. In my point of view, advertisements in some aspects can benefit children with many usefull information and knowledge despite of the increasing in number. Thus, the benefit of this problem outweight their drawbacks."
