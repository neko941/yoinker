        "In recent years, there has been enormous advancement occurs in the field of communication and transportation. Now people have the liberty to work and live anywhere in the world. In my opinion, because of this technological advancement, there are more benefits than drawbacks.",
        "One of the most noteworthy advantage because of development in latest technology is that, it shortened the communication gap. There is no restriction for anyone to be present in office all the time to complete their work . For instance, Skype and other applications make it easy to connect to anyone in the world just within seconds. In addition to this, there is no need of physical office remains now. With the increase of prices in rent, one can easily save significant money by using advance technology and get rid of physical office.",
        "However, there are some negative aspects to this development as well. if there is no physical office there, employees are not able to meet each other in person. Due to this, they are not able to understand each other better and it will affect their work. Secondly, employees eventually lack confidence while using other means of communications instead talking face to face. Research done by Sweden university students shows that people who use Social networking site more are less confident than others who communicate with people face to face.",
        "To conclude, despite some drawbacks of using advance technology as lack of confidence among workers there are still humongous advantages for this advance development. It shortened the communication gap and can save a lot of money. In my belief, there are more positive of this trend than negative."
