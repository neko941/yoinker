        "The rising level of people's income is being increasingly witnessed in many nations. As a result, people tend to buy more products compared to the past. In this essay I will discuss why this trend is largely a positive development even though there are few inevitable drawbacks.",
        "There are numerous compelling reasons why this tendency is beneficial to the public and prominent one is that buying more necessary life goods can improve people's living conditions as it enables people to fulfill their life satisfaction and increased life expectancy more easily and effectively. In addition to this, the economy will benefit a lot from pupils consuming more money because it can stimulate the economic growth. A recent survey conducted in Japan revealed that the consumers culture plays a crucial role in the economy development of the country. These advantages have profound impact on the society.",
        "On the flip side of the coin, there are some nasty consequences as well. Firstly, spending lot of money can lead to over consumption of the products and a rapidly growing amount of rubbish in the public because people are encouraged by various manufacturers and advertisements to buy more and more products that they do not read and then just throw th away a while. To examplify, I am planning to buy the newest smart phone in order to keep up the trend. As can be seen our society could be adversely impacted by this trend as well.",
        "To sum up. People like to spend more money on purchasing a wide range of products because they are having higher salary than the past. Taking everything into consideration, I am inclined to say that the positive aspects of such development surpass the negative points."
