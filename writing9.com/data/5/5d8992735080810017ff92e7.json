        "Family planning has been become increasingly popular in these modern days. Certain nations limit people with having only two children by using tax policies since it is a government\u2019s necessity and right to control the human population by the above method. This essay will argue that why it is necessary for government to adopt a way to limit population and its positive impact on the land.",
        "It is obvious for national leaders to adopt taxation method in order to control the country\u2019s population. Firstly, to reduce the shortage of food supply as the increase in number of citizens will give rise to vital problem such as supply of basic needs which includes food, clothing and shelter. As many people survive in a country it is difficult task for nation to supply equal basic necessities of life because every country has its own financial position where some are developed and some falls under-developed. Rich countries may have rich supply but the poor countries will fail to meet the requirements of public. For instance, in India people in rural sector does not have a proper housing facility since the state comes under the list of developing country. In addition, to provide proper placements to people who are in search of jobs because jobs will be the next challenge faced by the state every year since many graduates comes out of the universities who will go in search of opportunities to get a position according to their qualification. Higher number of graduates and lesser positions will give rise to unemployment hurdles as it a toughest issue faced by many states due to lack of balance in supply, this will have negative impact on ministry. Overall, it is necessary for law to control its population to have a balanced control over its homeland.",
        "Admittedly, controlling homeland\u2019s population has positives aside. To begin with, food is basic need of every human being and it is difficult to survive without a proper food. Some ministry has been investing more on its imports to have a proper supply of food to society even though it is exporting its goods to foreign countries the cash outflow is more when compared to its inflow. This is a reason for some states to be named as a developing nation because of its unbalanced nature. In this case, if taxes are imposed to limit population money spent on importing goods can be cut off as much as possible and can used for other developments in the society. Furthermore, according to the talent jobs can be shared to people which will not only worth for public but also for country as there would not be any migration to foreign countries as this provides a chance for politics to make use of inside talents rather than sending them to foreign companies for placements. For example, many people who are graduated leave their motherland and move abroad in search of opportunities as they fail to do so in their own land. Overall, a government enjoy both in financial benefit along with wonderful inside talents available.",
        "In conclusion, some countries have a made a law in tax to reduce the growing population to have a balanced society. It seems to me that limiting numbers in a family will not only reduce the family burden but also its states as well. If the ministry would not have been made this decision in connection with population it would face a serious issue in future."
