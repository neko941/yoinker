        "Crime is contagious and if it is not prevented it spreads like a plague. This has been a major dilemma around the world. Like an epidemic, crime also involves several hidden factors polluting the shallow minds to commit offense. There are always productive ways to solve  problems by identifying the core.",
        "Majorly, the law and order of many countries is lenient and do not correspond to the offense as it should be, resulting an increase in crime rate. In other words, sometimes the government does not imply strict rules and punish the wrongdoers in the way that they should not repeat the mistake. As a result, offenders take the authority for guaranteed and carry on breaching the law. Another cause is a major influence of media and movies which encourage the young minds to attempt felony in the same way as shown in the films in which mostly the thieves get away with the murder due to police negligence. Therefore, this creates a misconception about the law officers among people and this provoke them to commit offense fearlessly.",
        "In order to reduce the crime rate, the government must bring a strict resolution in punishment rules and also increase the severity of it. So, that the sentence should be enough to teach the offenders a lesson in one time and make them to follow the right path as they leave the prison.",
        "Moreover, the censor board of media should control and scrutinize the content of shows and movies including violence and crime. Instead they should on air the punishment criteria for different types of crime. In this way, the people would be aware and shall avoid doing anything against the law.",
        "To conclude, the misconduct always brings negative aspects in the society and it flows like a river if not stopped. There are many prominent reasons for the increasing crime which could be vanished by taking effective measures."
