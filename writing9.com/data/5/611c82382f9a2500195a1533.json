        "It is true that when children grow up , their social  behaviour will alter in some ways . Compared with the social behaviour of adults, there are many differences in those of jurventure.",
        "When children become adults , they will change significantly for many reasons. The external effect is also influencing factors to their behaviour. For example , they will be affected by an event that has occurred in the community or basicly their behaviour change due to the child's emotional development and temperament.",
        "There are  many differences between the social behaviour of adults and childrens. Kids won\u2019t be able to communicate like adults. For instance, adult society is wider and bigger than children's . They have access to a lot of culture ,people with many characters so their life perspectives are also different meanwhile kid social life is around school and family. In addition , children will easily make friends and think nothing of it. In contrast ,older people are much more sophisticated , when they see someone for the first time they will focus on the good impression. At the same time , adults have matured people who easily face many problems in their life. They have more  life experience than young toddlers . Additionally , they earn themselves and take responsibilities in their life with a happy face , unlike teenagers",
        "Sometimes when children get older. the changes make their behaviour tend to be bad .  They feel that they can do everything and as a result, it contributes to the generating of the feeling of tremendous brashness. However, as they become adults, this process inculcates them to garner new life experiences in mankind.",
        "In conclusion , there are so many difference in behaviour of toddler and a mature person like they have less experience than adults . These changes when children get older will help them have more experience and know about worldview."
