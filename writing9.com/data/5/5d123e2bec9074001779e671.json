        "It is often argued that home-schooling is better for a child as compared to conventional method of sending them to school to receive formal education. In my opinion, a school is better for overall growth of a kid as compared to home schooling. School provides an open environment for learning and experience whereas it is impossible to emulate such conditions at home.",
        "A school provides myriad opportunities to a kid to interact with other children from different backgrounds, make friends and get to participate in various activities. This provides exposure and teach them important lessons in empathy and team spirit. A recent study done by the American Mindset Association suggested that young adults who went to school are more likely to be social and are better equipped to navigate personal and professional challenges as compared to those who didn\u2019t.",
        "Where as when it comes to home schooling, a child is able to receive focussed attention and parents have the opportunity to select courses based on his or her aptitude. Those kids who are considered genius can finish their academic year at their own pace, saving time and resources. However, this means that a child is bereft of the wholesome environment of a school. It can be lonely and there are less opportunities to make life long friends and develop desired social skills. This may hamper their overall development.",
        "To conclude this, even though teaching a child at home may seem lucrative option to some but it cannot replace or match the experience that a child would encounter in a school. Sending a kid to school has more long term benefits on the child\u2019s growth and intellect."
