        "People nowadays can complete their assignment from home without working in an office owing to the advance in technology. Some people consider this stride can actually benefit for working remotely. From my perspective, the negative impacts of working with the technology devices, such as notebook or phone, outweigh the positive ones. The merits and demerits will be indicated regarding this pattern of working in the following essay.",
        "In terms of the upsides, one advantage of working from home is the freedom of time management which provides more flexible working hours, and allows employees to make their own decision on whenever to commence working or take leave. Secondly, they can also cope with the chores which are limited by business operating time for instance heading to the bank or post office in the day time. Overall, workers can exert more control and space on their own life compared to working in a fixed place and time schedule.",
        "However, working independently may greatly risk the relationship with other colleagues, and have limited chance of developing social skills and cooperating with talent from the various fields. Most important of all, for those working in a remote way, not only will working independently jeopardize their interaction with others, but also in some specific occasions, such as having group meetings or tackling the emergencies, working alone will definitely make less influence or contribution to the company, and has less chance to impress your supervisor.",
        "In conclusion, although working from home may provide relatively flexible schedule compared to showing up in the company, but I strongly believe that working face to face can profoundly make a progress in the social skills and create the opportunity of promotion or get a pay rise."
