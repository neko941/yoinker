        "Some people think that money is the best gift for a teenagers. Others disagree. Discuss both these views and give your opinion.",
        "Many people across the globe believe that a present as cash is ideal for youth. While others consider providing money is malapropos way of offering perks to teen. However, this essay will discuss both views and then present my personal opinion.",
        "To begin with, every human needs money depending on their requirement. It\u2019s true that in adult\u2019s requirement of money is more compared to teenagers but teen want of money cannot be ignored completely. Youth need money to buy outfit, for a movie, to buy birthday presence for friend and to dine out with friends. Now a day\u2019s teens begin to have more purchasing power than adult\u2019s. Apart from fulfilling requirement, financial decision during youth age teaches them some valuable lesson of life like saving, budgeting and how to spend money wisely. All these skills are highly essential to lead a debt free life.",
        "On the other hand, young age is considered as an age of immaturity and youth are shortsighted. It is seen on many occasion that youth get into wrong habits of smoking, drinking and drugs because they don\u2019t easily differentiate between good and bad when they have money. Children may get addicted to eating fast food that is quite detrimental to health. Availability of money can also land them to unnecessary buying.",
        "To conclude, everything comes with certain advantage and disadvantage outcomes. Hence a parent has to encourage teenagers to learn skill and ability to manage money sagaciously and teach them the right perspective"
