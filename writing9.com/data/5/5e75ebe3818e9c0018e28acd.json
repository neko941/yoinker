        "At the present, technologies are developed and have a lot influence in daily life. Presenting what people are doing and saying while they do not realise, usage of monitors is increasing dramatically. I strongly agree that the benefits of this innovation outweigh the drawbacks.",
        "First of all, tracking technology presenting the real-time position of people such as GPS and tracking application is one of the greatest advantages at this time. For example, COVID-19 tracking application, which was released on PC last month show the pobability of infection awhen user go the every region of Bangkok by using telephone GPS. Moreover, security cameras used for criminal investigation can format the figures and videos of people in the buiding into memoru of the security program. For example, the video that security cameras could record in Terminal 21 at Korat sent to the police during the emergency by its own program.",
        "On the other hands, the projecter technologies can make people feel uncomfortable when they realise that someone keep the eyes on them. From my own experiences, I usually choose the seat where is out of the camera's position in the restaurant. In addition, some people worry about the individual information such as password that these innovations gain from monitoring them. For example, I always aware about cameras or telephone of the other people when I type my ATM password and ID card number.",
        "In summaries, rapidly used to record people's behavior without awareness, most people do not know about this technological phenomenon. Tracking application which present real-time position and notification and security program are part of advantages. In contrast, feeling uncomfortable and worring about the personal information are the drawbacks, which are the less amount comparing to the benefits."
