        "As many adolescents in the modern society are lack of supervision from their parents as well as their teachers, several related causes deserve consideration.

For example, more and more youngsters have a tendency to imitate improper actions through unhealthy videos owing to better access to internet namely instagram, facebook or zalo.",

Firstly, a simple solution would be that the father or mother should give a high priority to educate their young people\u2019s personality in an effort to prevent adolescents from social complexity.
