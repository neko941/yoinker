        "Nowadays, travellers are paying visits to deserted regions. As much as there are many advantages to doing this,there are also drawbacks which include the period of draught experiences there and extreme cold which can lead to death.",
        "One major benefit of tourists journeying to the Sahara desert and Antarctic is to gain indebt and verified knowledge. People who give true stories are the ones that experience the situation firsthand hence what the travellers do. In addition, it helps them in developing write-ups for future references without such people visiting the place to know more.",
        "One major drawback is that such deserted places experience very harsh weather conditions, thereby making it tough for human beings to cope there. When the sun has reached its peak, draught can set in. Getting water is such a dry land is near impossible especially if one has exhausted all the reserves taken there. Moreso, due to the unbearable atmosphere it creates,when excess cold sets in, blankets and places of shield are difficult to get , however causing survival to be tough and this can lead to death. For example, it was discovered by a scientist in 1990 that 97% of people who embark on visits to secluded places rarely comeback alive.",
        "In conclusion, there are numerous drawbacks attached to tourists who go to places extreme weather conditions, however, it has fostered and helped to develop truthful researches without individuals who refer to it in the future worrying about embarking on any trip to know how verified the story is."
