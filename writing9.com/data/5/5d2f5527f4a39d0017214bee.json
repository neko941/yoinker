        "It is the fact that presently majority of the people are not spening enough time with their family. There are several reasons for this situation such as busy work schedules or social media and also few visible influences too. Both the aspects are explained in the ensuring paragraphs.",
        "Discussing the reasons, the most common is people's busy work schedules. This is because nowadays companies are assigning more tasks to people which cannot be completed in normal office hours eventually employees are spending more time at office including weekends . For instance, my friend who is working in IT company works for 10 hours daily including saturday. The other cause is influence of friends and social media.By this what I mean is  many youngsters are spending majority of their time in front of mobile phones or they would be roaming with friends. Furthermore, those who addicted towards bad habits also tend to stay away from home.",
        "The mentioned causes have some impacts too. The foremost effect would be seen on family relationships. Due to the less quality time spending with family relationship is getting spoiled day by day. For example, divourse rates are getting higher presently because partners are not spending quality time together. The other repercussion is lack of social skills and behavioral issues among yougsters.  since they are not spending time with their family they become unaware of family values and morals.",
        "In conclusion, although people cannot spend their time with family due to factors like busy work schedules and friends , we should make sure that we are speding quality time with our family members to live a happier life."
