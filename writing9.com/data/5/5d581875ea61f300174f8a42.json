        "I agree to the fact that many credit card holders spend extravagantly without realizing the payback terms and conditions. I am going to express my views on how banks can verify one\u2019s capability to repay in the following essay.",
        "Credit card is a marketing gimmick in banking sector which allows you to spend, without having money in your account. They give the leverage to spend up to a certain limit which was fixed while applying for the credit card based on current income. Usually credit card holders spend more than required because they are not spending actual money and the limit is usually 2 to 3 times of their income, also, not aware about the payback terms and conditions that they need to pay back the spent money with a pre-defined percentage interest in a pre-defined time. Not doing so will attract penalties and higher interest of returns.",
        "However, bank authorities can make it mandatory to do a proper background check before issuing a credit card. Sales representatives should be penalized if proper background check is not done. Back ground check should include the list of existing credit cards, their payback payment patterns, current liabilities, the existing credit card spending pattern, source of income. For example, banks should not issue credit cards to students or fresh professionals as they do not satisfy the basic eligibility criteria\u2019s for holding a credit card.",
        "All in all, more and transparent information to credit card seekers and proper verification of eligibility criteria before issuing a credit card will help people use the credit card efficiently and to clear the debts in time."
