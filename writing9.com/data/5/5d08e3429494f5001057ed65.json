        "In recent times,  the rate at which ex-prisoners are commuting crimes, has become alarming, this trend is due to several factors. Therefore, in this essay; the causes of this problem would be looked into and possible ways of solving them would be dwelled on.",
        "First let's look at the reasons ex-criminals go back to their vomits. The first factor responsible for this trend is; the environment where people serve their jail terms. The surrounding of a criminal is a crucial matter, take as an example; In developed countries, the main purpose of jailing an offender is for reformation, thus, everything required for change of attitude is provided, in contrast to developing and underdeveloped countries whose aim for sentencing convicted person is punishment and frustration; the criminals are frustrated until they reach their elastic limit  and break, consequently, this hardens the minds of the criminals and they become brutal committing more serious crimes. To tackle this problem, the government should provide an atmosphere that encourages reformation of mind, emotion and psyche rather than a brutal environment.",
        "Secondly, living with other criminals, fuel the desires of other prisoners towards crime. This is due to the favtvthat humans naturally learn from themselves. Take for instance, a criminal that was sentenced as a result of theft and the other was jailed for murder, when both of them are put together as prison mate, they learn more incriminating things from each other. Also, allowing a petty offender to be prison mates with an hardened criminal, it won't take so much effort to influence the criminal with a petty offense. A solution to this, is to keep petty offenders away from felonious criminals, furthermore, criminals with capital offences should be given capital punishment, to prevent them from affecting others negatively.",
        "To sum it all, the environment and the company, prisoners interact with determines the attitude ex-prisoners have towards crime, so therefore, the government should provide a reforming surroundings and also separate the goats and sheeps amongst the criminal and lastly, giving capital punishment to those who deserve it."
