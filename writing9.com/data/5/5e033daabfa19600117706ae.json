        "The public seem in a real dilemma on whether possessing another half's name once they live together for their whole life is mandatory to continue by appreciating conventianal role or it is not necessary in these days.Acquiring husbands name will virtually turn over a new leaf on the whole society by not turning a blind eye into tradition and helping people to recognise their status even though  it might be create long name.In order to arrive last but not least consideration, I will mull both aspects over as follows like the coin flips over two side.",
        "In terms of not possessing husband's name which is one of the component part of the society,it could help girls and mother to not hesitate with their name by living with their child's father.In which meant they donot have to write down their name with full of long names and their name might be more easier to call.According to the recent investigation, the most of the young individuals especially infant student of school confront issues as they have to introduce themselves to their counterparts by saying and writing their long name.Despite this,not pursueing traditional approach of naming will force the public to acquire humble memory.",
        "With regards to the conventional  name granting tradition which have been followed for the thousands of centuries, antique nameing style is not only intended to educate their children with good remembering skill but also proposed to respect tradition and history.To cite my mother as an example, when she was a young beautiful girl,she have to take my father's name by throwing away her name.Moreover,she was overly nervous about that and did a some research in order to grasp genuine truth.Subsequently ,once she realised that she receive a blissful honour ,my mom have never refused to grant his name be respecting their prostigious history and honour.",
        "Taking everything into conclusion,pursuing the conventional way of naming and respecting tradition by not burying a head into the sand help people to realise the value of history as well as honour seeing that not granting the name by avoiding the long name affects adversely to the juveniles skill of memorise along with demolishing the value of tradition."
