        "In the fast-paced of modern life, it has become far more prevalent that young people head to the shopping centers in their leisure time in high frequency. In my opinion, there will be both positives and negatives to individuals as well as society as a whole.",
        "Firsly, The rise in demand for shopping, from the social and economic angles, can be seen as a form of commercial promotion. Recently, shopping has ranked among favourite activities for teenagers and young adults since they are easily tempted by new items, and they are willing to spend on anything that can satisfy their crave for shopping. Therefore, the more products the malls sell, the more profits they gain, which is beneficial for the national tax system as well as the promising economy. Secondly, on an individual level, engaging in regular shopping can bring them much joy. For example, a woman might have a great experience and a sense of satisfaction after completing a shopping trip.",
        "Despite the short-term effects mentioned above, there are some long-term impacts in this trend which we should take into consideration. Firstly, from a personal perspective, the youth might suffer from symptoms of shopaholic or shopping addictions. Should young people only waste their time in such places, they will be less likely to participate in outdoor activities with their friends or family. This may affect their health and reduce the quality time for their social relationships in the long run. Secondly, from societal and economic point of view; many shopping addicts face financial problems, and they may become ovenvhelmed with debt. In some cases, they may simply max out their credit cards, but in other cases, they may take out a mortgage on their home or charge purchases to their business credit card.",
        "In conclusion, the increase in spending time in shopping malls of the youth will have both beneficial and detrimental effects on individuals and on the society.",
