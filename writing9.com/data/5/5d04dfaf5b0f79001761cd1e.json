        "Since the start of this world, everyone is in the pursuit of happiness. People have been trying to find a sense of acheivement and fulfillment through various means. Some consider that economic wealth is the key to remain happy whereas others disagree. I believe that, while money is one of the reasons to keep a person happy, it is not the only factor that gives this feeling.",
        "Firstly, having adequate financial resources is important to live a comfortable life, there are many other factors that affect a person's sense of fulfillment. It is thought that many psychological experts that having a happy and stable social life has a greater impact on person's happiness than any other materialistic factors. For instance, many famous movie and music icons have suicided due to mid life crisis who were known for being extremely rich.",
        "Secondly, it has been observed that people who have a lot of wealth are drug addicts, more often than not. According to doctors, the reason for death of such people was drug abuse. It is a known fact that the primary reason of using drugs for any person is finding happiness. If money would have been all thats required to be happy, would these people use drugs?",
        "Finally, the importance of money in being happy cannot be ignored. One of the basic factors for being happy is living a comfortable life and such is not possible without having adequate financial resources. Money not only helps in living such life but also fulfills basic neccessities of the people. For example, The New York Times reported that the second most common reason for divorce is lack of required finances. Afterall, Who doesnt need to pay bills in this world?",
        "In conclusion, money is important to live a comfortable life and pay bills which are the basic requirements of any person, however, the role that other factors play are also important. It can be said that all these factors go hand in hand and all these factors including money are important ingridients to live a happy life."
