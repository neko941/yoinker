        "As people get older, they tend to be depended on others due to the age factor and health issues.  As such, Old folks home is relatively common in Britain for the elderly  Whereby nurses are available to care for them. In my opinion, government should bear the cost for this services. This essay will explain why government should do so.",
        "Firstly,Many vaterans have served the government during their younger age. It may be in the military, banking or government offices. As these people grew older, it is the responsibility to look after the countrymen. The citizen of the country is the pride of the nation and by doing so it proves that it is a nation cares for its people. For example, a survey taken by the non profit organizations group  clearly states that elderly people are thankful and grateful to the British government.",
        "Next, the citizen of Britain pay taxes to the government for the income earned. Since taxpayers money have been used to develop and help with the economy of the country in is fair that the government in turn help the old folks as the age. Upon retirement, these people do not have income to support their medical expenses . For instance, the pension earned is only substancal to pay for their daily livelihood and not enough to cover medical bills. The medical services is also not covered by insurance after the age of 70.",
        "In conclusion, British have serve and are loyal to the country the fore as the grow older, the government should look after the expenses of the old folks home as a sign of appreciation and loyalty towards it citizens."
