        "Some people think that the most concerning factor when looking for a job is the income. I personally believe that the salary is extremely inportant, however, other factors such as the job satisfication and the contribution to society should not be overlooked.",
        "To begin with, there are several reasons why high salary is an important criterion. Firstly, people will have an good standard of living if they can earn a lot of money. As they have more chance to access to better health care, education and recreation, they might enjoy their life to the fullest. Secondly, the more money one person can earn, they more motivation they might have in their line of work. Because of the attractive allowance offering by companies, their employees usually make every possible effort to their success.",
        "Apart from the income, others one should be taken into consideration. The first one would be the job satisfaction. Recently, many job seekers are looking for a friendly working environment as they want to keep away from being stressful. If one person do not like what they are doing, they are likely to suffer from a wide range of mental issues such as depression or stress. The second one is how the job make the contribution to community. Nowadays, a numer of youngers are willing to work for NGOs, which might offer to them not a high salary but opportunities to make towards society. My best friend, for example, has been spending 5 years working as a human rights activist because she want to make progress in gender equality and childcare.",
        "In conclusion, not only the salary but also some other elements need to be considered when people want to choose a job."
