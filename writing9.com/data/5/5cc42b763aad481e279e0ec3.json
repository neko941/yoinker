        "Human kind has been exploiting mother earth for many years which has increased in recent years. People have used resource in many ways for example using air conditioner can negatively impact temperature of earth in mass scale. Since, air conditioner produces greenhouse gases responsible for ozone layer depletion. This has resulted in increased overall increase temperature and we know this effect as \u201cGreenhouse effect\u201d. This is one such instance of individual\u2019s contribution towards detrimental impact on environment. So, many thinks that people should be responsible for their acts for saving the nature.",
        "On the other side, people think that industries that are polluting our rivers cannot be restrained from endangering quality of water due to high monetary greed of industry owners. Moreover, it is difficult for normal individual to stop them in stopping them. These companies located near river banks continuously releasing their dangerous waste material in water as well as in air. Thereby, polluting the river which is habitat for many creature living in water.  Such type of pollution happens on large scale compared to individual contribution in harming the environment. Therefore, some believes government should take appropriate actions to curb harmful companies.",
        "In my opinion, both individual and government should be made responsible and it will go hand in hand for preventing deteriorating activities of individuals as well as large scale organizations."
