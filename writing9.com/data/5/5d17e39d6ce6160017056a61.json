        "Most of the day is spent in the work environment performing our various tasks. However, It is said by some populace that maintaining a good relationship in the work is not necessary as our major aim should be on the getting job done. I strongly disagree with this statement as I believe that connection should be made in the work place for future purposes as well as to promote togertherness.",
        "Firstly, I believe one should establish long standing friendships in the office as this can be useful in the future or in the case of unforeseen contingencies. As the saying goes, \"No man is an island\" thus when in need, we can turn to friends made in the office. For instance, it was reported in the paper that a dying man who could not afford his surgery, was saved and operated on by his colleagues father who is a renowned surgeon. This could only happened due to the fact that the co-workers maintained cordial affiliations.",
        "Also, having a good relationship in the work place is paramount as this help to foster one spirit and togetherness. Most companies see this as essential which is why they organise team bonding, picnics and end of year party.To exemplify, In the recent inter company competition which was widely publicised, the winner- ABC enterprises won due to team spirits and solid relationship amongst the employees . All this and more is the benefit of having good affiliation with your colleagues.Thus, Companies are increasingly taking advantage of this and they encourage their staff to also do.",
        "In conclusion, while some believe that an office should be just a place to carry out your primary assignment. I disagree with this view and i suggest that our heart should be opened to opportunities and relationships that can be formed in the work environment as this will go a long way in our future."
