        "It is argued that developed countries should allow more evacuees to enter their borders and give them primary support, such as food and shelter. The essay agrees with this statement because rich countries are capable enough to support these kind of people.",
        "Elite states have an abundant food supply for their citizens. The American people have estimated that 30% of their food has been thrown every day. Instead of wasting, why don't share these supply to those people who needs it. Sharing some of our blessing and giving a hand to others, is a nice thing for an individual to do. In the end of the day, it is ourbduty to help one another because that is what God wants us to do (having a quality of being human). In fact, the United States of America alloted one fourth of its budget for refugees.",
        "Another point to consider is that rich nations have wide areas for deportees to construct its homes. Countries who has extra land space was develop for the population who are fleeing from their respective country due to the lack of food supply and famine. In Australia, only one third of its territory has been occupied by immigrants, so there is still a big space for the non immigrants to build their house. This cannot affect to their economy because the government has sufficient budget for everybody.",
        "In conclusion, affluent states should welcome everyone who needs basic assistance. With this, people can preserve the value of humanity and wealthy nations are able to help the refugees."
