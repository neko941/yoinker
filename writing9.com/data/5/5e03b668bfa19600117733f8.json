        "With the changing scanerio and diverse needs of society, problem of traffic congestion and living space has been increased at rocket speed. In order to crub this situation government should take intitative to move businesses from big cities to country sides. However, pros in this phenomenon has overwiegh its cons which i will discuss in subsequent paragraphs.",
        "In commence with its advantages, this trend would definately help the masses of rural areas to get better job oppertunties in thier native palace. They donot need to migrate big cities for searching better future. Consequencly traffic and accomodation problem of metro cities should be restrain to great extent. Moreover, if more industries are developed in areas other than cities it would results into utlisation of natural resources in better way. For instance, in recent report by The tribune magzine that industrial area developed in outer parts of delhi not only help the people to get job but also reduce the level of pollution in delhi.",
        "However, it may arise problems for organistations as cost of adminstration cost has been drastically increased while setting bussiness in rural areas because they need to set their offices both in cities and rural area in order to compete demands of customers. Furthermore, it rise transportation cost as raw material send to units and finish product tranfer to wharehouses which also required more personnel for handling this process.",
        "To conclude, government should setting business units in rural parts of countries so that cities are free from huge traffic and accomdation problems."
