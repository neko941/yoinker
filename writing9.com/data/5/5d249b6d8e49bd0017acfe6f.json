        "People like to learn the foreign languages for the various purposes. There is a controversy between the fats that, the overseas languages are learnt only for travelling or working purposes in a foreign country or not. This essay will discuss, why people make themselves skillful in other languages not only for the jobs or tours, but also for the prosperity of their own cultures.",
        "First of all, to get any job or to travel in any specific country, it is certain that people have to learn the language of that nation, in order to confirm the easy conversation. Moreover, in some countries, where English is not being spoken by the natives, though English is an international language, it would become hard for anyone who does not know the language to chat with the citizens. For example, the Japanese like to speak Japanese language rather than English. As a result, if anyone want to visit Japan or get involved in any work there, he or she needs to have knowledge in Japanese language.",
        "On the other hand, the benefit of learning other languages excluding the native one, is not limited in the boundaries of workplace or tourism, rather it helps to enrich the local languages too. It is obvious that, when the natives practice the other languages, as well as, their own one, they insert variety of vocabularies within their language, which flourish it. For example, the word \u2018Biology\u2019 came from the Greek language and being used in English to mention the knowledge about the living one.",
        "For the mentioned reasons, I personally think that, the exercise of overseas languages should be continued not only for professional and personal purposes, but also for the enhancement of own languages."
