        "Travelling in the modern era has become easier than ever before. Although, tourism brings more employment opportunities and money in a nation, it does come at a tangible cost. Because of the high traffic of foreingn nationals, the residents of popular travel destinations have to suffer, especially in the peak season and most tourists are known for polluting such beautiful places.",
        "When people travel to a city, they need basic grocery items, place to stay and restaurants to eat at. These requirements open up a large number of business and employment avenues for its residents. Kuala Lumpur, for instance, attracts a huge number of tourists every year, this allows numerous hotels, restaurants, taxi service and other related businesses to thrive and for people of the city to earn their livelihood. Moreover, tourism contirbutes immensely to the gross domestic product (GDP) of the countries with popular desinations.",
        "With the advent of social media, small cities and rural areas with rich culture or stunning nature become an instant hit with the masses. Consequently, tourists flock to these places causing plenty of problems for the locals. For example, last year in the city of Barcelona, the prices of groceries in the summer went up by a record forty percent. This forced the natives to leave the city and spend their summer somewhere else. Furthermore, the cities which are underprepared to handle such masses get polluted by the amount of waste generated by the travellers.",
        "On the one hand increased tourism helps nations and its citizens to grow economically but, on the other hand, by polluting the famous desitnations it creates an imbalance to their fragile environmental and social ecosystems."
