        "These days, there is a growing trend of looking for family background and history amongst young generations. From my point of view, the main reason for this phenomenon is family reunion after separated during World War, and there are many upsides since the tourism can have a lot of benefits through foreign people want to comeback their homeland.",
        "In my opinion, people are searching for their origin to reunite with their separated relatives since war emigration. During that hard time, people constantly moved from this refuge to another, so they easily lost contact with their relatives. For instance, during Vietnam war, many citizens including my grandfather had gone to neighboring countries and continued to live after that. He told a lot of stories about Vietnam and his childhood to us, and his last wish before passed away is we will come back to Viet Nam and reunite with all relatives. After 10 years searching, we finally find out my family in Ho Chi Minh, Viet Nam.",
        "I believe the most advantages of this trend is that it will boost the tourism industry since many foreign want to go back and visit their hometown. Take my neighbor as an example, a few months ago, their cousin had gone back from America after searching for his hometown to meet his family. They bursted into tears and could not control their feeling. He stayed with them 5 days and had to go back but he promised he would come visit my neighbor twice a year and also bring his friends.",
        "In conclusion, younger people are looking for their family origin to reunite with their relatives and this will have many upsides to the tourism industry."
