        "Sport personality and entertainer have gain popularity across the world over the decade. Recently, people said that the government need to play their part to help students to participate sport and art activities as much as they did to professional entertainer and sports star. I completely agree with that notion.",
        "Learning art and sport at a young age stimulates their mind into creative thinking. In the era where people spend majority of their time on smart gadgets, children are less exposed to physical games and art craft causing them to become dull and lethargy. Therefore, the higher authority should place more effort in invigorating them on the importance of these types of ventures. In turn, more and more pupil will join and perform making them more versatile and unique in their own way.",
        "Furthermore, the government should collaborate with the school administrators to create a platform where students able to showcase their talent. For example, national sport competition and young artist competition are held for those who are interested in showcasing their talent. With more stages like this, talented child will receive the support and the recognition, inspired them to become famous artist or athletes in future. These youth deserved to obtain incentive from the government to further develop their skills.",
        "To sum up, although rooting for professional people is beneficial but I think that students need the encouragement as equal as all famous artist and athletes out there since the latter begins from young age. Who knows, this children will make the nation proud someday."
