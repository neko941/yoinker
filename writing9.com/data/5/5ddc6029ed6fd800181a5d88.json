        "In recent times, a lot of people hardly spend much time in their homes. There are several predisposing factors responsible for these occurrences such as economic hardship, tight work schedules amongst others. These effects also have implications on the health of the individual and the society in general.",
        "The first reason why I think people do not spend quality time with their loved ones could be as a result of the economic crisis of the country. People engage in different activities in other to provide the basic amenities for their immediate and extended family. For this reason, they utilize most of their time either on the streets or at their place of work.",
        "Another reason to consider is work schedule of most parents. Many adults who are working in the private sector spend an average of nine to ten hours at the workplace. For instance, bankers are meant to resume their duty by 7.00am and close by 5.00pm. Even after the official closing time, they stay back to make sure that the account for the day\u2019s transactions are balanced. More so, these individuals get to relax only on weekends if they are not called upon to reconcile their accounts. As a result of this, they hardly get the opportunity to bond with their family at home.",
        "However, the resultant consequences of these actions affect the health of people in numerous ways. People tend to breakdown because of accumulated stress and in worse cases they might even slump and loss their lives. For example, studies have shown that 45 to 55 percent of people do not go for routine medical checkup because of limited time and tight work schedules. In addition, most people who do not find time to bond with their spouse and children. More specifically, these individuals become socially estranged from the society. They become loners and alienated from the social world because of their workaholic nature.",
        "In conclusion, it seems that the outcome of spending less time with  immediate family significantly affect the individuals as well as the society in general."
