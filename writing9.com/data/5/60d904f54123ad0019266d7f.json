        "There are some single-sex schools existing around the world, but not in a large quantity. Single-sex school is a education approach that student learning under the environment that only has single gender, but mixed-sex school is normal. I think mixed-sex school is better for students to improve themselves and is sexual equality.",
        "The main reason of creating single-sex schools is that school can maximising the utility of their education resources. Different gender thinking in different ways and may good at different subjects. Male may more specialise in science lessons than female, and female may be more consistent in arts and humanities lessons. Also, after they graduated, most of males chose science related fields as their jobs and females chose humanities respectively. If teachers educating single gender students like male, they can concentrate more human or finance resources into science related subjects to improve their education quality. In addition, single-sex schools are useful for preventing younger students from early relationship which may highly affect their education performance.",
        "However, students should try different subjects, but it will be very queer if a female student want to learn her favourite subjects but only popular in a male school. Mixed-sex school should be a better structure to offer diverse options for students. According to some reports, female students studying at mixed-sex schools were more likely to explore and concentrate on the non-traditional familiarising subjects like physics and physical--due to the classmates teamwork and without feeling loneliness. Moreover, male and female have different strengths and their thinking approaches are slight different, that is good for the development of some subjects. For example, in management and law classes, different gender students have different views, males may consider more about the practical sides and females in the emotional sides, which can be exchanged and improved easily.",
        "In my opinion, it is important to have mixed-sex schools. In additional to the above advantage of mixed-sex school, school is mirroring the real world, students should learn how to communicate, especially between different gender. Separating student with different gender may create a communication barrier between them in the future. It also a important factor of the developments of students."
