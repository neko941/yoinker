        "It is sometimes argued that since it is impossible for us to help everyone out, we should only consider about our neighbors or citizens in our country. While I understand the importance of assisting our neighbors, I don't agree with the assertion that people living in our communities should be our only focus.",
        "There are several reasons why people would attach greater importance to help our neighbors as well as other residents in the same countries.  For starters, there is no doubt that it seems far more reasonable to provide support to someone we are familiar with rather than some strangers living in a country far way. In addition, if we offer help to someone living in the same communities, we are more likely to observe the actual improvement that our assistances have brought. Which could certainly make us feel more fullfilled. Finally, the whole process are far more transparent and easily to supervise compared with making donations to some sorts of non-government organizations.",
        "Nonetheless, it does not necessarily mean that helping people lived nearby should be our only target, we should try to help as more people as possible.  Even though we cannot expect to help every person in the world tha is in need of help, with the same amount of funds, sometimes it could benefit a larger group of peole if we donate it to some impoverished area in other part of the world. Especially for those who are suffering from famine, even the smallest amount of donation could possibly save some life whereas the same amount of funds could hardly change anything if we only focus on people in our own countries. Furthermore, if we turn a blind eye to other parts of the world that need aids,  when some horrible epidemic diseases start to spread from those areas, we are facing the same risk as well. It is shortsighted to remain indifferent.",
        "In conclusion, while I understand why people prefer to help their neighbors, I believe we should try to help a broader group of people."
