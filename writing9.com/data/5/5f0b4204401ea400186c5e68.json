        "It is no secret that a wedding is the most expensive party most people will throw. Some people believe that it is important to spend a lot of money on such a special day while others believe that it is not worth it. This assay will discuss why I partially disagree on spending money on a wedding.",
        "The main reason why it is worth spending money on a wedding is the feeling of joy when you share moments of happiness with your closest people. A wedding is a very special occasion and people choose to throw an expensive party in order to satisfy their guests and themselves. Also, a well organized party usually depends on the amount of money you spend and usually the couple decides to invest more money so they needn\u2019t have to stress for the details. If a couple has the money for an expensive wedding then why not?",
        "On the other hand, a fancy party is not always required for sharing your joy and happiness. Some people believe that battering the bank account for a wedding is not thoughtful at all. This money could be invested for personal development, such as starting a small business or buying a new house. Also, the wedding budget can be used for charitable purposes rather than being spent on fancy parties.",
        "This assay discussed the personal preferences of couples who choose to spend a lot of money on their wedding and the opposite opinion which claims that it is a waste of money.In my opinion, If a couple has the money to spend on an expensive wedding is a personal decision however, using the money for other puposes is much wiser."
