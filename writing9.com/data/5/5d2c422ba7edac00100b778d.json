        "In some places, the students stay at home with their parent when they study at univeristy. On the other hand, some students attend univeristy far away from their hometown. In my opinion, the advantages of studying away from home during universtiy outweigh the disadvantages.",
        "There are multiples benefits of living away form homw while the studnets study for univeristy degree. Staying alone in another city makes them to learn the responsibility. Take an example, they have to do their personal activities such as washing, cooking and they also have to learn their lessons simutaneously so that they are able to manage their time efficiently. Besides, their problem solving skills can improve while they stay in another place without their family. It means that they must solve the problems they face whether it is major or minor, for instance, when they have health problem, they have to go clinic and take care all by themselves.",
        "However, the students can also have some drawbacks while they are away from their parent. The primary disadvantage is, of course, the accomodation. Most of the students live in narrow and small room in hostel or apartment without privacy. Furthermore, they may have some problems with their room mate. Apart form that, the students may have home scikness and feel lonesome sometimes. Those problems can happen while they study in another city.",
        "From my point of view, staying alone in another place has many good impacts on students like the problem solving skill abd their interpersonal skill and they can improve those skills by solving problems while they stay alone. Those skills are very important experiences for their future.",
        "In conclusion, although there are some minor disadvantages of living alone, the students can explore many life experiences while staying alone and this can make them more mature people."
