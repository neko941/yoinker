        "In the olden days, majority of individuals were multitalented but as time passed the idea of expertise in different fields became an old fashioned one. Nowadays, people pay attention to establish a single career and are less inclined towards being a polymath.",
        "To begin with, in the past, local people had huge amount of time when compared with the times we live in today. Thus, they had plenty of time on their hands to master a new skill. However, at present, life in urban cities is fast-paced. Therefore, they don\u2019t want to indulge in learning DIY (Do it yourself) skills.",
        "Secondly, the major factor for the decrease in the trend is somewhat contributed to the fact, that it was quite difficult to find manual labor. Currently, professional and inexpensive labor is easily found. Additionally, it also requires a lot of effort, energy and time to learn a new ability. In spite of, spending time to efficiently increase the existing skill, individual would like to spend some quality time with their families. To put it eloquently, in early days, females used to sew their own clothes. But this positive trend began to sharply reduce when branded clothes arose in the markets and shopping malls. As a result, people started buying from markets as it was affordable and was not a hassle for millennial.",
        "Lastly, in my country, Pakistan, there is a gradual decline but a handful of people still possess these skills. For instance, my grandparents knew to plough, stitch their clothes and even knew plumbing. In contrast, I only know a little about plumbing. Hence, these skills are vanishing as me and my parents had not intended to learn them.",
        "To conclude, human beings possessed plethora of traditional skills. In addition, people don\u2019t get much time or they want to establish a healthier lifestyle with a single career. However, in my opinion, we should learn multiple/ different/ more skills so that we are not dependent on others."
