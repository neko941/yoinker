        "These days technology is changing all aspects of our life like pay methods, shopping, entertainment and etc. one of the most changes have occurred in communication and it totally have shaped a new form. But it has its effects and it could be affect our life and health.",
        "One of the advantages of high-tech communication is, we can connect with together each where we are. There is no need to stay at home and wait for calls and pay lot of money for it. Technology makes it easy as we can see together by video call and talk to our family and friends where we are. For example students study abroad can communicate with their parents and can see each other every time. Another positive effect could be useful in emergency status. An unknown virus was spreading all over the world and government heralded a quarantine condition and said that all citizens had to stay at home. So there was only one way to communicate with each other and do their job such as sending files, presenting in lectures and staying in touch with teachers for students.",
        "However, it has its own disadvantages too. Technology makes we connect with others at home. So we go out less and our body\u2019s activity reduces. It probably causes many diseases in our body like increasing fat and weakness of our muscles. Also it\u2019s possible high-tech communication causes we are more inward-looking. Technology of mobiles and computers makes we don\u2019t present in society and don\u2019t meet real new persons. So in some circumstance our character is changing to being introvert.",
        "In my opinion this type of technology is so practical and makes we can have many features. Also it has its negative impacts but we can reduce it. For example I try to use it less and often talk to my friend to meet each other in parks or cinema. Also I try do exercise in home and stay my body fit.",
        "Finally it\u2019s a effective and helpful shape of technology and we shouldn\u2019t confront it. We all must be aware of its effects and educate to others how they should face it. We can control it by limiting use of them and so use its positives features"
