        "In the past few decades, uses of motor vehicle for transportation has augmented in all big cities over the world which turns to immense traffic congestion. It is evident that cities are offering better living than countryside. However, I am strongly disagree with the statement because this way will compound the problem rather than solve it.",
        "For the first place, burgs are struggling with the accommodation and living with current inhabitant\u2019s .Though cities offering good job and secured life, there is a limit to number of population that a city can house. The more the population increased the denser the accommodation, consequently the quality of living will go downhill. For Instance, Dhaka is the capital city of Bangladesh where dwelling place become out of commission and outbreaks of pollution in each sector of basic needs such as foodstuff, transportation, health sector etc.",
        "Moreover, Increase residents in cities put sanitation system into a hazard. If migration to cities are welcomed to solve unruly traffic congestion, this will give birth more basic needs and some what extent cities waste management disastrous to meet up it. As a result cities become filthier and less healthy. While population raised government and civic authorities need to gear up the public transport which most of the time generate colossal traffic blocked and killed our valuable working hour.",
        "Finally, Traffic congestion can be shrink without Centralization of cities in different ways. One of the focal point is to establish skilled traffic manpower and ensure proper utilization of laws.",
        "To conclude. I hold the firm belief that, encouraging people for city migration cannot solve the problem. Any such move will only worsen the quality of life in metropolises as most of them are pugnacious to meet the demand of their existing populace."
