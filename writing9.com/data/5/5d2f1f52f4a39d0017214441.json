        "Some people believe that those having money and without money face problems to have access to the university. I partially agree with this notion. It is my opinion that accessing university is much harder for the poor people.",
        "On the one hand, I believe that there is certain criteria to qualify to get access to the universities. For example, students have to clear entrance exams to get admission to particular courses. Those who qualify these criterias get a reach to the higher education Institutions. Therefore, there is no difference of being wealthy or poor.",
        "On the other hand, universities  these days offer seats  in various courses against donations. Students from well-off families are in a position to pay these donations. Hence, it becomes possible for them to get access to these places. However, those lacking funds are deprived of these facilities. In addition to this, sometimes rich people are able to influence the authorities of higher educational institutions in favour of their children. This influence acts as a gateway for their younger ones to enter into the universities.",
        "To conclude, access to university is hard to get when universities rely on qualifying criteria. However, in some cases, rich people succeed in manipulating the authorities of these universities by influencing them with donations."
