        "In recent years, deforestation has become a major debate around the globe. This poses a great danger to the environment as well as the eco system yet still occurring at a great degree. The main reason behind this is the provision of employment especially in undeveloped areas. There has also been recorded merits to this such as provision of furnitures, books as well as cooking utensils. This essay will discuss in length reasons why cutting of trees are occurring and some advantages of these.",
        "The main reason why falling of trees is still occurring, is because of employment. Many individuals live and survive solely on tree falling to provide for their families. This has become a source of living to many people and this involves buying and selling. Take for example, in Ogun State, a major city in Nigeria, recorded about 70% of it's population surviving only on deforestation as a means of survival, according to the Daily Times in 1998. If the government would provide more job opportunities for members of it\u2019s society this would reduce the cutting of trees in different regions.",
        "However, while there are great demerits on the environment there are also some merits to this. One of such includes, the provision of furnitures such as chairs and tables and books. Wood gotten from falling trees are used to make paper which in turn are used for books and also to produce furnitures. Take for instance, the yearly African Art exhibitions, which showcases diverse African hand crafted furnitures. These furnitures are produced from the end product of trees. In addition, they can be used to produce cooking utensils such as fire woods. Needless to say, there are still a few advantages to deforestation.",
        "In conclusion, while there are real dangers to tree logging, there are also some benefits to this. This act is still being practiced in various regions across the globe. Provision of other sources of employment would reduce this act and make the society great again."
