        "Globalization makes similar goods available in many parts of the world and result in growing likeness amongst countries. This essay posits that the growing likeness amongst countries is a negative development because it may lead to extinction of tradition or culture and it may impact the tourism sector of a country.",
        "Firstly, as countries become more and more similar, local tradition and values are endangered. As globalisation has encroached into many parts of our lives, we are no stranger to foreign foods, music and other products unknown to generations before us. Sundanese traditional music is struggling to gain a large Indonesian fan base that Korean Pop currently enjoys. Modern shampoos are daily cleansing products for Indonesians, who may have never tried traditional haircare herbal concoctions in their whole lives. Traditional products that are rarely used or appreciated may go into obscurity and vanish eventually. The declining popularity of traditional products lead to fewer practitioner, reduced availability of ingredients and wisdom that accompany them. One\u2019s identity is jeopardised when her culture is vanishing.  Thus, the growing similarity of countries that result in declining usage of traditional products is a negative development.",
        "Secondly, global tourism, a major economic growth driver, thrives because of the uniqueness aspects that a country presents, one of which is culture distinct from one\u2019s own. A traveller may be less inclined to spend time and money experiencing something that is similar to the one at home. As a result, some places risk of losing their attractiveness in the burgeoning global tourism industry and thus foregoing tourism income. A bustling metropolis like Jakarta with its hundreds of shopping centres has relatively little to offer culturally for visitor who comes from other global cities. The economic consequence of developing a more universal, homogeneous culture shows the negative aspect of this development.",
        "In summary, growing similarities amongst countries is a negative development that we should take heed off. Considering the negative consequences of cultural extinction and the reduction of tourism income, we should take action to preserve our cultural heritage for our own good and for the generations to come."
