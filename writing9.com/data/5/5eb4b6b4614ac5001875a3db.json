        "Some people prefer to doing the same things in their whole life instead of change for more interesting as other believe. From my view, I love to change myself in positive ways and become the best vision of me and that is the reason why I want to find something new and do it.",
        "On the one hand, there are some behaviours that we need to maintain due to these will be good for our health. For example: read book everyday, do exercises, do meditation or travel one time per every year. This all things can improve your health, your lifestyle better day by day. And we need to keep doing optimistic activities like that, do not need to change.",
        "On the other hand, try something different will show you more experiences, you can get a fascinating life. Instead of read the same genre of book, let\u2019s change to other topic; still do exercises but in a brand new creative way. Travel can give you knowledges about the place where you go, let\u2019s go to more countries instead of just go around in Vietnam. For example, you can live like the way you want to live: wake up, go to school during 8 hours, come back home and go to the extra classes, go home to do the homework and then go to bed. This chain of actions repeat everyday and make you feel bored but you do not want to change because you lazy or shy. Whatever the reason is, you are wasting your time to have a meaningful life.",
        "In the conclusion, if there is the thing you know that is good for yourself keep going, but if you feel there is something wrong or bored in the way you go through it, change it. We just live one time, live a meaningful life."
