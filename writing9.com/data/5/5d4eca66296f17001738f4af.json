        "The role of globalisation in the proliferation of English language all over the world is widely debated, with many people claiming that thanks to globalisation, other languages and cultures will gain more exposure and threated the dominance of English language. However, I do not entirely accept this and I will explain why in this essay, when we do not agree with the statement. Note: (In my opinion this notion merits serious consideration. \u2013 we write this when we agree with the statement)",
        "There are a myriad of reasons why English will gain more popularity. The conspicuous one is that thanks to globalisation, the interaction between people from different languages and diverse cultural background will inevitably increase. As English is already the most widely used language throughout the world, not only will it help people to communicate effectively with each other, but it will also be embraced more and more people. This is because lack of knowledge in English is likely to leave them segregate from the ever changing world. Needless to say, this universal appeal of English will keep it in a preponderant position, as far as of it is concerned.",
        "Another pivotal argument in favour of English language is that now English is the language of Science, Commerce, trade, arts, history, literature, media, entertainment and what not. Unlike in the past, when the world was not much connected without a common language. Hence, the likelihood that English will thrive, flourish and spread rapidly is very high.",
        "In view of the arguments outlined above, one can conclude that the apprehension that English language will lose its value because of globalisation is ungrounded indeed."
