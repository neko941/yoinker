        "Yes, the world\u2019s work culture has changed a lot where most of the people tend to work for extended duration than their regular shift hours leaving less time for free time activities. I would say in comparison there is more cons than pros.",
        "Let\u2019s go through the overall realistic picture of the cons associated with the above criteria. Firstly, I would say staying long time affects long term health efficiency and causes detrimental effect to the body if leisure time is less. For instance, if people don\u2019t exercise regularly with intense cardio then their stress increases with diseases to follow such as obesity, diabetes and what not. All the body parts start losing its energy if very less time is dedicated also causing problems to husband wife relationship who might have been waiting to do leisure activity together and this might disrupt peace of mind.",
        "Secondly, you would not dedicate more time to leisure activities you would not be fit and well structured. For example, when I had been to Short Service Selection for navy, there was a test where individuals had to clear obstacles like jumping from high platform, crossing a small patch of puddle with the help of rope, balancing the body on a slanted structure which was difficult for me because of bad fitness, if I would have spent more leisure time time well I could have reduced my weight and would have qualified to serve the navy.",
        "Lastly, I would say if we have kids we cannot spend quality time with them if we stay more hours in office, usually many parents take their children to swimming class, so there will be a gap between such relations since going to swimming with children is also a part of leisure activities. There might be any such examples even can\u2019t cook food if we stay at office and would end up ordering unhealthy junk food.",
        "To conclude  I would say there is more cons then pros and it is essential to give more preference to leisure activities based on the above mentioned situations."
