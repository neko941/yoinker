        "Many people believe that life in urban areas is much better than in countrysides, while some of them think the opposite. I personally agree that cities as places to live are much more preferable than the villages. But nevertheless, this essay will discuss both views.\rCity is thought by some individuals to be the best place to live. There are a lot of opportunities for business and cooperation with big companies in urban areas for everyone, so a person who lives there can make a good career ladder for himself. I absolutely agree with that point of view and start-ups here are the best example, as 98% of them, according to the statistics, have been launched in big cities over the last 20 years in China. If they had not been located in such places as their ones, they would have failed all their beginnings in business.\r\rOn the other hand, whether living in cities is better than in rural areas is also a controversial topic for some humans to discuss about, because they believe that countryside is more beneficial for them. The main reason of that view is a good environment and ecological situation out of cities. They opine that in villages there is a clear air and a lot of greenery, while cities are very polluted and have very little pure nature in them. However, I do not agree with that as cities today are getting greened too and as a result, atmosphere is becoming cleaner than it was before. To cite an example, in the city of New York there will have been planted more than a million trees by 2040. This example shows that the ecology in cities is not so contaminated as some people believe.\rIn conclusion, cities give a lot of chances to make a career for a person and some individuals think that in villages there is a better environment, but looking at all the opportunities urban areas provide and also improving environment conditions in them, people must choose cities as a place to live."
