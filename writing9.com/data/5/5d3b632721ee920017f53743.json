        "In recent times, there has been a move towards having small family unit as opposed to large family. The exigencies of the modern times has made it so given that small family is easier to run and maintain and its cost effective however it has its drawbacks.",
        "A typical small families consist of a mother, father and a\u00a0 child or two children. This small size of family is beneficial because its easy to run and maintain. The cost of school fees, feeding and taking care of the basic necessities of a child has greatly increased in recent times. Small family therefore becomes desirable as the parents can easily train their child to any educational level thereby giving them quality education and can also afford to provide quality lifestyle for their child. Also the government will benefit from the small unit of family as the child support the government provides for each child will be less and the social amenities will not be over stretched.",
        "On the other hand, while small family unit is attractive, it can have it's negative impact on the population of a country as the population will decrease in the long run. Also increase in small family unit will lead to less workforce and labour.\u00a0 As the parents gets older, the younger population may not be enough to fill in the vacancies and labour requirements left by the older generation and this in turn will affect the economy of the country negatively. Furthermore, the life of a child is not guaranteed and if peradventure a parent loses their only child, this can be traumatic and will render the parents childless and if\u00a0 child grows and decides not to take care of his/her parents, this can also send the parents to an early grave especially in our African setting where there are no facilities to take care of old people and parents rely on their children to take care of them.",
        "In conclusion, though a small sized family is desirable, it can lead to low work force in the long run which will affect the economy and the parents stands a greater risk of being childless if they lose their only child."
