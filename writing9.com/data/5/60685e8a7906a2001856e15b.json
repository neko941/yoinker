        "Nowadays  experts throughout both the developing and developed world have debated whether prison is the best way to decrease the number of offences or providing better education could solve the problem of crime in the modern world. This essay will discuss both sides using examples from the latest research to demonstrate points and prove arguments.",
        "Firstly, developed countries with affordable education systems have less criminal rate than Third World countries, where education is poor and unnecessary. I could propose that the crucial reason this phenomena is that education gives us possibility for work, because it develops various skills and knowledge. Tus, people could earn money legally. In addition, schooling instills ideas of good and evil. Therefore, crime could be predicted by providing a better education.",
        "The second reason why I agree, however, is that, nowadays the world has a huge amount of criminals,especially in disadvantaged countries.  I am not a supporter of prison, but if they are released from prison, then there is a high probability that they will commit crimes again. Recent research of American Psychological Association showed that people who commited a crime once, they have a higher probability to do it again, than people who never broke the law. Therefore, prison is a necessary measure for public safety.",
        "In conclusion, from the arguments and examples given I firmly believe that education could predict crime, having raised honest and respectable people, which is important, giving them knowledge and the ability to earn a living without breaking the laws."
