        "Food is being thrown away by many people, which is major cause of concern as there are many places around the world where people die of hunger. There might be several reasons for food wastage such as excess quantity of food prepared or when the food get spoiled etc. Proper steps are to be taken to resolve this issue.",
        "The main reasons for food wastage are the left over food from the restaurants or canteens and the other is the food which gets spoiled  when it is not properly preserved. Firstly, we see many food joints  like resturants, canteens opening in large number these days. They prepare food as per their estimations which sometimes deficit the quantity of food or surplus it. This left over food is thrown away as neither they are serve it the next day nor they can give it to someone at midnight. Another point to consider is amount of food which gets spoilt. For instance, foods such as leafy vegetables, beans, pulses etc. gets easily spoiled due to the weather or sometimes due to humidity. These are to be properly perserved in refrigerators or to be kept in a dry place if not it gets spoiled and gets wasted.",
        "In order to resolve this problem one has to realize the importance of food and try to reduce the wastage. This could be done by cooking  in limited quantity, even after this if anything is left that could be given to needy people near public places or could be feed to animals. For example, a woman from banglore has intiatied a service near Balandur Bus stop, where she has installed a refrigerator which could be used by people near by. All the left over food is placed here and whoever is in need can take it from the fridge. This not able helps to reduce wastage but also prevents the food from getting spoilt. These measure should be adapted by everyone which would lead to a better society.",
        "To conclude, although I think we have many reasons for wasting food but we should now have an initiative and reduce its wastage by properly preserving it and providing it to needy people."
