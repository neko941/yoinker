        "It is thought by some that young people don\u2019t practice sport because of the huge amount of sport channels on the television in lot of countries.",
        "Even though I agree that television makes people lazier, especially by watching professional athletes, there are other reasons why teenagers do not take part in sport activities.",
        "People waste lot of time on the sofa watching the television, preferring the sport on the screen than practice activities themselves. This comes to be true also for young people which instead should be involved in physical activities both for health and socialisation issues. For instance, football matches are followed by most and represent one of the main topics of discussion in classroom and outside. The sport in the television is always performed by high levels athletes and this can cause a loss of self-esteem. Moreover, the time resource is limited and if young people spend a lot of time on sport channels, they do not have time to enjoying the outdoor activities.",
        "On the other hand, I believe that also social networks and computer games contribute on the lost time. Nowadays, young people are fully surrounded by technology and they prefer to be home and be \u201cconnected\u201d in some virtual world than live the real world. As a result, they lose the connection with their body and its possibilities.",
        "To conclude, sporty television programmes have huge impact on discouraging young people to take part in sport activities, but also other technology innovations have a role in that. In my opinion parents should encourage their children in outdoor sports such as hiking, climbing, kayaking to contribute on their psychical and physic health."
