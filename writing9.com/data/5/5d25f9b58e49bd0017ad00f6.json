        "A widespread belief by most individuals is that prevention of diseases exceeds the treatment. This essay will completely agree with the notion that financial investments should be geared towards avoiding sicknesses because of the exorbitant prices involved in both researching and proffering cures.",
        "Firstly, a stitch in time saves nine, and this implies that the likelihood of disease outbreaks will be inhibited. When monetary savings are rather channelled to the stoppage of certain illnesses, the probability of the spread will be minimal. Take, for instance, malaria, which is predominantly found in Western Africa. Research has shown that one of the ways to curb this ill-health is to use mosquito nets, as mosquitoes are the sole transmitters. Hence, when the government uses its resources to purchase and subsidize these nets, the rate of malaria will drastically reduce.",
        "Another important factor worth mentioning is that it is cost effective to indulge in the preventive techniques only, rather than simultaneously combining both the innovative studies with the treatments. Lots of scientific studies had been conducted in the field of malaria, with significant results, and so, the government should be interested in proffering more curative mechanisms to avoid the prevalence of these diseases.",
        "To sum up, the huge costs incurred from both the empirical research and sickness elimination are the major reasons why there should be a proper focus. In other words, it will be more worthwhile if there is a divergence of funds to the solutions of these malignant issues."
