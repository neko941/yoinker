        "Many people supports that, the childrens are having advantages from the TV and they should watch it, but others think that childrens should not spend time on TV. There are some both pros and cons about these views. I agree that , childrens have to be know how to manage time and this essay will discuss the both sides of argument.",
        "On the one hand, the specific benefits about spending time on TV are generally related with information and knowladge. For example, some reserchs showns that, the most affective way to lear a new language is to watch TV series on the TV in that languages which is wanted to learn. Moreover, sometimes the TV series are might be useful even in own language to practicing grammar and refreshing out to vocabulary. As a consequence, reserchers which is supporting to watch Tv have got strong evidences about good effects of watching TV. However,",
        "there are some extremely hazardous cons about spending a lot of time on TV.",
        "On the other hand, there are also a lot of supporters which are supporting to TV has to be banned for childrens. The main and the most efficient reason for this view is the side effects about childrens health and growing process. To illustrate that, there are some diseases which are causesome harmful consequneces such as, epilepsy. These kind of diseases may injure or even kill. The best way to protect children is limit to the time and then close to the device. Otherwise, it may become a kind of addiciton which is will be a waste of time for that child. These are extremely high prices to pay for a moment of fun.",
        "In conclusion, spending a lot of time might be bad for childrens future. In my opinion, the most accurate way to solve this problem is having a balanced routine between both sides and limit the time in spending time on TV. Although, one day child wants to watch more TV, parents which is resposible on their child have to be diciplined and strict on their routine to protect their child in a accurate way."
