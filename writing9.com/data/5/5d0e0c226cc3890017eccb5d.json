        "Climate change is an increasingly growing issue nowadays. While some argue that it is the responsibility of developed countries to combat this, others are on the opinion that all ought to have equal ownership on this. This essay will discuss both the view and the reason why I believe that developed nations should take the lead.",
        "One the one hand, many are on the opinion that climate change is a global issue and everyone should fight together on this arena; be it a rich country or a poor one. It is not the sole duty of developed nation to come up with solution since this is affecting the whole world. How much ever small one contributes, it will add up to the effort that others are making to tackle the detrimental situation that our earth is currently in.",
        "On the other hand, other believe that it is the responsibility of developed countries to take the lead since they don't have any other issues to handle unlike other small developing nations. Poor countries struggle to meet their basic necesities and hence their is the limit to which they can contribute to a big global issue like this. Moreover, since rich nations contribute more to pollution and gas emissions from various means, it does makes sence to take a more firm stand on this problem and thereby guiding and helping others to fight for one common issue. Their technological advancements will definitely give them an edge over others.",
        "To conclude, all are equally responsible for the world as a whole and everyone should fight hard to save the earth. In my opinion, even though all countries have equal ownership on this issue, being stable and wealthy makes developed nations the front runners and they should be the leaders."
