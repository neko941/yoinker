        "Every child is creative in their own way, and it is very much possible to bring out their inner self by letter them show how the world from their point of view. Therefore for which they must be allowed to make small decisions such as food, clothes, and entertainment by themselves or the things that matter to children. Hence, I believe it is important to give them the freedom to make their own choices.",
        "Children are a constant learner and they learn from their parents, like how to behave and how to make small decisions. Nowadays parents are involving children in making small household decisions. It is proven that children who make decisions in the early stages of their life, trend to make better decisions with more sophisticated issues. Hence constant decision making leading to better life decisions.",
        "I believe children who make the decision at an early age are less dependent on parents in the latter part of their life, they might not depend on parent's income and come up with their own plan for income.",
        "In our country, individuals' children depend on family choices, hence tend to make the wrong decision in their life when concerning bigger problems.",
        "Therefore, I believe individual children must be allowed to make their decision at an early age, which would be a greater good for the children, family, society and also for the economy."
