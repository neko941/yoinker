        "Parents play a central role in children's life. However, in many communities the responsibilities of mother and father are divided according to their role. In this essay I will not only discussed the duties of parents, but also represents the patenting roles in the upcoming future.",
        "Apparently, the role of mother is to nurture their child. This is because mother take care of their child, and they spend a large amount of time together, which creates emotional bonding. Besides this, mothers understand their children moods, and like and dislike as per, which creates feeling of love and affection. For instance, mother always cook their children's favorite meal, so Young's could enjoy it with ease. Although father's role  is to provide financial support to their juveniles, for their holistic development. To explain further, fatherhood is based on practical approach, and they behaviours toward  their wards is stringent, which is necessary for becoming better human in the society. Along with this, father provides better education to their youth, also take them for recreational activities, which helps to build better a  relationship. Thus, mother's duty is give love to their youngs, and at the same time father helps their child in providing education.",
        "Paradoxically, in the future situation might change tremendously, and the chief reason for this that both parents will be working for fulfilling their child desires. In the upcoming time, mother's duties will be changed, they will not only take the responsibility of dropping their children at school, but also paying their juvenile's fees. Besides this, children will be self-reliant at the earlier age, due to their working parents. According to the recent survey has been conducted by the Children Wealth Organization reveals that, more than 65% of females hardly able to spend time with their youngs,  because to they are more include in work. In contrast, fathers will take all households responsibilities. This is because both couples have hectic work schedules in the future, therefore they cook the food for family and even feed their child which helps them to maintain their Lifestyle. Hence, this will be scenerio in the future.",
        "In conclusion, parenting role role is vital for upbringing of child. Nonetheless, the circumstances will definitely changed as per their families requirements, but love and nurturing to their child will never change for the sustainable future."
