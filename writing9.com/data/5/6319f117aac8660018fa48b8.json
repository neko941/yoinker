To explanation, juveniles have a deep passion to seeking on the internet and finding new attractive matters.

In addition researches have shown that not only using cellphone as a faster and portable gadget would not be lucrative but also would intensify their exposure to harm contents. Secondly, due to phone addiction among children, the rate of time consuming of using smart phone were increased. This phenomenon leads to disrupt in their learning course of action.",
