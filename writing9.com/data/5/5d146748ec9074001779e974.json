        "Although, some people say that the government ought to allocate more money spent budget to rail then Roadways. However, I support the given statement to a large extent.  my inclination is elabroated in the ensuing paragraphs with reasons and example.",
        "Out of all the reason, the formost one is investing in a modern chain system will mean that people can get around the country faster. This is a  most of the general public or train passenger to not have to deal with the congestion most road User experience and send can achieve much highest and then cars there for most of people will spend less time computing and more time doing something more productive productive and this will benefit of entire Society. for instance, the Indian government recently valued plan to connect city in the Jammu to Mumbai with high speed Rail Network and this will reduce computing time by half , of people work in Mumbai.",
        "Another reason, for my support is few decades number of train accident are decrease and more people save their lives. while, road accident day to day high so lot of mankind lost their life. Also, Railway use cold Diesel And electricity as their source of fuel so global warming problem most of less than roads. it is a not cost-effective to develop rail infrastructure in small village where is rural infrastructure are cost effective in such places.furthermore, rail are best transportation to people as well as goods transport to one place to another place.",
        "Finally,there is an Road are most helpful for going to small area and Hill places. easy to go to near place to another destination. While, rail can not go every small places and hill places.Road journey helpful for enjoying nature beauty as well as Hotel food  moreover, Road are most significantly for city life.",
        "To sum up, government should spend more money in rail budget. while, road are also helpful for city area and small destination which mankind  going to one place to another place."
