        "Nowadays, help has been arriving from international communities to upcoming countries. Some people think that the developing societies should be given money while others are of the opinion that other forms of aid such as practical aid and advice are mandatory. This essay will discuss both opinions, however, I agree with the statement that aid should be in the other forms rather than giving out money to developing countries.",
        "On the one hand, people feel the abroad organisation should render help in form of funds, because they think that only the growing countries know much about their problems, thus when they are given money they know what to do with it.  This means that, rendering help by giving out funds, would help the government of growing countries solve problems peculiar to them.  For example, when the people of congo were confronted with Ebola, the international community gave them funds and this enables them to solve their  problems. Consequently proving financial aide can help growing countries to solve their issues.",
        "On the other hand, some individuals believe that other forms of aid is better than giving out funds to developing countries.  I agree with this point of view because, giving money to developing countries may cause more trouble than help, due to the fact that many growing countries are faced with corruption.This means that, when money is given to them, it might be misappropriated by their leaders or even embezzled. For instance, the world health organisations renders aid to several developing countries especially African nations, in 1990 the organisation sent money to the Nigerian government to help them fight malaria, this fund was misused, as it was spent on something else. Thus other forms of help, like giving out drugs, sending personnels and giving advice is much better compares to financial aids.",
        "To conclude, although there are lots of opinions as regards which kind of help can be provided to developing nations, i agree that reform materials and advice are better forms of providing aids rather than dashing money out."
