        "The tremendous usage of fuel is the major cause of global warming. How can we save our Mother Earth? While few believe hiking the prices of fuel curbs the global environment issues, I disagree to the assertion that increasing the oil fares would make any impact.",
        "There are few compelling reasons why I think the spike in fuel prices would make any change in global environment issues. Firstly, people are very much accustomed to the luxury life that they choose comfort and refrain from usage of any public transport. As per the recent report published in Times Now, there is a 60% increase on traffic from the last 5 years. Secondly, the fuel fares have already gone beyond the threshold limit, even though people still use their private vehicle as it seems to be the easy mode of commute. Finally, the quality and maintenance of public transport is so devastating that it is making the life of traveler\u2019s miserable, which in turn is forcing the passengers to opt their private transport.",
        "However, to solve the climate change issues, there are various other methods which could be taken into consideration. The government should come up with subsidies for the usage of public transport, which would attract more passengers because of which the traffic deteriorates. Besides, the officials should pass strict rules that a family should not own more than one car so that the number of vehicle purchase goes down, which contributes to the nature. Nevertheless, the forests which are being uprooted to construct the industries and factories should be controlled, which reduces the deforestation issues as well as the poisonous gases getting released from them could be brought down. Subsequently, it could bring a substantial change in the Earth\u2019s nature.",
        "In conclusion, I disagree to the assertion that there are various other factor to fight the global environment issues and hiking the fuel prices would not suffice this serious problem."
