        "In todays worlds, Everyone is running behind their career and trying to upgrade their lives. In this process, they are forgetting  the actual meaning of life. I strongly agree with the statement, People are living more artificial life the real oneone. I shall be discussing in details about the same topic.",
        "To begin with, There is a saying \" Things need to be used and people need to be loved\" however in the current phase, The exactly the opposite thing is happening. Non living objects  are being admired and living soul is being used. For instance, Family was the most important factor initially but with change in time basic values started to fluctuate and affection for one and other is reducing drastically due to within generation, We are facing many separations. No two human are attached to each other, With the increase in artificial worlds of passion the unreal good, Mankind has turned to become a machine. They can easily move on with some other person, Its like replacing your old cell phone. When two adults, decide to part their ways, They do not consider the consequences of their decision. The only things which are important to them is that they cannot adjust with one and other or rather they  can't compromise on the materialistic goods. Possessing material gives one a satisfaction of being rich and content.",
        "To conclude, Mankind is becoming more insensitive towards the bond they share and they are not loosing the most important factor in their lives."
