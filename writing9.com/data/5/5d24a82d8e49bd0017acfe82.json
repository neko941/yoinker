        "Many people concede that a prison sentence is ineffective, instead of that, education and vocational training should be encouraged. In my opinion, I am complete disagree with this view.",
        "On the one hand, putting someone in prison from their crime has been used for a long time, and there always have a reasonable explanation for this. Firstly, imprisonment is one of the best ways to ensure the safety of citizens. Depriving dangerous criminals of their freedom provide a sense of protection for other people. Secondly, serve a sentence as reminder of the consequence when committing a crime. This action give people aware that everyone has to pay for what they did and no one is an exception. The case of sexual harassment of a Vietnamese girl in the elevator by a high \u2013 position men is a perfect example for this. Although he was a head of the Danang City People\u2019s Procuracy, he was still sent to prison like any other criminals.",
        "On the other hand, education and vocational training is not really more potential. It\u2019s true that well-educated people can commit crimes as well. Carrying out a crime is not completely depend on people\u2019s intellect, some does just because they are bad by personality. For example, the case of murdering of a Vietnamese girl committed by a Japanese men. He have even hold two bachelor degree, he did thing make other people angry, and victim\u2019s family suffer. Otherwise, using training course instead of imprisonment is harder to categorize criminals. Some people who just is misdemeanor could be took part in this course, but for who murder others, joining training course is not satisfactory and fair.",
        "In conclusion, for all the reasons mentioned above, people who commit a crime should be punishment by putting in prison."
