        "It is often argued that enough efforts are not taking place to preserve flora and fauna. The reason could be less or no awareness by the people and concerned authorities. The Government should promote methods to save them.",
        "People have not paid attention to plants and animal preservation due to a lack of awareness and how to prevent them from dying. The general knowledge about their protection is limited, such as, provide animals their natural habitat to live, also to give them a conducive environment for breeding and protect them from the impoverished poacher \u2014 similarly, the amount of water, sunlight, and nutrition needed by the plant. For example, according to a survey by national geographic,the ancient breed of Rhinoceros from African forests is rapidly declining due to greedy cartels, untrained officials, and excessive poaching.",
        "As a solution to the problem, as mentioned above, would be the proper training provided to officials and general knowledge to people related to their preservation by the Government. The state-sponsored advertisement should be made and use all kinds of media to broadcast.For instance, The African Government has recently started 'A Captive breeding programme,' which provides information from the grassroots level to the people to protect plants and animals and help the state to prevent its extinction.",
        "In conclusion, to keep flora and fauna alive, I believe the Government assistant will be needed to provide information to the public due to their limited knowledge."
