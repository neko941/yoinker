        "Meanwhile many individuals have believed that governments should require to make public libraries in every rural areas although others also have seen that it is useless due to the trend of internet use. In general, there could have a lot things to consider with this statement however the following are my views of point about this topic.",
        "To commence, to begin with, we could not deny the fact that on these times that there are a lot of people who still choose to read books in a quiet place. However, library has been a conducive place for learning ever since because of the availability of books and its ambiance. And i think it is a good investment of the government to make his people knowledgeable and well informed about a lot of things in the most convenient and inexpensive way of learning. Moreover, it is convincing to every individual to read books if this will open 24 hours and 7 days a week.",
        "While on the other side, it is true that are rising of modern technologies nowadays and getting online, everything could be possible. Internet has been indispensable since it was invented and it comes through line or wireless connection. Through this, we could access a lot of information like recent research and discoveries, current events, newest fashion trends, weather forecast, etc. Aside from that, this could be used in the most convenient way, anytime and anywhere you want as long you have connections.",
        "To conclude, both parts are important however as i see it will never be useless investment to build libraries in every public places. Although we have internet it still up to every individual how they will make use both of them for learning."
