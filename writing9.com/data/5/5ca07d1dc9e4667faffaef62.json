        "In spite of remarkable medical innovations, the general physical health in developed countries, in fact, is now in crisis since an increasing number of cases have been reported to suffer from fatal diseases like cancer or chronic ones like diabetes. Many factors cause this problem but steps can certainly be taken to address.",
        "There are various explanations for the deterioration in health quality. Sedentary lifestyle is the first main cause. Most people nowadays commute by motor vehicles and tend to work in offices that require little or no physical activity. At home, people are even more inactive; most adults watch TV for relaxation after a stressful workday while their children entertain themselves with video games. Technology has indeed made our life more pleasant but obviously less healthy. Eating habit is another harmful reason. The increasing growth of fast food with their convenience and alluring addictive taste continually evoking an insatiable desire in consumers, especially children and adolescents, has directly contributed to the problems of obesity",
        "In my opinion, the responsibility to solve the problem, in part, falls on governments. For a far-reaching solution, governments should exercise stricter control over the fast food industry by imposing higher taxes and limiting their amount of fat and additives. Health awareness campaign through different means of media is also an effective measure that should be taken by governments to promote public healthy lifestyle. From a personal perspective, each individual should attempt to alter their lifestyle and eating habit by taking more daily exercise and maintain a balanced diet to reduce the risk of obesity, diabetes or heart disease.",
        "In conclusion, sedentary lifestyle and unhealthy eating habit are two main factors causing the health decline in developed countries and not only governments but also individuals must take on the responsibility to deal with the problem."
