        "Sorry, I haven`t written to you for ages. I have been so busy since my final exams are coming up next month. Wish I could cancel my exam and visit your country again.",
        "I had a lovely time when I was there and I could not thank you enough for showing me all the national parks and beaches in your city. Our visit to Karana national park was the tour I enjoyed the most although we failed to see lion cubs. It was my first time seeing mammals like African elephants, lions, zebras and baboons. Do you remember the time we touched a hyena ? The whole trip was so much fun and I wish I can sneak out of my home and take the next flight to your country again.",
        "My exams will be ending in the third week of next month and It would be great if you could visit Sri Lanka for a vacation. I`m happy to show you all the famous national parks and birding hot spots in Sri Lanka. I know you have got your university holidays until November, so you have no excuses but to visit here.",
