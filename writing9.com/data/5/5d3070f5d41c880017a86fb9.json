        "There have  been various argument about relevance  of history has  a subject. Some have argued that it is one of the most crucial subject  while , others believe science and technology are more relevant for school children. Personally, I feel both history and science and technology courses are important  for students and  one should not be said to be better than the other.",
        "On the one hand, those who argue in support of history say so because they believe it helps in learning about the culture and history of a place. For instance, students are taught about the various cultures in their country, ethnic groups, how the country  was developed, which country colonized them and men and women who fought for the independence of their nation. Without history as a subject, these set of information would have been lost as there would be no means of transferring them to younger generations. In essence, it helps in preservation  of historical details of a country.",
        "On the other hand, supporters of science and technology believe it has brought about an increase in development in the world today much more than history subjects. Firstly, in the world of medicine, several vaccines and antibiotics have been produced to fight killer diseases and  this has been through the help of science and technology. Secondly, most computerized devices used nowadays are all as a result of improvement in technology. Without it, there would be no television, computer, mobile phones and  all other electronic devices that make life easy. Lastly, in the field of agriculture, science and technology has  lead to the production of generically  enhanced seeds which can produce crops in the shortest possible time. All these can be attributed to the study of science and technology in school.",
        "In conclusion, both history and science and technology courses have their usefulness to the society therefore , It would be wrong to say one is more relevant than the other. In the future, I believe these courses would be further improved upon to ensure improvement in the society ."
