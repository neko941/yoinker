        "Owing to the increases in the families expenditures.Some people think that both the father and the mother need to have a job.Furthermore, there are others who believe that parents support it is more improtant than extra income.I will discuss both sides of the argument and I will summaries my personal conclusion.",
        "on the one hand, a plenty number of people think that having both parents working is a necessary these days.Many things become more expensive than it used to be in the past.For exaple, to rent a house in the city center that cost a lot of mony which it is almost inpossible to affored with",
        "a one salery, because of that both of them need to go out to work.Moreover, another reason is to give their childeren a good education.Without both of them working this things cannot be done.",
        "On the other hand, there is some people believe that they needed at lest one of the parents with them.They have feelt lack supported due to their parents absence.However, money could be important, but not more than spending time togther.Indeed, not having their parents around could have had a bad effect on the them.for instance, there was a study claimed that childeren with  personality problems had spent less time with there parents.This can be a good reason for parents to start thinking about the  most important thing to them, their kids.",
        "In conclusion, parents need to put their kids first, making a good money it is a good thing for the family.Nevertheless,having time for them it is as important as making money."
