        "Needless to say, Advancement in medical science tremendously boosts the human life span immensely. The great discoveries and researches that has been done in last two decades of finding cure of deadly pandemic diseases of previous centuries increased the life expectancy more than ever. I would say, it brings numerous benefits to family,society and country as compared to its tiny negative aspect likewise financial burden on the prosperity.",
        "It is an irrefutable fact, Recent developments made the significant fall of the human death line to the lowest hit in life-year death graph of the whole world population, which adds value to the family of any individual, country economy and longevity of workforce availability.first of all, these advancements made it possible that a person's own family can feel the warmth of any relation and enjoy the company of elder or their loved ones for longer term than ever feasible. Secondly, any country would get a long lasting workforce that will gift not only share its life experience, but guidance to get succeed at any point of time. Due to this, Almost 191 countries noticed that 30 percent increment in survival rate of younger age people who met with an accident and suffer any disease. Similarly, Old age people also get extended life by surgeries performed in order to cure their knee problem and other damaged organ-part replacement resulted in a longer workforce group and helping hand to lighten the burden of economic growth for any country.",
        "In contrary, there is only negligible negative impact on any country finances as compared to the benefits to the society. According to New York Times Journal, Unites states have 60% decline in the death rate of older populations and 20% of the society which are above 103 years, so for that particular person, The Government has to spend additional money on the healthcare system and give them pension funds for much longer time. These funds always get paid from taxpayers money that can bring frustration to them and make them think useless weigh on their pocket.",
        "To recapitulate, I would conclude that development in medical science has more benefits to the society compared to its small losses. Any discovery and advancement bring pros and cons with them, but science made changes generally brings the more positive factors and will continue till dawn."
