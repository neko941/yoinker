        "It is argued that students often struggle to take admission in the university regardless of their financial background. I completely agree with this statement because the merit of universities is relatively high than before, and they often offer a fixed number of seats per academic session to meet standards of quality education.",
        "Mostly universities intake students based on their throughout academic achievements and their performance in the entry test of the University. Which causes a constant increase in the merit and only students with high score could be able to secure their admissions. Most universities don\u2019t weightage weather the selected student belongs to a less privileged family or an affluent family. To illustrate, The JUNG has published the recent research only 20% of students per semester got the admission for post-graduation due to high merit.",
        "Those institutes that offer higher qualification fixed their number of intake students to attain their motto of quality education, though, the number of students is increasing constantly over a few years educational institutes are more focused towards the quality of the education so their students could have an impact on society. They prefer to take fewer students so they could provide them with the best amenities in terms of education, research lab and opportunities to publish their work. For example, public sector universities fixed their intake to 60 students per program to meet the criteria of a student-teacher ratio which is 1:3 so faculty could put more attention.",
        "Financial background is not a consideration of universities anymore to give admission to students that is why every student is facing challenges of securing admission, because institutes are considering merit as a parameter and they also fixed the number of seats to achieve quality."
