        "Obesity issue has become a major problem to the society these days. Adults and even toddlers are becoming hazardously obese to the point, that it affects their health. The government proclaimed that an upsurge in the price of the unhealthy food will curb this serious problem. Unfortunately, I strongly disagree the hike in the price on those food products will only affect to people in need and doesn\u2019t resolve the problem.",
        "Overeating is one of the fundamental issues that almost all obese person faced. Current studies have been shown that the best ways to keep body fit and healthy are to exercise and proper balanced meal. Eating healthy food may help to lose weight, though it must be eaten in a considerable amount. Ironically, overindulging on nutritious food can lead to weight gain and possibly even detrimental to health.",
        "Moreover, increase in price on food such as butter and dairy products, affect towards restaurants owners and low-incomed family. Restaurant and bakery require to by a lot of dairy products, sugar and salt to make meals and this implementation will only affect their business\u2019s sales. Furthermore, it will only make the situation worse for low-income family as it is already a struggle for them to have a decent meal. Despite of the implementation, the target group, however, will continue to purchase those ingredients as they couldn\u2019t control their eating habit.",
        "In conclusion, it is a matter of fact that the increment in the food price doesn\u2019t prevent obesity problem for growing. Self-control during eating and exercise are the best options for these people to lose their weight effectively."
