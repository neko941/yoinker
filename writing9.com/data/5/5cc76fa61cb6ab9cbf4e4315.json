        "Number of subjects learnt in school by youngsters has been a topic of debate. Some people are of the opinion that, they should pay attention to the broad range of subjects at learning place, while some think they should be allowed to focus more on the subjects they have passion for and know best. In my opinion, these adolescents should be encouraged to study all subjects with keen interest.",
        "On the one hand, youngsters would find it very interesting studying very few subjects that are appealing and very interesting to them, compared to when they would need to go through the psychological stress of understanding very boring subjects. This will help them concentrate and aspaire to know in deep such chosen subjects. Take for example, a student who has talents in football and developed interest in sports should not be bothered about studying business studies when he could easily proceed to direct all energy on his chosen career.",
        "On the other hand, these teenagers are still in their primitive ages that needed exposure to variety of subjects which will groom them to know what it takes to become which profession and what benefits and tasks are associated to each to be chosen career. More so, well exposed adults will grow up to apply knowledge he or she has gained in other subjects in to his day-to-day activities. This will make them stand out as stars in future.",
        "In conclusion, while it is convinient and easy for teenagers to focus on a few interesting subjects at school, they are yet to be matured to take better decisions so they need more exposure to other subjects till they become adults to help them choose a better career."
