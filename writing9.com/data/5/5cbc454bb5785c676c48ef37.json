        "Migration for work is common amongst medical professionals. Doctors and nurses relocate from third world to first world countries to progress in their fields. For the remainder of this essay I will mention the problems associated with this trend, namely; the decrease in qualified doctors in their home countries, and the increase in competition for jobs in their destination country. In addition to this, I will also discuss the possible solutions for example, salary modification and introduction of government schemes to improve medical systems.",
        "There are numerous issues associated with the migratory trend of people working in the health sector. Firstly, due to the rise in migration from poorer nations, there is a marked rise in deterioration of health services in the richer countries. This is due to the fact that there are less doctors to cater to the people\u2019s needs. For example, Khartoum has one of the highest migratory rates amongst doctors in the world, consequently, it also has the worst medical care.",
        "Secondly, more developed countries have a higher influx of applicants. Thus resulting in an overload in medical professionals. A good example this is the NHS. Doctors are put on waiting lists for months on end until an adequate placement is found. Overall, this trend is detrimental for both host and recipient.",
        "However, these obstacles can be tackled through many different approaches. A call for governments is needed to increase the salaries and provide better working conditions for their hard working medical force. This can be done through the reallocation of government funds to the health sector. If they have higher earnings, they may be tempted to stay. In addition, (another solution) is to limit the year\u2019s migrants may work abroad up to 5 years, with rules to withdraw practicing licenses if the time limit is surpassed. This way, they are forced to remain in their home countries. Although these laws would take time and commitment to be implemented, they are fundamental to solving these issues.",
        "In conclusion, despite the many complications with regards to medical worker\u2019s resettlement overseas, there is without a doubt many means of solving them."
