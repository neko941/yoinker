        "It is believed by a number of individuals that being wealthy is the principal way to happiness. Having a lot of money could make people happy because money could solve a lot of problems. Other things that can bring happiness to people is good health and peace of mind.",
        "Being wealthy brings joy to some people in life because they believe money can solve a lot of problems and make life easier for them. Challenges and difficulties in life makes people vulnerable and subject them to a sad mood but realising that the money they have can solve the problems light them up. For example, my brother who was out of job for a long time, finally was able to secure one recently, the joy he had was immeasurable, knowing that the his pay could care for most of his needs. Therefore, having a lot of money makes people happy because it solves majority of their challenges such as lack and wants.",
        "Also, good health and peace of mind can make people happy because they are not under stress. It can also be a result of previous experiences which they have had in the past. For example, a friend of mine who was wrongly diagnosed of hypertension due to faulty equipments was repeatedly sad and moody for a period of time until she summoned the courage to go for the test again and was proved otherwise. She has been happier, full of life and at peace since then. Therefore good health can be a form of happiness to people.",
        "In conclusion, both wealthy and good health can bring joy to people because there are different strokes for different folks. It could be a good health for some, I could be having a lot of money for others."
