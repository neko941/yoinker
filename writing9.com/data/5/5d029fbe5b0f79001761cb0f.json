        "The impact on children caused by families migrating to other countries for work has been a debated for a long time. Some believe that it has an adverse impact on the young ones while others percieve this as positive for them. I strongly agree that it is has beneficial for them and any problems associated with it are of negligible value.",
        "On the one hand, it is thought by some that families move to another country for better life quality which unarguably is beneficial for the children and I agree. Since most of the people are migrating from under developed or developing countries to developed countries therefore the quality of the life of their offsprings improve significantly. For instance, the quality of education in developed countries such as United States of America and Canada is far more superior to underdeveloped countries like Pakistan and Iraq. Moreover, it is also believed that moving to another country also gives exposure of different culture to them which is an asset when they start their lives as adults.",
        "On the other hand, some people are of the view that immigration of families makes the life of their children difficult as they need to adjust to a new environment. This means that they need to build their social circle from scratch and adapt to the new learning methods of the school. It is also believed that this also has a negative impact on the psychology of the children as they tend to get insecure in the new country. A study done by the Cambridge University is a prime example of this behaviour of children, where it was concluded that a majority of the children were more scared and cranky than usual within six months of moving to a new country.",
        "In conclusion, while the impact of moving abroad on children has divided view, i believe that the benefits it reaps such as improvement in quality of life are way more valuable than any difficulties it might cause."
