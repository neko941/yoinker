        "Traditional clothes and following their culture were the part of the medieval era.However, people nowadays dress similar and therefore look alike.",
        "However,wearing traditional clothes helped people to stay connected with their culture and it created a sense of belongingness to a particular group of people.It helps people to recognise people from the same cultureculture.For example India is a vast country with various cultures and religions.Every culture has different traditional clothes and rituals. People of Kerala were lungi whereas people of Uttarakhand  drape saree in a different was then the rest of the country  people of Himanchal have a special cap known as Himanchali topi. While visiting different places we can see and experience their cultures closely and learn new things.",
        "Yet, people nowadays wear simple and comfortable clothes. Globalisation resulted in the spread of trends and culture.People now generally do not wear traditional clothes as they are not as aware as their culture due to shifting to other places. For example, many people shift to Delhi for better job and education for their kids that is why Delhi is mixed with different type of culture and tradition. Therefore, people here wear similar clothes as shops offer similar kind of dresses.Wearing a similar kind of dresses helps people to connect with each other despite their different cultures and traditions.",
        "According to me, wearing similar clothes and looking alike is a positive development as people can connect with different people without being conscious about their own culture.However, it does not mean to forget about your own culture one should always know about their culture and tradition as it connects people to their history."
