        "When children become grown-ups their social conduct varies in certain ways. The main difference is dependence on parents.",
        "As a child, we are hand held by our folks to guide us through the world. They instill values in us, which will eventually help when we grow old. Although, as little ones we are fragile and depend on our adults to take care of us. But, as we ourselves reach a stage of maturity we no longer require their assistance. Man is a social being and our companions enable us to get through life. During childhood, we are introduced to our peers through school, but seldom develop relations with them. On the contrary, in adolescence we aren\u2019t able to proceed further without our friends. These examples of situations in our lives differ as we progress. The example of judgment between right and wrong is yet another differentiator. Our feeble mind at a tender age is unable to distinguish the good from bad while our trained minds judge people instantly. Decision-making is another criteria that develops with time.",
        "In society most rules of speaking, dressing or interacting are limited to the older generation.",
        "Nevertheless, growth is part of life and eventually one has to reach that stage. Change is inevitable and more often than not brings about the good in an individual. For example, the development of speech as a baby to a teen is required. The fact that independence is given rather than having to completely depend on anyone.",
        "Hence, to conclude we are part of a culture that demands growth in every aspect of life."
