        "In the current scenario, the customers like to share their feedback over the internet regarding the products they buy and use. Some are of the belief that it is beneficial to the end user and should be done. I also assent with this notion.",
        "There are myriad factors why people should provide their comments towards the stuff they purchase whether online or offline. Primarily, if there is any evaluation present for the services that any person wants to use for the first time, it will guide them about their pros and cons. This will help them to decide that whether the goods are reliable or not and if the advantages are more, they should go ahead with their consumption. For instance, on websites like Zomato where there are reviews present about the multifarious restaurants and the purchaser can check and learn about them before making any food order. Another reason is that due to these assessments about the things, the companies try to raise the quality of their equipments, as they know, if their stuff does not stand up to the standard of the buyer, they can lose their potential clients and their will hamper their business.",
        "Although, it is always great to be cognizant about where we are going to invest, sometimes, this becomes muddle for the companies, as the buyers generally make assumptions without actually utilizing the products just by seeing few negative reactions. For example, the cosmetics have impact depending on everyone\u2019s body type. Many have sensitive skin and those items which are suitable for the normal skin type does not mean it will be good enough for others.",
        "To encapsulate, as, the consumer is god for the businesses, they have freedom to say about their liking and disliking, people should not make one sided judgment. They should do their research properly before making any decision."
