But , if you have opportunity to advertise yourself, this fame can be easy to achieve. Nowadays some precentage of celebrities are known through the internet or with the help of adverstising. As an example of this, I can say a few Hollywood famous actors whithout any objections. For instanse Jim Carrey, has been known through a lot of movies and TV shows. In other words, this advertisement or the internet has helped him a lot. Despite a few drawbacks, this trend is considered to be good by scientists , becouse it has many benefitscthan downsides.",

They are slowly climbing to the top of their popularity through the internet and personal websites or different social medias as well as. However , it should be noted  that some of these bloggers are helping people, who are not yet well known. I support my opinion with following example. So my friend also wanted to be famous, he achieved his dream with assistance of bloggers by advertising. It become much easier than it was a few years ago.",
