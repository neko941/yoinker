        "The enthusiasm for famous people is increasingly more in our time by making them always in the centre. Today, celebrities\u2019 glamourous lifestyle and money become more intriguing for the audience than their success stories which create a bad example for a younger generation. This essay will argue that  famous people\u2019s stories affect positively to the younger people.",
        "There is a controversy about some celebrities that whether they deserved to become famous due to their achievements. The reason for this is the most of them being just lucky people for experiencing the overnight fame. Also the lack of qualities for success causes their need to exhibit their excessive lifestyle and became a public figure for the way they live. Indeed, social media influencers are the most obvious example for this category. Sharing their choices and entertainment concept is the attractive element for their fame. Consecutively, there is not much left for famous people to share if they do not have any achievement from the different waves of life.",
        "On the other side real successful people increasingly displays a good example to the young people for their future lives. The attention given to any field massively thanks to the related growth of social media contents. In addition to this, the young learn to appreciate the achievements since they are considered as rare. The positive aspect is born from the envy to the stories of these people. For example, the Report of Children Education done by USA Authorities the 45% of children are eager to learn the difficulties but admire the stories told by qualified interviewees. As a result, celebrities make the rareness of the achievements even more attractive than it was thought before.",
        "This essay argued that the lives of celebrities cause depressing wishes for new generations day by day. I completely agree with the opinion of in today\u2019s world being famous creates a false image for young people by making them desire to have wealth without any hard work, which leads to get disappointed because of  fate."
