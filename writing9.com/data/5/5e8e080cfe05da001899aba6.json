        "Government  plays a significant  role in human development . Some people  think that government spend money in theater  and music is a wastage of money instead  they must spend this money in civil service. I agree with this statement.",
        "Government invest money in highway system because road service is not well  infrastructure and large patholes and slugs on road. Government should spend money to improve highway syastem because it improve transportation  and problems which face by travellers who towards  their destination. It also help the travellers  to reach on time.",
        "Moving further, if government also spend money  in education organisation for example in government  schools and colleges to improve their infrastructure  and teaching  way.  The government invest money to gave advance  technology  facilities  in government  school to give students advance knowledge. In this government schools students  get better  job opportunities. If a person get a better job so they financial support  their parents. To elaborate , educational  system  of india is not well this is the reason the india is not counted in successful  countries.",
        "On the other side, some people  think that government invest money in the art such as music and theater  is not a wastage of money because  entertainment  sources is also very important for life. It is joyfulplace for people to visit theater on tgeir weekend and relax from their stressful lives. People spend their leisure  time with their families and friend.",
        "To conclude, improvement  in education  system is most important source for investing money rather than spend money in entertainment sources."
