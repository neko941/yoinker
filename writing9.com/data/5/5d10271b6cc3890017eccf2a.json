        "What\u2019s the proper attitude of young people towards older people has become a hot topic of discussion these days. While some people says that older people\u2019s example should be followed by the young generation, others maintain that it is beneficial for them to question older people\u2019s ideas and opinions. This essay will discuss why following the older generation\u2019s example has certain advantages but why challenging their thoughts is superior.",
        "There are various compelling reasons why young people should follow older people\u2019s example and the prominent one is that they can gain significant life experiences from this which will reward them later on in their careers. To illustrate, it is mandatory for children to learn a variety of ancient and contemporary examples at school in Korea because it is an efficient way to teach youngsters numerous morals values such as honesty and respect. For this reason, it is significant for children to learn elder\u2019s examples as it plays a crucial role in their future.",
        "However, some oppose this notion and says that it is essential to develop children\u2019s critical thinking ability as it enables them to think independently and wouldn\u2019t swayed easily by others. For example, a recent research conducted in Japan has revealed that children who are capable of thinking critically tend to achieve a successful career in the future as they are able to suggest innovative ideas. As can be seen, it is also significant for them to have the capability of questioning older people\u2019s ideas and thoughts.",
        "To sum up, this essay discussed the reason why people holds different opinions towards older people\u2019s experience and ideas. Taking everything into consideration, I\u2019m inclined to say that the overall benefits of thinking independently are superior."
