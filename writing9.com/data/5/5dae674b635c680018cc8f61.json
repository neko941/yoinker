        "The increasing availability of usage of social networking sites, such as Facebook, Twitter, Weibo and etc. is a significant feature in modern life nowadays. Some people have worried that this development has had a dramatic negative affect on individuals and society. Generally, I agree with this statement.",
        "For individuals, the addiction of social networking sites brings many disadvantages to their relationships in the present world and their online safety. For example, many young people tend to communicate with their friends and family members online instead of chatting face-to-face and the even use the applications, like Facebook during the regular family gathering. These behaviors would reduce the ties and bonds between close friends and family members. What\u2019s more, online safety is another thing we should pay more attention to. The growing number of virus threats and well-trained hackers has caused many cybercrimes around the world, such as identity theft.",
        "For our society, these sites also have undesirable influence. This is mainly because fake news and rumors are easier to convey online, which would build a distorted world. People are lost in these networking and more likely to make wrong decision that have profound influence on real life. For example, the popularity of fake news on Facebook and Twitter had harmful impact on freedom during the 2016 election of America.",
        "However, that is not to say that social networking sites brings no benefits. One of the obvious advantages is that this novel communication way was used in gathering people with the same interests together and chatting with people in remote area. Nevertheless, we should be aware of the potential disadvantages and find a way to minimize it when we enjoy the benefits of these sites."
