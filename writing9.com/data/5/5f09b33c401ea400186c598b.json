        "Nowadays, telephone and internet are extremely essential means of communication with other individuals in the society. Such vogue holds equal number of merits and demerits.",
        "Taking into account the globalization and technological advancement which helps us to communicate and stay connected with each other in the dynamic environment.

Moreover, various social platforms like facebook, instagram, twitter and so on, has made our life inter connected with our near and dear ones. World is now become our society because we can always get the latest information about everything which is happening around the world like weather forecasting, latest global news, and most of the University has started teaching online so trend has been changed with a rapid pace and brings excellence and made our life easier and faster.",
        "Apart from this, another pivotal aspect is that human relation with each other gets affected drastically and most of the relationship becomes virtual only owing to excess use of internet. Furthermore, we have become impatient as we compare everything with monetary terms which also divide our society into different classes. Thus, bond has become weaker and divorce rates augmented significantly due to less physical communication. In addition, various harmful sites also steal our personal data which is a major concern and necessary actions and steps should be taken to control and mitigate these mysterious activities.",
        "To conclude, although telephone and internet plays a vital role and become integral part of our life but its negative are worth equal consideration."
