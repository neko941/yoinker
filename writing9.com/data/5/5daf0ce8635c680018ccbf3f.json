        "The topic of when to incorporate foreign language in children's academic curriculum has always  sparked heated debates. While some individuals believe that including new language at primary school helps to broaden their knowledge, rather than learning a foreign language during secondary school education. I strongly believe that mastering a new language at children's tender age would be absolutely beneficial for children to get comprehensive knowledge about languages. In this essay I shall state some reasons to support my view point.",
        "Firstly, It is incontrovertible that during the early stage children have more intellectual capacity to grasp and learn new languages, effectively utilizing this  to get proficiency in a foreign language would be advantageous for the kids in their future. This is because, researchers  revealed the fact  that tender age is the most accurate time for an individual to learn new things especially languages and as they grow older, that skill gradually diminishes. For instance, a study conducted by Oxford university shows that young individuals belongs to age group 5-10 have more ability to learn and expertise foreign languages.",
        "Moreover, it is irrefutable that students learning in secondary school have more complex syllabus in their academic curriculum which includes advanced subjects such as  science, mathematics, geography and so on. Hence, if we try to integrate foreign language to their curriculum, that overloads and enhances their burden and may cause devastating consequences. Hence, primary school time period is more adequate than secondary school.",
        "In conclusion, it has been obvious that adding new language subjects into primary school student's syllabus has enormous benefits than that of including the same in secondary school syllabus because of factors such as language learning capacity of children's at tender age and complexity of syllabus of secondary school students ."
