        "In this competitive era, people are engaged in their graveyards shifts to lead ameliorated and exotic lifestyle, under which they find it arduous to extract time for read the newspaper. Most of the young generation avoid the papers they prefer the news watching on Television. I will discuss the reason for this problem and also give some suggestions how we can tackle this issue in the posterior paragraph.",
        "Admittedly, in numerous nations teenagers would like to prefer the visual so they follow the current affairs on television rather then read newspaper. Due to there hectic schedule children have no enough time to read the whole paragraph for getting the information so they can just watch it and grap the knowledge about current affairs because watching news on tv is very less time consuming. If they read the newspapers then they have to give full attention about the news. Sometime they are very worst reader but some young ones are good listeners. For instance, York university conduct a survey which is about the newsapaper and television 80% young people likes the watching news because they said on Listening the news they have enough choice to get the news about whole world if the read the headline they only bring the knowledge about their local area and the city.",
        "On the another side, there are many solution to resolve this problem if the starting days of school teachers should motivate the children to read a daily one article on magazine and then discuss 7-8 min in class. It has very benefited to improve the reading skills of learners. Secondly, parents should discuss the some important crimes, political news with their young one so they should build their interest in newspaper. Most of the people avoid the purchasing newspaper or magazine they are thing it is wastage of money if everything in their phones so, people should motivate their teenagers to read a magazine atleast once a week. For instance, in one section of newspaper especially design for young ones it about the puzzles, rhymes and other interesting things which is very helpful for their future.",
        "To the conclude, young generation is future for every nation so everyone should motivate their teenagers to read the newspaper and aware about the current affairs and current issues. Through the newspaper they should get enormous opportunities for their good career."
