        "It has often been said that nations are progresively becoming similar to each other because now the same products can be obtained anywhere in the world. In this essay I shall attempt to argue that this situation is beneficial, due to the fact that it would prevent immigration and would also contribute to the reduction of shopping tourism.",
        "First of all, the establishment of worldwide renowned franchises in remote undeveloped nations could help to generate sources of employment and this could prevent locals to immigrate to developed nations to pursue a better life. For example, the coffee chain Starbucks has created around 10,000 job positions in Vietnam, and according to The New York Times, this has helped to decrease the number of Vietnamese immigrants to the United States by around 5%.",
        "Another reason for considering that the availability of equal products in all places is a positive growth, is that it can help to reduce shopping tourism. Some people like  to travel to purchase things that are not sold in their places of origin, and if those objects were obtainable everywhere, individuals would not have to travel to buy them. For instance, an article published by The Washington Post revealed that American women are very fond of the luxury French brand Louis Vuitton, and with the oppening of the first boutique of the brand in the USA in 2010, the demand for flights to France has been reduced in 10%.",
        "In conclusion, having access to same objects in all parts of the planet is a helpful trend, because it can prevent people from leaving their native countries, and would also contribute to the reduction of people travelling for only shopping purposes."
