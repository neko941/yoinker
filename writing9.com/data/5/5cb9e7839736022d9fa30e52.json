        "The ultimate goal of any human being is, to be happy. It can be out of materialistic result or just a gesture from other person. Everybody thrives to find happiness in their life. The definition of happiness can vary from person to person.",
        "In general, it is always difficult to define any kind of emotion. Every person has their own definition of happiness. So it becomes really challenging to define the emotion. For example, if a person wins lottery money, that would bring him happiness whereas for someone spending time with their children would bring happiness. Some seeks happiness in form of material, like buying things and money could make them happy while others find happiness with person. Being with their loved ones bring them joy. On the whole, the definition of happiness can differ and makes it even harder to explain.",
        "There are so many factors that can contribute to achieve happiness. One of them is a \"person's character\". This goes by a famous saying - what goes around, comes around - Karma. If someone show their kind to everyone it will definitely comes back to them. Being rude can only bring pain to them and in a long run it could affect them mentally as well. secondly, acceptance is the key to happiness. Accept for what you are and who you are. one of the important factor for happiness is to realise and acceptance themself instead of trying to adapt someone else's lifestyele. For instance, A man from a middle income group could be happier with his family when compared to the rich. It all depends on the way we accept our life.",
        "In conclusion, it is always important to be happy in life. The definition might vary but the feeling remains the same. Those are some of the factors that are responsible for happiness."
