        "It is argued that educational activities should be included in a child leisure time in other to reduce time wastage. In my opinion,  I agree that children should be involve in educational activities as this would enable the child develop new skills and reduce the opportunity of a child getting injured.",
        "Children who are involve in educational activities would develop and learn new skills. This can be seen in how they speak, read and write. In addition, they can also be taught how to bake, cook and sew during their spare time. The youngsters would be excited about learning new skills instead of playing all day. For instance, primary schools in Lagos makes it essential that students learn how to bake during the official school break time and they also give allowance of 15mins to play and 45mins to bake. Consequently, research has shown that the attention span of a child is 1min and after that they lose interest so most times they need things to occupy their mind with educational activities would achieve.",
        "Furthermore, most children are very active and engaging in educational activities would reduce the chance of the child getting injured. Ultimately, the child would more often have to be in one spot and if she needs to move it would be supervised as movement would be limited. For instance, in my niece school, they have a structure that during break they are not allowed to climb on any high platform instead they are made to watch educational channels.",
        "To conclude, children would learn more things during their free period by participating in educational activities and this would help in developing new skills and limit a child getting injured."
