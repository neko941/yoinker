        "Nowadays, individuals\u2019 spending pattern has shifted. To illustrate, in most countries, people prefer renting homes instead of acquiring them. This essay will highlight both merits and demerits of renting a home.",
        "By renting a house, a person can save a living cost. This is because, it is usually economic to rent a house, for building a new home often requires a substantial investment. Erecting a home involves labor and material costs, which escalates the overall expenditure. Another merits of living a tenancy life is the ease of migration. If a person rents a home, they can easily move from one place to another, but if they make one, that may not be the case.",
        "Nonetheless, there are demerits of leasing a house. Firstly, building a home could be the passive income source. The owner may rent their premises and make it an income stream; to illustrate, by renting a flat or a building to individuals and business, they can be at break even. However, if they rent the building, they will not make proceeds. Furthermore, constructing a building is often an arduous process, for it mostly involves a lot of hassle. The time and cost constraints make it better to rent the building rather than making one. For instance, building a house will take an enormous time and effort; similarly, the cost is also higher than renting the premises.",
        "In conclusion, while there are several advantages of renting a house like reduced living cost and a ease of migration, we must take into consideration the obvious demerits such as deduced income streams and hassles of building home."
