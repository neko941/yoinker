        "Although, some people believe that history subject is most important for student's school curriculum, while others support the subject of science and technology because they find it more beneficial for one. In my opinion,  both subjects have their own relevance.",
        "On the one hand, of discussion, proponents of history subject, define it as one of the most imperative and significant to plan for future. In other words, history serves the role of pioneer to those who wants to discover something new because it develops the better understanding. Moreover, there is an opportunity also,  past mistakes could be avoided by having the knowledge of that time and coming tomorrow can be secured by making oneself aware. For instance, a geologist whose research topic is based on earth must have good understanding of ancient time also.",
        "On the other hand, regarding science and technology, its relevance cannot be explained in a sentence because the reason of existence of world and living being can only be explained by it only. Even, nowadays, we are completely surrounded by their outcomes that is why it is beneficial. Furthermore, the reason of everything in this universe could only be demonstrate by medium of science. For example, scientists have discovered existence of other species in the galaxy,  recently.",
        "In conclusion, despite the everyday discussion over most relevant subject for children, I believe both have their own charisma and significance. Both are necessary and indispensable."
