        "Some inndividuals would agree that building new museums, townhalls, and other sporting facilities would be better than renovation and maintaining old buildings. However, there are some people who contend to this idea. This essay will tackle both of this view and give my opinion.",
        "on one hand, there are several people who would agree to construct new public building than renovate the old ones. This is mainly because, constructing new buildings are much easier, cheaper, and safer. Old buildings, such as, museums are very tedious, sensitive and difficult to maintain. It needs close monitoring to check if the buildings are still safe for the public to visit. An example of this, is when the famous notre-dame church caught fire; according to the news old churches are prone to fire because they are usually made of woods and thus what happened to notre-dame church. It is estimated that the renovation of the church would cost millions. Therefore, some would agree that it would be economically wise to build new buildings, it is much safer and more modern in style.",
        "On the other hand, some individuals are for that renovating and maintaining these old and ancient buildings are most important. These building have seen and withstand thousands of years, and because of that, it became part of our cultural heritage. It gives people a glimse of what was in the past- their culture and lifestyle. Futhermore, these buildings are tourists attraction and generates massive income to the country.",
        "In conclusion, it is important for me that these old relics should be kept and renovated. These buildings are part of our history and it deserved to be well-mintained even it is costly."
