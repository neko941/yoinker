        "Recently, value is most often placed on people's wealth and affluence rather than ancient moral principles as honour, kindheartedness and loyalty which is believed to be necessary. I totally believe that these morals still takes an upper hand in all human endeavor and existence, hence good reputation should be a golden key in evaluation of a persons' value.",
        "A group of the populace who support riches as the main determining factor in humans' worth assessment may be justifiably right as wealthy people donate and assist the government in building social infrastructure, which in turn, serves as a key indicator in a community's development goals. To further expatiate on these, most key figures in the society virtually control local and foreign trades of which their benevolence promotes a nation's economy. For instance, in Nigeria, most shares and scholarship programs that drive her economy is being held by top politicians and influential public figures.",
        "However, despite the above claims and beliefs, the idea that moral virtue should be neglected while evaluating a man's worth is entirely unacceptable and thus, should be reconsidered. Most businesses that serve the world are sustained on integrity of which having employees who are loyal, kind and truthful is a huge bonus to the company and society at large. In addition, a country that desires to attain political stability should consider these good quality as benchmarks during election and role appointments as these are major determinants in promoting peace in the world.",
        "In conclusion, moral values should be incorporated while judging a person's value as these are the essentials, other than one's social status and physical possessions."
