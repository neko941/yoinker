        "After turning into an adult, the young folk gets the option either to leave their comfort zone or to stay put in their same old town. In my opinion, rather than staying in the hometown, it is always better to leave the town for better career and opportunities.",
        "On one hand, when a person gets out of his city and moves into a mega city, he faces numerous challenges and pitfalls for the first time, such as taking the decisions on his own hand. Life without family can become quite cumbersome, and this new challenging situation of life teaches the best lessons to become strong and mature. For instance, when I stepped out of my home, I faced wtih huge difficulties in a new vicinity, but those hursh conditions made me a more adaptable, flexible and a successful person. Furthermore, these new conditions develop the can do attitude, which is very important for anyone to become more confident. And being confident is the key to be successful. Without positive attitude toward life and confidence it is tough to get any work done in a harsh condition that we live in.",
        "On the other hand, staying inside the hometown also comes with lot of benefits. Firstly, by nurturing ones comfort zone one can take care of his old parents, which is not an easy job when he is outside his hometown. Second, Not leaving the neighborhood makes life easy in many ways, socializing with friends and family, networking with people, serving the community are to name a few. Finally, for people whose life is set and have lot of property to take care of, leaving their city does not make much sense.",
        "In conclusion, although I do undrstand why many people want to live in their hometown forever, I strongly believe for a better career path, and to learn more about the walks of life, the young people should walk out of their comfort zone and accommodate themselves in big cities to become more successful."
