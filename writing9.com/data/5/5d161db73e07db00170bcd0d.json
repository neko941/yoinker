        "Nowadays, the health care system deals with the growing population of overweight people which causes the problems of health. It is thought by some people that the key to tackling the issue is to include more sport lessons in the curriculum at schools. In my opinion, I completely agree with the statement , this way  definitely  will improve the current situation.",
        "First of all, growing number of obese people including children could be a serious problem. For instance, recent survey reveled that the number of overweight people increased six times more in comparison with the last decade situation. At the moment, children who do little sport and exercises are tend to have issues with heart, high sugar level, and blood pressure in the future.  Therefore the best solution of this problem is to increase total hours of physical education in the curriculum and encourage students to attend extracurricular classes.",
        "Another point to improve the existing situation is to involve parents into active lifestyle. It is evident that every child consciously or unconsciously follows parents\u2019 way of living.  In other words, if parents will be interested in being active and fit, that will encourage their children to do more physical activities. Promoting families to do more activities will solve health issues which will result in healthier generation in the future.",
        "In conclusion,  to deal with the health and weight issues by increasing the number of sport lessons in the school curriculum is crucial, because this is the best method to   keep children fit and healthy."
