        "There is a fact that luminaries of entertainment have a higher income than politicians these days. This can be credited to the magnitude of technological developments. Personally, I do not consider it as a positive trend because this may lead to political corruption.",
        "It cannot be denied that entertainment is one of the most lucrative industries. The reason entertainment programmes draw more attention than political ones is that people prefer to watch amusing shows after a hard-working day. Celebs have received a generous salary from a wide range of social media like Youtube, Instagram, Facebook. It is shown that a household name on Youtube can earn up to VND 100m a month. In addition, the main source of income of stars is from an inordinate amount of commercial ads due to the mushrooming of companies.",
        "However, I believe that the great disparity in salary between celebs and officials may lead to embezzlement issues. It is claimed that political corruption can be directly attributed to low income. Some politicians hold the opinion that they should have been paid much more than stars for their valuable contributions, thus they are not satisfied with their salaries and find an unacceptable way to earn more money. Besides, if the luminaries of entertainment have a higher income than the luminaries of politics, it seems like the younger generation will tend to want to become a showbiz star; which can lead to the fact that the government will be lacking political cadres in the future.",
        "In conclusion, I do admire celebs\u2019 fame as well as their luxury lives, but I do not agree the politicians\u2019 salary is having a long gap compared to showbiz stars."
