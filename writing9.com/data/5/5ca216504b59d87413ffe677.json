        "people have contrasting views about whether a satisfying career life is easily come from those people who choose their job in early period rather than who regularly switch jobs or not. In my opinion, chaging career paths could have some benefits, however, i tend to agree with the idea that remaining a simillar job might obtain more satisfied than frequently change.",
        "Generally speaking, regularly altering jobs could bring a lot of positive impacts to labours ( particular young people). One of the main reasons is that workers could figure out the most suitable career after trying several jobs and significant different workplaces for them. Another reason is that many workers find interesting when they have opportunities to face with new chanllenges instead of repetition tasks. For example, my close friend jumped out at least 4 jobs within 2 years after graduated, that give him a lot of experience and many friends.",
        "Despite the above arguments, sustainble job actually supply many advantages to employees. Owing to the fact that people stay in their workplace would have greater to promote in higher position, which affect directly to worker's income. Additionlly, people keep doing their jobs could avoid making mistakes when they are too simillar with it that could occur with new employees. For instance, many officers would not be able to work outside building when they choose other jobs in open area because different atmosphere.",
        "In conclusion, i would say that employees might gain more satisfied when they remain in their field for a long time than work in a short time and quit."
