        "During the time of technology boom , the prevelance of television and computer games has increased and gone along with myriad of violent incidents . While some people attributes it to exert a great ingluence on the public , the others believe it has no  impact on people\u2019s demeanour . I strongly believe that media violence do spoil our behaviour pattern to some extent .",
        "Firstly , people , especially children, have a tendency to do an impression of motives which was displayed on TV . For instance , children will imitate the way of battling on the virtual worlds and transfer it into real life . Moreover , the more aggression and violence you are surrounded by  , the more cold \u2013blooded and restrained you get .",
        "Secondly ,  the crimes of violence is attributed to the excessive access to gagets such as computer games or violent media . For example , the combat and  shooting games make teenagers become more truculent . Surpringly enough , they tranfer this warlike approach into the real world  as the way to evince their compative spirits and comfort themselves . As a result , the rate of juvenile delinquency has risen considerably .",
        "Last but not least , violence has inclination to turn to social evil . It is examplified that addictive gamer stole money or even resorted  to violence if they were detered  . The activities of such men represent a constant threat to the welfare society, and much being done to reform them.",
        "In conclusion , violence in contemporary media plays a part of role to shape children 's behavioural patterns . Therefore , we had better to make use of its function and minimize its effect ."
