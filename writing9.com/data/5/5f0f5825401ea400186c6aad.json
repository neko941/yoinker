        "As soon as people move toward retirement, there are many things to consider, like, where to settle for the rest of life.These old age people usually prefer to settle in the country where living cost is minimal; however, I believe that despite the monetary advantages, adapting in a different culture will be a real challenge for the oldies.",
        "Many older adults, mainly from English-speaking countries, plan to settle in other parts of the world where the cost of living is manageable. Undoubtedly, besides some benefits, the cost of living  in North America and England are extremes. The majority of people who work their entire lives in the North America or England and save  a hefty amount of money. Consequently,upon retirement, they want to spend their rest of life peacefully in the place where living expenses are nominal. For example, many North Americans opted to live in Central America where they can buy a big house with many rooms,a big garden with a servant quarter in a  few hundred dollars comparatively. Additionally, they will hire housemaids as many as they want at very affordable rates; maids can clean their house, prepare meals for them, and perform all day to day chores effectively.",
        "On the other hand, including some advantages, people who move to another region to live after-work lives peacefully have to make many compromises. People from North America who move to Panama, for example,have to adjust to a new culture in terms of language barriers, no queuing system; frequent blowing traffic horns; underdeveloped infrastructures. Hence, one has to be flexible with a good sense of humour to adjust to a complete novice society for senior citizens. Therefore, i think adjustment can create a big problem for elderly people.",
        "Ultimately the benefit of living out of one's native environment for a minimal cost of living, and drawbacks are to adjust in a new environment and culture."
