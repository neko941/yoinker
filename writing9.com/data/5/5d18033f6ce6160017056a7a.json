        "The issue of whether a country should spend a lot of money on these competitors has sparked off an intense debate. Some people, as advocates, suggest that huge national expenditure on supporting these competitors to take part in some worldwide sports competitions could improve the comprehensive state power. However, other as opponents claim that to spend money on children to take part in sports activities would be better than support these competitors. To a certain extent, I agree with these opponents, with some reservations. I aim at discussing both side of the issue and put up my opinion.",
        "On the one hand, it has well accepted that participating more sports activities could improve the health of children. However, nowadays, most of young generation locks physical excises and are reluctant to take part in sports. Accordingly, every country should implement policies to encourage and support children sports activities. For example, the government can build more sports facilities fitting for children or set up scholarship for these positive young sport participants. Consequently, when the government could spend more and more money on the children sports activities, the more benefits under the policies would address to children.",
        "On the other hand, spending a huge amount of money on supporting these professional competitors would encourage young children to take part in the sports. First of all, if a country has a huge expenditure on world wild professional competitions, this would directly encourage young children to be interested in sports and hope to be a professional sportman. Besides, young people would be encouraged to take part in the sports activities, when they can find that has been supported by their country. Thus, under a certain extent, I agree with these advocates to spend money on these professional sportmen, however the range of supporting should be controlled.",
        "To conclude, I concede that government should spend a huge amount of money on supporting children sports, when these young generation are the hope of the future. Nevertheless, I am convinced that expenditure on professional world wild sports activities are also important, and which could effectively encourage, directly or indirectly these children to participate sports."
