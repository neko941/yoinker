        "Since ages, every single person has been inclined towards the concept a perfect community. However, this is also true that there have been many contradictory viewpoints on this topic. I personally consider that education is the key element which can lead to a perfect society and realistically, people can achieve this aim by right intention and individual efforts.",
        "Undoubtedly, receiving good education is the foundation of a good society. The foremost reason behind my thinking this is that formal education helps people to understand the value of relationships and uniformity by studying with children from all walks of life. The school atmosphere inculcates the sense of belongingness and care that leads to brotherhood and love within a society. This feature makes the society an ideal one. In addition to that, by learning at school, the duties of a citizen, people are anticipated towards their responsibilities for society such as keeping the environment clean. Those who realise the impact of environment on their life, put extra effort in this direction and make a place liveable for all.",
        "With regards to individual efforts, people can start from their home. For this ,they should, for example, save water. Also they should educate their children as well. By taking this initiative, people can help in combating the devastating problem of water shortage in many areas. Additionally, those who have been gifted with good communication skills or developed leadership qualities, should organise some sort of workshops and campaigns so as to motivate others for partaking in social activities such as plantation. By this,they can decelerate the detrimental impact of green house effect on climate.",
        "In conclusion, I would subscribe to the view that receiving value education is a boon and this is the core of an ideal society because only a group of literate people can construct and look after a perfect society."
