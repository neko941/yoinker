        "Nowadays the fact that humans seldom interact with their neighbors is leading to a negative trend in local communities. There are several reasons for this trend and the role of overworking or desire for making money are the most imperative among them. However, there are some measures that can be implemented to tackle this issue.",
        "In today\u2019s life technology-dependent era, people are busy with their work. The majority of streets are full of busy people who are rushing to their office or talking to the phone about work. That is to say a number of people lack connection with their neighbors. In my opinion, the governments should reduce the workers\u2019 hours and organize extra day offs. For instance, a well-known company called Microsoft cut down the working hours and allowed its employees to work on the dependence of their will and this trend has dramatically increased workers\u2019 productivity on any project.",
        "It is important to consider that the tendency for money of humans\u2019 activity is now raising incredibly fast. To be more precise, many people are becoming busier and earning much money for their requirements. As a consequence, they have less time to socialize in local communities. We can observe that most individuals who are moving away from their relatives such as friends, neighbors because of money. To resolve this issue, people should have their own aspirations to put the neighborhood above financial success.",
        "To conclude, it is difficult to find time for neighbors because of several reasons. However, I tend to believe that government and people have a great responsibility upon this problem and they should address this issue considering the ways that I have mentioned above."
