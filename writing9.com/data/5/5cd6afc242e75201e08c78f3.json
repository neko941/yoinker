        "In recent times, there has been a debate about the most important subject to be studied in school. While some people consider history as one of the subjects to be given the utmost priority, others think that subjects like science and technology are more important. This essay will discuss both sides of the argument and five evidence to why science and technology should be prioritized.",
        "To begin, people in support of history have their reasons. One of then is that humans' origin and development is clearly portrayed by this subject. Thus, culture of a place is better appreciated. For example, South Africans know about apartheid championed by Nelson Mandela through history. Hence, giving preference to the study of history helps individuals and government to understand their past, as such serving as a basis for future development. Why then will there not be an argument in support of this subject.",
        "However, science and technology should be given utmost importance. The numerous benefits make it more necessary. Firstly, the development of  several gadgets that makes life easier nowadays is driven by these subjects. Transportation, unlike in the past, for example, has been made more comfortable with the invention of aeroplanes and motor vehicles. Furthermore medicine has advanced recently, with production of  vaccines and drugs that has tackled previously incurable diseases. Anti-Kochs cures tuberculosis within 6-8 months. It is clearly obvious that these courses outweigh history in importance.",
        "In conclusion, although school subjects like history have germane roles in the society, emphasis should be place on science and technology as they have revolutionized the existence of mankind. Students should thus he encouraged to study them more."
