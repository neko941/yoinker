        "Whilst, many individuals think that authority money should be expend on essential objects rather than arts like music and painting. In my opinion, spending on health and education in top priority, but disagree with no funding for arts. I would discuss about both these views in the following paragraphs.",
        "To embark with, there are myriad reason, why I am  claiming that authority should be spent money on vital things such as health and education. The first and an important reason, health is necessary for everyone. These days, diseases are very common, all people suffer from many types of sickness like diabetes, obesity and asthma. For this purpose, Government should be opened more and more hospitals and health center; mankinds may do easily treatment. Moreover, education play vital role in humankind' s life. If humanity will decent educated, country will easily develop.",
        "Contrary above to the statement, art is also important in humanity life such as painting and music. Furthermore, painting express the emotions of masses, there is no need learn to any type language for understand it. Thus, everyone can easily understand it; which has shown in the painting. In addition to, melody illustrates the culture's music, instead of international music. For example, Vande Matram is special song of India since it represents the nation. Music creates more opportunities for employment; native can decent earn with the help of music.",
        "In the conclusion, both are necessary for mankinds. Government should be spent more money on education and health, although also spending for art but in limit."
