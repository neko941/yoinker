        "Parents play a significant role in children's life. There has been a constant debate on whether parents should be held legally responsibile for whetever their ofspring are doing. I disagree with the above ideology.",
        "It is undoubtedly a proven fact that children learn everything from their parents. Even though schools are important in ganing knowledge, the learning starts from the house. They observe what ever going on at home and most of the time try to mimic what elders are doing. For instance, every kid try to imitate their parents. Moreover, the environment in which a child grows definitely impact their behavior. Those whose are coming from a stable and happy family will grow up as responsible adults whereas those having disturbed childhood mostly becomes anti-social and end up in criminal activities.",
        "However, I donot believe that parents should be legally responsible for their children's deeds. Nowadays, a lot of kids are addicted to mobile phones and internet. Sometimes, if both parents are working, it is becoming difficult for them to control what kids are watching. Although they try to teach them what is right or wrong, there has been cases where children get into bad company and start using drugs and do illegal activities. Even though to an extent parents are responsible, they cannot be blammed for everything. Schools should be providing enough guidance and awareness on what to follow and how to grow up as a responsible individual. Teachers ought to play an important role in the development of a child.",
        "To conclude, I agree with the fact that everything starts from home. But, I am of the opinion that parents and teachers both are responsible for the well being of a child and blaming one of them is inappropriate."
