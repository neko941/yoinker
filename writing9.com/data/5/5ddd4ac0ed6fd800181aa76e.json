        "Vaccinations play a vital role in preventing numerous childhood diseases. Some parents believe that vaccinating their children would be beneficiary if it is mandated, and a few others argue that they shall have the right to choose to immunize their children. In my opinion, prevention is better than cure. I strongly support the fact that a law shall",
        "be made to the parents to vaccinate their children.",
        "Parents are solely responsible for the well being of their children, and they possess every right in choosing to immunize them. However, if they are ignorant of the effects of not",
        "vaccinating their children, it would cost them dearly. For example, as per a recent survey, 75% of children are suffering from polio, which is a common disease among children that could be avoided by vaccination.",
        "Making a law to immunize children would make the parents abide by it. Consequently, the number of children suffering from common curable diseases could be reduced significantly.",
        "Furthermore, diseases that can spread easily among children could be reduced to a great extent as a suitable host is not available. For instance, countries like the USA have prevented yellow fever throughout the country by mandating vaccinations to the citizens as well as to the tourists. Issuing a law to vaccinate the children would not only help in curing a disease",
        "but also in preventing it to spread.",
        "To summarize, parents may not know about every disease, and being ignorant of them would do them more harm than good. It would be easier for the government and the parents if there is a law to carry out the vaccination timely. Moreover, parents could demand the government for more information on common diseases, and there is a scope for the government to invest more resources in improving the vaccines."
