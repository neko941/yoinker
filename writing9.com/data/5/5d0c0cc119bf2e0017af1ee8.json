        "Declining health of citizens due to poor diet is major concern of many governments in the world. Different people have distinct mindset. Some section of society deem that it is personal job to take care of their health and food, whereas other opine that government should take care of their citizen's diet. The following paragraphs would shed light onto the approaches before making the final conclusion along with my perspective.",
        "To comence with the first notion, there are myriad things to be shared in the first statement. First and foremost, there is no dought that it is personal responsibility of individual to make their own food which gives them freedom to make food of their own choice and it also helps    them to keep healthy themself. Besides this, the children who does not have knowledge about food, probably will be obessed due to unhealthy food consumption, In this case their parents can provide them healthy food which will help them to keep away from health related problems. For example, there was a survey done by the times of america in 2008 which stated that the people used to cook and eat  their food themself at home were more healthy than who used to consume junk food.",
        "However, there is an eminent adage that says,'' beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder,'' likewise others believe that the government should take care of thier citizens diet because nowadays, people often have less option regarding food and they have to rely on junk food which contains more fats, sugars and salts due to the pressures of work. Government could regulate the content of such foods by aplying heavy taxes on the fast food companies which will not only result in the automatic reduction of fast food consumption but also help to maintaining health of individual.",
        "To recapitulate, It can be said that, \"every coin has two sides'' in the same manner, both aspects of taking care of personal health and diet by individual or by government are crucial for both groups of people and can not be denied."
