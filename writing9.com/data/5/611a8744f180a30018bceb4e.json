        "Migration these days has become a very common phenomenon, People are moving to a new nation for work-related purposes. It is a highly debatable topic that whether the children from immigrant households benefit from this move or not. In this essay, I\u2019ll pen down both the views covering benefits and drawbacks followed by my own opinion.",
        "Those whose core argument revolves around the drawback of this move, contend that numerous challenges may come in front of a child to deal with. New language, different food, new school, new friends, culture change, weather conditions are some of the many challenges  which a child has to adapt immediately. A child may take a long time to get familiar with. This can ultimately bring discomfort which hinders the most pivotal aspect of a child\u2019s life, his study at school. It may have a permanent effect on child personality, his or her level of confidence.",
        "Nevertheless, once the child gets  familiar with the new environment, there is a wide array of opportunities for such kids. They become immune to such challenges in their lives and can think beyond it. With this, they are more open to people from different races, colours, communities, languages. This can engrave deeply in his psyche that individuals are different entities and are global citizens. Citizenship can not be territorial. This may lead to a bias-free world.",
        "To sum up, despite of the fact that moving from native land to a new nation may put many obstacles But all these obstacles are temporary which will not be there over a period of time. I strongly believe that they will be world-changing catalysts in formulating a perfect world in which racism, discrimination would cease to exist."
