        "Studying in developed nations such as Australia, Britain or America provides not only knowledge but also global exposure to students. Some people move there to pursue their higher education while some people send their children to do schooling. There are numerous advantages of the same. Firstly, one becomes independent by opting  a job while studying in their college or university. Secondly, it gives an edge over others while looking for a job or settling over there.",
        "English is used widely today in every area of business. Therefore, it becomes important to have a good command over the language. This becomes another possible reason for people who wants to study in English. Moreover, by learning English, one becomes confident and becomes ready  for  one\u2019s later stages of life.",
        "Regional languages such as Hindi, Sanskrit, Telugu, Russian, French, Spanish, Chinese  bounds a person when he visits another country. While English, being a widely spoken international language helps a person in communicating with other people. It breaks the communication barriers and one can easily make friends when he goes in English-speaking countries.",
        "Although regional languages are important to stay connected with one\u2019s roots yet English plays a vital role when career aspects are concerned. It also helps in immigration as tests such as IELTS are conducted to check deep knowledge and command over the language.",
        "To recapitulate, English has become an important international language. It is spoken widely today and helps in communicating with people from various nations. Many people immigrate to English-speaking countries to pursue their education and for skilled jobs which can help them in raising their standards of living."
