        "In the contemporary world, tertiary education has become paramount. However, a lot of deserving students are unable to enroll in colleges and universities because of financial limitations, which is really very sad. The only rescue for such candidates is the free higher education provided by the government. Some people argue that students must bear the cost of their university studies instead of utilizing the state funds. But, I disagree with this notion.",
        "First and foremost, the tuition fee in universities is generally high. The cost of accommodation/hostel, commuting, examinations, books and stationery further add up to the expenses. Hence, if a person is not from an affluent financial background, it becomes very difficult for him/her to pursue higher education. Quite often, bright students lose the motivation to study in colleges or universities and instead start working after completion of secondary school. This is a serious flaw that deprives young adults of equality of opportunity and promotes discrimination in society.",
        "Furthermore, tertiary education offers numerous benefits to individuals and society. College/University graduates have greater intellectual, problem-solving skills and civic mindedness as compared to their non-college counterparts. Higher economic and job security, improved standard of living, increased tax revenues and greater workforce productivity are some other tangible plus points of higher education. These factors are pivotal to the development of any nation. Free university education to all is therefore justifiable.",
        "To sum up, education is a fundamental right to all. I believe that it should not be obligatory for scholars to pay their higher education expenses, especially if they are worthy of it. Free education to the needy is a great encouragement which should be promoted in the future."
