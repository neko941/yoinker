        "Motorists are often found in violation of traffic rules, this could be due to less policing, but also due to lack of respect for the law. In my opinion, traffic offenses can be curtailed by stricter punishments as well as helping people understand the potential consquences of violation.",
        "In recent years, there has been a sharp increase in the number of cars on the road. In most situation, vehicle owners are at fault for causing accidents because of their disregard for traffic rules. Generally, it is believed that laws backed by sanctions are effective in controlling violations, Laws which allow for stricter punishments often prevents people from infractions. For example, since the local traffic police has started implementing punish for those who do not wear seatbelts, the number of people actually wearing seatbelts has drastically gone up. As Austin pointed out, whenever there is threath of punishment, more compliance can be seen.",
        "However, on the flip side, there are those who argue that once the respect of laws is internalised, even if there is no one to check misconduct, people will often not break the law. For example, if one is at a signal in the middle of the night with no sign of an officer or cameras, people who respect the law, who have internalised the law, will not break the signal. This type of internalisation will almost always be taught at a very young age.",
        "Hence, to conclude, in my opinion, for immediate action, laws need to be backed by sanctions to control misdeamour and major violations."
