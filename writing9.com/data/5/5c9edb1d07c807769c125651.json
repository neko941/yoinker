        "Many people believe that the expenditure on enhancing healthy lifestyle to avoid from diseases rather than spending money on medical conditions to cure people of their available health issues. While I agree that impulsing healthy lifestyle should be invested, I also think that the support of government for treating many patients is likely to be more vital.",
        "On the one hand, there are serveral reasons why I believe that authority should spend their money on encouraging healthy lifestyle. Firstly, it is true that some diseases might result from sedentary life on a daily basis. People seem to be so caught up in their works and studies, hence, they are not accustomed to do exercises regularly to maintain their health. Secondly, more people tend to prefer travelling by cars to walking or to cycling, which leads to a significant increase in the number of people being more prone t obesity in manycountries around the world. Therefore, it is necessary for government to spend money on not only constructing more new sport centres but also on improving the quality of public transport to advocate people to live healthier lifestyle.",
        "On the other hand, I also think that the expenditure on the treatment of people who are suffering illness is more important. The first reason is that beside unhealthy lifestyle, there are some other reasons which may cause serious health issues. In Vietnam, for example, the hazardous problem of dirty food, water and air pollution all have becomed burning topics that everyone concerns because they have been detrimental directly to their lives. Another reason is that many patients, especially who have chronic and acute diseases, needs medicines and effectively medical techniques to be cured. As a result, the most essential thing for people who are ill already is the support from government in the way of spending public money on enhancing the quality of services in many hospitals and researching on medical conditions.",
        "In conclusion, spending public money on the treatment of people who are having illness is less important than the expenditure on encouraging healthy lifestyle to prevent diseases. Although it is necessary to invest in improving people\u2019s lifestyle, I think that spending on curing patients is more important."
