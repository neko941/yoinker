        "Olympic games are admittedly a divine arena where sports luminaries from different parts of the world united together in a single platform to exhibit their best performance for their mother country. Even though some people ascertain that technological innovations have faded the significance of this particular event in the current century, I strongly stand against this statement.",
        "To comments, the importance of Olympics is still at the peak, this could be evident from the competition among various nations to host Olympic meets. At the same time, this game has became a prestigious arena in order to showcase the extravagance, economical stability as well as hospitality of a particular nation. For example, China spent almost 2,000,000 crores to set up Olympic village in Beijing in 2014.",
        "On the contrary, some people argue that technological improvements has been taken a heavy toll on the games, but it is extremely a false view because as the technology increases, so does the technicality in the event. For instance, many countries including America and Australia has developed new sensors and electronic chips  not only to monitor but also to assess the performance done by the sports stars. Another point worth considering is that in one go,Olympics in turn aids to ease out international tensions between states, flourishes tourism or industrial sector and many more.",
        "To conclude what I perceive from this context is that all the Olympics is a game which had orginated in Greece before two centuries, the glory of the game is still there. Therefore, it is apparent that the reputation of the game must be there in the future, till the world ends."
