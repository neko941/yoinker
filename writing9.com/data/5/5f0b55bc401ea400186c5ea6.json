        "Majority people have less mixed with their next-doors and it could be negative impact on local communities. This trend is mainly due to guarding their privacy and interest in social media. However, there are a number of measures that can implemented to remedy a situation of lack of interaction with neighbors.",
        "One of the reason for having a lack of communication with their neighbor is preference to maintain their privacy. Although most people spend their weekend stay at home, they often do not want to interact with them. Instead, they would be involved in solitary activities such as reading a book or cooking. Another cause of rare interaction is digital media which is many people have engaged in modern society. For instance, they might actively communicate with their friends on social media or play online computer game. These issues could lead to a serious problem in the community.",
        "There are number of ways to tackle less communication of neighbors. Firstly, the government should encourage residents to participate in volunteering work to increase sense of neighborliness. It would be cleaning neighborhood or help to local poor neighbors. As a result, they will encounter with local people and get to know each other closely. Secondly, founders of social media should invent app for neighbor in order to establish neighborly ties. After that they can keep communication with next-doors even though when they are away from home which allow them maintain long-term relationship.",
        "In conclusion, limited interaction between neighbors can cause a serious issue in local residents. In order to overcome this difficulty, the government should establish volunteering work as well as inventers need create neighborly program."
