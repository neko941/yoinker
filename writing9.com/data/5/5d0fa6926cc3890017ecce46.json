        "It is argued by some that the mother and father should teach their kids to be better individual of society, while others believe that the educationsla institutions help children to learn this. Although, the fundamanetal behaviour starts at home, I believe that the schools play crucial role in desciplining the young children.",
        "On the one hand, parents teach their children to learn good behaviour by monitoring their attitudes right from the yound age. That is to say,",
        "kinds spend a lot of time at thier homes so that the elders have enough opportunity  to guide them with proper instructions to emerge as a good person. For example, a recent survey states that young individuals develop the best charectersitics with the guidance from their families. However, I believe that the parents can be particial towards their kids by supporting their misbehaviour because of the compassion.",
        "On the other hand, some would argue that the school play prominent role controlling thier pupils by incorporating good traning system. In other words, teachers closely observe the conduct of the pupil and take necessary desciplinary action incase of misconduct. For instance, research on mindsets of children by Thomas states that 70% of the young generation tend to behave properly with stingent rules applied at schools.I believe that the educational organizations play prominent role in shaping up an individual with strong standards.",
        "In conclusion, although the basic behaviour is lerant at home, I believe that colleges and schools are the best places to incorporate this in a young mind to become better person in the society."
