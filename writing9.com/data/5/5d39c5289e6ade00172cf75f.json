        "Over the years, the consumption of products has increased owing to higher incomes. However, as the salary hikes, people gradually become addictive to shopping and saves less. In my opinion, this can be detrimental to society as people will never be at peace and always be lured to earn more money.",
        "Due to high earning and purchasing, a person gets shopaholic and a cycle of never-ending demands is initiated. Firstly, as monetary situation improves, lifestyle of people becomes expensive by investing on high-end products. To illustrate, many people buy new cars when their salary is increased, though the old car was functional and fulfilling all the requirements. Secondly, a vicious circle of never ending wishes for materialistic things gets started, when a person is over indulged in shopping. Therefore, at the end of the month, they do not have funds in their banks, no matter how huge the salary is.",
        "Eventually, savings for the future is minimized because of extravagant lifestyle. Moreover, incorporating king size lifestyle is easy, but compromising lavish lifestyle during monetary issues is extremely painful. To exemplify, many businessman commits suicide after the business failure, as they are not able to degrade their standard of living. However, circulation of money increases in the market, as number of customer increases, but this cannot suffice for the problems people go through by overspending.",
        "In Conclusion, people should not get trapped in the cycle of earning high and spending high. Attaining a balance between spending and saving money is the main key to lead a quality life."
