        "The topic of anti-aging is becoming increasingly popular. The major reasons why people want to look younger are increased self esteem and the significant amount of negative societal pressure on bodily perfection. In my opinion, it is very good for people to try to appear younger than their ages because it helps increase effectiveness and efficiency, as well as improved health.",
        "With the advent of social media and technological advancement, it has become ubiquitious for most people to want to look younger and feel beautiful. Human beings have existed for centuries, but are yet to comfortably accept the body's aging process. We tend to boost our self confidence if our outward appearance is spectacular. The society frowns upon aging and portays it as a pathology. People who look older are seen as unattractive and are most often than not segregated and bullied. From personal experience, I attended a school reunion, during which I was chastised by my fellow colleagues for looking five years older. I was gloomy most of the time , however, I proceeded to work on my skin care routine. After weeks of vigorous skin therapy, I started receiving compliments and I have felt really good about myself ever since.",
        "Everywhere in the world today, there are adverts of skin anti-aging creams, methods and regimens. Fashion lines exhibit clothings and fabrics that make people look younger and vibrant. Personally, I believe this is a welcome development. Human beings should be able to enjoy the world without a fixation on aging. People see older looking individuals as weak and dependent, but really its an evidence of maturity and a good force of nature. Nevertheless, in a society where looking younger is already the norm, it should be embraced. When people feel better about themselves, productivity increases significantly. Experts have shown that the feeling of looking a year younger than one's actual age has tremendous health benefits ranging from reduced blood pressure to engaging in healthier lifestyles and improved mood.",
        "In conclusion, the art of looking younger is increasingly popular. Majority of the people tend to try to look younger because of the way society portrays bodily perfection, as well as to boost self esteem. In my opinion, i think it is a good thing because it results in an elated mood which has significant positive benefits on health."
