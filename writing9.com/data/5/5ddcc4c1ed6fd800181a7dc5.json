        "Nowadays, tourism is one of the fastest growing and most dynamic industries in the global economy, especially in emergent nations because of its enormous advantages. It is argued that these countries should control the extension of this industry while others believe that this enlargement is necessary and inevitable in today\u2019s international integration phase. I agree with the second opinion.",
        "On the one hand, tourism results in negative influences on environment. The rapid development of tourism implicates the spread of urbanization, deforestation and overpopulation, consequently causing the greenhouse effect and the imbalance on ecosystems, biodiversity and human livelihoods.",
        "On the other hand, the massive potential benefits from tourist industry is obviously undeniable; therefore, this development is certainly positive. Firstly, tourism has a significant contribution to the growth of economy. With the diverse consumption of goods, services from visitors, national income and taxes are increased. In addition, many countries take advantage of tourist industry development to attract investment in upgrading infrastructures, services, facilities and investors finds various opportunities to make benefits vice versa. Secondly, the people\u2019s living standard is visibly improved, especially the local people. There are numerous jobs created to cater for tourists worldwide. Accordingly, the unemployment has been sharply dropped by years. To take a proven illustration, Sapa is an attractive mountainous destination of Vietnam, charming a huge number of domestic and international arrivals yearly. Despite the fact that the majority of population here is ethnic minorities, people can make money easily through selling hand-made souvenirs, building homestays on hire, especially being a tourist guide with impressive English ability\u2026etc. Finally, the expansion of tourism creates favorable conditions for historical and cultural exchange and preservation of each nation. Each area has its own featured culture and formation and development history which draw visitors aside to explore. Travelling to different lands, tourists can experience and spread the locals\u2019 habits, thinking, custom, history...etc. It is un-exaggerated that one of the most effective methods to advertise one country is through tourism.",
        "In conclusion, although there are still many contrary opinions in tourism extension, if the government has suitable development policies to restrain its disadvantages, this tendency is one of the top-wise choices and strategic development goals of the growing nations."
