        "Mostly people these days are unaware of their neighborhood, owing to the hectic work life and the lack of trust on other people.  To tackle this issue, community centers can be constructed in the localities, and special occasions or festivals can be celebrated within the community, to bring people together.",
        "People have become ignorant of their neighbors due to tremendous amount of work, and they have become apprehensive of strangers due to soaring crime rate. First and foremost, everyone is pre-occupied nowadays because of most of the time spent in working and travelling far for job. Therefore, due to extremely tiring weekdays, people prefer to relax in their home on weekends, instead of connecting with their surroundings. Another reason for not acquainting with neighbors is that people have become more alert and apprehensive of other people\u2019s intentions, as the numbers of heinous crimes are increasing rapidly.",
        "To cater to these problems, authorities and local associations should collaboratively come forward to build community centre in their vicinities, and also cultural events or festival celebrations should be held in the localities. Primarily, building a regional centre where people can express and exchange ideas is a great way to promote interaction. For instance, many localities held monthly meetings to take input from their residents about the enhancements that can be done in the area. Not only people get to know each other in such meetings, but also start trusting each other, as they interchange ideas about the welfare of the community. Furthermore, celebrating festivals together will enrich the relations between families, as people will connect better over foods and drinks.",
        "To conclude, indubitably people have become uninterested to know about their next door neighbors, but with deliberate efforts of extensive community services, they can be driven closer."
