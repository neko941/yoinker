        "Hobby is something that you love doing in your free time and I feel, it is someone's hobby because he or she likes doing that activity. When a person enjoys something he does not find it difficult. So I completely disagree with the notion that hobby should be difficult if you want to enjoy that.",
        "The most important consideration is, if you choose something difficult as your hobby then you might lose the interest in pursuing it. Rather than enjoying it you might feel exhausted, which results in quitting that particular hobby. For instance, if someone chooses his hobby as bodybuilding, which includes heavy weight lifting and tough exercises like push-ups then one can easily find it cumbersome and can leave that after a few days.",
        "In contrast, if the hobby is easy and something which one loves doing then it will be more fruitful. For example, if someone's hobby is walking then one can start with a few kilometres of walking and might proceed further gradually depending on stamina. Also, the person feels motivated by seeing progress in terms of physical and mental fitness. Which helps them to continue with the hobby. In addition to this, one can choose a difficult hobby only if they have strong will power to pursue it.",
        "To recapitulate, a hobby is something which one enjoys, so choosing a difficult hobby might lead to quitting that when one is not able to achieve desired results. Therefore, everyone should start with easy levels then they might take it to more extreme levels, which helps to keep them motivated."
