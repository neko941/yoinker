        "Nowadays, there is a common phrase: \u201cYou only live once.\u201d It indicates the fact that people should care how and with who they spend their time. While some people consider routines and stabile life without changes better, other disagree and believe that changes are positive components of life.",
        "On the one hand, there are some people who enjoy in normal life without adventures and taking opportunities. Those people prefer routines that make their lives organized and mostly the same each day. Additionally, those people avoid risks and changes because of fear of losing what they have. Moreover, knowing what will come next and how they can reacts in the situation makes them feel secure. Furthermore, they do not appreciate new challenges, they are satisfied with what they own. What is more, usually they do not get involved in accidents or problems because they tend to avoid any risky situation.",
        "On the other hand, if person decide to change things, life can bring them many opportunities. Some people are more enthusiastic and adventurous, so they radley accept new things and changes in their lives. Not only that they gain new knowledge but also amazing experience. Additionally, changes can give them opportunity to learn more about themselves and others. For instance, changing job can bring to person new knowledge, new surrounding and new experience. Moreover, with chances in life, person can feel fulfilled and satisfied.",
        "In conclusion, both statements have advantages. In my opinion, taking chances is better way of living life because you never know what can you achieve and gain form opportunities."
