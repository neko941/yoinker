        "The modern society without learning the English language students cannot do anything in the future world. Because  English becomes a more popular and global language in the world. Some people were arguing, subtends needed to learn English as a second option, while others were arguing, educating a foreign language would put the native language at risk. This essay will explore both sides of the argument and finally express my view on that.",
        "First of all, these days studying English is a most important thing rather than in earlier decades. In the ,world without ,it we cannot move forward through future education or career path.For instance, consider with our country many companies run their business through international market, while their all document, the presentation and interviews depend on the way of their talking and capacity. Apart from that, without knowing these major requirements job seekers could not find appropriate job opportunities in the future. If you prefer to learn that, it has numbers of benefits can be pinpointed, such as the students can get their highest studies through international universities, easy to cope with global and find proper employment, it helps to make a relationship in the foreign environment.",
        "On the other hand, the native tongue and other traditional subject helps to the students identify in our society, historical diversities, cultural background and many more. However, in the present culture depend on the English. Plenty of the nations use this as their common tongue.",
        "In conclude, I support this first opinion, I entirely agree with that. As a human begins, we have to adhere with the adaptation and various situation, challenges. Everyone should educate in the upcoming world, while it will beneficial in the future life."
