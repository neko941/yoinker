        "Preparing food has been an important part of the daily routine in most cultures. Recently, advances made in information technology, social networking and refrigeration have made it easier and quicker to prepare food. This has led to an improved productivity of people, mostly women, and also provided access to various types of cuisines and their recipe.In this essay, we will analyze some of these reasons and their impact on the lives of the people.",
        "Recent advancement made in cooking methods like Refrigeration, microwave and oven has reduced the cooking time to a third as required before. This provides opportunities to the people working in the kitchen, mostly women, to explore additional careers outside of the home. Increase in the workforce and productivity has also contributed to the growth of the economies. For example, since the feminist movement in the eighties, major economies of the world has grown by 4% year on year.",
        "Refrigeration and cooking recipes on the social media have led to better information sharing ,which has provided people with access to different cultures and their cuisines. This has led to more immigration of people and cross cultural interaction. For example, Americans now have access to Chinese and Indian foods which are very different from the American food.",
        "To conclude, Although there are other reasons for feminist movement, shorter cooking time is definitely one of the reasons which empowered women to seek opportunities beyond the kitchen. Immigration has impacted lives of the people to a great extent and access to different cuisines is one of the factors which has promoted immigration."
