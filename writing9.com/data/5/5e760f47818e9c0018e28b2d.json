        "In this age of globalisation, together with the promotion of several dominant languages in the world, every year we see the disappearance of other local languages. While some people argued that the extinction of certain native languages is insignificant, I\u2019m strongly against this view as",
        "On the one hand, I hold a belief that language is the fundamental tools to communicate with a native and to understand the culture and traditions of a community. If a language come to an extinct, the whole history about the locals and their culture will fall into incomprehension and erase its name from the world. Take the Voynich manuscript as an example. The book was written in a relatively alien language that is completely novel to the linguists. It has proven to hold valuable information about a whole area.",
        "Opponents of the view may argue that a variety of languages only brings confusion and difficulty in communication. This is justified to some extent, however it is difficult to accept this point of view as with the introduction of technology, it has become relatively easy for people to transfer one language to another using different means of translation. As more and more linguistists and technology developers are now working to bring more and more language into the worldwide dictionary, difficulty due to difference in communication may be abolish eventually.",
        "In conclusion, I believe the fact that an increasing number of languages now dies out is undesirable, and  attempts should be made to preserve these dying languages."
