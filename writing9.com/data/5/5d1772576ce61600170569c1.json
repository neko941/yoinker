        "Nowadays, a lot of people are depending on the internet for daily activities including studies. Some argue that public libraries are no longer necessary since all the information are now available online. I completely disagree with this statement.",
        "One the one hand, few argue that public libraries are no longer required and they have become redundant. With the advent of technology, whatever infomation needed are present in the internet and we can easily access with the help of mobile pohones or laptops. A small 2GB pendrive can hold information that used to take the space of a big room in olden days. Even books are available along with latest updates and this will avoid the need of having multiple updated versions of same books. Also, since it is available in small devices, it can be easily carried anywere.Moreoever, libaries need huge amount of money for maintanence and this can be avoided with the help of digital version of the same.",
        "On the other hand, another group of people are of the opinion that libraries are still necessary and I completely agree with them. Many of the old and rare books do not have the digital copies and they are available there. Once these places are closed, there won't be any way to access these valuable information. Also, reading over the phone or any device needs a lot of concentration and this will have adverse effect on eyes. For instance, majority of teenegers now use spectacles due to the over use of gadgets. Since these gadgets work on power, once they are damages, there are high chances that the information is gone unless it is stored in the cloud. Although primary use of libraries are to read books, it is also a place where people gather and converse with each other. This in turn will serve as an entertainment for people in their busy life.",
        "To conclude, there is no doubt that the internet has made our lives a lot easier in getting information in a faster way. In my opinion, how much ever we change, certain aspects will still have its value and libraries are once such place. They should be preserved and ought to be considered as a place of importance."
