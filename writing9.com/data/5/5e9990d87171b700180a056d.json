        "One of the most conspicuous trends of today's world is the colossal upsurge in the violence in the media promotes violence in our society. There is a widespread worry that this will only lead to a myriad of concerns in the society. In my opinion, media has more negative impacts than positives in the society.",
        "On the one hand, critics may point out that one of the most significant benefits of society is to get information and news at the right time through media. For example, people are distancing themselves from newspapers due to depending on social media for news, unlike in the past now have more strengthens bonds with your loved ones. Distance is not a barrier anymore because of social media as you can easily communicate with your friends and relatives overseas.",
        "On the other hand, there are a number of arguments in favor of my stance. One of the most preponderant ones is that media does contribute to violence in our society by examining music, video games and web Sites which has some negative effects for the community in various ways. Firstly, violence which influences behavior in our society is music. This sort of media is a concern to parents who are interested in the development and growth of their children because of the negative and destructive themes of some kinds of music. According to, \"Times magazine December 2017 edition\", the proportion of violence influences due to music has increased from 15 percent to 30 percent today. Secondly, a large portion of violence which influences behavior in our society is video games. Our youth who play a lot of violent video games have an aggressive behavior. They acting out criminal fantasies and earning points for attacking and killing innocent people in games.",
        "Lastly, in my opinion, the government of Australia is taking a great initiative in educating its society on the impact of media violence. Someone, is being encouraged to spend a less portion of their time in social and online gaming websites in order to compensate for media violence."
