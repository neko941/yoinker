        "People spend a great deal of time on social networks to share their own experience with other members. There is a question in this regard: which is better to do? sharing recorded own experience in the social-networks or not to do it? As it relates to me, I firmly believe that keeping a record of our own experience and uploading it can be beneficial. There are two reasons clarifying my point of view which are described as follows.",
        "First, being in contact with others and share their own experience can motivate both members, the listener and the record-keeper. In this regard, people by uploading their own experience in the social-networks such as Instagram may reach a broad appeal which encourages them to do it again and insist on whatever they do. Furthermore, other members who are in contact with this individual, who share his or her own experience, get this person as their role model. For instance, when I was an undergraduate student, I used to work in the field of Robotics and I usually shared my own experience-products that I made",
        "in the laboratory with my followers on Instagram. I believe that their comments about my work experience not only showed that how much my work influenced  them but also encouraged me to spend a great deal of time on my project. Hence,  keeping records and sharing them on a social-networks is a kind of motivation for all members.",
        "Another significant reason to be mentioned is that by sharing people\u2019s own experience on social-networks, they may be able to find some people which are professional in their work. In this vein, they are able to start a communication with them and increase the efficiency of their products. In the example which I mentioned in the second paragraph, I could find an expert person and this connection helped us to flourish our talents and finally, write a high impact paper.",
        "To conclude, in my point of view the advantages of  uploading people's own experience with others on  social-networking sites overweight the disadvantages. First, this can make a great motivation not only for person who share but also for person as a follower. Second, helps the people to find individuals in the same favourites."
