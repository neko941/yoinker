        "Well developed nations are supposed to help lesser nations with charity in situations of disasters that are related to nature. This essay agrees with the statement because the act of helping others proves these countries humane and doing this will not affect their economy negatively.",
        "The act of helping others will prove  these countries humane. It is only a normal human response to respond to the suffering of others by helping them out with whatever thing they need at that point and this can be seen in nations helping nations. A very good example that portrays this is the help that was received by the Asian country Nepal, which is a less developed nation, when they experienced their first volcanic eruption in 10years, in 2002. A relief was sent to this country by the United States. So other rich countries can learn from this as well and be well concerned about their less privileged neighbours. This will prove their humanity.",
        "Moreso, doing this will not affect these countries' economy negatively. Since these countries are well developed in all aspects and are very rich, it will cost them absolutely nothing helping other nations who are less privileged. Since they have nothing to lose, it will only make sense to help. A study carried out in 2003 on the United States' economy showed that there was a 10% increase in the country's gross domestic product, which is directly proportional to the increase in the wealth of the nation. This was around the time that they helped the country Nepal. So rather than have a loss, it is seen that this country rather increased in its wealth.",
        "To conclude, rich countries should provide assistance to poorer countries facing naturally occurring disasters because it is an act of humanity and it will cost their economy nothing to do so."
