        "The population in many countries are increasing rapidly day by day, therefore, it is very vital for those nations to spend most of their budget to improve their transportation network. Many believe that majority of the state\u2019s fund should be used in the construction of fast rails, while some people claim that it should be spent for the improvisation of the transportation services that are in existence. This essay discusses both of these perspectives in details.",
        "Undoubtedly, the large percentage of the nation\u2019s budget needs to be spent in the foundation of new high-speed railway networks for various reason. The population of rich nation is ever increasing in a rapid rate and most of its rural places are being transformed as large cities. Hence, it is very wise for those countries to spend their funds for the creation of fast train lines, so that people could travel between those cities for their needs such as jobs and education. In addition, this new mode of travel also reduces the concentration of population in one area. For instance, people in India, nowadays, are dispersed in many vacant areas because they are continually adding new fast rail services and people could travel to their workplace, residing far away from the major cities.",
        "On the other hand, for some countries adding new high-speed train service is impossible. Due to the lack of sufficient budget, many developing countries could not afford to construct new railway lines and for them there is not any options other than improving the transportation service in an existence. For example, Nepal is a country which is struggling for its economic development and most of its budget are being utilized to improve its basic transportation services including public buses and better roads and it will not have enough budget for the addition of new travel medium.",
        "In conclusion, although it is very good decision for many developed countries to spend their budget to add new high-speed railway networks, I believe that those new transportation services should be added only if they have enough fund to support that."
