        "Many countries now have laws that prohibit smoking in public places, such as the park, bus stop, or the train station. The laws are well accepted and supported by its citizens, citing that it is a fair rule. I agree that there is a need for a law that ban smoking in public places for two main reasons, the public health and government responsibility.",
        "There are many reasons for making smoking in public places as an illegal act, but the main one is probably because of the major public health risks. Smoking in public or open places increase adverse health risks, not just for the smokers themselves, but also to the passerbys. The act creates many passive smokers, allowing people walking in public areas to inhale the smoke without their consents, thus making them susceptible to diseases related to smoking, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or even lung cancer. Many researches have been done to connect public smoking to the rise of pulmonary or oncology diseases.",
        "In addition to the public health risks of smoking in public, the other reason is that government has a responsibility to improve the living condition of its citizens by creating a cleaner environment and air to breathe in. Open air is a right for every citizens, it should not be contaminated by only a group of people. Also, the government has the responsibility to help the citizens who do not want to inhale smokes because they choose not to smoke in the first place, but inadvertently do so. The government has to make rules that benefit the many and not the few, while also considering the future generation. It is important that children who often be in public places to not be exposed to smokes and nicotine, for the reason that smokes can make the children sick and that it can make them assume that smoking is a cultural norm, the latter then will create more generations of smoking addicts, creating more diseased people.",
        "In conclusion, prohibiting smoking in open spaces or public places is an act justified for the reason that the public health is an important aspect that the elected governments swore to protect, and to prevent future generations from smoking addiction in the first place."
