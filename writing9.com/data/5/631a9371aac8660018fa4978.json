        "In modern era technology become crucial part for the society .It changes the lifestyle of  individuals.various  individuals claims that adavncement in mechanism changed person  more  social while other reject this notion .The substantial influence of this trend has sparked the controversy over a potential impact in recent year .This essay itends to  elaborate both the ideas and also favouring  a view on postive side with logical conclusion.",
        "Analyzing the statement the first and foremost  reason is that invention of various chatting apps .These applications is beneficial for the individuals who find difficulty and feel shy to talk with a other person.They can easily make friends through social media platforms .For example instagram, facebook,omegel  those are the applications which is very helpful for the intovert persons.However, the most prominent reason is that  it resolve the probelm of unemployement . Individuals gets various type of jobs through the advancement of technolgy In instance google providing a job related to various qualifications and these jobs are mostly work from home .Hence ,these are the reasons that claims that  innovations made man more social person.",
        "On the flip side, due to innovation individual losses  their  link with their traditional culture .Many youngsters didn't know about their culture history and values.To examplify in past  people send invitatiion cards during the time of wedding but  nowdays they can send their invitation by sending message through whatssapp which  may mostly hurt old people fellings .Thus these are the reasons why some individuals reject this  notion.",
        "In my opinion ,  advancement in maechanism make mans life more easy and social .Individuals can  go anywhere in the world with innovation of transport .In instance through aeroplane person can  easily plan their trip  to europe, canda , america etc . However through online shopping sites individual  can easily  bought branded and international stuffs like clothing ,shoes , mobile phone and laptops . Because of these reasons i think technolgy changes a man more social",
        "To recipituculate , according to the argument aforementioned above .one can reach to conclusion  that  benefits of  using technolgy to change a individual to social person are indeed great"
