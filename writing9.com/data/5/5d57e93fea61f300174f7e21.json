        "The rich gets richer and the poor becomes poorer is a saying which is being carried out since ages and is absolutely flawless even today. When we try to peep into these poor nations and  have a look at them meticulously, then we can see the other face of the earth which most of us have neither been exposed to nor have availed a chance to atleast stretch our cognition towards it. So, to all those people who have an ambiguity regarding the development of these nations and also frequently confound about the responsibility being taken up either by the government or by the developed nations in ameliorating these countries, this essay will be providing you with a solid information regarding their improvement.",
        "The fact that a particular nation become wealthy and tend to alleviate it's economical state is purely dependent on the relationship between these and other rich flourishing states so it is completely obvious that these countries shall overlook the poor nations and therefore an initiative must be brought into the picture such that a certain amount of percentage in their revenue from each nation must be donated or given a charity to these poor states every month which can thus improve their state of financial crisis. Also, we must educate some of the rich dwelling nations who lead an extravagant life and  spendthrift daily routine on their military and on their food like the USA, Europe and many more countries. They shall be made to live in conditions with minimalistic wastage of food and other resources and this inturn helps the nations oscillating below the poverty line.",
        "Despite, these changes the government of this poverty nations must be helped initially and also they must be taught to adapt for survival in both the extremity conditions. To enumerate further, let us look into the history of the country Venezuela who had a balanced economic line and a glamorous financial status which is not easily diverged but the authorities with poor planning and implementation had taken an initiative to lift all the people and class under the poverty line by providing amenities with heavily imposed subsidies and soon the country faced an immutable state of economic crisis and has lasted for a couple of years. Again, by the help of many scholarly financial experts and help from a few nations the country is now getting to regain its original state in a slow pace and no matter what happened the Venezuela government had taken enormous care of its citizens even in hard times.",
        "In the long run I want to conclude saying that though there must be an expectancy from wealthy nations and from the government by the people it is also an individual's responsibilty to make his financial state better and also strive hard to make his country a developing nation day by day."
