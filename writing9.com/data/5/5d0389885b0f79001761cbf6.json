        "Nowadays obesity becoming a critical problem in the world, but children from developed country is facing the issue more than any other part of the world. There are many arguments to state the causes and its consequences.",
        "The preponderant reason for weightgain in developed countries is modern life style of these countries. People of these countries have very busy lifestyle and to save time they are taking fastfood as their meal. These fastfood is very high in calories that can fill your stomach in less money and time. Therefore this junkfood is the main reason for overweight in developed countries.",
        "Secondly, children are spending less time on physical activities and outdoor games. Due to ubiquity of internet and advanced gadgets, children are spending more and more time on mobile phone and computers which reduces their physical activity. Moreover, they are not aware about importance of outdoor games and physical exercise. Hence obesity has became critical problem in developed as well as developing countries.",
        "However, with the active participation of parents and schools, this problem can be solved easily. Parents should take active interest in child's daily life and guid them for different outdoor games similarly schools should organize different sports competition which encourage students to take part in such physically intense activities. Additionally, government should take survey of different area for the obesity index and suggest different programs to cure the obesity based on requirement.",
        "Finally, based on the arguments outlined above one can conclude that hectic lifestyle and technological developments is the main cause of the obesity in developed countries, however it can be cured by active participation of government, parents and schools."
