        "There are people who believe that universities should help their students to developed the skills that they will need to start their careers, many others consider that the main goal of a university should be to provide their student with general knowledge without caring if that will be useful or not in their future jobs.",
        "Universities are istitutions where students should develop the skills they will be asked in a workplace. That\u2019s why it is extremly importart to not only teach basic knowldge and theoretical studies but give students the tools that companies ask to join them.",
        "Studying professors\u2019 studies and books could be a good way to build the fundations of strong knowlegde and open the mind to new points of view. However, a strong cultural background will never be enough to meet the requirements of the job market. In addition, many theoretical studies might lose their value if they cannot find connection to the actual reality and they cannot be apply into the real world. For that reason many universities give their students the possibility to put into practise what they learnt, for example during internships with companies.",
        "Although, still a lot of university courses are not focused on practical skills and students at the end of their studies are left with a lot of theoretical information but without experience they need. For example, during my undergraduate degree many teachers opted to concentrate their program into the history of advertisement or cinema. When I conclude my degree I realised that most of the skills I had were the one I developed on my own outside of university. And that abilities where the ones that allowed me to find two internships.",
        "In conclusion, not giving students the skills they will need in a workplace and concentrate only in theory would be a big mistake. Students will conclude their university programs but not being able to meet the requirement to find a job."
