To clarify further,a lot of  people  usually surf the net with their mobile phones  to find out  various  disease condition ,and the preventive measures. This therefore, helps in sensitizing the  public  about ways to prevent the occurrence of a sickness.  For example,  when I hear about an ailment, I  often  use  my mobile phone to get more  findings about that condition. This has helped me to disengage from habits I hitherto indulged in.",
        "On the other hand, there are many  downsides to the  use of mobile phones  in accessing  facts .Firstly, it exposes one to some wrong  materials . In other words,  children may use their mobile devices to watch Pornography  which is not a  right information to pass across.",
        "Secondly, it leads to loss of vision.  This implies that constant use  of the computer puts a strain on the eye. As a result, it reduces the visual acuity of the eye.  A good example is  Illustrated in a research done in Burlington Hospital UK, to find out the causes of Visual loss amongst the elderly population(65 years and above ).It was discovered that the constant use of the mobile phones was the  reason  of such eye defects.",
        "In conclusion, although  getting   materials from an  online source through the use of   electronic gadgets   has  demerits such as exposing  one to Pornographic videos and  a decrease in the range of eye vision,  it has a lot of   merits which has been discussed."
