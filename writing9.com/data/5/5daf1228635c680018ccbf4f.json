        "Thesedays, parents usually do not have enough time due to their duty so some families send their kids to a nursy in time they in work. so, if these families have grandparent both or just one, could help them more, which is also benefit to eldery people to have accompany and assisstant by their grandchildren. For example, in Italy their are a house who serive old people and take care for them. this house also alow families to leave their children in the day time side by side with this eldery people, which create a atmospher of friendship between these old and young such as telling stories and helping them. Therefore, grandparent could help a lot inthe process of growing up kids.",
        "Furthermore, grandparent are more experience than parent in brinig up of children, they have the wise that they can share, for instant, they always teach kids how to deal wiht others and moral values. However, sometimes grandparents fell by the generation gab between themand small kids, which is the resposibility parent to persuade them to be more with their grandparent.",
