        "In these days, more and more plants and species are disappearing at an alarming rate. While there are various reasons behind this phenomenon and with this lot of negative effects on individuals life. I will examine some causes why the number of biodiversity is extinct and the potential impacts of this in the upcoming paragraphs.",
        "To begin with, there are myriad reasons why flora and fauna are endangered. The first and the important cause is that deforestation and illegal logging. Nowadays people do an enormous demand of land for farmings which resulted in a loss of habitat for animals and plants. Secondly, biodiversity can also affected by pollution. To site an example, emission from vehicles, factories, and industrial parts increase to global warming; leads to the destruction of plants life. Hence, pollution as well as deforestation plays a vital role to rise biodiversity disappearing.",
        "On the other hand, the most adverse impact on medical treatment because plants are the source of medicines. If we loss these medicines we will not able to treat many disease. Moreover, due to use of pesticides and insecticides on crops food security could be affected. For instance, World Health Organisation has revealed that in 2016, in under-developing nation 30% people prey of asthma as they used to chemical products. Thus, loss",
        "of biodiversity adverse influence on people health.",
        "In conclusion, the disappearing of plants and animals is an biggest issue and the loss of biodiversity create different problems that related with crops and medicines so the government and masses ought to preserve species and plants."
