        "Humans are responsible for a variety of environmental problems, but can also take steps in order to reduce the damage caused to the plandlet. This essay will discuss environmental problems, the role of government and individual in addressing this issue affecting the planet.",
        "The two major causes of pollution in the environment are air pollution and waste. Emission of gases from factories and exhaust fumes from vehicles are the major culprit. These gases released accumulates in the atmosphere, causing the warming of the earth which could be harmful to the planet in the nearest future. As humans continue to grow, waste increases and improper disposal of these waster released chemicals that can contaminate the water.",
        "Government can take various roles in limiting  these series of pollution. Laws can be introduced to limit the gases emitted into the air and they can also provide alternatives to the use of these gases like renewable energy like wind and solar power. They could also enact \"green taxes\" to car owners in order to reduce its population on the road and therefore encourage increased use of public transport.",
        "Individuals also have a big role to play in reducing the effect of pollution. They must dispose their waste properly and cultivate the habit of recycling. Supermarkets now encourage customers to reuse their plastic bags, this has helped curb poor waste disposal. They can also take public transport rather than driving this will help reduce the amount of CO2 emitted into the atmosphere.",
        "To conclude, both individuals and governments have lots of roles to play in order to ebsure a cleaner and safer envionment. It is recommended that the government should create waste management agencies to help enact the waste disposal laws."
