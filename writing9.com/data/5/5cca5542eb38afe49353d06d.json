        "Deforestation is one of the major human activities that has posed more danger in our environment and this has been on an increase globally. In this essay, I'm going to discuss two major reasons why it happens and it's benefits.",
        "Firstly, trees are being cut down for commercial purposes. They are major raw material for manufacturing furniture, produce paper and for making cooking utensils. When the trees are cut, they pass through several processes and sold in exchange of money, goods and services. For example, 4.2% of the internally generated revenues in Nigeria are from wood exports.",
        "Again, infrastructural development is another reason for forest destruction. Countries around the globe are guided by their master plan (the map) which gives clarity as to where roads are to be constructed, industry establishment, building of schools and hospitals, construction of railways and setting up recreational parks. Most times, the map suggests forest locations for these infrastructures. For example, the sites where most of the National football stadiums in Nigeria are today were forest and their development were made possible because of deforestation.",
        "Although there are dangers of cutting down forests in the world at large such as destruction of ecosystem, depletion of ozone layers which invariably impact our health negatively and distortion of wild life conservation, however revenues are being generated from it. These income are channelled properly in most countries to improves the citizen's standard of living and also invests heavily in capital projects such as construction of roads, airports etc.",
        "In conclusion, deforestation has caused several damages to our society but has some advantages which directly impacts the people's standard of living."
