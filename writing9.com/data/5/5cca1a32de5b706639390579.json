        "In major cities, there are a  plethora of building structures with the skyscrappers being the most common. It then begs the question of who should determine what a building should look like. Some have said it is the government's responsibility while others say its should be the owners. In my view, i agree with the former view.",
        "To begin, the government should have the function of approving building plans so as to ensure conformity with the master plan and i agree. In other words, they typically reserve certain areas for residential and business development for easy running of the cities. The supporters of the view believe if governments hands off building design, house owners would build houses indiscriminately which would disfigure the city's landscape. For example, highrise edifice are built in commercial areas in major cities of the world in line with government's plan and this clusters create an amazing scenery.",
        "In contrast, some people opine that funding parties of such project should have the perogative of chosing what they desire. People should be at a liberty to determine what they wish to build, afterall it is their money being spent, i may desire a bungalow while the other man wants a storey building. For instance in Victoria Island Lagos, the building are not uniform and they serve both residential, commercial and recreational activities.",
        "Although, there are diverse views on this issue, i believe government should determine and approve building designs so as to ensure people follow laid down plans."
