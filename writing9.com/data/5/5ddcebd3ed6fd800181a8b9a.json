        "Usage of air transport has been increasing from last decade to export the vegetation and fruits which are not cultivated or unseasonable, the prime benefit is, it saves transport time compare with traditional shipping and drawback is cost of the items increase.",
        "On the one hand, transporting goods using airways is the fastest way in a short while. Furthermore, traditional shipping takes days to reach the items to the destination, by using air transport system nations can ship the items anywhere in the world where airport is located. To illustrate, India is shipping apples and onions by using Air India airlines to the UAE in a short time where consumers enjoy the fresh and rich taste of fruits and vegetables.",
        "On the other hand, shipping the items in the air is too costly as the fuel charges and maintenance bills are hefty. In addition, crews in the plane and pilot wages are unimaginable due to the shortage of their availability in the job market. These are indirectly causing for increasing the price of the product which is exporting and in the destination people are choose the items wisely while purchasing it. The prime example is the UAE has been transporting dry fruits to the USA which prices are unreasonable.",
        "In conclusion, Air transport has been using for exporting the vegetation and fruits where they are not available due to the climate change or they cannot grow, the upside is goods will reach to destination within hours and downside price of the export item increases."
