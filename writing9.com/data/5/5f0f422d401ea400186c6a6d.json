        "University education is a stepping stone of successful career. A significant number of students live with families while studying at university,whilst others stay on rent at various places near the university. This essay will highlight both merits and demerits with elaboration.",
        "Firstly,those who live with families during the period of time in university education have comfortable life since their parents usually have rich enough to pay for all expenses. Not only annual fee, but also other sorts of bill as well, leading to having sufficient time to utilize on study for pupils. Besides this, students can conveniently borrow books from the library and return them as they have a fair amount of time to learn it. Conversely on the negative side, a survey conducted by Singapore university revealed that 76% of students live with their families during the time of studying in university they find difficulties afterwards when they move for work purpose in another state.",
        "One the flip side, as these days students are being enrolled for different courses in a university due to which they have to pay for tremendous expenditure ranging from bill, taxes, rent and many more. For which , many students do part-time job to meet their ends, due to which sometimes students acquire supply in a subject and reason of low grade as well . However, living isolate has own benefits, it makes students independent and self reliance they also teaches how to sort out problems on their own as well as they easily interact with others.",
        "In conclusion, although students who reside with their parents have numerous advantages, in future they will face difficulties  to live far away. While pupils who accommodating on rent might face difficulties to survive, they will become independent for the rest of the life."
