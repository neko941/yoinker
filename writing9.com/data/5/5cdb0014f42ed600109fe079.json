        "The popularity of English language is largely attributed to the development of tourism. It is proposed by one school of thoughts that this will result in English language to be the only language spoken worldwide. There are advantages like promotion of trade and business on an international level, but also disadvantage of loss of cultures associated with various languages.",
        "Speaking a single language on a global scale will prove beneficial in promotion of trade and business across international boundries. This is to say that speaking the same language will overcome the problem of language barriers, causing an increased level of trust on others. To exemplify, a survey conducted on an online social media platform advocated the fact that Americans prefer to do trade with English speaking countries like United Kingdom and Australia.",
        "On the contrary, development of norm of speaking a single language worldwide will cause abandonment of speaking of small languages. To further say, this will cause a loss of cultures since every language has an associated culture and heritage. For instance, Red Indians suffered a loss of language and loss of culture because they adopted English as their mother tongue and did not transmit their native language to their generations.",
        "To conclude, speaking of English is becoming a common trend due to provision of various facilities in field of tourism. This is beneficial in a way that it will promote business and trade among nations. However, a downside of this will be loss of cultures and heritages that are associated with many small languages."
