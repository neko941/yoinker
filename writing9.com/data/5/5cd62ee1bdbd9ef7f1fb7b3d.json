        "Gender inequality in work place has been a matter of concern over the past few decades. Especially when it comes to a firm\u2019s leadership. While some people believe that companies must be required by law to reserve some seats in their boards to be filled by women, some others doubt that this is going to be the to the best benefit of women or the companies. In the sequel, I will reiterate some of the main arguments that each of those groups propose, and I will explain why I tend to lean towards the latter.",
        "Women right advocates are the most vocal supporters of the idea that governments should mandate on businesses to hire more women in higher ranks. They argue that without such mandate, male decision makers in the market are set to linger on their patriarchic favor for male coworkers. Several gender equality surveys have been carried out lately and they all suggest that there are far too few women of higher ranks in companies than men.",
        "However, some economists and business owners point that even though the statistics hint on a huge gender gap in management positions, they also show that the gap has been shrinking steadily for the past several years. Suggesting that qualified women are increasingly finding their way into business leadership with the existing business dynamics. To force companies to put unqualified women in their boards risks hurting the image of a female leader and will not be beneficial to women in the long run.",
        "To conclude, while I agree on the general idea that women need some level of government support to close the gender gap in business leadership, I do not think that forcing companies to put more women in the board is the most effective way to achieve that. Governments have much better means, like tax exemptions, in their toolbox that, if properly used, could provide much more sustainable remedy for this problem."
