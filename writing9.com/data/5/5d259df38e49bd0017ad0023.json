        "Watching international films is being preferred by many individuals rather that the local ones.this could be because people are inquisitive about other cultures and local movies seem boring to them. In my opinion, government should not divert funds towards local film",
        "Industries owing to the need of financial resources in other important areas requiring immediate concern.",
        "One reason why people like watching non native films is that people want to know about cultures other than their own. In other words, people are keen on understanding and picking up good things from other cultures so as to bring about changes in their own cultures.for instance , western outfits have become so common in many developing countries. As a result, ones culture is getting diversified and people are happy embracing these small changes. Another aspect may be that people are bored of locally produced pictures as they have same stories and are addressing same issues which are present in ones society, such as poverty, politics, unemployment. Therefore, these pictures seem monotonous to locals.people find foreign movies fascinating as they are entirely different. Take for example , foreign movies featuring space exploration and robots is being liked by many .",
        "In my opinion, diverting capital towards local film industry is unnecessary as this would mean channelising resources from other areas towards entertainment. In other words, there are so many problems which encumber most countries , such as poverty, unemployment, education and health, which call for urgent attention as they affect the very existence of mankind.So spending money on entertainment is not justified in any way at the expense of these basic issues.",
        "To conclude, people view international movies to enrich their knowledge of other cultures and to do away with monotony in their lives . It is not reasonable for government to support local film industries financially owing to other important issues prevelant in societies which should be addressed urgently for the betterment of the society."
