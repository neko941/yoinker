        "Some believe that there is more emphasis on learning facts rather than practical skills at all the levels of education, right from primary school to universities. This essay agrees that there is more focus on learning theories and facts than practical skills because of the design of course curriculums and the examination patterns.",
        "Facts consist of large portion of our course curriculum. We do not have any practical classes till the 8th grade in our education system. Early years as kids are consumed while learning language and mathematics. Afterwards, the students spend time learning theory of science, social science and general awareness. The content of practical skills in course structure is next to nil. The percentage content of practical skills in entire course is never more than 25% for any year at any level of education. For example, a disciple of class 10th has 7 lectures a day for 5 days a week. Out of these 35 lectures, only 3 to 4 lectures are for practical training. This amounts to around 10% only.",
        "A student prepares and learns as per the exams. If one is tested more on theory rather than on pragmatic angle, then it is obvious that he would learn theory and facts more than their pragmatic application. In the exams conducted at all the level, the weightage of practical exams is always less than 40%. For example, in the exam for physical education which is primarily a practical subject only, the weightage of practical exam is just 30%. Therefore focus of all pupils are way more on theory and fact.",
        "To conclude, the people are correct and lot of time is spend on learning theory and facts compared to practical and real life applications in all the education institutes. The reasons are biased content of the courses and the pattern of exams on which the students are tested."
