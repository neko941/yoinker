        "People these days are facing unprecedented health issues due to their unhealthy lifestyles. Lack of exercise and physical activities are the main culprit. One reason why people are choosing this sedentary lifestyle is because of the nature of their jobs, yet one possible solution is workplace initiatives that promote healthy and happy employees.",
        "On one hand, majority of the jobs today require the employees to sit on their desk and perform mental work as compare to any sort of physical work in the past. Moreover, the stress level is also extremely high in today's services based occupations. These high anxiety levels and no boundaries between work and family life creates distortion in work life balance. In simple words, even though people realize that working out and getting into shape is important, but they just don't find the time to adjust it in their busy schedules.",
        "On the other hand, initiatives taken by the Human Resources department of the organization can curtail this problem. For example, Abacus consulting company promoted a campaign in which they motivated their workforce to stay in shape and eat better. They took a number of steps to ensure the employees ate consciously, such as arranging appointments with nutritionists and educating the workforce about addictive fast foods and their calorie contents. They were also taught how to manage their portion sizes. Further, free fitbit watches were distributed throughout the organization so that the employees could track their physical activities.",
        "In conclusion, people these days are highly unfit due to their sedentary lifestyles. A crucial reason for being addicted to this way of life is stressful work environment. One possible solution is their organizations being actively involved in their well-being and providing such opportunities."
