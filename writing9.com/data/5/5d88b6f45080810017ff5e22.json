        "These days many families depends mostly on electronic goods in their houses, sush as rise cooker, TV and dishs washing machine which may cost them a large amount of money. Although these electronic gadgets would ease their life, but it has many negative consequences.",
        "To begin with, in these modren life both woman and man are working and most of their time are spent in the work. In such circumstances, they become physically tierd with these overload work and may not have the ability to do household choars such as cooking. Thus, they rely on these electronic facilities to help them. However, such trend could lead to lossing many skills, for example, when a women use rise cooker, she may loss the sense of creativity in the kichen. Therefore, lake of skills can be stated as one of the negative results for this trend.",
        "Futhermore, buying these household goods could lead to budget deficit of the family. Also, it consumed a huge amount fo energy which may have a great influnce on family financiallly. To illustrate, most of these electronic devices such as water heater and electrical oven consumed by far the highest amount of electricity that supplied to the house which in order to will rise the outstanding bills to unfavorable prices. In addition, this energy means more oils burning which will affect environment negatively.",
        "In conclusion, after a careful analysis of this trend, I believe that buy a lot of electronic goods means more energy needs for a house which ends by bad influnce on the environment."
