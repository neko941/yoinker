        "Language is the best means of communication. In the modern globalization era it is not enough to be able to speak one language to communicate with the outside world. I strongly support the idea that infants should begin enrolling a foreign language as soon as they start education. They faster become familiar with a strange language, improve their hearing ability to understand new words as time goes by and learn new words. In the following paragraphs I will list some reasons to support my position.",
        "First of all, if one wants to see outcome soon, one must start sooner. So, the early children begin to learn new language the better will be the result. Scientists say that a child does not confuse two different languages but learns them more effectively. For example, In India every province has its own official language with diverse cultures. But most of the people prefer to speak in hindi and english languages. However, it is vital that adolscents should learn these two languages with their mother tongue.",
        "Second of all, Adults are often to afraid to make mistakes when they are speaking in a new language. This fear is one of the biggest barrier for a person in his efforts to speak freely. Otherwise, kids do not affraid of making grammatical mistakes because they just repeat words and sentenses in the way they hear them. They faster get used to the right pronumciation and better feel the meoldy of language.",
        "To sum up, I think that it is very essential for children to begin learning a foreign language in their early ages. It is brings many benefits such as great pronunciation. Also, it help a child develop and gain more knowledge which is good for a long run."
