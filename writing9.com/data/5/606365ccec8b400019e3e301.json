That type of membership includes the free yoga classes on weekend along with regular activities. I remembered that I have paid for membership through my HSBC credit card and availed 15% discount on the price.",
        "I was new to the Central London. My decision to join you club was absolutely perfect. It was great to spend a quality time and enjoy the activities, like gym and swimming pool. I got many new friends there. I never missed any yoga class, which is without any charges on weekend. I lose my weight and my body is in shape now.",
        "Unfortunately, my work has decided to appoint me in Norway and I have to leave the country by end of this month. Hereby, I request you to cancel my membership and refund the remaining balance. In any case, I am back to the London, would love to join your club again.",
