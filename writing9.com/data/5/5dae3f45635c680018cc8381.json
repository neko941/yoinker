        "Food is necessity of life and vital source of energy for all human beings on this planet. Now a days it has seen a rise in number of people eating fast food causing lot of health issues. Some people say that government should impose higher taxes on fast food and I completely agree with this group of people.",
        "Now a days it's very common that people across globe are more inclined towards junk food becuase not only it's easily available but also give plenty of options to eat. This can easily be seen in workplaces as employees don't want to carry lunch along with them and feel more comfortable in taking it from the comapany's canteen. This bad food habbits causes lot of severe health problems like high chlorestrol, cardio issues and high sugar content in blood. As per research done by some known universities  average life of individual in many coutries is almost reduced by 10% as people are easily prone to numerous disases due to bad food habits.",
        "In order to make people healthy, government agencies need to take necessary actions as healthy people will led to healthy nation and moreover government need to spend less on yearly budgent. In order to do so they need to impose a higher taxes on junk food so that people would start eating traditional food which is more healthy any day as compare to processed food and it will not fit into their monthly budget as well. In this way there would be win win situaiton for the government as they will utilize this money in other public services and also save money which they are spending in public hospitals to cure those who are victims of fast food.",
        "To conclude, although fast food is easily available and affordable but there  has been side effects as well which could not be over seen. To tackle this situation before it goes out of control government should high taxes to make sure people step back to traditional way of eating food."
