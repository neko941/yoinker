        "In recent years, many big national as well as international corporations have spent a huge amount of money on marketing and promotion. Hence, customers will have a tendency to buy the products that they often see on social media. As a consequence, many small firms will be closed and those large companies will become dominant in the market. In this essay, I will give my own opinion as well as suggest some steps that may be helpful to encourage buyers to choose local products.",
        "First and foremost, customers easily shape their thoughts for what they have seen on the TV or other social media. Thus, whenever people need any items for their life, they often think about the products of those firms which they have heard many times on the advertisements. Due to this reason, many local companies can not sell their products to potential customers even though the quality of their products is really excellent. That leads to bankruptcy for many small firms, and hundreds or even thousands people will be out of work for a long time. Furthermore, if many small companies run out of business, then large corporations will become the monopoly for that brand of the market. As a consequence, customers have to pay a high price for the products even though the real quality does not live up to that price.",
        "On the other hand, there are some solutions to boost the sales for many local companies. First of all, there should be more campaigns to encourage people to choose local products. That means local enterprises should carry out some more events to help customers realize the real quality of their goods , for example, samples can be given freely to passers-by by the salers. When customers have more choice to think about, they will weigh up the pros and cons before purchasing any products. Hence, local products with high quality can have chances to access potential customers. Finally, the Government should adjust the frequency of large companies' advertisements on Social networks or mass media by raising the taxes for each advertisement which will be shown on the golden time and has the duration for more than one minute.",
        "In short, buyers always tend to buy those items especially products of large groups that they often see on social networks or mass media. Hence, small companies should hold more events to boost the sales and the government also give those small firms a hand to avoid the monopoly of  many large corporations."
