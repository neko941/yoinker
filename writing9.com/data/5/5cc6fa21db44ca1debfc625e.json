        "Nowadays, many high school graduates have been advised to take a gap year before university. Although some people believe that it can greatly benefit a person, many others including myself believe it to be a waste of time.",
        "One of the main reasons why students have been encouraged to undertake a gap year is to broaden their horizons and explore the world. It is through their journey and travels will they fully understand the society around them, something that cannot be wrote learned. For example, many students who have the privilege of going to school do not understand those that could not due to financial reasons or societal reasons. However through their volunteer work in these under developed areas are they fully able to comprehend these problems and grow as a person.",
        "Contrastingly, many of those that oppose the extra break believe that is merely a waste of time and money. Going abroad and volunteering in different countries across the globe is not cheap and instead is costly. For example, in order to travel accomodation, visas, travel insurance all have to be covered. These costs are mainly burned by the parent. This leads to the child being dependent on their parents for extras years. However, if they had gone straight to university then they would be able to get a job faster and become independent.",
        "In conclusion, although going taking a sabbatical allows graduates to grow and experience societal values it can lead to financial strains on the family. Therefore, I believe that gap years are a waste of time."
