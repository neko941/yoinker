Nowadays,most of the school and universities are encouraging and already started to use of online platforms for teaching. For exemplifying that, children easily memorize their  poems and rhymes using mobile or tablets.",
        "On the other hand, if it is not used in  proper way of without supervision of parents and teachers, there would be a horrendous effect on our teenager career growth. Also, the excessive use of Web Wide Web and social networking sites can cause the health issues as well. Moreover, without proper guidance to use of technology, young generation might be involved in awful activities. To illustrate this point, there are lots of  bad contents available over the Internets and that can impact the children behaviors and their day to day activities.",
