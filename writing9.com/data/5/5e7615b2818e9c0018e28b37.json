        "These days, the amount of older people has been increasing in many parts of global. There are more negative and postive effects on our society. In my opinion there is more advantages on our society, also this have several disadvantages.",
        "Let's begin by looking at the positives of the increasing of older people. Firstly, nowadays the share of older people is increasing because of improvement of medicine and science people are enjoying a longer life than before. For example, one of the famous country Japan, Japanese people live longer than other countries because there is the best condition, pure water and neat air. In addition, the more longer livers in the world that Japanese people. There is no doubt that this has improved people's lives and this would not have been possible without longer life.",
        "Turning to the other side of the argument, in some community older are considered to be burden. For instance, a family which is going to the trip in the remote locations, if in family have older people that grandparents, as a result of they deserted by your kids. Finally, if the proportion of older people will be rised, the household will live happy because every kids want that their parents will live eternal with them and enjoying from life.",
        "In conclusion, I personally beleive that the rising of older people will be beneficial for all. Because, when a person who becomes old, he or she gets profit on our community."
