        "This is in reference to your notice published on student notice board on 25th May about the new computer course (intermittent level) that the college is offering. I am in second year of my bachelors in Arts degree course but I have always had a keen interest in computers and hence I have learned the basics of computer on my own.",
        "I am willing to join this course but the notice clearly mentions that is it only for the students who have completed an elementary course in computer. Studying in Arts department I never had the opportunity to complete any such computer course. But post my graduation completion I am planning to enter the computer world as there are many opportunities in this field which will help me in making a good career.",
