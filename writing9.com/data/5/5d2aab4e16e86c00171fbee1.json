        "Language is the only thing which made humans different from other different creators. English is one such language responsible for communicating people from different geographical locations. Even though learning English language does not mean that we can avoid studying local languages. Seeking local languages is as important as foreign languages.",
        "Engilish language study has become most important in every curricullam from primary schools to Graduate universities. This is because, it will help them to explore knowledge from different places of the world. Furthermore, it will help individuals to do research, study and work in other countries. Those people who started seeking English language at school can improve grammar and knowledge. For instance, A survey conducted by the IIT madras states that kids who started learning foreign languages at primary school will have more ability to solve complex problems and good memory than others. As a result, Learning English at school age will have tremendous effects.",
        "These days schools are giving more importance to English and started erasing native languages. The reason behind this is, they feel that implementing international languages in syllabus will be sufficient. But, avoiding mother land languages will stop the student from knowing about the traditions of birth land. For example, a student without seeking local languages may not able to understand the importance in his culture. To illustrate, A survey done by the Sikkim Manipal university tells, learning local languages will help person to seek foreign languages fastly. Hence, native languages should be kept In the syllabus along with the international languages and also government should make it a mandatory rule.",
        "To conclude, Although it is important to learn English in school age but learning regional languages is also important. Schools should include local languages along with the other programs, and those schools who will not include them should face serious legal problems."
