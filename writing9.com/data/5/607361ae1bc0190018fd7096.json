        "The bar chart illustrates the favourite form of transportation for the young  in four different countries : Great Britain, the USA, Germany and France.",
        "Overall, it can be seen that cars are the most popular means of transportation, apart from Germany, while motorcycles are the least favourite in all the counties, other than in the USA.",
        "A closer examination of the figures shows cars are the most popular in France, with more than 70 per cent, while cars accounted for the same percentage in both Great Britain and the USA, at 60 per cent. On the contrary, in ,Germany this way of transportation is not very popular as much as in the other countries with 40 per cent of preferences.",
        "Motorcycles are well-liked by Americans. It is also noticeable that there is a huge difference in terms of preference between cars and motorcycles in Great Britain as well as in France. The number of car preferences is actually six or seven times the motorcycle one.",
        "The last form of transport is the bicycle, and this is the most prefered among the German young people with slightly more than the car's rate. Bikes are also popular in Great Britain with around 30 per cent."
