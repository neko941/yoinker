        "Computer screens have now become a commodity within every person\u2019s reach due to the technological advancements and market competition. The children are especially attracted to computers and tablets which are found in every household and it has been observed that a number of parents allow their offsprings to freely use them. In my opinion, there are a number of psychological and medical shortcomings of this practice which easily overshadow the benefits.",
        "Firstly, the usage of electronic devices makes the children less family oriented. The usage of computers and tablets minimizes the family time of children. This is because of the tendency of electronic devices to instigate addiction in their users. The children become emotionally attached to computer games and social media at a tender age when they should be spending more around parents learning precious life lessons.",
        "Secondly, the usage of LCD and LED screens has been linked to a number of health issues which may victimize children. A number of studies have proven that the usage of computers and tablets over a long period of time causes lumber pains as well as eye sight deterioration. What is even worse is that these medical issues materialize over a certain period of time so the parents would not notice a change in their children in the initial stages. It is with the passage of time that its learnt what could have been prevented now has to be cured.",
        "In conclusion, there are far more serious issues linked to the usage of computers at an early age than its advantages. The parents should curtail children\u2019s screen time to decrease their chances of developing health issues."
