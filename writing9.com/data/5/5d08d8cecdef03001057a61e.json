        "The population ratio of youngsters to that old aged people found to be numerous in the current days among few countries .Few people say that these difference in ratio seems beneficial ,while some other people say that this situation itself is futile. According to my view, the old aged people population is never decline .This difference in population  should remain null .",
        "A plant can never sustain without roots ,similarly, one cannot lead their lives without elders .elder people ratio should not be dropped ,since ancient times elders had been teaching  traditional values and culture to us .Let\u2019s  consider an example ,Ram and Razvan family . Ram\u2019s family had imbibed the values of culture and tradition from their grandparents whereas Razvan\u2019s family were modern with lack of cultural and tradition in the family . Consequently, Razvan\u2019s family faces many problems. Secondly, elder people teaches many human values and qualities such as discipline, staunch behaviour, respecting elders and many other. Hence, old aged people plays vital role in population ratio in country.",
        "Furthermore ,elders teaches us many tactics to lead life smartly, such as preparing home-made products ,medicines and food and many other life hacks .Let\u2019s consider an example ,Shelly  had stomach ache .In spite of her condition she visited to grand parents home. After listing to the problem her grandmother prepared a syrup and taught her how to prepare .As a result ,Sally stomach ache vanished .Elders not only dominates in  decision making in family but also they withstand for family and country welfare .",
        "In conclusion ,Elder people are eminent in family as well as in country, hence population of old aged people must remain in the good ratio . The decline in population ratio of old aged people leads to disastrous in family and country."
