        "Nowadays there is a dramatic increase in the usage of animal to fulfil human needs. Some people claim that animals also hold the same right to live, and this is why human being should stop using them for their own wishes, while others argue that there is no alternative to the use of animal for certain purposes like for consumption and essential scientific experiements. This essay will discuss both views and will come up with the conclusion.",
        "Every living organism on this earth have the same previlege to fight for the life. Animal serve various purposes which help other living cretures in the tremedous ways. For instance, eggs from chicken used by the human for eating. Animals are speechless and can not express their anger and dissatisfaction while they are being abused. If people continuously exploit animals for their own needs then in near future we may loss some important species of animal. So, it is the responsibility of people to be empathetic with the innocent beastly and protect them.",
        "On the other hand, there are certain tasks which requires use of animal, For example, as a mean of research sample. There are various scientific laboratories and pharmaceutical research centres which uses the rabbit or the mice to test the effect of the certain drugs or methods on them, before implementing it on other living organism. For situation like this, it is unavoidable to use them because they represents similar charactristcs as human does. Although, animal act as a useful mean in certain activities, I believe that we should respect their dignity to live and only use them in the situation where there is no better alternative is available. For example,  one can avoid hunting wild creature just for the habby, or people can also switch to the other options for the food rather than killing aphonic creatures.",
        "To conclude, to save the precious haritage of our animal species human should move towards finding better resources to fulfill their needs and respect the right of the speechless animals. They should only be use in the circumstaces where using other alternative may leads to worst impact."
