        "In recent times, parents allocate generous time to their offspring than it was done in the older days. In my view, I believe peer influence will impact negatively on children who are given excessive freewill.",
        "To begin with, parents giving their kids excess lack of restriction will lead to a negative development as a growing child\u2019s mind is always curious. One of the reasons I believe this school of thought is because children tend to copy from what they see mostly. For instance, a network cable in Nigeria called DSTV shows different music channels. Unfortunately, the lyrics are filled with vulgar words and more so the picture depicts nudity. Children\u2019s brain undergo development daily and whatever they hear or see get stuck to memory which may lead to a child trying to grow into uncontrolled character if left unmonitored.",
        "Another point to consider is that when children are given too much liberty, they can be negatively influenced by their peers. In other words, kids left unmonitored with their fellow age groups may pick up certain behavior displayed within their circle. Using Nigeria military barracks as an example, uniform parents who come from different background are often required to stay together within the force form a mini community. As such a family whose both parents are in the army may be required to resume at their duty post same time will leave their children with lots of free time. Undoubtedly, these children associate with many others whose moral view might be opposing to their parents whereby giving them room to be influenced or convinced them to engage in act like taking hard drugs, smoking, stealing or sexual involvement.",
        "In conclusion, based on the reasons above, I believe that parents giving too much liberty to their wards will influence them negatively with regards to bad association."
