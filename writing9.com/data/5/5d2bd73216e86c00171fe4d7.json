        "People have different views related whether it benefical for the children to immigrate with their families abroad. I believe it is beneficial for children to move outhside their country.",
        "On one hand, there are many advantages for the children to move abroad. Firtsly, they get access to quality education. The education in developed country is far superior than that of the developing country. Additionally, in these countries they have better career opportunities in comparison what they may have in their home country. Moreover, the children gets internationl exposure where they studies with students from many other countries. This help them to learn multiple cultures and prepare them to excel in their jobs after completing their graduation. Furthermore, they live a convinent life in migrated country. The developed nations have better infrastructure. People in developing country spend more time in commuting same distance in comparison to developed country. Some of the cities in third world countries have become unlivable due to increase in pollution levels. For example, Delhi capital of India, is one of the most polluted cities of the world and children over their suffer from numerous diseases due to inhaling of that air.",
        "On the other hand, children also encounter many difficulties, when they move to other country. Firstly, they have to start to all over again and it is not easy for everyone. Secondly, they have to learn different languages. Learning language is not everyone cup of tea and some of the student struggle lot with it.",
        "In conclusion, I strongly feel the advantages of moving out far outweigh disadvantages for the children."
