        "It has been suggested that the punishment on crimes should be both equal on adults as well as the underage people. Even though others may have strong arguments to support this, I do not agree on the given statement.",
        "On the one hand, I understand some people who agree on the given view. Firstly, there are reported cases of crime which involved young individuals. At times, these youngsters do not think how serious their offense was, because most of them only received a warning and got easily acquitted; consequently, they will do it again multiple times and the cycle repeat. Another reason is that, they are the target labourers of most syndicate. Because they have some kind of immunity from the law: some took this as an opportunity to gain on their favours. For instance, in the Philippines, drug traffickers used children as a mule to transport their contraband to their customers for them not to gain attention and cover their crime.",
        "On the other hand, I believe that they are still innocent and do not deserve equal punishment. As the aforementioned situation above, some law offenders victimized this individual, because they are an easy target which makes them a victim too. In fact most of them are either forced or threatened; therefore, they are caught in the difficult time wherein they are not given any option but to follow instruction. Secondly, we supposed to protect and guide this people. The society should not be hard on dealing with them. For instance, these young individuals do not have parents to look for as their role model and teach them the right and wrong.",
        "Overall, although there are some good arguments to support the given suggestion, I still think that it is not enough reason to receive equal punishment due to some reasons mentioned above."
