        "Using computers for academic purposes is becoming a norm nowadays. Many people believe that it is an advantageous trend, whereas some consider it is having a detrimental effect on students. This essay will discuss both views. In my opinion, despite few drawbacks, usage of electronic devices in education has a lot of benefits as not only, it gives easy access to large amonut of study material, but also it is helpful in taking online classes from home.",
        "On the one hand, the major negative impact of over-usage of computers is on the students health. If youngsters spend too much time on computers, then it will have harmful effect on their health, especially on their eyes. For example, in a study conducted in 2014, researchers found out that constently looking at a computer screen for more than an hour, reduced the concentration of the subjects dramatically, while affecting their vision. However, this can be reduced by taking short breaks when working on a computer.",
        "On the other hand, there are numerous positives of computers in the educational sector. The most prominent benefit is that they make huge amount of data easily accessible to the students. Since most of the people have internet connection these days, infinite amount of information is available to the pupil's at any moment. To cite an example, in the US, majority of students use electronic gadgets to complete their home work and assignments with the help of internet; thereby making computers vitally important to them.",
        "Moreover, computers have also made the concept of online classes a reality, which was not possible in the past decades. In other words, with the help of computers, students can not only study their curriculum at home, but also store immense amount of data on their computers. Consequently, compuetrs have made life of students a lot more easier as compared to the past.",
        "To conclude, I would like to reiterate my opinion, even though, computers have few disadvantages for students, its advantages in terms of providing sources of information and opening a new avenue of online classes makes it a more benefical trend."
