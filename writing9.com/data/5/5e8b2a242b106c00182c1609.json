        "Since few years there has been considerable change in the life-style of humanity. No surprise that today\u2019s young generation tend to spent most of their time in front of blue screen called television. And it is often said that youngsters have already become the main viewer of world screen in comparison to twenty years before. To be more precise they are getting less active in a fast-changing world because of over watching TV. And still there is a question what can be cause and of course rescue treatment .I strongly believe that if children would change attitude or not, this issue will not be solved until we give them safe encouragement.",
        "One of the main cause of the problem is that majority of kids at school are not learning how should they manage their time. The more children get project, the more they will be at the bottom of the request of the elder. Nowaday\u2019s generation do not want to waste any part of their time, all stuff which is given by teachers may be done by powerful information technology. Therefore they have much time to get addicted to TV. Another thing that has been causing children\u2019s inactivity for two or three decades is illiteracy and indifference of their parents. How someone can teach if he or she does not know how to avoid this behavior herself or himself.",
        "Judging twenty-first century technology almost every single thing can be considered as a solution. First of all we have to learn not to limit ourselves instead we must think ahead for a bright future. Schools should lunch a special time management  program for both child and family so that they can avoid or tackle these problems like inactivity or over watching TV. Although we cannot stop ourselves from telling that society has obligation to teach young generation especially who born after 2000, I strongly believe that every parent should take a responsibility for their children\u2019s time.",
        "All things considered , most of today's children are facing mass problem like being inactive because of addiction to television rather than in the past. And it is widely held view that we should take a serious action immediately until it will not be so late. My view is that rather than relying on educators or developers of ethic culture we just need to guide our children with most suitable approach mainly because every one has own personality."
