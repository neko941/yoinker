        "Television has become an essential part of our life over the years from its inception. It is believed by many to be an early educator for human beings, while others think it is overhyped as a tutor. This essay will examine the role of television as an educator and how overusing it can decrease its effectiveness over time but with an agreement that it is still one of the best tools to spread knowledge around the world.",
        "At first, television is known to be a medium to delivering information to the general masses. Who gave birth to a number of informative channels? The informative programmes broadcasted on channels like Discovery, History etc which gave us a glimpse in ancient times enabled us to learn more about nature as well as the historical events that were buried deep into the library books. The Earth, for example, aired on National Geographic Channel is a series of episodes which educates people about the life present on earth and also brings awareness on how to save it, in order to maintain balance amongst nature. Television was used efficiently by DIscovery and other informative channels.",
        "In spite of that, people feel otherwise as there are shows running on different channels which are not informative at all but provide ways to kill time in the name of entertainment. Even though people are aware that these daily soaps or reality shows are scripted, they are nowhere near to get rid of them. Younger minds are also being dragged into this as they tend to follow footprints of their elders which is an alarming situation since these programmes are not made to pass any useful information to next generation.",
        "To recapitulate, television acts as a medium of transferring information and entertainment but elders have to decide what to gain from it. I strongly agree with the effectiveness of television as an informative machine rather than an idiot box. If people choose knowledgeable programmes  over useless shows, then the television will never be considered as a harmful teacher."
