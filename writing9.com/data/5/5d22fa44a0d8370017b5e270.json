        "It is argued that government funding for education should give preference to science-based subjects over others, in an attempt to help boost a countries future development and progress. Although investing in arts and humanities is essential, this essay agree with the view that science is the key contributor because it has brought a number of improvements to the society and allows highly productive output.",
        "The primary reason for investing fund in science is that the advent of modern science has brought a numerous improvements to the way that countries and societies function. Increased electrical and computer based technologies have led to much more streamlined and efficient workplaces. For example, sources of renewable energy, such as solar and wind generated power, are beginning to help ease the planet\u2019s reliance on fossil fuels. In contrast, unless the technology improves, it will burden the national progress.",
        "The second main reason main reason is because it allows greater efficiency and higher productivity output. Advances in technology have led to automation of many jobs, where several human effect was involved. This is to say Computers and computerized machinery can now do the work of what would have precisely carried out by humans with greater accuracy. For instance, a recent research conducted in Elcos Medtech in Denmark, an automated factory, showed that the number of efficient hours has more than doubled and at the same time produce 20% more items.",
        "In conclusion, the authorities investment in science education should be encouraged for scientific education and development because of the enhancement in technology and it provides an effective output through automation."
