        "Happiness is often perceived as a state of mind. Although for some people having a lot of money is a source of happiness, sometimes happiness depends on certain other things. For example, happiness means good health for the sick and close-knit relations for the deserted.",
        "Money can procure us many valuable items which make our life full of comfort and luxuries and these belongings are often attributed to the happiness in a person\u2019s life. For some having excessive amounts of money brings a sense of satisfaction as it relieves them of their future stresses and also financial worries of their posterity. Besides being able to afford basic amenities, money enables one to indulge in recreational activities that are beyond the reach of commoners and thus bring them a greater feeling of happiness. Concurrently, money evolves into power and with all the power and dominance, it is natural to have a sense of elation.",
        "On the other hand, money does not always mean happiness. People often perceive a rich person to be a happy person, but it has been proved illusionary quite a number of times. Under the veil of money, nobody knows how much distressed the owner is. For a person suffering from a long-term ailment, freedom from medication and treatment is definitely an immense source of joy for which they will be ready to spend all of their wealth.",
        "Similarly, for someone with no friends or relatives to rely upon in miseries, a shoulder to cry on and a helping hand in need are the means of happiness Therefore happiness cannot always be related to the amount of money one owns.",
        "To conclude, while it is a fact that money can buy us luxuries of life in some instances even excess amount of money cannot bring happiness in one\u2019s life and thus due importance should be given to good health and relations in life."
