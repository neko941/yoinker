        "Nowadays, every person living in the Earth can know the most latest news that occur in every place by just watching the TV shows easily within few hours. Frankly, we cannot deny that thing occurs in the world is connected to each other. Let's us discuss the main reasons why it is of great significance to know every thing that happens around us.",
        "First and foremost, I vehemently believe that our today's world become like a small village. The people's live is likely to be affected by every thing we do. For instance, frequent and excessive crowd formed by the cars can of course cause air pollution in the atmosphere. So, when the citizens in the middle east listen to the news and they know that there is huge fire in Australia forests this is a consequences of their own actions.",
        "Secondly, to be honest for every action there is a reaction according to Newton's third law. For example, deforestation that occurs today by the people which means cutting vast numbers of trees can lead to huge number catestrophies and many natural disasters that occur in the environment like flooding as an example. So, when the person read about flooding in the newspapers this is because due their actions of cutting trees. Furthermore, trees act as a resistors against the natural disasters like flooding which has the ability to damage many regions.",
        "On the other side of the coin, some people argue these ideas say that there are many other news that do not have any connection to their life like the news about the famous actors which seems to be destroying their own privacy. Factually, I support their point of view because it does not relate to our life.",
        "In conclusion, I request the the great TV channels and newspapers to filter their news while giving it to the people and spreading it through the communities."
