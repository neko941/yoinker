        "Shifting to a new place becomes easier if you have a small family size. In this contemporary era, with the advent of industralisation and technological revolution, there are ample opportunities availabe to the public in their career progression and every one wants to grab each and every one of those, in doing so they have to keep moving from place to place and in this essay I would discuss its merits and demerits in threadbare.",
        "Firstly, having resided at various destinations inculcates in a student more confidence and ability to tackle various type of challanges.  Moreover , They become more aware about their surrounding and are more socially active, this helps them a lot in choosing the right career ,for instance a child who has developed a more pursuasive nature would have a shining future in marketing.",
        "Contrary to this , as every coin has two face, frequent migration from a place could also have negative impact on the mental situation of a child. Some juveniles are intovert and hardly got mixup in the society  and keep migrating place to place would make them more self centeric , which would hinder in the overall developement of the child.",
        "To conclude , I would say that this trend of migration has both positive and negative aspects on the personality developement of the youngsters but the positive impact surely surpasses the negative side and could be uprooted by the involvement of the parents, by being more vigilant and helping their ward in accepting the challenges of life and supporting them in that phase of life."
