        "Different measures are necessary to handle the reduction of traffic accidents. Some people believe that infringements need to be taken with stringent ruling, while others think that refinement in road safety might be more beneficial. This essay will discuss both sides of the argument and provide evidence as to why strict punishment is superior.",
        "Driving infringement has to be taken with major seriousness to minimize car accidents. Government should establish more effective laws that punish commuters depending on the gravity of their driving-offences. Punishments such as paying a certain amount of money for the damage made to the community, mandating to do community service or even being in jail may be the better ways to decrease traffic accidents. This, as a result, could make drivers to think twice before breaking the law.",
        "Measurements in the refinement of safety road would be more beneficial. The rapid advance of technology might be a useful approach to resolve this problem. Nowadays there are a great number of people depending on their smartphones which relatively lead to the programming of a vast number of driving applications. If these applications helped commuters to select more safety road and with less traffic, this could not only reduce the number of car accidents but it would be monetary efficient.",
        "In conclusion, while there are convenient arguments in both sides of the debate, punishing drivers for their traffic offences is the better alternative to minimize car accidents. I strongly believe that stringent punishments to reckless drivers are vital to make them take consciousness about their actions. (261 words)"
