        "Certain individuals think that a hobby is supposed to be hard to some extent for it to be fun. In my opinion, whether a hobby should be difficult  on not depends on the individual's taste.",
        "On the one hand, some  people prefer to put their brains always on duty by choosing tasky things to do. For instance, most humans who are in engineering  or mathematics departments who deal so much on calculations would prefer some tasky leisure activities like playing advanced computer games that requires so much skills. Also,some believe that by engaging in difficult recreational interests, they meet, socialize  and make friends with persons of their calibre,  thus setting higher standard for themselves.",
        "On the other hand, some other persons would want to go for any easy going activity that would  not put them to so much stress. For example, many grown ups would rather choose to watch sports such as soccer on the television than getting themselves involved  in playing it. Furthermore, others believe that since hobbies are what humans like doing, there should be no need for them to be difficult to those who love them, but to the exceptions who do not have interest in them.",
        "Finally, in my own view, this decision depends on the kind of a person one is. For instance, some subjects and courses are very cheap and easy for certain students in school, but difficult for others, and still, all are chosen by different students.  No matter the course one chooses, he/she has reasons for selecting it and would definitely enjoy it, likewise leisure activities.",
        "In conclusion, despite  people's varied thoughts, individual differences always affect human's choice, and this remains the most vital key factor in determining whether an interest should be hard or not."
