        "Volunteer service rendition in communities has recently been debated. While certain groups for individual are of the view that school children should be involve in village voluntary services. However, I disagree with this considering the poor academic performance this will proffer and also because services to the community should be optional.",
        "on the one hand,some proponent argue that school children should render services voluntarily to their community and I disagree. This is because with this kind of services, school children will devote less time for their academic activities with resultant poor performance and low grades which will negatively impact on their future. For instance,in a study by an academic body in 2010, showed that student who were involved in community services had very poor grades compared to those who did not. Seeing in this light ,it is undeniable fact that community services can influence the child academics and future negatively.",
        "on another hand ,unpaid community services should be optional. This is because not every student cherish getting involved in work which they will have no wages for and therefore should not be persuaded to do so. Furthermore,voluntary services by students is not necessary since this kind of services is part of punishment given to prisoners.there is no need for such services as it was mend for criminals. It is incontrovertible that unpaid services should be done willingly and not enforcing it on them.",
        "In conclusion, besides that voluntary service to the community should be optional and  also considering overall poor schools performances of students who engaged in this services,i disagree that volunteering services without renumeration should be part of school programs. I recommend that people should not be persuaded to perform such services . It should be purely by Choice ."
