        "It is argued that some people believe ,the violence on television and in computer games has a negative impact on the society.This essay agrees with the statement because people try to copy actions by watching various reality shows and violent games in computer which teach them to be aggressive in everyday life.",
        "Firstly, a few people try to enact actions or stunts by watching the television programmes in their home. The reason behind copying the actions is that they get fascinated  and try to link the reel life with the real life. They challenge themselves and try to perform same action which requires supervision from the experts. Hence, they end up getting themselves hurt. In recent news, twenty-two year old man ended up his life by trying to copy an act from one of the reality show by jumping from fifth floor of the building .",
        "Moreover, addiction of violent games in computer make the growing teenagers  aggressive in everyday life. Games like going to a war by using swords and other utensils in computer makes them impatient and short tempered. They tend to fight for short issues instead of sorting it out.In 2019, a school boy murdered his small brother by holding his neck because he refused to give him television remote.When police did the investigation ,they concluded that the boy was mentally obsessed with the game which had the concept to go for war and defend themselves.",
        "In conclusion, Society is negatively affected by the violence on the television and violent games in the computer. I suggest that people should watch light, comedy shows and video games which will improve skills and knowledge."
