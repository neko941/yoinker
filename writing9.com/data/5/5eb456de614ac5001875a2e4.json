        "It is often argued that working from home is beneficial. I mostly agree with this opinion, although it has a few disadvantages. To begin with, working from home is a lot more comfortable for lots of people. Employees can save a great deal of time and money since they do not have to travel so often, which means people will have more time for work and for themselves, too. This is particularly helpful for women with young children. They can take care of their children and at the same time build their career. Besides, working at home does not mean staying inside all day, people can choose to work in their garden or backyard. Secondly, the atmosphere at home helps to reduce stress as people can work at their own pace with a flexible working schedule and not be interrupted by the phone and other colleagues. Therefore they can complete their tasks effectively and productively. Lastly, apart from the workers, the employers benefit from this approach. Employers do not have to worry about organizing vacations for their staff. They do not have to invest in expensive devices either. When employees work from their home, they will most probably be using their computers, printers, telephones and other equipment to get their work done. Employers can also save money on bills and rentals. To sum up, this arrangement should be supported as it benefits both the employees and the employers."
