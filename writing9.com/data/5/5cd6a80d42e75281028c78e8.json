        "A lot of museums charge a visiting fee from their attendees while there are others that have a free entrance. This essay will argue that despite museums charging entrance fees can deter many people from visiting them, the benefit of using the revenue for art maintenance far outweigh any drawback.",
        "The main disadvantage of museums charging visitor fees is that it would discourage the public from going to such places. Many people are overburdened with financial obligations and believe that paying to see arts and other historic places is a waste of money. For example, the Louvre museum in Paris charges 50 euros from each of its visitors to see their famous paintings, but a lot of people are unable to afford such high rates and take their whole family. However, I believe that museums do not need to charge the same rate from all individuals, and they could offer special concessions for different sections of the society, such as students and elderly folks, thus making it affordable for the public.",
        "Charging a certain fee can help museums maintain their valuable pieces of artworks. Many paintings and artifacts require regular maintenance and museums need to employ expert professionals to take care of them. For example, old scriptures require specific type of experts who help to preserve them every year from wear and tear. I believe that this is a very important advantage because without having proper funds museums will not be able to sustain their artworks.",
        "In conclusion, charging a certain visitor fees by museums for preserving their artwork far outweighs any disadvantage of public unattendance due to high fees."
