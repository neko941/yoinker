        "We as the citizen of particular provincial having a key responsibility to take care of our energy and diet. This is also an important part of the power to know the well-being condition of the nation, but we all know that authority is having many other functions and roles to perform.",
        "But as a citizen of rustic we must have main function to perform is to make a strong eye on diet and fitness as to fight with many viruses, and to make provincial strong and healthy. Diet is the main issue for strength because if we are not responsible for our nutrition then our body becomes weak and not able to fight with the diseases and make another person ill.",
        "Diet should be in such a quantity which gives vitamins, iron, calcium to our body and make us feel strong and make our provincial as an iron. There are 4 types of citizens who are leaving they are tin ages, adults, youngsters, and old age and all are having different taste. But we have to remember that each and every person must have an eye on their health and diet I.e. On food.",
        "The biggest example: As we all not that every rustic is facing a big problem of corona virus due to which many deaths occurred. So to make this virus through our diet chart and make us feel strong so that we all become one and fight with this so called virus.",
        "The regime should also focus on the diet and energy of the citizens. We are having the energy ministers, Food ministers, Experts etc. If the provincial citizens want that this responsibility should be taken by the government than they have to make discussion's and plans with their team members and should appoint such a person who is always there for the help of the candidates of the agrarian and give guidance and awareness regarding the diets and well-being.",
        "The power should start campings, lectures advertisments, awareness programs, etc. so that they get proper knowledge and training regarding this. The ministry should focus on every problem of the bucolic.",
        "So as per me both should perform proper responsibility for their energy and diet. No one should ne irresponsible and should not take liberal because \"Jaan ha to Jahan ha\" .  If we are having proper strength than we are having a good and strong family."
