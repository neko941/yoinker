        "In today's world with many technological advances, companies have become flexible in their ways of getting the work done from its employees. With new software being adopted by the company, it has become possible for employees to manage work outside the office. In the majority of companies, it is permissible to work from home instead of coming to the office daily. While working away from the office gives the employees an opportunity to work on days when they are traveling and increases employee satisfaction at the same time, this leniency results in minimum to zero supervision of work tasks by the manager.",
        "There are several situations which may make it impossible for someone to go to the office like an urgent business meeting out of town. So having an option to work remotely makes it easier to complete work on the go ensuring that the business is not negatively impacted in times of travel. In January 2019, a study by Harvard University on \"Factors contributing to Employee Satisfaction\" shows that this level of flexibility in the workplace reduces work pressure resulting in happy employees and lower attrition rate in companies. Thus, working remotely or from home can be extremely beneficial for both the employees and the companies but this enjoyment comes with certain pitfalls.",
        "A certain drawback is that if you were to not work in the office, your manager has less control over monitoring your work performance indicators. In addition to this, there is also a risk of data theft if employees are permitted to access company data outside the office. Even though granting permission to work remotely is highly critical in companies these days, I would argue that this access is limited to employees at all levels with a genuine reason to support their request to work from home. This can happen when they are out of the office for business or personal reasons but the first priority should always be to ensure that work is done in the office itself.",
        "Therefore, despite the decreasing work stress and easy access to work data outside the office, continuous monitoring of work metrics is key to ensure work efficiency which is sadly not fully possible outside the office. There is also the risk of data security so keeping in mind these downsides, companies should give an option to work from home but with limited access and in exceptional situations approved by the manager."
