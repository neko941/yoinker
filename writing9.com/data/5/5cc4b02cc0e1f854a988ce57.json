        "All the companies explore the wide variety of ways to motivate their work force, there is a common belief that the best to inspire and motivate an employee is by paying them based on what the productivity. I think, it is the right way to encourage the worker to stay on the top.",
        "Every year, the companies spend huge amounts of time and money to encourage their employees to meet the targets. It is a win-win situation for both, the employee and the employer because the performance of the employer depends on the employee and vice versa. For example, if the employees get underpaid for what they have achieved, it clearly demotivates them from putting same or extra amount of effort to get the work done. There are plenty of studies that proved, the money is the single most important motivational factor that effects the performance an employee.",
        "All the big multinational companies follow this strategy, especially online retailers like Amazon, Alibaba and Flipkart have been doing this for a long time. Since the low end jobs in these companies are labor intensive, workers get paid based on the target achievement, paying less doesn\u2019t make any sense for such a heavy duty jobs. However, they are other ways to inspire the workforce, two of them are the work satisfaction and the stress-free work life balance, but the most effective and proven way is high pay.",
        "To conclude, money is the best motivational factor for anyone in any scenario in the modern day world, the entire humanity is running behind it, leaving everything else to the dust."
