        "Pursuing further this, According to point of view those people who advocate that they play reasonable taxes to states for road so, masses should leverages in returns from government.They suggest that the government should allocate  staff member for cleanliness.Another way, the ministry also establish some seminars to the community related to environment so they should be aware about them and parents also provide information to children because it is our fundamental duties to reduce the detrimental effect which are occurring by untidy environment.",
        "In addition, elected union member has a main responsibility to clean filthy roads.",
        "To recapitulate, after all things, while keeping in mind that the famous saying\"cleanliness is godliness\".After I acknowledged that Moreover all the inhabitants have responsible for unhealthy environment because they should be affected mostly in that area no one other.Nevertheless, the government also take further step to mitigate problem related to environment which are suffered by residents.So ultimately back offs such a problem."
