        "In our contemporary world, hefty proportion of people have been confronted with obesity. This health issues may be addressed through accreument of junk food prices according to plethora of people's notion. I strongly disagree with this remedy because of numerous cogent reasons on below.",
        "Perhaps it should be acknowledged that, drawing attention of consumers for fast foods, which are roots of overweightness,  may fail due to the high prices. Needless to say, if this initiative had been launched, vast majority of cutomers would have forsaken this sort of foods. This initiative, however, would call for astronomic prices to be valid and impactful due to addictive attribute of junk foods. Consequently, myriad of inhabitants, who cannot afford no more, may cease consuming junk foods and instead commence to seek alternative more healthy options. On the minus side, rest of people, for whom these foods are available due to their abundance, still suffer. Hence, this approach cannot be panacea at all.",
        "In terms of possible alternatives, the acquaintance of necessary knowledge about this difficulties and how to cope with them, may be large step toward sole solution. To illustrate that, making people aware with this heartbreaking advancement's adverse effects on human body via massive media or increasement number of sport centers and draw citizens' attention to this places would be perfect example of that sort of initiavtives. Therefore, people start to tackle with obesity on their own, which is supreme advantage.",
        "The conclusion to be drawn is that, making efforts to eradicate this by only one side cannot be adequate and instead of that, patients should take responsibility on their own and take care for themselves."
