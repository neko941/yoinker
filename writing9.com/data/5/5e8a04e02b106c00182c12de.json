        "In upcoming decades, shopping will be converted as an entertainment activity rather than purchasing merchandise. Shopping areas are now playing pivotal role in some customer\u2019s life as a source of goods, while others accept shopping activity as an entertainment. I believe that shopping mall might experience some changes. However, I will debate both sides of argument and give my own view in this essay.",
        "On the one hand, some customers prefer shopping to entertainment. One reason is that they are usually tend to select items and clothes with their friends. In my view, another one is that all shops specialize in one area. For instance, customers might be informed by shop assistant so as to enrich their limited knowledge of some items as well as purchasing what they need. However, minority of people consider shopping as under one roof with entertainment due to the fact that people enjoy shopping as an entertainment. In my opinion, people have sufficient such activities as cinemas, fishing, riding, restaurants, et cetera to entertain themselves",
        "On the other hand, vast majority of buyers will regard shopping as a great entertainment in order to have relaxation in the future. Because shopping areas will comprise fascinating performances, great shows, cinemas, fast food restaurants, etc. In upcoming decades shopping will diminish its value owing to online shopping. Such merits of online shopping as saving time and economizing money will outweigh benefits of shopping mall. Some clients may recall shopping when they feel incredibly uptight so as to minimize stress.",
        "In conclusion, I would like to emphasize that shopping activities will undergo some changes. Shopping may replace its current purpose with entertainment facilities in upcoming decades."
