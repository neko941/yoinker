        "An ideal society where the human can fulfill all their desires has not been accomplished yet despite much efforts that have been made. Therefore, I tend to believe that instead of setting a high standard (*),  we should build a society where moral values, equal , and justice are highly respected. (**)",
        "In the society where its citizens love, support each other, and share both material and spiritual values, all of which lead to a wealthy and healthy lifestyle, the quantity of prison would be lower. In other words, humans could live in safety and grow up in ethical-educated condition, therefore, they would voluntarily take the responsibility for taking good care of their family and people around them. This would become the motivation for developing and enhancing many fields which play integral parts of society such as economy and education. (***)",
        "Additionally, the society that justice and equality are critically respected, there would be no discriminations such as sexism and racism, both are the most serious problems in our current world. For instance, George Floyd, a Negro, was killed by a police officer although he said that he could not breathe when that white man knelt on his neck. This raised a protest storm in countries, leaving many consequences such as economic stagnation, death, and destruction . Thus, were citizens to want to live in peace and security, it would require them to make a joint effort in eradicating these issues and building a virtuous world. (*)",
        "Creating a society based on these standards would be hard, but it is possible. Beginning from changing education that students should be educated to imply with moral standards rather than learning theoretical knowledge. Also, not only at school, parents ought to improve their lifestyle to become the paragon of virtue which children could follow, contributing to form their positive personality. (***)",
        "In conclusion, an ideal society should be created depend on justice and righteousness, from my perspective"
