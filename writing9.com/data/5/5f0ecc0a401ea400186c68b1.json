        "It is been propounded by some that the key success factor in education is having access to qualified teachers since with a proper teaching approach students from different backgrounds can evolve to their highest potential. However, some others including me claim that successful education path is not attainable for students with a fundamental reluctance toward learning regardless their access to high quality teachers.",
        "On the one hand, advocates of high profile teachers as the core competency of education success, propose that experienced teachers are able to implement an adjusted education system based on students\u2019 needs and potentials. As a matter of fact, they can develop a learning methodology to cover all of students needs and bridge over their learning flaws. Therefore, no matter the attitude of students are, a proper teacher can find a way to trigger them to get back on the education success road and achieve their goals. However, there are some cases that even excellent teachers could not achieve a success story in education.",
        "On the other hands, the insights and approach of human-being have been a non-negligible element of their success throughout the history, indeed the education is not an exception to this general understanding. In fact not every single individual\u2019s success is being define through the path of education. For instance for a student with an exceptional physical ability and a natural potent in a certain professional sport, being successful in education is not a concerns. As a result, even a wonderful teacher efforts to convince to follow educational goal will be a waste.",
        "To conclude, I believe that a proper teacher with a flexible learning methodology can be a significant factor for having a successful education path, however, the main motive to succeed in this regard, is the personal insights, potential and approach."
