        "Nowadays, there have been a growing number of crimes in many developed countries. Although crimes take place due to various reasons, one noticeable factor is that people are not happy with their current lives. This essay will discuss the reason in detail and suggest some solutions to deal with the issue.",
        "Most of all, one major reason of their dissatisfaction comes from unequal opportunities for wealth in our society. In other words, as our society becomes more and more industrialised and commercialised, the wealth gap between the rich and the poor is widening. If you are from rich family, you can enjoy comfortable and abundant lives with enough money, whereas poor family will experience harder lives. So, if people realize that it will be difficult to avoid their poverty even though they strive to work hard, then they may easily fall into crimes to express their anger and pains.",
        "On the other hand, there are some ways to solve this problem. Firstly, government should try to distribute the wealth to everyone equally. Even though this is not easy task to achieve, but the government should get rid of some regulations and rules that threaten poor people. Giving equal opportunity to every single person can prevent people from making wrong decision. Equal employment and educational chances can make people happier in their daily lives. Moreover, the state should give people to receive equal chances for medical service and welfare pension so that they can maintain basic living condition.",
        "In Conclusion, unequal economic and welfare opportunity seems to be the main reason of increasing crimes. The government should work harder to create a peaceful society which all people are treated fairly based on their effort and contribution."
