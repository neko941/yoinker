        "Firstly, we should consider people's living habits in the past. It is obvious that they seemed more healthier than now because we did not have technology or variety in food at that time. Also almost the citizens of the world in the past spent more time activities outside such as playing sports or doing exercises. Fortunately, they were not busy for working and they often kept thier mind complete peace.",
        "As for now, people work out less than before because they waste time focusing on technology such as playing video games or watching TV too much. The most important that appearance of fast food is making they get obese. This is reason why they choose fast food than cook a meal by thierself because they do not have enough time to cook. In addition, stress is one of the cause make them get fat. For example, the amount of fast food in US was consumed is the highest in the world, the consequence of eating fast food makes Americans can not keep fit than others",
        "To sum up, there are so many way to get into shape. If we want to burn up a lot of calories, we should try to do exercises and keep well balance diet or change some daily actives."
