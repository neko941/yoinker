        "Currently, people all around the world have faced wih the sirious epidemic which is called Covid-19. Citizents are received free health care from their goverment. This can have both positive and negative.",
        "On the one hand, supporting free health care is benificial for some way. Fistly, one of the main benifits is that all citizent has accessed to the same quality of care and tratments especially poor people. Medical services and treatments are quite costy with people. In fact, expensive health care cost being from priscription charges and treatment cost prevent a great number of these people from meeting doctors to treat minor disease for a long time and their health certaintly be worse. Secondly, the goverment can controll the spread off illness and diagnoze at the initial llevel. For example, thousand of people were kept away citizents area and then were took care of by doctors, nurses, and miliary goverment. After a short- strict time, patients who were attack by viruts have been got rid of disease.",
        "On the other hand, there are some disadvantages of free medical services and treatments. The goverment invested the amount of money for supporting their citizents, there for, the budget is nearly scarcity. It make an appoitment effect to another field that need to be supplied such as education, foreign- econonmical or culture. Another problem is that the lack of doctors, trained nurses can have a detrimental effect on the quality of medical centres frequently overload with patients. It means that doctor meet and take care of many cases continually. It is hard to focus on one persone. Additionally, medical staffs must have to work long time and nurse a large number of people.",
        "In conclution, free health care has both advantages and disadvantages. National authority should motivate benificals in effectively ways."
