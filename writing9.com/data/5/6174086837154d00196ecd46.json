        "A section of society believes that in today's world, few strategies followed in promoting products are not profesional as well as not acceptable. However, other's disagree  with this approach. In my opinion,advertisements nowadays are negatively persuading children and young adults.",
        "To begin with , advertisements targetting on children may cause detrimental effects on society. In contemporary times,almost all junk foods are being promoted with the children's favourite cartoons character.This allure  students to eat unhealthy foods that are rich in calories . Moreover, this not only assists them to gain weight but also make them  susceptible to many health issues.  For instance , a particular candy bar sales increased upto 70% after publishing an ad with a famous hero in India. Therefore , unprofessional commercials would negatively impact a society.",
        "Secondly, advertisements may develop wrong values in young adults . In recent times,Tv commercials are mainly concentrating only  on their products sale that would encourage the  young adults to respect the materials instead of people. When this behaviour develops in people that may lead to a materialistic society. If that happens, then it will make people more self-centred and concentrate on their progress alone. In addition, young people  may waste their money on unnecessary products. Thus, advertisements could create impudent behaviour in the younger generation.",
        "In conclusion, advertisement methods targeting children and without social values would cause negative impacts in  a country . Hence, companies should not use these strategies to promote their products ."
