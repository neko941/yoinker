        "Although attending universities is popular, it is thought that more people should be trained in manual work to meet social needs. To me, I only agree with this idea to some extent.",
        "On the one hand, there is not a shadow of a doubt that student can derive a host of benefits from universities. Firstly, the school curriculum is carefully designed to equip students with the essential knowledge and in-depth theories which is fundamental to the practical working environment. Secondly, attending a prestigious educational institution can enlighten the personal background as well as help candidates easily apply for well-paid jobs and also secure their career prospects. Furthermore, not only the academic and theoretical knowledge but also extracurricular activities are the crucial factors to build students' success. As can be seen, those who take part in after-school activities are inclined to be more creative and self-motivated which make them feel confident after graduating.",
        "On the other hand, some arguments lend support to the view that vocational training is a better opinion. Firstly, training programs for the skilled trades regularly take half the time or less when compared to a four-year degree, which allows students to cut down their study expenses and enter the workforce sooner. Secondly, most communities require skilled professions such as tradesmen, plumbers or sanitation workers to guarantee safety and provide citizens with convenient lives; therefore, manual labor should be respected and highly appreciate. Finally, more people should pursue vocational training to sustain life because of the current imbalanced workforce resulted from surplus white-collar workers.",
        "In conclusion, although I recognize that vocational training is less time-consuming, I would argue that universities make students more well-rounded after leaving school."
