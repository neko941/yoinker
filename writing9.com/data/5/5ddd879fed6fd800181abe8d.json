        "In recent years,childhood obesitty has become a hazardous issue for new generations.some people recommends that,advertisments  about junky food and desserts ought to be banned in academical facilities.I tottaly agree with this view and this essay w\u015fll explore the main reasons about this issue.",
        "Firstly,obesity is not just a physical problem.For example,some reserchs showns that this issue may couse terrible problems such as,anxiety and depression.For reason thatiparents which is resposible for their child,have to be careful on their children's daily routine.Furthermoreithey should always monitor the meal which is eaten by obese child.Otherwise,it may bring some consequneces which is hard for the future of their child.",
        "Secondly,childhood obesity causes some harmful illnesses.For instance,the most accurate reserchs show that.If a child is obese,he or she could be diabeties in the future.The high level of diabeties will be hazardous for every preson.They even have to cut off their fingers or maybe even arms or legs.As I mentioned.It will be the parent's duty t\u0131 deter their child to be over-weight.",
        "Thirdly,In schools,students have to be responsible for themselves.Moreover,they must bring their homemade meal with them.Even though the billboards are attractive,They have to be loyal and liable on their own health care.Although their school authority do not support them in this situation.They must encourage themselves and never give up!",
        "In conclusion,for some reasons,some schools authorities support the junky food adverts.This will be harmful for their students weight.In my opinion,school authorities which are resposible for their students,have to come up with a solution to find a way to deal with this obesity issue.It might be challenging to find a solution as a result of highly financed adverts but in accurate way it will be extremely beneficial to their students health."
