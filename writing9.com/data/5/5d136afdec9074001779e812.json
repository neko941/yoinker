        "In recent times, the number of people travelling abroad has increased tremendously. While some argue that it is not required to travel to know about other countries, other are of the opinion that it is necessary. I completely agree with the latter side.",
        "On the one hand, some people believe that it is not important to actually travel to know about places. With the advancements in technology and availability of the Internet and television, one can know about each and every country in the world, their tradtions and customs, just by sitting at home. This is more beneficial since there is no time constraint and whenever people are free, they can just watch and know about various tourist attarctions all over the world. Besides time, another advantage is the amount of money one can save by avoiding trips. Also, another mode of getting knowledge is through magazines and books that describes culture and tradtion of different locations.",
        "On the other hand, I personally belong to the other group who says it is mandatory to visit places if we need to know in-depth about their actual culture. Their argument is that unless we mingle with people who lives there, we won't be getting a clear picture and we may not be able to appreciate it. Although we have all different sophisticated methods to learn about the world, unless we feel and embrace it, we wont be able to understand fully. Another aspect is the scenic beauty of the place, which no one can explain perfectly. Also, only when we visit a place, we can get a grip of what is the real scenario since majority of articles and documentries will only show the good aspects and ignore the reality. For instance, Mumbai is a place in India where the biggest slum is located. Only very few people actually knows that there are other places which are worth watching. We should not forget the fact that only a personal visit will give a chance to experience the wide variety of cuisines that a country provides.",
        "To conclude, it is always ideal to experince rather than just watching or reading about other countries. I believe that, although we have the option to get all the details at our finger tips, there are certain things that we need to see and realise."
