        "Nowadays, Abortion means not removing the baby before they are born. They have been argument going on whether it should be legalised or not. Lets discuss in detail regarding the same in the latter part.",
        "Regarding making Abort legal. Before going to discuss it, let's check out the reasons for it. One of them may be because of poverty. some of the parent's don't want to have kids, as they are not in a position to grow them. Other could be, already they had children. In this case, it will difficult for either mother or father to take of their kids, if they have more than couple. For example, If a family already had 2 little ones, they third may be difficult for them to raise, so because of this reason they want to go it. One more could be on medical grounds. If the mother became sick after the first one then she could not have the other, as it may be dangerous to either mother or born child. Considering the above points, we can support for making it legal.",
        "Lets discuss about other side of the coin. Recent generation, because of infactuation and knowing that they can go for abortion, they are having free sex at early stages. For example, Many news published in internet or newspaper, regarding minor getting pregancy. In this situation, if they go for it, it may be risk for life. Its not only risk, but also chances of getting pregant in future may be questionable.",
        "In conclusion, to my opinion, under some circumstances like with doctors permission and proper legal approval, it can be done. If this was followed, we can better society."
