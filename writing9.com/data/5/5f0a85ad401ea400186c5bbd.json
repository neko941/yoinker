        "High population density in metropolitans exerts significant pressure on housing infrastructure. The tendency brings several heated debates on whether constructing skyscrapers or building low-rise residential areas on large space is the better solution. For my part, I believe that tall apartment buildings are the more suitable choice.",
        "First and foremost, compared to establishing residential areas on a wide space, skyscrapers not only require less amount of land but also provide larger space since they are multi-storey, thus they can effectively preserve open space which is a core goal of sustainable urbanization. In particular, the availability of open spaces such as farm land or places of natural beauty provides significant benefits including improving air pollution, attenuating noise, controlling wind, controlling erosion, and moderating temperature. Moreover, apartment buildings also mitigate massive overpopulation in megacities by accommodating a large number of people, unlike low-rise residential areas which have less capacity.",
        "Many people claim that construction of these buildings requires an extra cost premium because of their need for sophisticated foundations, structural systems to carry high wind loads, high-tech mechanical, electrical, elevator, and fire-resistant systems. While it is true that constructing low-rises is less costly due to its low technical requirements, investing in tall building remains the wiser choice for urban areas. Since more buildings are synonymous with plenty of services that cover diverse needs such as recreational activities, groceries, and healthcare within walking distances, it can bring enormous economic profits, which is worth exerting investment on high quality facilities.",
        "To conclude, despite complicated technical requirements and the prohibitive cost of constructing high-rises, I believe that this is the solution for sustainable urbanization and overpopulation in megacities."
