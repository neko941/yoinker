        "Giving punishment to young  lawbreakers in the same manner as adults, is believed by many many people to be prominent. In my opinion, although valid concerns underlie this demand, It should not be followed through.",
        "On the one hand, It is understandable why the demand is being made. Instances of juveniles who misusing the law have been risen in modern times. Knowing well enough they are likely to be let off with a slept on the wrist. Due to this many young people take participate in criminal activities intentionally and fearlessly. India take as an example, there have been countless cases in which young people have committed heinous crimes, such as rape and murders, Without knowing any series repercussions of their actions. So, injustice to the victom and their family would happens.Thus, that's why I agree with that why the individuals are demanding same punishment for the young criminals as young adults.",
        "However, Despite these concerns, punishing them as adults, would not be a wise decision.The children do not possess intellectual and moral capacity to understand fully the consequences of their actions. Keeping in mind, punishing them in the same manner, it would be an immoral act in itself. Moreover, as young people's minds are impressionable still, they can be easily rehabilitated.The rehabilitate efforts make for greater sense than stricter punishment. Consequently, sending them in prisons with the adult criminals, it would be worsen the criminal tendency of their impressionable mind. Owing to these reasons, I also agree with this perspective.",
        "In conclusion, while there are some valid reasons to demand stricter punishment for the young criminals, according to my thinking the demand should not be acted upon due to some moral and practical issues"
