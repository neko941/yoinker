        "Global warming has become a public health problem as it's effects are deleterious to all life forms. Sadly, this problem of increasing worldwide temperature is caused solely by man's activities. The two major man-made causes of this issue are the use of fossil fuels for energy and deforestation. There are a variety of ways to tackle this controversial issue, however, in my opinion, conversion to renewable sources of energy and planting of trees or preservation of green life in general will prove effective.",
        "First and foremost, industrialization brought about the advancement of the modern world but also the continuous emission of dangerous pollutants into the earth's atmosphere. For centuries, coal and other fossil fuels have been used to generate energy for our daily activities. Experts have shown that these gases are responsible for the elevation of the earth's core temperature as they cause depletion of the protective covering of the earth called the ozone layer which counteracts the greenhouse effect. To solve this problem, governments globally should place an embargo on the use of fossil fuels as energy. Funds should go to the research and development of other forms of reusable energy such as water and nuclear power. This will allow for healing of the ozone layer since the factors causing it's destruction would have been eliminated.",
        "Secondly, as the population of humans increase so is the need for more space for housing and other infrastructures. This has led to a vast depletion of the trees that are responsible for clearing out the earth's air. Furthermore, the trees especially in the artic region help to preserve the permafrost which keeps the core temperature cool. Abscence of this causes a rise in temperatures with resultant melting of the polar ice caps. To deal with this, areas where deforestations have already taken place should commemce tree planting drives. For example, there are countries where community service for minor infractions are done by planting at least 500 trees. Government should also make policies that ensure incorporation of nature and trees into works and housing plans.",
        "In conclusion, the biggest challenge of this generation might as well be global warming. It is the culmination of the effects of man's activities such as burning fuels and cutting down trees. I believe that changing to alternative forms of energy and worldwide planting of trees can help solve this problem."
