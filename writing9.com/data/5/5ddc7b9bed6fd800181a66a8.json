        "Some people believe that the authorities should assign some funds to teach sciences for the advancement of the nation.  Do you not think this is the right investment? I strongly agree to the assertion that assigning some money to teach science has no harm.",
        "There are some enthralling grounds to agree with the idea of spending money to teach science subjects in the school . Firstly, it helps enhance rational skills among individuals, which inturn develops problem solving skills. This would benefit the young ones in cracking the toughest of interviews.  As per the recent survey conducted by Times Now, students who had science subjects in their curriculum are more successful than those who did not have.  Secondly, it restricts children from being distracted as it helps them think out of the box. Finally, the country would be producing more educated people which helps the economy growth.",
        "Nevertheless, having students restricted to the academic subjects makes them dull and lose their interest. There are chances for the pupils to get distracted which directs the to the wrong direction leading them to inherit bad habits. Furthermore, there might be behavioral changes in them which might turn out to be horrendous to the development of the country. Although the students may be able to complete their schooling but they might lack in analytic skills which keeps them behind in the competitive world.  Seen in this light it is evident that having knowledge on science subjects is significant in shaping the progress of the nation.",
        "In conclusion,  according to me, I believe that the officials should spend some money in the science subjects for the growth and progress of our country."
