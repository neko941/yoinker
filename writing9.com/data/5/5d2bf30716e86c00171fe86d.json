        "Social integration is a crucial factor needed for everyone in the path of being well accepted in human society as an individual as well as a member in a group. Recently, there has been a serious concern among a vast number of people whether children should be home-schooled or educated at school in order to become good members in society. In the essay, both views will be discussed and my personal opinion will be present as well.",
        "Family has been considered the sustainable underpinning in mental development of every child. In early ages, children spend most time with their parents, therefore, most things that they have learnt are derived from their mother and father. For instance, if a child living in a family where he has to face domestic violence on a daily basis will likely do the same things with his peers at school and even later with his colleagues and life partner in the future.",
        "On the other hand, the importance of school education in shaping children\u2019s personality and morality is unignorable. First and foremost, students are provided with basic knowledge conducted by educational experts with lifetime experience in different fields. More importantly, schools are considered an ideal environment where children can obtain multitudinous down-to-earth lessons from real life situations which might happen between peers as schools are a miniature society packed with people with various backgrounds and personalities. At the same time, varied useful things can be gained when working individually and in a group in different activities at school. For example, doing various tasks with their friends helps them recognize the effectiveness of working in group whereas working individually can help stimulating the flexibility in handling different tasks.",
        "In my opinion, both schools and homes are essential educational environment which offered children numerous great lessons, from academic aspect as well as social one. Children with strong foundation in both school and home education can greatly contribute their best for the society with lofty attributes learnt and selected from friends, teachers and parents.",
        "In conclusion, the key to help children to be widely accepted and welcomed in any communities is that parents should lead by example at home but also make a wise decision in choosing a good school for their offspring."
