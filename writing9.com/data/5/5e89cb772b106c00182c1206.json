        "In the present world, education plays a vital role for the country as well as for children. Adolescent's fate decide by a proper schooling. Some people believe that in small age there is lot of burden on them by education. Others believe that, Studies should begin before the age of 7. I will discuss both views in next paragraphs.",
        "Few parents suggest that students would start their tuitions in early age. Due to this,  in little age, they have the capability of grasping things better than any adult. According to oxford university's research paper, 40% of mental growth depends on child's early teaching. Moreover, This early educational environment will bring great benefits for them. Like, writing, reading and they can enhance their social skills by interact with other pupils. However, forcing young children to start their journey can attract mental sickness and trauma to them because they do not sustain a lot of pressure.",
        "On the flip side, there are many countries have a law of primary education and the law describes that, in the age of 7, child is fully aware of any formal inculcation & also adapt cognitive theories.In addition, Starting school at a later age will offer kids to learn something exciting and interesting by parents. At that age, they have curiosity to learn something new. It might be beneficial for them to cultivate their own ideas and skills at home.",
        "In conclusion, in my opinion, children should start their educational affairs later because that's the perfect time for them to recognize the words and their meanings."
