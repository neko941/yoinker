        "Nowadays, there are many people choose to living big cities for their better future,but besides the benefits urban areas bring, people also face a host of issues everyday. In this essay, I am going to explain some drawbacks, which they face, and according to my point of view motive people towards rural towns is the best way to solve this issue by the government.",
        "There are some problems people face in big cities. Firstly, the living in big cities are very expensive as compared to small towns. In other words, citizens have to pay high prices for housing, transportation and even for food.",
        "Secondly, huge traffic jams is also a major problem in big cities. Because all the people and business in these cities depend on private vehicles. As a result, the rods are become flooded with the transportation at the peak hours and people face difficulties to reach their destinations. Moreover, the shortage of enough space is also important difficulty for citizens of big cities. As we observed people living in multistory buildings in these cities so that they do not get enough space to make park, small playground for their children and so on.",
        "However, there are some solutions the government can change this situation of large city people. I consider that motivating people towards the regional towns is best way to give relief to the big city natives. But to get the attention of public to the small towns the government should bring the all major facilities to the rural towns such as better public transportation and excellent rods, which help them to rech at big cities in small amount of time. Furthermore, the government need to open colleges and universities in small towns. Because a lot of students go to big cities for their education purposes. Last but not the least, people moved to big cities for employment. If the government should build factories in small towns then people obviously choose to stay at regional towns.",
        "In conclusion, I believe that it is government responsibility to look after the welfare of its people. The migration to the small towns work out if the government provides facilities like big cities."
