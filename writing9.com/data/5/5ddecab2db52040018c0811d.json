        "Today\u2019s era, indeed the ratio of crimes rapidly increased in urban areas among young people. Many people frequently move towards criminal act because they face several issues regarding jobs, and uncontrollable rise in prices. Such kind of offence  impacted in their  lives.",
        "There are uncountable reasons to rise in crime ratio. Firstly, the unemployment rate is higher day by day. In many countries the passing tendency of graduates increased but unfortunately they do not find any opportunity in the market for income. Consequently the young generation starts doing crime. For instance, Mostly the street evils are very famous in the urban areas. As per recent research published in New York Times the offence is much higher ten times as compared to last years.",
        "Secondly, the other major reason is inflation. In underdevelopment cities the prices is  exceed   beyond the limits. As a result poor people couldn\u2019t able to full fill the desires and needs. However they start comparing with others and try to achieve the targets in other evil way. For Example, in Japan the prices of commodities have rapidly increased and side by side the medical facilities also uncontrollable.",
        "There are different solutions to control the unlawful things . Therefore,  the Government should arrange jobs for students in their respective fields. Additionally, in the  urban cities universities must offer scholarship programs for those students who couldn\u2019t afford the university fees. Furthermore, to control the unbeatable inflation rate the Government imposes some taxes and utilizes these taxes to support the deprived people.",
        "I summarize here, so these preventative measures easily overcome the crime ratio in the cities among the young people."
