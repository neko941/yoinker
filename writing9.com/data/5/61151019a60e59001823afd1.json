        "It often argue that the use of products, made from animal skin or bodies and killing of animal for individual's food should be stopped. Some are keeping opposite opinion. I will discuss both statement and conclude in the end.",
        "Firstly, Innocent animals are kiling to satisfy an individual's food desire. Non-vegetarian people, like to eat animals in the everyday food routine and take in their compulsory diet. An increase in the demand for animal meat has become a danger in the ecology system. For example, the demand for fish meat, many places in the sea and rivers, some speices of fishes have been enter in endanger because due to increase in demand for fishes meat, even small fishes are being caught and they can not reproduce. It is utmost necessary to lesser than the particular size of fishes must be prohibited for fishing.",
        "Further, thousands of innocent animal secrefy their lives every year fulfil the demand of human needs like valets, purses, belts and many other products beacuse items made from them are durable and attractive. I believe, many people do not know from which material are being used to made these items and awarness among the people can reduce their killing.",
        "Other hand,  there are many region in the world where there are no vegetation possible in the soil like desert, extream temperature that is very low or high. People who are living under exteam wheather, they suvive on animal meat. Moreover, there are limited vegetation in the area and can not fullfil the food demand through them. There is no harm if we use animal product made from animal skin, for example natural dead animal's skin can use appopriatly .",
        "In the conclusion, I would like to say that animals can be used to satisfy the food requirement but animal should not exploited and natual ecology system should be maintained. To avoid over exploitation, government should introduce the laws and spread the awareness among inhabitants."
