        "Nowadays, social status is more important to survive in this competitive world.  If the people is maintaining a good car and a big house is considered as rich and is treated as good human. In my opinion judging a person through its material things is not a good thing as humanity and moral values are more important.",
        "Furthermore, it is true that in todays society people give more respect to rich people.  For instance, in my society the person who is holding a Mercedes Benz a big villa in a city is treated as most cultured and rich person. Even though he dont have a proper ethics and not much qualified and is given more importance as compare to the middle man with higher degree and a kind heart. Being rich is not easy nowadays but to help poor is very important which can be seen very rare.",
        "On the other hand, I believe that people who are earning less has great values and kind nature as compare to rich people and even this is mostly seen in rural cities. In present world it's  impossible  to trust people,  and the values and ethics are seen very rare. For instance, before if people who is having gold is considered to be rich. But now we can see the values kindness and trust is no longer important.",
        "To conclude as the present world is changing rapidly its difficult for the people to carry the values and believe the society, by this we can find no family bondings and no family gatherings. And can find people are busy in maintaining there social status which is a bad impact on there coming generations and society."
