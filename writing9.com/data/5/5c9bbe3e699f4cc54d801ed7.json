        "Many nations in the world for instance China have implemented schemes to manage its population for the benefit of the country. One may observe that some countries have a larger population of young adults when compared its to its older population. This essay will discuss about the merits and downsides of having a relatively higher number of young adults in a country.",
        "First of all, a country\u2019s workforce and future advancement is dependent on its younger population. As the older population eventually reaches their retirement age, new laborers will be needed to substitute them. Looking at the country of Singapore, the government has introduced schemes for parents to have more offspring as the country foresees a demand for more workers to develop its resources. Moreover, the future development of a country depends on the knowledge of its younger generation as the older generation may become obsolete in the ever-changing modern world. In the field of information and technology (IT), many employers prefer to hire the younger generation as they have more relevant and up-to-date information about IT in the modern era.",
        "On the contrary, having a youthful population may place a strain on the country\u2019s education, health care, food and accommodation supplies. A country will enter a deficit state when its output exceeds its income. Many developing countries such as India that have growing youthful populations lack the fund to meets its demand for food, education and accommodation. Furthermore, an increase of young adults may mean a lack of available jobs in the future. For example, many freshly graduated accountants are unable to receive a job at accounting firms due to the flooding supply of workers.",
        "In a nutshell, this essay has discussed the advantages and disadvantages of having more young adults in a country. I am more inclined to believe that having more young adults is more beneficial as they are the key for a country to thrive and prosper in the near future."
