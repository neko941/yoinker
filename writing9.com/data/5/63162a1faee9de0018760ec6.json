        "The given charts below illustrate the data about sales of Fairtrade-labelled coffee and bananas in 1999 and 2004 in five nations in the Euro.",
        "Overall, it is obvious that the given tables had faced an increasing trend in the sales of Fairtrade-labelled caffeine and bananas when both European nations the UK and Switzerland were the ones that had the leading position in the sales of  both Fairtrade-labelled products in 1999 and 2004. Bananas and caffeine were the most popular in the UK in 2004 while they became the least popular in Sweden in the same year.",
        "There are three countries in Europe where the information about wholesale of two Fairtrade-labelled products rose astonishingly in comparison to data gained from two years that are 1999 and 2004. In UK and Switzerland, the number of wholesale of these products began relatively at the figure of 1.5 and 3 in coffee and 15 and 1 in bananas which, then, increase significantly in 2004. Specifically, both sales of espresso and bananas in the United Kingdom and Switzerland rose relative to the number  20 and 6 in cappuccino and bananas were at 47 and 5.5. A similar thing happened to Denmark when it slightly increased from 1.8 to 2 and 0.6 to 4 which relatively were the profit-making of  caffeine and bananas in comparison to 1999 and 2004.",
        "The other two European countries that are Belgium and Sweden tended to decrease slightly in the sales of the two Fairtrade-labelled products. In alphabet order, the information about the sales of coffee and bananas relatively in these two countries were at the number of 1.8 and 2 in 1999 then fell down to 1 and 0.9 in 2004"
