        "With quality of life increasing, people tend to go out for broadening their views. Some people like to take a journey with friends or family, but other people love to travel by themselves.I prefer to travel with others such as colleges or friends for the following reasons.",
        "Firstly, traveling with a companion can make tour easier. For instance, the companion would take photos instantly for us when we meet with some vivid landscapes. Especially for female, the companion could help us to get out of trouble when we cannot go out at night. Secondly, travelling with a companion can improve friends' relationships. we communicate and share innovative ideas  each other during the course of journey for there is no much time to do so in the working day. We even talk with a joke make the journey full of pleasure.",
        "Of course, other people decline to travel collectively because it is  less efficient than traveling individually.Taking catching coach as an example, we must wait for the companion to get on the coach together because of the different  pace of living.  traveling alone is more free and convenient. Sometimes, we just make self  refresh in a different condition by traveling and not want to be bothered by others. We may immediate and observe the  life circle from the destination alone in a new view.",
        "To summarize, I would travel alone if I intend to make a quiet journey ,but I prefer to travel with friends or family in most time because it will make us more intimate during the journey."
