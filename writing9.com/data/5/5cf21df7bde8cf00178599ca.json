        "As regarded,\"Freedon is the only attribute which renders an open area to humankind to flourish.\" There are split reviews regarding the belief that either inhabitans are allowed to choose better options in daily routine, in terms of cuisuine, leisure activity and dressing sense. A group of people believe that same should be rely with an individual, whilst a loud voices supports that it would be in responsible people's court. Both the aspects have it's pros and downsides. The same will be discussed in the ensuing paragraphs.",
        "To begin with, ellaborating the former view, in today's contemporary era it can not be denid that how many charecterstics can be risen if liberties given to a minor. This is because it  fosters not only selfconfidence but also give them a vision for forecasting. Moreover, if parents are not giving their children the freedom then development of their brain will definitely get restrianed. For instance, one of the articles of The New York Times had published that Adults who were given liberties for what to wear and what to do in their free times are more likely to be intellegent than the others who were not.",
        "On the other hand, some repercussions may not ne overlooked. Firstly, some parents ponder that minors are not mature and can easily misguided. Therefore, continious hammering should be given by a responsible person. To suppoer the prior sentence, history has witnessed that most of the drug addicts had started their career to enjoy their free personal time.",
        "To conclude, in the final analysis, it can be finally commented that although there are quite a few darksides such as fear of misguidence, upsurge in selfconfidence and foresight are the on the plus side. As fare as my views are concerned, I strongly support that balance should be establish between parents and youngsters in regards of thinking process. All in all, this is the solely rational way  to deal with the vital dispute."
