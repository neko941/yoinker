        "These days, artificially controlled robots are increasingly taking over control of jobs  in workplaces. While, it is possible that most of the simple jobs will be replaced, it is highly unlikely to take over skilled jobs that require human contact- to be performed by robots. This essay will discuss why majority of the jobs will be carried out by robots.",
        "Robots may eventually replace largely number of human labour that doesn\u2019t require sophisticated and complex human skills. They are cost-effective and significantly reduces the amount of money given that would otherwise be given to labourers. In addition, they are less time consuming as they are automatically programmed to carry out a particular task. In Dubai, for instance, all mega shopping malls use robotic cashiers thus, doing jobs without being paid heavily. Furthermore, it minimizes the human error that otherwise is impossible to be rectified. In Qatar, for example, all toll tax collections on motorways are done by robots, making it cost effective and less time consuming. For these reasons, robots will replace, by and large, most of the jobs in the near future.",
        "However, there are some human jobs that can\u2019t be replaced by robots because they will never achieve the capacity to do them. Humans are complexly designed creation of God with unique ability to think, mold and modify according to the situations. Jobs, for instance, Psychology, Medicine, Education and Social work require higher Human intelligence that can\u2019t be performed by artificially designed robots. Due to these reasons, robots will never be able to do jobs that need human skills and touch.",
        "To sum up, it is highly possible that a considerable number of Occupations will be done by robots in near future. Unskillful and menial jobs will be done entirely by robots; however fine skillful jobs that require human hand will always exist. Ultimately very few human jobs will be safe in a increasingly artificially intelligent robotic workplaces"
