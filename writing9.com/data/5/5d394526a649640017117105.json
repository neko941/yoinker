        "With the globalisation, not only adult people learn foreign languages, but many children also study foreign tongues in our modern society. However, I believe that school children have more positive outcomes when they learn a foreign language when they start going to school rather than they learn it in secondary school.",
        "On the one hand, opponents of early language education argue that pupils should wait to study a foreign tongue until secondary education, because the small children might be confused between their own native language and the foreign tongues that they learn at school. However, experts claim that people learn languages more efficiently when they have contrast, so it will help children to learn a foreign tongue comparing with their own language. Furthermore, it is also argued that elementary school students tend to be very busy and tired due to their fixed academical timetables which prevent them from learning extra subjects. In fact, pupils before puberty have special ability to learn languages easier than people in adolescent or adulthood and that will help children learn language without difficulties.",
        "However, despite the fact that children in elementary school are more likely to be comitted to their busy academic schedules, I strongly feel that children learn things more effectively when they start learning them at the early stage. Firstly, pupils in primary education are usually passionate enough to learn new things, and they do not feel fear to make mistakes as well that can motivate them to learn more. Another positive reason to learn languages in primary schools is that the development of cognitive skills. Recent study shows that learning foreign tongues is similar to learning mathematics according to the responces of the brain systems, which will be beneficial when they learn advanced science skills later on.",
        "In short, although children in primary eucation could be confused between their own mother tongue and the foreign tongue, that is a small price to pay when it comes to the more developed cognitive skills that they will have later. Therefore, I believe that studying a foreign language in primary school rather than later outweighs the disadvantages."
