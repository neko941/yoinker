        "Nowadays, some families migrate to other countries to find appropriate work places.  Hence, their children would grow up in the unfamiliar place. Some individuals reckon that migration has positive impact on children, while others belive that their lives become more complicated after migration. So in this essay i am going to exameine both sides of this debate.",
        "To start with, there are several advantages of migration on kids. Firstly, when the family move to other country their offsprings would able to explore the culture and tradions of foreign place. This helps them to understand how our world is diverse and contains many nations and communities. Moreover, when children move to the other place, where people speak foreign languages, kids would learn other tongues. There is the fact that learning other languages develops thinking skills and creativity. So, as a result, migration might be",
        "positive impact on children.",
        "On the other hand, when teenagers migrate to the other countries, they may face some problems. Initially, when young students move to unfamiliar countries, they are likely to leave their best friends and teachers. It greatly affects their psychology. Even in few cases they feel depression and anxiety. Also, when students move to the countries, where individuals use other languages, they can have linguistic problems. During the learning process, many teenagers feel embarassed in front of their classmates. These issues may also lead to stress or even depression",
        "To conclude, I think that it may be useful to young children, when they move to the other place before they go to the school. However, when students migrate to the unfamiliar countries, they are more likely to have social and communicative issues."
