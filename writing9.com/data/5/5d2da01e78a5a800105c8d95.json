        "Taking a year break before higher education is common in some countries. Working and travelling aid in personality development. However, it is the reason many youngster encounter difficulties to re-adapt academic environment. In my opinion, this trend could have both advantages and disadvantages in equal measure.",
        "the greatest benefit of a gap for year is, as it helps in positive personality development. Travelling broadens the views, youngsters learn new social attitudes. In addition, working before university education leads to development of proffesional attitude. Consequently, work experience make them profecient and skillfull. To illustrate, my cousin , who travelled to England after finishing high school , learned how to survive in new environment, linguistic and cultural challenges made him grow as a person . As a result, he comfortably adapted to new environment of international university later on.",
        "the main challenges students will face after working before higher education is to re-adaptation to university environment. Many people continue to work and never return to universities, as it is difficult for them to start study again. As an illustration,  my brother started a job in call center, earned agood amount of money and became independent. He never returned to studies, because in that case, he had to depend on finances sponsered by parents, ultimately, affecting his freedom.",
        "To conclude, It is nowadays incredibly common to take a year gap after high school. The advantages and disadvantages of working and travelling before higher education are equal in terms of their effect on youngsters."
