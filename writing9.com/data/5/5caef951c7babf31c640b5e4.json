        "Some people are of the opinion that teleworking would be more effective for most employees rather than making daily trips to work. This essay agrees with the notion and would prove that the benefit of better time management and happier staff due to improved work-life-balance surpasses any perceived demerits.",
        "Naturally, people who work from home have better control of their time as against the rigid routine of those traveling to work every day. Many people live miles away from their work place, and the result of this is that precious time is wasted on the road, especially during traffic rush hour; however, for those who work from the abode, time that would have been spent on the road is put to better use. For example, a growing number of UK teleworkers attributed their excellent job output to being able to work during the early hours of the morning which coincide with the traffic rush hours.",
        "What\u2019s more, people who work from where they reside have good work-life-balance since they spend more time with family and friends. The result of worrying less about meeting family and social demands is that these ones become happier individuals ultimately making them function better at work. For instance, statistics show that many European mothers now tend to opt for online jobs as it gives them mother-child bonding opportunities such as, engaging in exclusive breastfeeding or witnessing an important milestone in a child's life. Indeed, these are benefits that cannot be traded for anything in the world if teleworking becomes a trendsetter worldwide.",
        "In conclusion, for teleworkers, the advantages of flexible time and good work-life balance outweigh any disadvantages. Having said that, can teleworking be suggested to hit employees\u2019 maximum productivity?"
