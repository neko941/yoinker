        "It is argued that when natural calamities strikes weak nations, the rich countries should come forward to provide moral support in emergency aid activities. This essay agrees with this statement because the wealthy nations do have moral obligations to do so and they can provide resource to combat the needs of affected countries.",
        "First and foremost, they have moral obligations to do. Every nation needs to understand that we are humans first and we are divided owing to international boundary and cultural differences. This should not stop reaching out to destitute one\u2019s, especially when they are in need and affected  by tsunami\u2019s , earthquakes or other natural disaster\u2019s. For instance, tsunami struck the island nation of Srilanka claiming many lives as well as destructing huge number of properties. People from many European countries came forward to provide moral support for needy individuals and ensured the rescue activities are y are provided with food and shelter.",
        "One more significant contribution is to provide resources. This can be in the form of monetary help , exporting tons of food , or deploying several disaster relief forces who can join hands with the local forces to take swift actions. In one such instance, when flood affected Bangladesh during 2015, India sent their National Disaster Relief Force to rescue many unsheltered individuals especially children\u2019s,  transported tons of rice and roti\u2019s and funded 1 billion for development activities. By doing so, the faith in humanity exists and destitute nations gets moral support during hard times.",
        "To conclude, the prosperous governments should extend their hand when mother nature strikes developing countries because they have responsibility to help other nations and they can provide more supplies when the situation demands."
