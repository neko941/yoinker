        "Today, children watch television  more and it  is  significantly increased than the past.A unfortunately this lead to  reduce their activity . . In this assay I will explain the causes  and  suggestions to rise up the level of  children's activity.",
        "Many causes  lead to increase hours of watching television among children. The first important one technology like   the  satellites and  size and type of television . There  are multiple kids television channels  and these channels  open twenty four hours . Also the kids  have a lot of selection like songs , dance, different cartoon character and program  . Each  channel try to attract the kids to watch more. The televisions are available in public area like restaurants  and even in medical clinic.Second reason is working of both parents , so the time of spending with sibling  is reduced and caring is dropped as compared to the past.",
        "To solve this problem , parents should detect time  for watching television during the day and not allowing to increase than one hour.and try to select the channel. They will like activities if we try to diminish  time for seeing cartoons etc.  mother or father should go with siblings in outdoor activity ,playing with their children and encourage them to play in beaches and participate in sport team like football or tennis .If  children won in activity ,parent can give rewards . This issue lead to motive children more to jump and play or paint. Their community can make champion of practical skills between school age or preschool age like painting , playing music , acting drama or playing tennis ball.",
        "IIn conclusion, I  feel  the way of spend time of our kid  is responsibly of their famil, then the community and they can  both. Help the children to take activity ."
