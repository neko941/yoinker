        "There have been plethora of debates about the determining agents for intelligence. While some people claimed that it is hereditary, others argued that environmental influence is the main implicating factor. In my opinion, I believe proper nutrition and tutoring play major role in being intelligent.",
        "On the one hand, proponents of heredity thought that as skin color,height and some medical conditions could be inherited, the same applied to intelligence. In other words, certain genes which encodes knowledge are inheritable, which were responsible for people having different grades despite being subjected to the same learning environment. To illustrate, most scientists and academicians have predecessors who were also renowned in the profession. This buttressed that intelligence could be transmissible.",
        "On the other hand, others claimed that some environmental factors such as enriched nutrition and proper coaching play major role in enhancing intelligence. It was noticed that children who were exclusively breastfed and had balanced diets, which contain certain nutrients including iodine perform better than their contemporaries. Furthermore, if children are properly taught right from  their early childhood they are usually more knowledgeable than their peers. This enable skills and academics virtues to be impacted into the rapidly developing brain.",
        "Finally, in my opinion, excellent nutrition most especially during early childhood and effective tutoring enhance knowledge than genetic make up. For instance, they are some children with outstanding performances despite being born by an averagely intelligent parents due to these environmental influences.",
        "To conclude, although it is believed that heredity perform a vital effect in determining how intelligent someone is, I am of the opinion that balanced diet and effective tutors are the major agents in being knowledgeable."
