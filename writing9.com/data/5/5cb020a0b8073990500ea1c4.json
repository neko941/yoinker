        "While, universities use the technology because, nowadays, online courses are provided by universities. Moreover, in universities, these days teachers teach the students through projectors . In other words, education system is doing incredible things day by day . It has both pros and cons. Now I would describe both the views in the following paragraphs.",
        "Education lays the foundation stone for success. Firstly, online courses are very beneficial for people of all age groups. secondly, people live a hectic life so a lot of them choose online courses. Especially, those students who have come to another city for their jobs; they prefer the online courses because it is time saving. They can study at their home also after work . On the other hand, those people study online courses who can not go to expensive cities and are far away from their home.",
        "Lastly, I think classroom study is worthwhile rather than online study. Since if you have doubt on any topic then , you can ask from your teachers face to face. If you are studying in campus then you will learn how to be punctual. You will learn how to be disciplined as well as be better at communication. You can also human interaction in campus which does not happen during online study.",
        "To sum up , in my opinion, campus study is much more advantages rather than online study. As I already discussed above that one will be serious about attending the class regularly instead of online study. online study will  provide  more knowledge but classroom study will correct a person's mistakes and clear his doubts."
