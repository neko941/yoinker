        "Since the beginning of the twentieth century, mankind have been conducting researches and discovering new information of the modern world in the aspects of science, business and the academic world. Even though it is widely regarded that mankind should not resist sharing as much information as they can to others in the science, business and the academic world, it has also be regarded by others that newly discovered knowledge is too precious to be widely distributed. As far as I am concerned, knowledge, being the key to development, should be generously shared for the growth of humanity in our ever-developing world.",
        "Information in terms of knowledge should be freely shared to our global society for the development of the modern world. Without the sharing and distribution of newly discovered information, mankind will lag behind its development as humans should work together in making the world a better place to live in for each other. Through the sharing of information, less time, cost and effort will be needed to tackle any global issues that surfaces such as an epidemic, issues in food technology and modern transportation. For example, history has showed mankind that the discovery of vaccines could only managed to cease the outbreak of the bubonic plague that threatened the lives of billions of people after the knowledge on the derivation of vaccines were shared across the world. In other words, people should not withhold sharing new information as people depend on each other to advance and thrive.",
        "On the contrary, if information falls in the wrong hands, it may be exploited by people to commit the most terrible crimes. This is due to the fact that acquiring knowledge can allow humans to help each other but also to destroy each other through reaping benefits at the expense of another. The incidence of warfare across history has shown that the widespread information on the development of firearms has cost the lives of many as stronger nations conquer the weaker nations to take control of their economy and exploiting their resources. Apart from that, the knowledge on computer hackings has allow cyber criminals to pry on the lives of many famous people and consequently destroying their reputation by leaking their private and confidential details to the public.",
        "To sum up my point, information can be wrongly used to destroy the lives of others.",
        "In a nutshell, information can be shared without restrictions as knowledge is the key for mankind to prosper; yet it can be detrimental when it is abused by the wrong hands. I am more inclined to believe that distributing information should not be controlled as the advantages outweigh the disadvantages."
