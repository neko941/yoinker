        "In the days of the 21st century, relying on the internet is not unfamiliar to humans. Lives and financial systems have been altered by the internet, nevertheless, the planet is tended to become a worldwide community. It is indisputable that the identical thoughts and behaviors will exist in the humankind. This essay will illustrate a subjective opinion that is in agreement with the given topic.",
        "It is undeniable that lives and economies have been completely changed by the internet. In some previous centuries, information and signs were not delivered as simple as these days. Furthermore, the internet has become a contributing factor influencing many industries. Schools and colleges are maximally exploiting the upsides of the internet which is thought to be the potential instrument to be used in education. Goods are being sold via some worldwide webs, it is not only available in particular nations, but also the oversea trade. Hence, humans derive great benefits from the internet, which meets the demand for convenience, variety and consecutive development.",
        "Nevertheless, the internet narrows the distance between the world and a universal village, and rapidly, everybody will express indistinguishable ideas and actions. People receive the same knowledge due to consulting similar information resources that were updated on the internet. It is not accidental that children believe in some videos posted on Youtube, adults concern about much ridiculous online news. Besides, people are being controlled because we have a strong conviction that everything posted on the internet is reliable. Gradually, there will be no differences between individuals in society and the entire world will be combined into one huge village.",
        "To put it in a nutshell, although the internet brings many enormous benefits for humans, it does not mean that we let ourselves be dependent on it. We have to fulfill an obligation that prevents the internet from changing the world into a global village."
