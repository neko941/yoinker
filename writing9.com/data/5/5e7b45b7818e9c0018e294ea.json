        "Children are deemed as the future of a nation. In order to get a better generation, children should be brought up with proper care and education. Some people say that a mother plays a crucial role to grow up a child. Other people believe that fathers play a better role to up bring a child. However, this is difficult to choose one between a father and a mother as a better person to up bring children as both have important roles to play. However, mothers are naturally more capable of taking care of their children and they play a more significant role up bring her children. In my view, the mother keeps a better role to bring up a child and that is why they have greater responsibilities as well. Generally, mothers get abundant time to spend with their children but fathers do not get this opportunity as they have to spend more time to earn money for maintaining the family expenses. On the other hand, women are naturally more lenient than a man. Hence, children love to stay with their mother. Moreover, fathers have to remain busy with their jobs or businesses. That's why they might not have enough time to spend with their children. This is true that men keep a lot of contribution indirectly but mothers devote their time more for their kids. Their roles are also indispensable for children. To sum up men and women both are crucial for a child\u2019s proper grown-up. However, considering the usual trends and natural ability of women we can say that mothers are better parents than men."
