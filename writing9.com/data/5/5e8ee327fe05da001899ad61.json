        "It has sparked off a heated debate whether to raise children in an extended family or a nuclear family, the world over. Some assert that upbringing the children in a family including, grandparents, uncles, and aunts, is a virtue, while others refute this idea. From my perspective, nurturing the children in an extended family may result in many benefits that outweigh the potentially detrimental demerits.",
        "In today's hectic lifestyle and owing to financial problems, families are mostly dual-income, culminating in being pressed for time and consequent lack of adequate supervision for children.",
        "Furthermore, many families, who are struggling with monetary issues, cannot afford child-mining and afterschool care. It may increase the risk of children falling victim to crimes such as abduction, or coming under the influence of negative peer pressure. In such hard circumstances, living with other relatives such as grandparents not only is deemed as a positively contributing factor in providing constant supervision for children but also children are benefited from their support and aid while their parents are at work. Admittedly, since children spend most of their time with them, relatives can act as role models to establish ground rules for behavior, leading to having less truancy and juvenile delinquency later on.",
        "It might be said that being the center of attention and receiving unreasonably excessive help from people around, especially grandparents, at home, children may become spoiled rotten. However, today, the level of people's awareness of disciplining children has increased dramatically, and they are conscious of how to manage their emotions to avoid spoiling the child.",
        "Based on the above, it can be concluded that people around like grandparents are deemed as role models who can convey conventions and codes of conduct to children, and they may hopefully compensate for the absence of parental supervision. This is provided that they are well-educated on how to behave reasonably to avoid spoiling the child."
