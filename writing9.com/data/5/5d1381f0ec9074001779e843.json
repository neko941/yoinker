        "Nowadays, humanity seems to show a natural propensity of emulating people around iteven if they are not the perfect role models. This phenomenon can be seen throughgarments and items used. From my perspective, people try to become what they see atother persons all the time.",
        "On the one hand, I strongly agree with the given topic that the appearance of peopleand their products are imitating by each other because they what they do not possess,and sometimes they do not really need them. For example, the latest phone which every people wish to be treated with one, if people,especially younger generation sees it at a closest friend, then would persuaded to take one. Thus, they ending up in being in debt.",
        "On the other hand, it seems to me that the potential problem which is concurring at thisphenomenon is high-street names because they have a critical impact toward peopleregarding   their   style   of   clothing   and   consumerism.  For   instance,   they   launch   everyseason   a   newly-limited   collection   of   a   particular   type   of   good   which   persuadesindividuals to buy it. Therefore, people are lured into wearing the same clothes or usingthe same technology.",
        "Furthermore,   fashion   shops   and   fashion   shows   underlying   imitation   because   theypromote some outfits on the catwalk, triggering the wish of buying them, although someclothes cannot be worn in the real life. This kind of advertisement plays a huge role intothe development of copying. Thus people buy what they see on at others not what theyreally like or need.",
        "To draw up a conclusion, people are inclined to possessing the same products due todesire of being much better than others. I wholeheartedly believe that this trend shouldbe changed because people should be unique and satisfy their fundamental needs thantheir greed of having more than other persons"
