        "Countries are spending huge amount of budget in order to make the bicycle service usage easy. This is because it is a better and cheap alternative than other vehicles and is also a great assistance in an enormous issue i.e. traffic congestion.",
        "To begin with, vehicles such as cars and buses are expensive and it is better to opt for alternatives such as bicycle. This is because providing more bicycle usages for people than other vehicles is beneficial in terms of cost of money. For example, buying a bicycle will cost $200 while any other vehicle approximately on average $2000. Another reason is relating to its effects on health using bicycle instead of other vehicles such as car is having a positive effects on health, owing to the fact that it is keeping body, especially legs in movement. As a consequences people adopt a healthy life style.",
        "Furthermore, availing bicycle service for transport is critical for avoiding traffic congestion which is a fast growing problem in the modern world as compared to other measure such as increasing fuel cost. Conventional vehicles are enormous in with and length, thus making the flow of vehicles on roads arduous owing to large numbers of vehicles used by people. While bicycles on the other hand are occupying less space on roads and is a better way of dealing with traffic issues. For instance, a survey by national highway authority California has shown that at a time a single road making possible flow of five vehicles at one spot can accommodate thirty bicycles.",
        "In a nutshell, developed countries are spending money on bicycle technology in order to upgrade it to the performance of other vehicles, owing to its reliability, cheap cost, and handling traffic congestion issue."
