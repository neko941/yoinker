        "It has been an ongoing debate about the increasing population of the nation. However, this will also add the concern for the rising the number of youths compared to the elderly people. I agree with the notion having manifold irrefutable points and few demerits. The essay will discuss above notion with arguments in below paragraphs.",
        "To begin with, the predominant merit for having large number of adolescents is that the nation can grow their prestige over the globe. As the younger person are more capable who having the dynamic personality. They can expand the glory of the nation by doing the new research. Moreover, the authority should also relax as their citizen having healthy life. They can spend their money and time for the development not on the health care. For example, many manufacturing companies has increased their production capabilities having more youth as their employee.",
        "On the other hand, this diversity having few detrimental impacts on the nation. The first demerit is that younger one never finds the correct direction. As this person are not much mature to take decision. So, if the elder are present then they guide them by using their experience of life. Furthermore, the youth has to live alone having no family support. This will create a gloomy impact to their mind as the family would provide support which helps to reduce the stress as well. For instance, most of the youngsters has started to drink as they feel alone having no one who will take care of them.",
        "In conclusion, there are many positive points which outweigh the disadvantages of having large number of youths compared to the elder. This will help the nation to excel their economy and give focus on the development."
