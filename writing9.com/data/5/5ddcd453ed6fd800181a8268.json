        "Social networking sites such as Facebook and Instagram have become increasingly popular around the world during the past decade, and almost everyone from young children to older adults has an account in such social media. Although social networking sites are convenient and entertaining to use for the purpose of communication and obtaining information, I totally agree that individuals and society have had some detrimental consequences from them.",
        "One negative impact on individuals is that they have changed the way people interact with others. In the past, people used to have more intimate relationships with friends and family, spending time and sharing the real experience together. However, people became less interactive in recent years even though people keep their friendships online. I acknowledge the usefulness of  these networking websites as they allow people to stay connected with each other around the clock and even with some distance, I still think that these connections are superficial and different to real friendships that people used to have in the past. Thus, social networking sites have weaken the human relationships to some extent.",
        "Social media has caused a negative impact on our society as well. One illustration of this is the increasing incidence of cybercrime such as phishing scams and identity theft. This kinds of crime are expected to increase more in the future along with the increases in social netwroking users. Furthermore, some of the online communities on social networking sites are not suitable to young-age users. In fact, there was an incident where a young children was kidnapped by a man who the girl met through the social media. This kind of crime is concerning for both children and their parents, making the society unsafe.",
        "In conclusion, despite the convenience of socail networking sites, there are asocciated negative impacts on both individuals and society. People should be aware of these consequences and use the social media wisey."
