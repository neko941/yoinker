        "In the current modernisation, people's style of life has drastically changed in comparison to the past, resulting in more younger adults to take medications for degenerative disease. In this essay, I shall provide lucid examples and causes to such degradation of health.",
        "Long ago, most people were working manual works which require much more effort and eventually, people were much more dynamic and healthy. Nowadays, people sit in an office where they feel more stressed and barely make movements, thus resulting to poor health and obesity. Similarly, instead of walking, people take their cars to drive short distances, definitively causing illnesses such as cardiac, high cholesterol, diabetes and high  blood pressure. We unfortunately observe that young people have to take tabs earlier than they should.",
        "Additionally, the quality of food products are of poor quality. There are more processed foods on the market which are rich in sugar, carbohydrates and grease. People were eating more healthy food long ago but nowadays, fast food and restaurants are opened mostly everywhere and people are tempted to eat rich food which are drivers of a complicated health state. Moreover, meat and chicken are being grown with hormones  and likewise, for vegetables, pesticides and artificial stimulants are added to them for rapid growth. All these factors are unfortunately deteriorating our health. In the past, children were playing in garden and running in the neighbourhoods. But now, kids stay in their house,  scotched to their tablet and smartphone, meanwhile, eating snacks which contain food colorant,salt and oil. Obviously, all these factors are worsening people's health.",
        "In conclusion, being realistic, young people's health will continue to deteriorate as long their lifestyle does not change. The government should provide more facilities such as sport complex should be accessible to everyone freely. Moreover, bio farming should be encouraged so that the products available to customers are healthy."
