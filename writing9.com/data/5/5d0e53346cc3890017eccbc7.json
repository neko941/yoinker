        "Some people believe that health of individuals can be improved best by provided more games facilities. Conversely, others feel that other schemes are needed for improving people\u2019s health. The matter is a controversial issue. However, I believe the facility of having sports centre near house will substantially help the people in improving their health.",
        "Newly developed games arrangement near the homes of individual will motivate them to get involved in sporting activities in their leisure time. As a result, they would get social and have more acquaintances which would help in relieving their psychological stress. As an instance, an adult who plays badminton on a regular basis in an activity institute helps him to remain physically fit and mentally free of stress. These benefits on the well being of human suggests that making an initiative of more sports facilities will prove boon for the society.",
        "However, some individuals are not interested in engaging in games and other measures like free medical camps would be needed. Different kind of health checkup and consultation from physical experts is required, which motivate them to lead an active life and unleash their potential. For example, a working professional, who is busy in his office gets tired after whole day of active life and would not like to play, so in this case having an interaction with experts would help him to identify the gaps in his health. Nonetheless, to bridge these gaps he needs to be more active and having a sports centre would be of great help.",
        "To sum up, although some individuals might not be interested to play, having a sport facility at nearby place would motivate them. In my opinion, increasing such arrangements would support in the physical and mental well being of common people."
