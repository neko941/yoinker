        "The trend of studying abroad is getting popular. More and more students are going overseas for higher studies. This essay will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of studying in a foreign country.",
        "Firstly, the main advantage of studying abroad is that, you are learning in the best institute and get the chance to learn from the top faculty moreover, you are exposed to the latest researches and trends of your area of study. Another very important benefit associated with it is, that students are exposed to different cultures and get the chance to meet and interact with people from different cultures, religions and ethnic backgrounds. Which makes them learn important life skills and the become more acceptant of people from other cultures. Studying abroad gives you an edge of learning from the best of the field and also to interact with people from other parts of globe.",
        "There are some disadvantages to when you go to attend universities away from home. One feels home sick since, frequent travelling back home is not feasible option both in terms of time and money. Secondly, one doesn\u2019t get familiar with the local trends and aspects of the subject. For example, if one chooses to study in foreign university but later intent to work in their own country they might miss how things are done locally or what work approach is followed. Learning away from home makes you miss home and family.",
        "To conclude, I would say more people are opting   to take their final degree from abroad. There are some negatives like being away from home as compared to the positives that you get to learn from the top people of the field and learn about cultural diversities, which definaitely overshadows the negatives."
