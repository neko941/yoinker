        "Animal experiments are widely used to develop new medicines and to test the safety of other products. Some people argue that these experiments should be banned because it is morally wrong to cause animals to suffer, while others are favor of them because of their benefits to humanity.",
        "Every year, millions of animals feel painful suffering and death because of scientific research for drugs and cosmetic products. Thousands of people are saved from painful diseases and death because of the powerful medical drugs and treatments. This incredible gift of medicine would not be possible without animal testing. Scientists practice new techniques such as organ transplant on animals. If they don\u2019t test on animals, many products or drugs will be extremely unsafe. Moreover, many lifesaving drugs were invented in this way and may help to find more cure in the future. Consequently, there would not be any more death as well as fear of the diseases like Cancer and AIDS.",
        "However, animal experiments are unkind behavior and it causes animals a lot of pain. Many tests are not really important such as cosmetics, shampoos, soaps and other cleaning products. Furthermore, sometime an experiment on animal gives us the wrong result because animals are not exactly the same as human being. As a result, this testing may not be providing the safety products. Moreover, it is not needs to be tested on animals, especially with the huge database of knowledge and modern computer models.",
        "To sum up, there is no better way of alternative on animal experiment. Human beings are always more important than animals. However, we must make sure that millions of animals who are used for testing new products are treated with minimum suffering. Furthermore, testing should be avoided for cosmetic products."
