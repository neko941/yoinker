        "These days, an internet has become more popular and most people are using day to day for many purpose and they can get news from the digital portal instead of newspaper as a result, the newspaper is less popular among society. I strongly agree with this statement for the following reasons.",
        "To begin with, the digital news portal can give an instant information to around the world and we can use by electronic devices such as mobiles and laptops. For example, in this pandemic situation we cannot go outside while we can know about the world information through an online data portal. Moreover, this innovation can help to people are able to obtain data from anywhere and anytime. In other words, most office-goers obtain  an information after they finish work especialy at night time.",
        "Furthermore, the magazine price is extra as compared an internet. The internet gives more information with free and we can use many digital portal whether we get accurate data. For example, many online news portal has been starting for the last one decade due to most folks cannot prefer to read traditional method of getting news. To be more precise, an online platform provides up-to-date data to the population.",
        "To conclude, certainly, newspaper is popular although, nowadays an internet access gives more convenient and comfortable to watch rather than traditional one. Therefore, I strongly agree with this phenomenon. I hope this trend is conducive for the next generation."
