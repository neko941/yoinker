        "Nowdays, the world economical growth is steadily increasing, which makes the people to consume all their basic and luxurious needs. People are not thinking to spend limited money on purchasing, when compared to past. I largely agree that the individauls are maximizing their cash flow in unneccesary items.",
        "Firstly, the cash flow in our society is inundate, this makes individuals not to think money is important as compared to buy things in cosmetic,fashinable items etc,. For instance,  people buy more dresses when there is an offer in the clothing shops, eventhough the suffiecient dresses are obtain.Actually, this makes people over the moon when  pass time with their family, but they are not understanding money is the only way to enjoy our pastime.",
        "Secondly, the present generation are not educating their children that money is the vitual part in our lifecycle. For instance, in olden days, the parents getting their children to work after they finishing the day-to-day school. These make past people to value the money and spends on essential items. Furthurmore, the present society has compare among themselves in the form of statue. Individuals assume that society calculates each other with the statue what they have obtained. To want a position in the society, they started to purchase the luxuious and unrequired items to live a posh lifestyle. This make the mindset of the people to feel money is less impaortant.",
        "To conclude, the individuals should know the vitual role of  money in the society. When the people starts to manage the cashflow, they can live the life more happily than what there are presently."
