        "Technology has greatly provided us with immense comfort level when it comes to transport. People these days easily commute in cars, buses, trains and airplanes. Majority of them use personal cars as it\u2019s a safe and secure means of transport with privacy. However, the increase of vehicles is contributing to increased traffic on roads and the toxic gases released in air due to jets are causing a rise in air pollution which is a cause of major concern.",
        "It is thought by some that traffic and pollution problem can be controlled by raising the price of petrol. As the price will be increased, people will not go out frequently and that will limit the number of cars being used. Moreover, people will be encouraged to use the public transport.",
        "On the other hand, increasing price will add another added expense for those people who live in cities where public transport is limited, as they will have no choice but to use their own cars.",
        "In my opinion, it is government\u2019s responsibility to control the growing traffic and pollution problems by making sure there are enough public transport facilities available and the fares are reasonable for people commuting daily. Introduce a law that restricts the numbers of  vehicles on roads during peak hours and weekends. For commuting in neighborhood, encourage people to walk or ride in their cycles. Moreover, the risk of accidents on roads will be reduced aswell.",
        "In conclusion, citizens should also take part in tackling with increasing road congestion by following alternative ways the government has provided with. By being good members of society these issues can be combated."
