        "Imposing a ban or a curfew always feels terrible to every individual if it restricts their freedom. Some people might be in favour of not letting teenagers alone out of their houses at night in certain areas of US due to safety reasons. But I am not in favour of keeping children inside and hampering their growth.",
        "Since there are some parts of every country which are unsafe for teenagers at night, they are not allowed to move outside their buildings. Illegal activities, pubs and bars, drugs, prostitution comprises some of the major reasons behind the curfews. These activities can misguide the teenagers and can lead to addiction and serious health issues if they come/fall under bad influence. As teenagers are the future of any nation, they should always be shown the right path.",
        "According to me, if these issues are given serious consideration by the higher authorities, there would be no need of banning anyone to see the world, be it day or night. With due diligence and care, police can easily identify people conducting illegal activities and put them behind the bars. Also, residents of the community can make different groups to give moral values to the children so that they themselves are aware with whom they should befriend with.",
        "To conclude, I would like to stress  upon the importance of giving freedom to teenagers. These are the crucial years where they can enjoy their lives and should be given a solid foundation on choosing their friends for the same. This can be achieved with the help of police, strong law system and government of the country."
