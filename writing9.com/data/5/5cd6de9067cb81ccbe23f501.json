        "Being a good parent is a much needed quality which every individual must posses. This skill should be developed in a person in his childhood and, schools could contribute to enhance this ability. In this essay, I share my thoughts about engaging schools to teach kids about parenting.",
        "In my opinion, children spend a large time of their day in school. \"How to be come a good parent?\" is something that schools can emphasise in their curiculam just like any other subject like history or science. In a class, students could get a variety of opinions from thier peers and teachers on how a parent would react to a particular situation. This helps the child get exposure to a different behaviorial aspects and, this will assist to make a right decission for his younger one in future. Parenting also requires sacrifices done to make a wish come true. Educational insititutions have many pupils and, with each sharing their experiences with one another facilitates an understanding of how a mother or father sacrifice for their child.",
        "A good parent, in my view a person who provides all best possible to thier child. Some of the key skills a good parent must have is the patience, ability to 'let go', able to explain difference between right and wrong. Every person needs to be extremely calm with their young one, they should avoid being angry on them frequently and patiently explain the effects of any action. There will be times where in the baby will just understand the idea or concept that is being explained and repeat the same actions over and over again. A \"good parent\" in a composed manner should keep trying to make the kid understand the consequences of the actions. Apart having patience, one must also have quality to give up their desires. An individual must put the wishes of their children as top priority and if the situation permits they could fulfill their own wish. As example, on a given weekend your child could make a request to watch a football game, while you may have made plans to play golf; giving up to the request of your child would be right decission. This brings a smile on his or her face and makes you a role model for them.",
        "My conclusion is, parenting is needs is a mix of soft skills which are required to for every man or woman. Institutes like school, colleges, etc. where a lot of time is spent in the early years of life and, if pareting skills are embedded early days it helps an individual to be a good person."
