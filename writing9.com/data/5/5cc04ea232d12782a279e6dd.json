        "Most of the country's Population have been increasing year after year. Moreover, there has been an ennumerous increase in the number of houses because of the increase in population. Due to the lack of space for new building, people choose countryside to furnish their dream house. Some of the people who are very nostalgic choose those types of places for their homes. Some people argue that, protection of countryside is very important and don't allow to build homes in country side.",
        "First and foremost thing is that, countryside is a beautiful place and low population . People choose these types of places to settle in their future life . Countryside is a place with beautiful sceneries, environment ,low on pollution, etc. People who love nature choose Places with lots of trees, flowers etc.Some research  Students found that people who are after Retirement age like to keep pets and grow agricultural plants , choose countryside because they need quiet calm and peaceful place for their future life. The fack is that, life in peaceful countryside increases positivity and reduce depression.",
        "Conversely,it is true that ,countrysides are precious one and we should protect the beauty from people who are careless. For Example, Munnar is one of the famous countrysides in kerala and the visitors keep the place untidy and they throw plastic bottle and waste on the roads and mountains. As a result  tourism in the place will be declined. The reason behind people argue about the stay in countryside is that messy dealings. This may decrease the cultivation of agriculture and farm activities . Some people build big apartments in the countryside may cause some natural calamilies .",
        "To Sum Up, building in a countryside is an attractive one but people are  careless about their activities.Some people who love nature protect environment and they tried to build   eco friendly house that are not harmful to the nature . In my opinion , nature should be a protected one and cities with low space for building new home can give sanction after agree some rule related to the nature protection."
