        "Hardly can anybody that education plays important role in developing prosperous society . Progressive education , to be more specific, is one of main factors thriving country . Besides , there is  arising controversy that whether children should have their code of behavior or be able to do everything as they will . From my perspective , i strongly agree that releasing behavior code is the suitable method for cultivating children . However , i also believe that , it is origin of various ngative effects . In the following essay, i shall put my effort to explain this issue",
        "On the one hand, children is should set a range of code of behavior . More details , it could does wonder for youngster generation becoming more responsibility and maturity . Thanks to these rules , children could learn how to separate truth and wrong acts and then , preventing from falling behaviors  as insolent gesture or bad words . If child does not have these rules of behavior . they would go far away from the controllable region of the parent",
        "On the other hand, i am convinced that forcing strictly children obey these rules , which does not mean that it could bring a good result . Hence psychology of children is still immature and naive , they have an intensive to do the opposite trend in comparison with something they are told . Furthermore , the youngster generation should have their freedom right , creating discipline could limit the successful possibility of children . Specifically , by living as their wish , creativity and sense of discovery in children could boost completely .As a result , it could become an ideal beginning stage to accomplish success in the future for children",
        "In short , enacting many behavior codes might be an efficient way to educate children . Beside that , it is still hidden various disadvantages"
