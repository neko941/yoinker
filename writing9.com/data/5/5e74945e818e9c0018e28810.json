        "Due to globalisation, English has become dominating language.  Therefore, schools prefer to teach English in comparison to teaching native languages. Owing to this preference, many local languages are on the verge of extinction. This essay will discuss the importance of learning English and ensuring survival of local languages along with my opinion on this issue in the upcoming paragraphs.",
        "To commence with, learning English is indispensable for individuals for several reasons. First and foremost, it helps in eliminating language barrier. To elaborate this, if everyone understands a particular language, they can communicate with each other conveniently. In other words, exchange of ideas without misunderstanding its meaning is  possible. Another main reason is enhance the knowledge of people. When they learn a new language, they get exposed to different culture which can be beneficial for them in various ways. For instance, businessmen can expand their business overseas by altering their products as per culture of another nations.",
        "Inspite of merits of learning English, survival of local languages is also equally important as these languages are identity of different countries. For protecting these languages, government should made teaching of native languages compulsory in schools and universities. In addition to that, regional languages must be given importance on the same level of English so that person do not feel embarrassed in speaking these languages. Apart from this, parents must encourage their children to learn and speak their local languages.",
        "To conclude, it is my opinion that although learning English for everyone is essential to reduce obstacles pertain to different languages, preventing local languages from dying out is necessary to preserve diversity in world."
