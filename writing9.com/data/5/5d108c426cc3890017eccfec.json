        "We as humans are always keen on knowing what is happening in our surroundings. Although, there are newspapers and news channels on the TV which do a fantastic job of potraiting this, however its without a doubt incomplete without pictures. In my opinion a picture speaks a thousand words and in the below essay I will try to justify the same.",
        "The photos have great impact on humans, Firstly it is really easy to understand additionally, there is no effort needed if compared to reading the articles in the newspaper. Pictures are also used as it requires less space for instance, there are only 16 pages in the newspaper and if there is too much information the only way is to concise it. Photos are a great way to do this.",
        "Television is a common household item and, is owned by almost everyone around the globe. The news on TV is a bit different as it may not only have pictures, but also videos. The people watch these shows out of curiosity and the messages can be informed in short time and to a wide spectrum of people. For example, it was found that channels which have pictures had 34% higher TRP ratings to the channels which do not.",
        "In conclusion, I would certainly agree in that images have a greater impact than a article which is printed in black and white. Its is a better mode of spreading information compared to writing."
