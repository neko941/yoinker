        "Some would argue that, it is a healthy sign as government is financing artists. While other says this money could have been used on other projects. Although, an artist need financial help in the initial stage of their career. However, I belive that there are other departments which state need to give priorities such as health care.",
        "On the one hand, some say, in early stage of any artist needs funds to master in their respective art field and showcase their talent. At young age to learn all crafts of movie making is only possible to attend international film schools and it is every expensive for a middle class person. For example, An Indian film director SS Raja mouli, who went on to win four national awards for his best movies. His dream to became film director fulfilled only because, he got financial help from the state government to study in New York film academy in the initial years of his career. However, I believe that art does not solve major problems of our society. Government should start invest more in health care which can be beneficial for evevryone.",
        "On the other hand, Government first invests more in health care sector which is very important because. In every country diabetes is the major health problem. If state funds for diabetic research it will solve entire country\u2019s problem. For example, in India many decades ago, new born babies were suffering from vitamin deficiency which was very severer and babies were dying. Then Indian government deceded and made a huge investment in the Polio research, after few years this problem got solved completely and new babies were taking birth healthy.",
        "To conclude, Istrongly belive Government should first invest in the mojor problems of the societ like health care and then invests on artists."
