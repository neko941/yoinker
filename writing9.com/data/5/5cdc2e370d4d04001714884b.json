        "For many people, working for big co-operations or worldwide companies is always a great chance for their life while someone does not think so. They decide to open their own companies or exactly, to be a self-employed. In this essay, I will give the reasons why and the drawbacks of this phenomenon.",
        "Firstly, it is clear that today, the multinational companies or well-known groups is not the only destination which can help people have well-paid jobs anymore. The development of technology support people seeking out their opportunities on the Internet easily than ever. Therefore, they can work from home and choose their favorite jobs, deal their salaries with partners. Moreover, they do not need to commute to offices and facing with a variety of issues such as traffic jam at rush hours, the increase of petrol price. One more reason people choose this job because they can work with flexible time and for someone, who love working alone they will avoid many seriously conflict.",
        "On the other hand, there are still many disadvantages when you want to be a self-employed instead of working for a company. Obviously, working alone means that you could not communicate or discuss your problems with others and also can not expand your friend circle. Therefore, you will not receive the supportance from other people. What is more, when you decide to be a self-employed you could struggle with many difficulties which you can solve more easier when learn from the experiences of seniors.",
        "In conclusion, working for a big co-operation or a company is always the best experiences for each person, while there are still more and more people want to work alone by themselves to suitable with their personalities."
