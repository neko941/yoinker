        "There are a few countries where a chunk of people earns more than others. Some citizens feel that it is beneficial for the country while others believe that the government should normalize the salary structure and no one should be allowed to earn more than a threshold amount. I fully concur with the viewpoint that people are allowed to earn as much as they can, provided, the means of earning money are legal.",
        "Money is the most important aspect of life and everybody wants to get the abundance amount of it. So people generally work hard to earn more. High wages is one of the motivating factors among the youth to work diligently. Which in turn give rise to competition as the one who is adding more efforts will be at a higher designation than others and will be drawing more salary. This will excel the economic growth of the country and everyone will be living happily as they are getting paid as per the amount of work they are managing.",
        "On the other hand, if people are not paid adequately based on their endeavours, they might lose their enthusiasm. Also limiting the amount that one can earn can lead to the feeling of getting exploited. As the employee might think that he is not getting rewarded based on pressure that one is handling.",
        "To recapitulate, the government should not put bars on the salaries of employees instead everyone should be paid based on their abilities. This will lead to economic growth and building a nation with prosperous citizens."
