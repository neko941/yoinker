        "When we talk about student\u2019s overall growth, It does not only include their growth in regular studies, we also determine how active and functioning they are in extra- curricular activities. These non academic activities play crucial role in student\u2019s development. As we know not all students are good at studying, instead they have many hidden talents which can be exposed by asking them to participate in such programs. I am fully in a favour of fact that extra-curriculars are important in a student\u2019s life.",
        "Encouraging school children to get involved in various exercises will aid them to improve on various factors such as confidence, personality development, stamina and cognitive functions. It is highly exceptional because we have examples like Sachin Tendulkar who is legendary figure in cricket. His biopic has clearly made us understand how his parents were so supportive for his playing hobby and they pushed him for coaching.",
        "I feel being book worm should not be the only option. To face this competitive world one should always go beyond his/her limits and showcase their interest in such programs where they can feel motivated and confident and can actively participate in extra classroom activities. Students can themselves identify their own strengths and weakness and work on them accordingly. In this way they can give a try for unique careers. They can seek what they really want and become successful also most importantly they can be happy.",
        "In conclusion, it is very important to keep an extra-curricular should be a part of the academics for better involvement and motivates children to be regular to school."
