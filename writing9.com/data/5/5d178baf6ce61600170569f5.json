        "Globalization is on the trend these days, exporting and importing goods from others have become important for all countries. This essay will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of transporting goods for a long distance including the daily basics.",
        "Increased global economy has made importing and exporting of goods very easy.  There are mainly two primary reasons why this is advantageous for us. Firstly, this has created an environment where everything is easily available for everyone everywhere. For example, cloth brands that were previously only limited to a country are available everywhere now. Anyone who likes to wear that particluar brand can buy it mostly in any country. Secondly, globalization has created a lot of job opportunities for people. There are a lot of jobs involved in transporting goods from one country to another. Indeed, in a recent survey by Oxford university, 40% of jobs has been created worldwide because of import and export. And due to these advantages globalization is on the rise these days.",
        "Incresed global economy can also lead to some negative impacts on a countries economy. Firstly, it will impact the local farmers and local businesses a lot. For instance, people will stop buying local brands once they get aware of any international brand easily available near them. This will end up in loss for local businesses. Secondly, there will be a lot of dependency on other nations. For example, any product that was previously manufactured locally, would have stopped their production due to loss. And now if import of this product stops than the product will no longer be available in the country. So, globalization has also killed many jobs and created dependency on other countries.",
        "In conclusion, advantages of global economy does not overweigh the disadvantages. This essay discussed the postive and negative aspects of globalization on a countries economy."
