        "The multi-line graph reveals clear data about the yearly revenue of three bakeries in London over the covered period of the graph.In general, what stands out from the graph is that there were considerable upward trends in the income of both Sofia and Cake Lab, while the earnings of Buns saw a substantial fall in the time period in question.",
        "In terms of Sofia's production, sale recorded a more firm stability over the first 5 years about 58.000, simultaneously Cake Lab's income reached an enormous growth nearly 60.000, after being fallen in the beginning couple years respectively. However, in the rest of the period, both trends saw rocketing in sales. The Sofia gained extraordinary popularity and sharply boosted in profit in next per years by almost 40.000, at 100.000. Comparing to Cake Lab, levelling out, followed by a steep climb in the rate of profit from 40.000 to roughly 60.000.",
        "Regarding to Buns, in initial time was dominated by annual income nearly 80.000, to compare with Cake Lab's income was more quadruple and with difference 20.000 in Sofia. However, the trend sharply went down over the years. Between 2000 and 2005 there was a huge lost by 25% of the revenue, also what happened in the last 5 years with Buns business, recording almost 37.000."
