        "With the advancement of technologies such as internet and smart mobile phones interaction of people have changed immensely. Tools such as Facebook, WhatsApp and Skype have brought people close to each other unlike in the past. This essay will describe the closeness of the family members as and advantage while children falling prey to sexual predators on the internet as a downfall of the advancement of technology.",
        "In some families, responsibilities of parents such as employment and commitments of children such as education have forced them to be living in different geographycal locations. But, thanks to today's technologies they can still be close to each other via smart mobile phones. For example, I know a family where father is in a European country doing a job for last 20 years and the family, wife and four girls are living in Sri Lanka. Eearlier they had to wait for weeks to send and receive mails but now they speak to each other, when ever they want using Iphones.",
        "However, earlier for a person to interact with another person they mostly had to physically meet. Especially to convince someone into a relationship people had to meet several times. But now with tools such as Facebook, Skype and WhatsApp never need to meet to affirm a relationship. Sexual predators who are behind children make use of these tools to make them fall prey and then, abuse them, when they are convinced to meet them. A recent Newspaper article revealed that twenty percent of the recent child abuse cases were originated from a famously used social media application for smart mobile phones.",
        "In conclusion, when there are advancement of technology, there can be advantages such as bringing families together and disadvantages such as children falling prey to sexual predators. So as people we should be aware of these both sides and try to use only for the good of it."
