        "There is an increasing migration from rural agricultural areas to cities in search for jobs. As a result, urban areas are becoming overcrowded and the social fabric of the villages are under threat. This problem may be solved by improving infrastructure  in villages and implementing agricultural reforms.",
        "Most villagers are engaged in agriculture which has over the years become less productive and profitable. The resulting urban migration has resulted in many deleterious consequences on the urban landscape. Major cities like Mumbai are overcrowded with slums and poor infrastructure plagueing development. On the other hand, agragarian and village communities no longer have the social cohesiveness as most members have become migrants. For instance, many men from my village are already gone to cities which has led to family discord and unhappiness among children.",
        "The problem can be addressed if factors are identified which are driving this movement of people. Poor employment and education facilities seems to be the prime motivation behind shifting to cities. If there is a larger investment in agriculture, which is the major occupation of village dwellers, the need for migration is expected to reduce. Furthermore, agricultural practices need to be modified to yield better crop and profit so that there is no need to travel somewhere else. In fact, when rural employment scheme was introduced in my village, many migrants returned back as they had a better life in village than in towns and cities.",
        "To conclude, growing migration from villages to cities is a major concern as it leads to concerns in both regions. Improving employment and educational facilities and encouraging modern agricultural methods can solve the issue to a certain extent."
