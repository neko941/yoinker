        "In modern times, due to the advancement of technology, people can grasp information and news much easier than in the past. In other words, children also having more chances to see news about gossip about celebrities, which may cause some negative effects to them. In my point of view, despite the various controversy had emerged with this statement, I still consider these media coverages will bring negative effect to children.",
        "One of the primary reasons is that the images from medias may mislead children behavior. Since these stars are their idols, youngsters usually fall into a myth believing all behavior their idols have done are absolutely right. For instance, if some celebrities are succumbed to drugs or alcohol, it is easily for children to mimic such behavior which is fascinating for them. Once adolescents try those negative habits, such habits may lead them to the wrong way in the future.",
        "Admittedly, it might claim that those famous stars can bring children a bright expectation for future. However, there is high possibility that these fragments of news only distort children\u2019s value rather than helping them to explore their careers. Medias nowadays are filled with fake news, children value might still not be mature to have ability to tell the things from right or wrong. They might have an unrealistic expectation for their further careers and eager to seek fame and wealth.",
        "In conclusion, the coverage from medias had already brought negative consequence to younger generation. These lead children to have distorted value in behavior and career. Despite the enormous sources of medias are difficult to restrict their audiences, still, it is a serious problem that should be more valued in the future."
