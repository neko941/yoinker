        "At a very young age, children learn by imitating adults' behaviour or things around them. However, they do not have the ability to distinguish which is right or wrong. To help kids learn the differences, punishment is one of effective ways for parents and teacher. However, it is controversial that this method would negatively affect the children. In my opinion, punishment is an useful method for education as long as it does not badly affect the children physically and mentally.",
        "To begin with, using rod, scolding or detention are common punishment of parents and teachers when their children badly behaved. These punishment would not help the children learn from their mistakes but have negative impact on children physically and mentally instead. When parents hit their children, the children feel hurt and have scars. Frequently, their emotion which is vulnerable tends to be insensitive. Moreover, these children who are often physically punished by adults are more likely to become a violent figure when they grow up.",
        "Hence, punishment without physical and mental harm is more effective. If a child behave badly, parents and teachers should gently explain how wrong the behaviour is instead of criticizing or hitting him/ her. To help the child remember his/ her mistake,  parents and teachers can ban the child from that bad habit or a hobby of him/ her instead. As an instance, when the child use his/ her phone in a long period of time, which negatively impact the eyes, parents may consider punish them by taking their phone away for several days. As a result, he/ she would understand why he/ she ought not to behave that way and form his/ her morality positively.",
        "In conclusion, punishment is essential to educate children how to differentiate good and bad things. However, physically and mentally harmful punishment have to be avoided."
