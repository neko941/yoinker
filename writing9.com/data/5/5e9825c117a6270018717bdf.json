        "For the past few decades, a significant change in climatic conditions was noticed on planet Earth. This modifications are due to global warming, which is has become a considerable problem affecting all inhabitants of the world. This essay will analyse the root causes of global warming and suggest solution to handle this issue.",
        "",
        "The main causes of global warming are due to human activities such as deforestation, building factories, driving more cars and etc.  and these all lead to the production of gases and hence rising in global temperature. Countries are becoming more industrialised and are dumping waste into the atmosphere without realising its harmful effects and severity of the issue. Moreover, exhaust fumes produced by factories and vehicles, released into atmosphere and changes its composition, so that instead of reflecting heat, the atmosphere absorbs it. In addition, deforestation reverses the effects of carbon sequestration and releases greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Furthermore, deforestation changes the landscape and reflectivity of earth's surface.",
        "In order to overcome this issue, both government and civilians must take part in solving it. Government must reduce the use of transport among the population and encourage cycling by introduction of tax. On the other hand, authorities can invest to alternative sources of energy by encouraging the transition to electric vehicles in every possible way. Putting filters on the exhaust pipes of factories and conduction of gas heating in all houses can tackle the problem with emissions. Each individual can make a small contribution to solving this global problem by having responsible behavior. People could use more cycling and plant trees to reduce the effects of global warming.",
        "To conclude, global warming poses a serious threat to humanity, wildlife and ecosystem of the planet. Governments and civilians both share equal responsibility to overcome this issue and make planet Earth safer."
