        "Offences are a much-discussed problem because there is an observed increasing, especially among adolescents. The origins of this situation seem to stem from two main factors, while several remedies appear to be open to us.",
        "Perhaps the major factor here is the multimedia platforms. In other words, the absence of media censorship, induce youngsters to commit some crimes. For example, many pornographic materials and excessive violence scenes are existed freely which make people copy what they watch blindly. Another cause is the increasing cost of living in many countries and increase the poverty in a less affluent states. This may leads to increase the illiteracy, ignorance and eventually the unemployment rate, which consider the main induction to take action to rectify their situation by offence.",
        "Turning to possible measures, an obvious step would be taken to control browsing the Internet. For example, parents can use blocking service to block the undesirable websites, if they took this step, it would greatly enhance the access just to useful web pages. Another remedy might be the parents and school fill the free time of younger people by sport activities and social works, Such as, taking part in sport competitions or specify some time to communication between a family members. Finally, volunteering in a community charity may ameliorate the situation and lessen the probability of crimes. For example, in some countries, such as France, working unpaid work is appealing to employers so it will increase the opportunities of getting employed immediately. If such requirement to work were available, it would encourage adolescents to focus on such work rather than being offenders.",
        "Overall, it would be logical to conclude that the factors of the Internet availability without controlling and the poverty appear to be the main causes. A coordinated response by individuals, institutions and employers may well lessen the severity of situation."
