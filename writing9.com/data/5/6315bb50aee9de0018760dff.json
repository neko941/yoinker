        "Nowadays, pollution levels have risen in many cities around the word and some cities becoming more polluted than other. In this essay I will explain the cases and effects with the relevent examples.",
        "Firstly, why some cities are more polluted than other? I suppose that main reason is the high level of population for an instance, in japan they can't bear the country population and government made strict rules and regulation to decrease population. I am sure that high population cause to risen world pollution and it made lot of wastage. Secondly I believe the cause of this fact is lot of construction and manufacturing companies run in the urban areas and they get use to natural resource and some companies use in appropriate methods to out of their wastage and garbage. A lot of centres enhance to develop their main facilities without using the environmental resources.This paragraph with highlight the urban areas and main causes of this trend.",
        "The possible effects of this causes include health problem and global warming. Also it definitly effects to the natural resource Because high level of future consumption. For an example according to the reason reseach conducted by university of Colombo, they assume world will be vanishing after 10000 years\u2019 consequence of the over pollution. Pollution also effect to the environmental problem such as damage of ozone.",
        "to sum up, pollution is a big problem and some cities are becoming more polluted than other. It manly cause by high population, construction and manufacturing companies and mainly effect to the health problems, global warming and future consumption."
