        "Advertisements are important means through which most production companies market their goods.Certain parents believe that they are misleading,while the owners said they are knowledgeable. In my opinion, some adverts are beneficial, but others could be misguiding.",
        "One good reason why some adverts are believed to be misdirecting,especially to youngsters,is because they are minors and are motivated majorly by what they see or hear, and thus, may not be able to differentiate good from bad. In other words, they are attracted by what is happening around them without considering the consequences or outcome. For instance, in advertising indomie noodles, the presenters portrayed super intelligence and smartness after consumption, and this singular act attracted my children, whom till date refused to eat other products.",
        "Furthermore, these adults believe that most of these factories do not care about positive achievements from the viewers/listeners, but rather are so much interested on their sales and income generated from their goods. For instance, one of the brewery industry in Ogun State,Nigeria, was closed down  last year because of non-factual nutrients outlined on their food pack, and their environment being so unhealthy for consumable goods.",
        "On the other hand, many displays and write-ups can be seen to be advantageous in terms of impacting knowledge to the young ones. For example, by watching the presentation and the dance steps on television, a child could learn how to dance. This also applies to reading posters or sign posts, and by constant viewing leads to memorization  and learning of different words.",
        "In conclusion, despite the  misdirecting effects marketing of many items may cause to some juveniles, there are certain advantages such as, enlightenment."
