        "Today, an issue attracting the public attention is that children spend less time playing with their peers. Notably, this practice has become popular in many parts of the world including developing countries and developed ones. In this essay, the reasons leading to the above matter as well as its effects will be discussed in detail.",
        "From what I read in the news, there have been some several causes resulting in the problem above. For one thing, in today's society the majority of children have to spend most of their time on learning, for instance, computer skills and foreign languages in order that they can find a good job in the future; in other words, the pressure of learning has prevented them form participating in outside activities with their friends. For another thing, tha attraction of TV programs and computer game is referred to as the agent contributing to lack of social communication among these young citizens. What is more, parents feel unsafe if their kids hang out without adults, especially when children are always the aim of the kidnappers.",
        "It is indicated that some negative effects resulting from the above practice should be taken into account. More clearly, children cannot have properly physical and mental development once they are not give opportunities to take part in outdoor activities with their friends instead of studing; more seriously, they have the high risks of getting psychological disorders because of their isolated life. Another negative aspect is that the young generation will not get realistic knowledge and experiences in life in case they only work with computers and share information via social networks.",
        "To sum up, parents are clearly accountable for the rise in their children's passive and unsociable lifestyle. However, my belief is thay the above problem could be melted soon if there have been great efforys from both parents and governments."
