        "A number of high school juniors in numerous countries would like to take a gap year either to travel or work before to attend university courses.",
        "Majority of pupils in high school prefer to go abroad to have a year off instead of passing directly from school to university is rather restricted in terms of general knowledge and experience of the world. Those who have spent earning work experience and traveling and I brought can give them a more vivid life, that is to say, people will have understanding the crucial factors of life. Moreover, it might also be a favourable reason to be independent so as to make quality life goals as well as coping with the challenges of student life. That trend has been becoming the major activity in all European countries such as in the UK 50% of high school finishers took benefits of having a year off in 2018 and 2019.",
        "On the other hand, to have a break from academic life, young people may end up never returning to their studies or finding it difficult readapt to an academic environment. Besides, taking a year off and in other places maybe high-priced as well as requires tons of extra planning, whilst without having required money or careful schedule, people might not get much out of taking a gap year. Due to the tremendous number of destitute positions those Chinese students are undergoing, there are only 5% of students can afford to pay have a gap year in overseas.",
        "In conclusion, young personalities should be encouraged to broaden that horizons. That is best way for them to get it clear perspectives of what they are hoping to do with their lives."
