        "It is believed that spending governmental money on arts is useless as it could be spent on others country\u2019s issues. I disagree to this statement due to the fact that art plays a key role in the society, culture and moreover in international tourism worldwide and I will explain the main concepts of this vision.",
        "Since the first development of humanity, art has been vital, in fact the first trace of human presence was discovered by some paintings in many caves in Europe. Through art, we can understand and study the development of humanity since their origins to nowadays. There are several national museums of international importance which preserve these importance testimonies of history and human vision of the world, furthermore also architectural buildings that have been declared hierarchy of UNESCO. Tourists came from all over the world to see these art representations and to illustrate one, the Louvre Museum is one the main attraction of France. Hence, art is one of the main reasons of tourism all over the world: Italy, as well as other European countries are clear examples.",
        "However, I believe that governmental funds cannot respond to many issues of the society. Many people suffer from poverty and there is no guarantee of a good quality life. I believe that our countries should focus their efforts and resources by providing them basic needs. Thus, by thinking that art is one of the main income of a country, it can be helpful to provide this requirements to national inhabitants.",
        "To conclude, I believe that invert at national level in art benefits both residents and tourists at international level because it meets both needs."
