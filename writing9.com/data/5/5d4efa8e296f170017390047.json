        "Modern science and new inventions have been impacting our lives so profoundly that the result of the former one has vividly altered our generation\u2019s lifestyle in comparison with our ancestors.However, some people still urge that not only most of scientific inventions and discoveries are not constructive but also supporting them squanders time and a great deal of money. Of course, I take issue with this view and also believe innovation has brought us tremendous benefits which are impossible to be overlooked.",
        "To some people allotting big budgets to projects which fail at very first step seems like a big vain effort and it is not acceptable to them.It is understandable that low success rate of innovations can question the amount of money being spent,however it worth to take the leap and risk for the result at the end.These experiments and research may not seem practical at first but the result will shine later. Many of them will become the fundamental of numerous afterward achievements.For instance NASA had failed in mars probing mission which was the biggest cosmo project of this contemporary era until two years ago scientists kept on researching and they have made some alternations and modifications on previous datas which had disappointed them before. Shortly after that they successfully launched the spacecraft carrying robot to the mars planet.This discovery led to the existence of water on this planet which is an important discovery.",
        "As we go forward in the 21st century we observe that human being\u2019s life pattern has evolved rapidly since decades ago.",
        "Agricultural and then industrial revolution are the grand children of the technology which is the biggest achievement of various scientific inventions in addition to that even our mind set has altered due to that evolutionary changes.Also another crucial thing that we should bear in mind is the life_expectancy,our ancestors used to live an average period of approximately 35 to 45 years of age. If they had been lucky and also had not been hunted by predators,they would have died because of infections and thereof.But now thanks to antibiotics and medicine our immune system does not fail so easily.This evidences are so obvious that we cannot neglect the impact of scientific research in various ways the result of it has become an indispensable part of our routine life.",
        "In conclusion, lots of great minds have gathered to make this inventions beneficial and also functional this is the reason why it requires a huge amount of time and money.In my opinion the benefits outweigh the negative aspects of the discoveries. We all owe the life which we dwell to these scientific inventions and most of them worth the time that they take and also money resources ."
