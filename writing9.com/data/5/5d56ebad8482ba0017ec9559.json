        "The world is now considered a global village with the help of the internet as it avails us with more than enough data. Although it is quite acceptable to some people to take the increased access to information as a positive development, yet it is out of question for others. In my opinion, I strongly agree that the increased access to information provided by the internet is quite commendable, and in the following paragraphs I will give reasons to support this statement.",
        "One reason why I am in support of the increased data provided by the internet is because the internet enables us to access such information at a reduced costs. Worthy of note is that this information provided by the internet is readily available, yet at a reduced costs. For example, a recent survey by the University of Nigeria on sources of information for a research work shows that the internet provides the information and data required for a project at a reduced costs.",
        "Another reason why I am of the opinion that the increased information we receive from the internet is a good thing is that it aids better decision making process. Business consultants are able to decide on a potential deal in a split second by accessing the internet.",
        "To sum up, while some people might conclude that the increased information we receive from the internet is a bad thing, in my opinion, the increased access to data should be commendable because the internet provides such data at a reduced costs, and it aids better decision making process."
