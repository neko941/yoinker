        "Nowadays, many migration processes can be seen around the world. As a consequence of those processes, you can see children from different cultures interacting in the same school. It is agreed that these mixtures of cultures, as well as skills, bring benefits to the students. As we will explain below, the improvement of the learning experiences and the development of soft skills, are some of the benefits that can be obtained from these interactions.",
        "The first consequence found was the improvement of the learning experience. For example, some schools have as their final work the development of a project to be carried out by groups of kids from the same grades but from different classrooms. In this way, students with differents types of abilities are brought together. This mix of abilities results in projects full of creativy.",
        "The second effect found was the development of soft skills in students who study in a multicultural environment. For instance, one study found that students from schools located in the boarders between countries, developed better comunication, respect and emphaty skills. The study showed that these improvements are the results of the interaction with schoolmates from other cultures. Therefore, students in school with a wide variety of social backgrounds can benefit greatly.",
        "To summarise, letting children with a wide range of abilities and from a variety of social backgrounds mix with each other at school can bring benefit to their development. If schools take adventage this mixture inteligentlly will get better results for themselves and for their students."
