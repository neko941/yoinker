        "In this era of great develpment, modern studies seem most attractive to many, but to some, history is still course of paramount interest. Although, breathroughs of science and technology has made lives largely depenedent on them, but In my opinion, history holds equally importance, as it preserves tradition and culture of any nation, both history and science studies should carry sequal weightage in school syllabus.",
        "On the one hand, technological revolutions have gone to next level to provide comfort living. from a smart phone to aero-planes, everything is bound to science.It has changed human life style to an extent that they are dependent on it. For example, to secure a job now a days, one needs to be equipped with necessary level of competence in moder studies, that is why thousands of pipil compete to get into a university to fulfil dream of better living.",
        "On the other hand, history is something that posseses realm of human life in the past, it depeicts tradition and culture of any nation, nations are known because of their historical marvels. For example, Pyramids in Egypt, archeological excavations have revealed, how these giant structed were anchored on the earth is  even not possible by the cutting edge technology of recent times.",
        "In my opinion, educational istitutes have a prime responsibility to lay down a balanced corriculom for their students, history and advance subjects both carrying equal marks",
        "In conclusion, it is an undeniable fact, technological progress is at climax and no country can prosper without having a proper work force in this arena, without the knowledge of past new generations would more like robots, who know how to work but unaware of  their cultural values."
