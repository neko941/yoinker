        "Each person will come across all the stages of life. It is believed that, when an individual becomes older, the life turns into tragedy. This is true in this recent era and I agree with this statement. This essay describes the reasons for the former view.",
        "To commence, each person will grow into old. When life began as an infant, start to crawl and slowly learn to walk and talk. They are dependent on their parents, who helps them as a support system. But, when the same individual grows as an old man, the situation becomes worse. Being old, even they need help to walk and perform certain chores. However, people are not willing to do such help. This makes the number of people is joining in the old age home. As a result, old age homes are increased nowadays when compared to the previous period. For instance, a friend of mine, who joined his grandfather in an old age home recently because he could not able to walk.",
        "Furthermore, elderly people should learn to lead their life in a healthy way in order to overcome this situation. If a person stays fit, the need of visiting the hospital is not necessary. This reduces their dependency on others. In addition to this, they feel that they were in an insecurity state. They might think, though surrounded by few peoples, but still they were not in secure stage.",
        "To conclude, each person will face a struggle in many situation, despite he is old or young. But, in old age, it is more difficult to have food or to maintain health. Based on the aforementioned reasons, when people getting older their live turn into difficult."
