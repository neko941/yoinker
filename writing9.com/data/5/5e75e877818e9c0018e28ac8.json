        "Choosing friends is a circumstance which depends on the nature or needs of person. Although some prefer to enjoy in a big company of friends, others favour having a small number of companions. Regarding number, I would state that each friendship is essential in its unique way, so I would choose either in different situations. My personal evaluation is based on the following reasons.",
        "Firstly, it is irrefutable fact that we feel far more comfortable among people who share similar interest and have mutual understanding. Needless to say, such a delicate bond can be created between limited number of friends but not many. Moreover, once we have fewer friends, it's highly possible to spend plenty of time with all of them which, in turn, enables us to connect closely and effectively. This, we may establish rather stronger and long lasting relations with limited number of acquaintances.",
        "However, we may ignore the benefits of owning a large group of friends. More often than not,by having many friends some individuals may surpass others  in terms of awareness of news and improving general outlook. For instance, social, as well as cultural, contact with friends coming from different background can significantly broaden one's horizon. Additionally, a great amount of friends in a social gathering also makes an event livelier. Hence, the chance of learning much and enjoying in memorable parties proves the essence of a big company.",
        "All in all, given the merits of both small and large group of friends, I draw the conclusion that we need both types of friendship. What I mean by this is we may build a close-knit circle containing a few with deep understanding and, meanwhile, not lose touch with those who we need for the sake of being social."
