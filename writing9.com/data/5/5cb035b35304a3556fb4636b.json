        "It is an obvious fact that financial aspect is an essential factor of day to day life. However, many people believe that schools should make accounts related subject Complusive in student's curriculum. I do not agree with this assertion and this write up will justify my viewpoint in following paragraphs using some relevant examples.",
        "Not every individual want to pursue their future education in financial studies. Everyone has their own talent and interests. Like someone want to become singer or actor or painter. For them it should not at all mandatory to learn accounts. Instead educational institutes should allow pupils to choose a subject of their choice to shape their dreams and talent. Furthermore, my making a certain subject compulsory, students may not get ample time to do other indispensable things and sports and games. This point clarify that making financial education must have subject is not worthy.",
        "On the other hand, it is true that little financial education and budgeting is necessary in daily life. Managing expenses, calculate profit loss and investment require one to have basic knowledge of accounts. However, every school has basic mathematics as a compulsory subject of students syllabus.After that, every graduate and senior secondary student can easily manage regular accounting. For instance, a software professional is able to calculate profit and loss of his regular earning. Also he can use his basic financial knowledge to do yearly investment. This scenario does not know the need of financial education at early stage of life.",
        "Concluding this, I would like to say, financial education is important but must not a Forceful subject.Everyone must have full access of what they want to learn and do in their life."
