        "In this world, where we are living today is dominated by advertisement. Different source ( Television, newpapers, streets, mobile apps ) can be used to advertise the product. The publication can provide benefits not only to the companies but also to the consumers like knowledge about the quality of product, convient and time saving for the consumer. Although, significant drawbacks cannot be ignored; promotion of artificial living and competition and in society, and confusion for the buyer in the selection of product. In the upcoming paragraphs, i will discuss both the advantages and disadvantages in detail.",
        "Advertisement is the promotion of the product and your thought; it can keep us informed about the latest product and their prices. To begin with,  it can help the consumer to know about the quality of the product, and it can help them to save time. For example, if the consumer is aware of the quality of the product , it will help them to choose and buy stuff which they need. Another attraction of advertisement is it can provide more option to the buyer. Moreover, it can help in settling business. Let's take an example of tourism, through proper promotions we can promote this in countries. Additionally, it can be used as a tool to educate lay people for social awareness.",
        "On the other hand, the major drawback of advertisement is, it manipulates people. That is why most people nowadays are more worldly. Secondly, too much ad makes confusion in selection of product. For example, if a consumer goes in the market to buy shampoo for hairs, he may get confused about what is suitable for him. The third major drawback is, it is causing competition in busniess. In last, most people use it for fake publicity for their low-quality products.",
        "In conclusion, although the advertisement is gaining popularity, it has its problem. If the ad is done with real honesty, it can help everyone."
