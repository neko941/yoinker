        "In the 2010s, a myriad of social media platforms, mainly Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter have become a playground for various tasks. Considering the aging generations: for mature entrepreneurs, it is an excellent opportunity to start promoting a business venue; for teenagers, it is the most convenient chatting method. However, all of them have a mutual tendency to share life updates, and, unfortunately, there is no 100% securityguarantee.",
        "The majority of social media users do not respect the invasion of privacy. They are prone to share their important news with only close friends or parents if they live far abroad. However, data protection policies do not always work, considering how many profiles may be easily hacked. As a result, any single user is exposed to the risk of either cyberbullying or cyber fraud. Additionally, it would not be a surprise to evidence the impact of such attacks on the younger generations. In most cases, it witnesses a negative outcome.",
        "On the other hand, the pattern of social media has not been always gloomy. Firstly, one can advertise a newborn business venue and promote it vastly when having a certain number of followers. Secondly, there are no costs needed to keep connected to your peers if they are miles away. The number of calls or messages is unlimited, as well as the timing of your conversations. Thirdly, mass media and social media are highly intertwined in terms of having official news accounts. Everyone can follow, react, and comment on the most entertaining and desirable items.",
        "To summarize the bullet points, due to social media, everyone has quick access to each other\u2019s updates on either life events or comments under the news posts. However, data protection policies must be consistently renewed. Therefore, the advantages of social media are equivalent to the disadvantages."
