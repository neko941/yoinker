        "These days the amount of rubbish has significantly increased.There is some reasons for that also, there is number of solution which should be implemented to by the government reduce this problem.",
        "One reason for this issue is, the overuse of plastic.The  amount of this plastic rubbish is the highest among other shape of wastes.This kind of wastes have a major damage effect on both people and the environment.For exaple, I have noticed that plastic product taks away longer than other products to decompose. Perhaps, hundred of years.this have a dircte effect on  the issue  of global warming.a possible solution for this problem that, the government need to imposes people to start useing  a sefer alternatives sush as, papers.By donig I believe that the amount of plastic rubbish will noticeable decrease.",
        "Another reason is not having dispose of this wastes an appropriate way, many countries tend to burn their  wastes.In general this can take  days and, with the large amount of wastes that every countries preduce per day, this operation will never end.This might be the main cause of respiratory diseases.For instance, I  have read that people how lived near to this area which wastes burn at have showed  a high percentage of  respiratory diseases  among other people.A feasible solution is to stop using this method. I think that The  government need to find other and more safer way to deal with this rubbish rither than burning it.",
        "In conclusion.This rubbish  can damage both the eirth and people health.All countries need to stop underrated this problem. The governmnt should work side by side with the residents to control the amonut of rubbish that produce every year."
