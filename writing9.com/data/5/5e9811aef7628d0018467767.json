        "A few scientists believe that soon artificial intelligence will over-rule human intelligence. Some masses consider it to be advantageous as it can lead to automation and accuracy in tasks; however, others feel that it will soon result in unemployment among the general masses.",
        "To begin with the positive side, computers perform complex tasks with high accuracy and the end results are always precise while leaving no room for errorenous mistakes. They are used in diverse range of manufacturing industries, in the production of automobiles, in developing goods, and many others where precise control is needed during constructions. Since human-beings are incapable of lifting heavier weights in industries as well as they take in large hours for a single task, computers are hugely beneficial in working firms. For instance, Human Space and Research Organisations take in use of computers to perform huge amount of calculatons, as they produce quick and accurate results within seconds which otherwise would require hours and even sometimes days in case of humans.",
        "Admittedly, intelligent computers are of great benefit to the societies but some people fear that it will soon result in unemployment among the individuals. Although people can perfom complex neurological calculations with optimal brain usage, they are in no match with computers. It might be the reason that now industries are turning to artificial intelliigence and as a result job opportunities are being vanished. As a result, it is leading to poverty and starvation among the public.",
        "To conclude, in my opinion artificial intelligence is a positive development that would be of great use in future; however, inhabitants of the world's regions should be made literate about its advantages."
