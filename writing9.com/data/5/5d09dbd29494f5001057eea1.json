        "Many organizations makes it a necessity for pregnant women and nursing mothers to proceed on pregnancy leave and while this tends to have some negative effects on the overall company's performance, In my opinion, I strongly believe there are more  benefits to gain from it.",
        "Despite the drawbacks below,  mothers, babies and society at large stand to gain a lot from maternity leave. Firstly, it gives women enough time to properly nurture their infant from birth. The early life of children plays a very crucial role in  their development as getting the right nutrition, immunization and help bring about a well developed brain, sound mind and in general, a healthy society. Secondly, maternity leave is an avenue to implement work-life balance which is vital for employees' optimal performance on the job.. For instance, Distractions and ineffectiveness at work place that are results of pregnancy stress are simply avoided by staying away from duty.. Furthermore, nursing mothers have ample time to take good care of themselves during this period and as such resume fully recuperated and refreshed to  perform optimally.",
        "Admittedly, there are some issues associated with women embarking on maternity leave. One of the problem is that it might create additional workload for other colleagues thereby leading to poor productivity at work. For example, an organization with fewer staffs would have to bear the burden of another member proceeding on leave. And this could bring about poor results as the few available staffs would have to overwork themselves. Another issue is that, staying away from work for a very long period could give room for idleness and laxity on the job. To buttress, the modern day workplace is a fast-pace working environment where new ideas are innovated daily. So therefore, a nursing mother might need to undergo several training to cover up for lost time and meet up with company's current standard.",
        "In conclusion, pregnancy leave helps foster a healthy society and high performance at workplace and these are clear benefits that exceeds any drawbacks it may pose."
