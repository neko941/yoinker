        "Farming has been developed in the current era such many other features are related to our life; however, many countries are suffering from the scarcity of food around the globe. Several actions can help this knotty problem to omit hunger.",
        "To begin with, one of the chief reasons for this serious problem is unfavorable weather conditions. Parts of the world experience intense, searing heat and temperature soar that triggered irreversible pitfalls eliminating crops and vegetables. Other areas that suffer torrential rain or widespread flooding on a regular basis are contributing to exert severe pressure on finite resources. Another point worth noting is due to the recession, residents of these poor countries fail to have ample money to afford the cost of their life particularly food that nowadays many countries faced. The country\u2019s fragile economy has caused arduous situations potentially people who earned lower salaries. Financial losses are the unfortunate by-product of the recession of areas that the threat of inflation is increasing.",
        "Nevertheless, an effective action to redress this crucial difficulty could be create water supplier for dry climate by constructing mechanized spaces for ameliorating cultivation which resulted in harvesting much more products compared to the past. Another caution to this crisis that staved off famine is the government takes measures to be invested in producing local produce at lower prices, reducing food miles that todays is incredibly high. This, in turn, encourages the majority of farmers to put their goal agriculture in their yields. By increase in their sellers is attributed to further individuals eager participating in these activities that brings more money and disappear starvation.",
