        "It is a common belief amongst a few individuals that kids attitude can be best molded at a youthfull age, while others are of an openion that kids are better of with more liberty.I believe both control and freedom should be balanced together when it comes to rasiseing children.n the upcomming essay i will shed more light on both views.",
        "Children are like an empty vasse at a tender age.What ever we teach them they learn & believe without a second thought.As they grow up they are no longer as close to us as they were before, hence they learn more from outside then from home, which can be either be good or bad depending on the community and socity we live in.It becomes quite diffucelt for parents to mold them towards the right direction once they have been exposed to the outer world like high school & colledge.For example i was controled and diciplaned by my parents from an early age.That has changed my behaviour and made me a gentlemen.",
        "On the other hand when kids are givin freedom at an early age they can no longer control themselves nor can the distingwish between good and bad.Such kids fall prey of bad habbits and distroy thier childhod. As they become adults they are limitless and have no respect for their elders nor do they possess feelings for anything.",
        "for example a much recent survey done by the US child services on the inmates of texas county jail proved that they were either neglected by their parents as a child and they were given the freedom to do what ever they desired when they were kids. Which distroyed them in their adulthood.",
        "To conclude it is always a good idea to control kids attitude from a early age rather than give them a free hand. Otherwise they will endup as a burdun to the socity by not fitting in.I am of the opinion that parents are the best teachers & preachers for their children when done right at an early age."
