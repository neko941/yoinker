        "It is true that the issue of pupils\u2019 bad attitude is getting worse all over the world. There are numerous reasons why the school goers show a bad behaviour, but steps can be taken to tackle this problem.",
        "There are several reasons why young students exert unexpected",
        "behaviour. Firstly, there is a lack of proper training among the teachers on how to control the pupils. Secondly, we live in a society where kids are showered with instant gratification. Parents are allowing their offspring whatever they demand almost instantly, and this is making these young minds impatience and not to listen to the adults. Finally, students have too much screen time in terms of TV, phone and computer games; and this is making them unsocial and they end up acting in a bad manner. Overall, due to these key causes, I believe the young generation of today act in a rough and unacceptable way.",
        "However, these mentioned issues are critical but solvable. To start with, the elementary level tutors are in need of a great deal of mandatory training on controlling the students. For instance, in Japan, for the first five years, the institutions only teach the manner and culturally appropriate behaviours to the children. Also, the responsibility of the parents is even greater. The parents need to control their school going kids by putting a limit to their demands, since due to the over access to entertainments and instant gratification these children don't tend",
        "to obey the teachers when they are at school. Furthermore, the parents need to spend a lot of quality time with their children, rather than making them occupied with phones, TVs and computer games. Spending quality time and proper counselling can make these youths behave better.",
        "In conclusion, to make the behaviour of the pupils better what needed is good training for the teachers, restricting the screen time for the students and parents to spend good time with their school going kids."
