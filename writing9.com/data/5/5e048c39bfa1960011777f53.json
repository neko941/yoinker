In your opinion, is it important for everyone to learn English? Should we try to ensave the survival of local languages and if so, how?",

        "In this globalized epoch, some people consider learning English at schools to be of utmost importance than any other indigenous language; however, others are apprehensive of the fact that this belief has",
        "led the other languages to be at the brink of extinction. Although I believe, in this competitive world, it is imperative to be proficient in English, it is equally important that consideration ought to be given to save",
        "the other dying languages.",
        "To embark with, English has become a global language, which is widely used in different spheres of business communication. Owing to this, people who have a good command on it get numerous employment opportunities worldwide as well as comparatively better remuneration. For example, a recent survey done by an eminent university revealed that more than three-fourth English speakers are",
        "employed in top multinational companies, who earn substantially higher salaries than any of the non-English speakers. Indubitably, use of this language is a key for an effective international communication.",
        "However, with the rise in popularity of English, other dialects are not being believed to be essential. Consequently, the native languages are losing their grips in the locals. In order to mitigate this grim situation, governments need to accentuate to the denizens the importance of speaking the local dialects. In other words, masses should be encouraged to use their own languages in social communication while in home country. Moreover, school curriculums also need to be amended where addition of local languages is made mandatory by the officials. This would result in children being bilingual where they could speak both the English as well as their native language.",
        "To conclude, although it is irrefutable that English has been dominating the world and resulting in other languages to dye out, I believe equal emphasis ought to be given in schools to all the other languages along with English so that the indigenous dialects do not lose their value among locals."
