        "Most people would agree that car ownership has increased in recent years. This is causing problems, especially in built-up areas. I think there are a lot of ways that governments can aim to deal with this.",
        "Many big cities in the world have traffic problems. These problems vary. For example, it is easy to drive around my city after 10am and before 5pm. Outside these hours, you have to allow double the usual time to reach your destination. Traffic jam happens at all times in some other cities. There are a lot of car horns too.",
        "One of the best approaches governments can take in busy cities is to encourage the use of public transport. This means the public transport has be too well run. People must be able to afford them too. Buses, trams and trains are good ways of getting around. If they are cheap and reliable, people will use them.",
        "Another approach is to try to stop people from entering the city. This can be done by building car parks and shopping centres outside of the city. Many cities around the world do this quite successfully. They even offer passengers bus transport into the centre.",
        "Governments can also run campaigns to encourage people to be less dependent on their cars. This is because a lot of car trips involve very short journeys. These are often unnecessary.",
        "We all have a responsibility to look after our cities. Governments can do a lot to improve the situation. They need to focus on encouraging people to consider alternatives to driving."
