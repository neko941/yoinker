        "There is no doubt that population has been inflating at an alarming rate and to accommodate all countries are in dire need of more homes. Some suggest that the solution lies in the construction of houses in countryside, while others argue that this will leave the countryside vulnerable. This essay will evaluate both the views before a reasonable conclusion is drawn.",
        "To commence with, countryside is the most vital source of providing crops to the nation. That is because the agriculture land is used to cultivate the vegetables and fruits for the inhabitants of a country. The building of accommodations on these lands will eventually affect their production capabilities and hinder the growth.",
        "In addition to the above, countryside is considered a favourite tourist spot for its natural beauty and scenic outlook. Lots of people within the country visit these spots to take a break from their hectic schedules and to enjoy the exhilarating landscapes. If in future, houses are created on these it might spoil the exceptional purity of these places.",
        "On the flip side, the main reason behind the massive requirement of extra houses is the immense influx of people coming to cities often for education and employment purposes. State need to work towards creating more employment and educational means in countryside to deter the migration of there natives towards cities.",
        "In consideration of the above factors, I can opine that development of houses in the countryside will considerably destroy its production abilities and stunning beauty, however government needs to develop a robust plan to reduce the needs of more houses in cities."
