        "Visiting new places for recreation and understanding their culture, is one of the main idea of tourism. Now a days so many people tend to introduce themselves to diverse places with unique beauty and culture. Tourists try to explore undiscovered places on the earth. They get to know more about places, which is always good and satisfying. However, sometimes their curiosity for finding new destinations take a plight and can put them into dangerous situations, Which in-turn, could be life threatening.",
        "Holidaying with loved ones for the purpose of recreation and pleasure, which everyone love to do these days. Earlier people used to visit places which were regular tourist spots and were famous for its beauty and culture. But now a days they want to innovate and explore new places which are equally beautiful but remained unrecognized as tourist spots. The main advantage is that, these discoveries are making these remote places connected to rest of the world and people tend to know about various culture and traditions.  Other main advantage, Tourism has contributed significantly in the economic growth of such places and nearby. It attracts International tourism which gives a rise to country\u2019s foreign reserve and increases financial value.",
        "But on other hand, sometimes visiting places which are not safe for journey to the destination and could cost  to their lives. For example \u2013 exploring places of different continents like Antarctic, which is covered with snow throughout the year and not safe for human activity. Visiting such places requires special training beforehand. Extreme weather conditions at some places makes it life threatening rather than enjoying that place.",
        "To conclude, while it is always more satisfying to visit unexplored places and to know about their culture and admire their beauty but not at the cost of their life. Always it is good to keep a balance between adventure and safety to make it a life time enjoyment."
