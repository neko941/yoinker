        "The advancements in communication technologies has provided the people with a number of mediums to obtain news from. It is argued that listening to the radio is still the best method for receiving news. However, a number of people, including myself, differ from this opinion and tilt their take in television\u2019s favour, considering it the best medium for news broadcasting.",
        "The one advantage that radio news bulletins offer is that they are more convenient to listen to. Unlike other mediums of communication, listening to the radio does not have space or environment constraints. In other words, you do not have be in your TV lounge to listen to a radio news bulletin. Radio stations can be tuned into on the move, on cell phones or car stereos so their news bulletins are much easier to follow.",
        "On the flip side, the biggest advantage with television as a source of news is its ability to broadcast international news channels. The world has become a global village of late and people need to be up to speed with all the worldwide happenings. Television has an edge over other mediums of communication as it can broadcast a number of international news channels bringing its viewers close to the world. Moreover, the ability of television to broadcast news using the senses of sight and hearing is what makes it different. People can not simply listen to the news but they can also watch the video clips and even live telecasts of local of international events.",
        "In conclusion, television is by far the best means of news broadcast as it shows visuals and has a global reach. Radio bulletins are easier to follow but my opinion is in the favor of television for its various benefits."
