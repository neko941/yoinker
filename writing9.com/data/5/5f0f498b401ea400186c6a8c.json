        "In the ultamodren epoch,it is a point of debate that providing the education of good values and behaviour is responsibility of schools rather than parents.Undoubtedly this notion remains sucessfull in keeping the majority in its favour.This essay will highlight that this certainly is a ratinal approach that needs to be opted.",
        "To commence with,behavioural education must be given in the schools because juveniles spend their most of tine in schools.While some argue that patents should be resposible for providing education regarding moral ethics,i would say that it is resposibility of teacher to teach them how distinguish right from wrong.To elaborate it more, instructions about good atticates provided by mentors becaues they observe students in svhool hours.For instance, a research conducted by world education organisation showed that  children who study in schools 80% more well mannered;however, others who complete their education at home has less manners. Thus schools play piovtal role for granting behaviural dkills to youngsters.",
        "Adding futher,how can any one forget teacher plays indipensible role in children's life.In simole words juveniles follow their mentor advices more than parents.since students learn atticates from educators ,they would be become gentalmen.To substantiate there is an epitome of local news paper article presented 70%of youngsters consider their tutors more intelligent than their pparents.so,behaviouralskills are delivered at educatinal places by educators.",
        "To sum up,it can be asserted fron above discussion although contacting moral ethics and distinguish between right and wrong should be taught at schools as their is not any plousible argument against the very phnomenon."
