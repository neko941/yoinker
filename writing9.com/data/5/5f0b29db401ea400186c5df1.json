        "Some people argue that cleanliness of residential areas is responsible by the government officials while others believe that locals are the one to do it. Personally,  I do believe this shared objective can be achieved by the combined efforts of civil bodies and residents considerably.",
        "First and foremost, it is true that citizens are paying taxes for the basic infrastructures including this municipal work. Hence, authorities are accounted for sanitation of residential areas by doing garbage collection on schedule, sewage repair when flooded, etc. Moreover, they have to encourage and educate local people to be aware of pollution around thier living areas. Regarding these corporation jobs, sufficient funding for the municiple workers, officers and equipments should be established by the officials to support the working system accordingly.",
        "Concerning the local dwellers' side, they also have to act with the sense of responsiblity instead of relying on the government to do all the jobs. In fact, they ought to spare a few minutes of their daily regime to devote for the cleanliness of their neighbourhood. Clearly, they have to dump waste at designated places, keep the roads clean and also need to avoid or reduce usage of plastic. Moreover, they have to abide the municiple laws and regulations, and most importantly, they must pay taxes which would be funding the services they get in many ways.",
        "To reiterate, local residents are mainly responsible for their clean and hygenic dwelling places while the duty of government also plays the key role in maintaining the sanitation of these areas. Nonetheless, the concerted efforts of administrative bodies and locals will sustain the aim of keeping the living areas without pollution undoubtedly."
