        "Although tourism is the main source of GDP for certain countries, it also has a detrimental effect which should be taken into account. I agree that its disadvantages should be considered since it may lead to spreading terrible diseases or dirtiness in some places.",
        "The main reason why I believe that tourism might be disadvantageous to certain extant is that this can result in pandemic. Indeed, if individuals from a particular country get sick, they can easily spread this sickness among others by travelling to different areas. For example, current coronavirus outbreak taught us how quickly can pandemic get started due to the travels, and only lockdown of the whole country is the best solution to combat this.",
        "Another reason to support aforementioned issue is the fact that the most visited countries suffer from dirtiness from tourists who flock to these places from all around the world. To clarify, not only do travelers leave plenty of garbage after themselves, but it also significantly difficult for social services to keep such crowded places clean. To illustrate, Paris is one of the most popular places among tourists in the world and also, it has a reputation of the most romantic place, but it contains a significant amount of garbage on the streets and in subways which may spoil the whole beautiful picture of the city.",
        "In conclusion, while many countries introduce new ways to attract travelers which will enhance their economic situation, there are some drawbacks which the authorities should also bear in mind such as possibility of spreading diseases or the garbage."
