        "Computer act as important machine for students to do all the school related work, so most of the pupils depend on it. However the principle problem is students allowing machine to do all the work for them without thinking for themselves and a possible solution is to have stricter supervisions from teacher and parents. Firstly, this essay will discuss the problem that computer is acting as a spoon feeding for students to complete all their school work and the solution of this issue is supervision should have  on them by their mentors",
        "Firstly, the major problem of this issue is pupils take a help of computer for completing all the school works like assignments and project. As the result of this students can\u2019t think of their own for assignment and can\u2019t improve their knowledge about the topic if they are getting all the information without taking any efforts for it. And this will not help them to face competitive world. University research shows in Times of Bombay that 60% students complete their assignments with help of computer rather than completing themselves.",
        "However the solution for this assertion is parents or teacher should supervise their work and encourage them to complete assignment on their own. However this can help to improve their thinking ability and boost their confident for doing their project independently. For instant working on project teacher should ask the their students to think and make at least rough project and then take the help of computer if needed , so this can help them to improve their ideas and knowledge about the topics",
        "In conclusion, dependence of student on computer can be avoided by parents and teacher by supervising on them properly and encourage them to complete the work independently"
