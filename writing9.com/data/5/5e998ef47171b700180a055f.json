        "One of the noticeable trends in the 21st century, is Using internet for shopping which becoming more popular in many parts of the world. While some advocate the idea that they may prove beneficial for consumers, Other dismiss them as a drawback of shopping over internet. Both sides of the argument present rational ideas, which will be elaborated.",
        "On the one hand, supporters of online shopping assert that the benefits accruing from them are no negligible. To begin with, since the vast majority of these shopping stores have been sold goods and services, shopping is made easier and convenient for customers through internet. In the other words, this is to say, people could sit at home, search for deals and receive delivery the next day. For instance, during coronavirus pandemic, when it is impossible to go shopping, we stay at home and order from websites such as Digikala and SnappMarket and receive our delivery on time.",
        "Further and more importantly, though, another merits of online shopping relate to environment. In fact, it is one of the most environmentally-friendly means with less pollution, while people will drive less. In the other world, instead of going out for purchasing things, they can be order from everywhere and have less traffic congestion and air pollution will increase.",
        "Nevertheless, others put forward the argument that shopping over the internet provide people with some drawbacks. First of all, one of the most impacts on numbers of unemployed people. In fact, the less of business for local markets, while consumers tend to shopping over internet, has result in rising unemployed individuals as losing their jobs. Statistics have shown that unemployment are far more than employment rate, since online shopping has been increased.",
        "By way of conclusion, there are logical points on both sides; however, it seems the benefits of online shopping far outweigh its drawbacks."
