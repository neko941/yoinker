        "Over the past few decades, the rate at which people are becoming obese has increased dramatically. Some people argue that this is caused by unhealthy fattening foods available in the market at low prices, and that increasing prices of such foods will help to curb this problem. In my opinion this is not the solution.",
        "Reducing the prices of fattening foods will not solve the issue of obesity. It is vital, that time, and resources be allocated to analyse and understand the reason for obesity. Most products available in the market have excessive sugars. Ranging from sodas such as Pepsi, to regular bread. These products are consumed on a regular basis by the majority of the population. Moreover, there is a lack of understanding regarding effects of unhealthy foods on the body as well as the role an active lifestyle can play in reducing the harmful effects of fatty and sugar loaded foods. Therefore legislation regarding sugar and other fatty contents must be enacted to direct the food industry to be more mindful of the ingredients that are in their foods.",
        "Furthermore, regular health updates need to be readily available to individuals, as well as making work spaces exercise friendly. Apart from unhealthy diets, an inactive lifestyle contributes enormously to individuals becoming overweight.  Due to lack of time, and some times resources, people are left with no choice but to be inactive. It is essential that government legislates to include at least 15 minutes each day during the work hours for individuals to exercise.",
        "Nonetheless, even if such legislations are made and passed, it is essential that school children are made aware of the importance of exercise and its benefits for the body and the mind. Exercise should be made mandatory. Once children internalise the need to be fit, they will make an active effort to avoid products that are harmful for their health.",
        "Therefore, In conclusion, there must need efforts made by the government to promote healthy lifestyle. Increase in prices of foods will not deter people from consuming such foods."
