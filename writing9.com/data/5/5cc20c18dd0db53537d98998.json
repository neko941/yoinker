        "For hundreds of years, the education played an important role in people\u2019s lives. Skills like maths, reading and writing have remained and considered to be critical parts an education. Nowadays, some people believe that with the invention of the computers, computing skill needs to be added to the list. I strongly agree with the statement because the technology has touched the lives of each and every human on the planet and there is no going back from it.",
        "Until a quarter century ago, many people on the planet never heard about a computer. All the daily activities were literally never dependent of any computing power. Fast forward to 2019, it is very difficult to imagine a life without the computers because all our finances and careers are directly or indirectly dependent on the computers. Without the skill of handling the computers, it will be really a difficult life to lead in the modern era. For example, 15 years ago, people used to visit banks for all the financial transactions and send letters to communicate with each other. Now, the people are communicating with each other instantly and doing all the economic transactions without stepping out of the comfort zone.",
        "The technology has transformed the life of humans like never before. Nature of the jobs has changed over the period of time, for most of the jobs these days, the computing skill is mandatory. Taking the future of the younger generation in to the consideration, computers must be introduced in to the academics right from the primary school.",
        "To conclude, a person without knowing maths and physics can still survive in the society, but without the knowledge of computers, he will be treated as an illiterate."
