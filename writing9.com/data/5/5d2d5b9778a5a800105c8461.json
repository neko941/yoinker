        "Most people from different age group are glued to their computer or cell phone these days. This is not a positive development because when any one spends their entire day on front of computer screen or phone screen it will leads to health problems. They may even develop behavior issues. From my perspective, it is beneficial for everyone to explore themselves towards outdoor activities like sports and many more.",
        "As far as I think outdoor activities are good for everyone. They make them fitter and stronger as individual. By playing outdoor games it increase the stamina of the body. A survey was done by Health times showing a report that person involved in sports have healthier life and live long than those people who stay in their home. Thus one should get involved in outdoor activities in their life.",
        "In contrast to this, spending more time in home and watching TV leads to several health problems like obesity and diabetes due to lack of physical movements. Furthermore, such people face difficulties in interaction in social life. This is because; people do not communicate with their friends, relatives or neighbor which give raise to lack of confidence to interacting with others. As evidence, repost was presented by Public speaker Authority claiming that interpersonal skills in people are cultivated only by spending time outside from home and having words with others. Thus staying in home has adverse effect on our health and personality.",
        "In conclusion, it is crystal clear that spending time outdoor and getting involved in outdoor actives makes our body fit and healthier and on the other side spending more time in home have negative effect on our personality."
