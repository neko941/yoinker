        "Many people have brought up debates on whose duty is it to revamp the surrounding they live in. while, others considered it to be the responsibility of executives, some are of the opinion that private individuals have no power to enhance their surroundings. In my personal view, I believe only the government and owners of big firms are in the position to make a change.",
        "To begin with, it is noticeable that only the authorities and large companies has the fund and power to initiate programs that can create awareness on the positive impact of a clean environment as well as the disadvantages of an untidy surrounding which can lead to air and water pollution.  For example, it is regrettable that the people of ogoni town in rivers state Nigeria are continually exposed to water pollution as a result of oil pipe leakage which circulate into the run-off. This has caused a lot of hardship for the people inhabiting the town. It has also been observed that this water pollution has resulted in habitat loss. However, only the government and owners of large oil companies in this area can make a difference by empowering the oil thieves. This will ultimately reduce water and air pollution caused by pipe bursting.",
        "Furthermore, only the leaders has the power to enact laws that encourages afforestation which will improve biodiversity. In addition, the executives should persuade the general public to engage in recycling. The used tins, papers and containers can be recycled, this will not only serve as measures of tidying up the surroundings but also serve as a means of generating income.",
        "Conversely, the populace also has a major role to play in keeping their environment clean. There is a saying that says \"charity begins at home\" if every member of a family judiciously manage the amount of waste generated in their homes everyday, there will be less environmental pollution. The individuals should also practice weekly environmental sanitation. In ondo state for instance, the people participate in weekly sanitation in every area which always leave the state sparkling clean. This has effectively helped in maintaining a clean surrounding.",
        "In conclusion, both the individuals and government together with private organisations can create a change in their immediate environment. Although, I am of the opinion that to live in a disease free environment and also to maintain healthy living, the onus lies greater on part of the government."
