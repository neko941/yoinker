        "People have different view with regards to where would be a good place for government to allocate public fund to improve public health. While there are several reasons to prioritize a healthy lifestyle, I would argue that the treatments of people who are already suffering from illness are far more important.",
        "On the one hand, promoting a healthy lifestyle is worth investing in any government. The sedentary routines which are steam from lack of physical activities put many people at high risk for modern diseases. In fact, there are a growing number of young people being obesity since they did not spend time engaging in outdoor activities. Therefore, allocating public funds to build new leisure and sports center couple with launching health campaign could raise public awareness about how to keep fit and healthy, which would be a contributing factor to increase the general level of public health. To be more specific, doing exercise and following a balanced diet on a regular basis could prevent citizens from being an illness in the long run.",
        "However, I would believe that it is a must to place an emphasis on treatment people who are already being ill. Firstly, there are some dangerous illnesses that could not prevent and could not avoid due to the lack of vaccination. There were a billion of people who are in a life-threatening situation saving lives thanks to the advance of health care systems. Secondly, unhealthy lifestyle could not be a main root for all illnesses that people face today. In fact, living in contaminated air as well as consuming position food and drink could be the key factors influencing the significant escalate in public diseases. If governments are not able to deal with these issues, it could lead to detrimental impacts on society.",
        "In conclusion, although promoting a good living style is important, I firmly think that the emphasis should be put on the treatment illnesses."
