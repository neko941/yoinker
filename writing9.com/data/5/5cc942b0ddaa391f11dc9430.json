        "Whilst, Art Gallery and historical sites are less attractive for native masses them to tourist. I would discuss about this in the following paragraphs",
        "To begin with, there are myriad reason why I claim that the first and an important cause is that, the local people take these places for granted. They think that these places are not running anywhere, so that they will see  sooner or later. Moreover, people have seldom time for to see these places. due to this reason individuals take time from their hectic schedule to watch historical places. Furthermore, tourist who come there are on a holiday, and their main motive is visiting these gallery and historical places. For instance ,I visited Hyderabad tourist and went to see Ramoji Film City which is the biggest Film City .which is the biggest Film City in the whole word; my relative who staying in Hyderabad have never been there once. When I told them they decided to visit with their children. In addition, nothing new is added to these places over the years public who have been there once, do not wish to frequent these places again and again. However, museum and historical sites are not cheap to visit in fact visitor are often required to buy expensive tickets.",
        "Contrary above the statement super up more mankind coming to museum. School trips could be organised for children to enjoy these places . a day free for local mankind  art gallery  ; they take interest on them.",
        "In the conclusion, reasons can be given to why lose their and tourism place of exhibition. However 2 popular the sides among men and women some action should be taken"
