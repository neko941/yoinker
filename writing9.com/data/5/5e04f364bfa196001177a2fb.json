        "Annually many languages go extinct. Many individuals believe that it is not a big deal as there will be lesser languages and it will make communication easier . I think that though there are positives in having many languages still the negatives cannot be ignored and I feel  languages  has to be seen only as communication medium .Having so many languages is simply causing a lot of barriers among people.",
        "Firstly , The negative of having many languages is that simply you can't communicate with everyone you want. Communication among humans is a basic need and every human loves to communicate and express themselves but due to language barriers people of different countries and communities do not understand each other and miscommunication have become so familiar. For example I went japan last month and wanted to buy a diamond ring which was rare piece . So I told him that I wanted to buy this diamond and store keeper said something and show me another shop ... I tried my best to tell him that \"I am here buy but the store owner doesn't  understand what I was telling him and he kept showing another shop grocery shop thinking that I am looking for some grocery items.. finally I could not convince him and get through my message .So I had leave the store empty handed even after Struggling to buy the item for 30 minutes explaining him was all waste time .",
        "The biggest positive about having only one or two languages is that expressing yourself is so easy and there won't be any miscommunication or misunderstanding among people due to wrong interpretation of someone else's language . For instance last week I travelled to Australia and attended an exhibition on gem and jewellery and spoke to many like minded people and we I spoke in  English without any language barrier and was able to make some agreements on future business deals between our companies . This shows how on this occasion we were able to make some advangeous decision for companies by using a common language.",
        "To conclude I believe that advantages in having few languages  far out reaches its disadvantages  and having few languages is a positive even if some languages go extinct."
