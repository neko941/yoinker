        "We have witnessed many animals being used and even killed to meet human need of food, clothes and medicine. Some people believe that in the near future, animals will no longer be essential for our products. To a certain degree, I agree that these products can be replace by synthetic ones in clothing industry; however, I would argue that human still need animals for food and medical research.",
        "On the one hand, we did find many alternatives to avoid using animals. First and foremost, modern science has invented substitute meats that taste like real ones but were made from soybean. This innovation allows people such as vegans to remain their current while still have enough nutritents they need. Secondly, the utilize of animals are decreasing rapidly, which is very fortunate. Last but not least, using animals in producing clothes has no longer been integral since scientists developed alternative materials that are adequate for our need. For instance, we now can use synthetic fur and synthetic silk that are as good as the real ones and can even stay intact for a longer period than what from animals.",
        "On the other hand, it is nearly inconceivable to stop using animals. White meat and red meat are parts of many traditional cuisine over the world. For example, India cannot could curry with the absence of chicken of beef. Additionally, some specific protein and minerals can only be found in animals; thereby avoiding meat from animals thoroughly will make some people fail to approach adequate nutritens. Likewise, the use of animals in medical research is being lessen as much as scientists can. Nevertheless, for the time being, yet there is no proper alternatives so we still have to utilize animals in these fields.",
        "In conclusion, it is no doubt true that animals will be unnecessary in some particular areas like clothes; however, I believe we still need animals to meet our nutritents requirement or performing medical research."
