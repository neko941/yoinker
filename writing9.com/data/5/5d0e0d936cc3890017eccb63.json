        "Looking back at the past, we often seem to notice that war and mililtary tensions were highly pronounced under the situations when a man was commanding power. Hence, it can be argued that women holding positions of power might be a viewed as a better alternative for establishing peace. I strongly agree with this statement. The following essay will highlight the primary two reasons for favoring the fairer sex for a better world. The reasons are their non impulsive nature and motherly instincts.",
        "Firstly, women are not slaves to their impulses. Ladies, in general tend to be more rational. They think decisions through, and do not jump into conclusions as compared to males, that are more or less often driven by their implulsive thinking. When a woman takes a decision, there is a smaller probability of her being dictated by her gut feeling. For example, a study by Colombia university demonstrates that 68 % of females were willing to listen to a given situation before reacting, as compared to 45 % of males.",
        "Secondly, the feminine has an innate motherly quality. This virtue allows her to focus on the creative aspects of life. As compared to men, who are however, known to jump directly into a direct combat.",
        "A prime example is our past. If we analyse all the major wars that happened, it was always a man leading the armies. Whether it is the battle of Plassey or the First World War. Contrary to this, history has evidence of women employing diplomatic ways to resolve an issue. A classic example is of Queen Cleopatra of Egypt, who formed alliances with her enemies. Hence, Egypt flourished under her reign and completed its golden age.",
        "In conclusion, due to a woman's non impulsive feelings and motherly nature , I agree that female leadership can be seen as a better option to promote a peaceful world."
