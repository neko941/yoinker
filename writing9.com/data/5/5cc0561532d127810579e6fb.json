        "It is true that today people are getting addicted to electronic gadgets to pass their free time. Watching their favorite films and playing interesting games is available at any time through their mobiles, tablets, laptops and desktops, which has its own benefits and drawbacks. I believe the pros overweigh the cons of this development, if these are used within limits as overuse of everything is bad.",
        "On the one hand, people tend to reach out to their phones the moment they get some ample amount of time. They don't feel alone at any time with the smartphone in their hand. This is good because one can utilize their time, while travelling and commuting to their work places, by watching their favorite movie and playing the game they like the most.In addition to this, It helps people to connect with other members who play the same games. For instance, I have seen people discussing about the games, which are in trend, which in turn give rise to communication and help them know each other.",
        "On the other hand, when people start giving priority to the electronic gadgets instead of other people around them then it makes things unpleasant. To add to this, these things have a negative impact on individual's growth as they prefer to spend most of the hours watching movies and playing games instead of socializing with their friends and family members. For example, a recent research by technological department revealed that these electronic gizmos have a deteriorating effect on the mankind health.",
        "To summarize, everything comes with its own advantages and disadvantages. Access of anything is bad so if the latest gadgets are used in a controlled manner to watch films and play games then it proves to be fruitful. Alternatively, if these things start replacing people around you then it is considered to be a negative development."
