        "This is extremely beneficial to get some experience before hand to persue the studies further. Some people think it is waste of time, while others think it is good for them. This essay will elaborate the pros and cons of having experience between the school and college life before ending with the conclusion.",
        "First of all, it is indisputable fact that everyone has a right to know what actually he/she likes to persue in his/her life ahead without having any peer or family presure. So, going for practical work after completing the school, gives best chance to them to explore their options without any hestitation. Furthermore, teenagers become more responsible while doing the jobs, where they understand the value of precious time and money more, as it is their hard earn money. For example, in many countries like Canada and Australia, after 16 years students work part time in restaurants and in other fields with their studies, which help them to know what they actually want and become independent.",
        "On the other hand, it is not deniable that, while doing jobs after school, sometimes youngsters get rude comments from their supervisors due to lack of perfectism or professionalism, which puts the negative impact on their mind reagrding that job which could cause the reason of not doing that job again. Moreover, being responsible in respect to work, puts a young child into depression where he can not say no to his manager and do not share his feelings with his parents, as it is his decision to gain some experience or to do job before getting the admission in the college. For an instance, reaserch conducted by the Health Society of Mumbai shows that 20% of youngesters are suffered with the depression and mental problems after getting the harsh comments from their upper management while having internships or experience before persuing their further studies.",
        "To conclude, I would like to say, it is essential to get some kind of practical experience relating to their career in which they are interested,before going to the college, as it gives the reality check to the youngsters, so they can paln their future better."
