        "With the increased amount of qualified workforce, there is a growing competition for every vacancy, especially for high ranking management positions. Because many of these high rank employees are working in the same position for many years, some believe the company should encourage them to retire early, so that younger workers could have the opportunity to advance. In my opinion, Although I do think it takes a substantial amount of time before  a person becomes fully qualfied, I agree with the statement and think that high position workers should retire early.",
        "Naturally, People who work in high ranking jobs, have a greater ability to direct the company and create large changes. This, however, requires experience and knowledge which often takes a few years to master. To illustrate, when a person is working as a bank manager, it takes him between 3-4 years before he truely understant every aspect of the financial relationships in the bank, and only than he can truely direct the bank acording to his beliefe. It is understandable,",
        "than, why bank managers are usully employed between 15-20, and in many cases retire well after the age of 60 years.",
        "In contrast to the above mentioned, I think that having a worker in the same management position for many years may lead to fixed opinions and decisions, which can affect the company and its income. While older man tend to be strict and unflexible with their working routine, young end energetic workers have the ability to change and challange previous conceptions, and make new and bold decisions. The new research and development leader of IBM, for example, was only 23 years old when hired, and his first step as the new manager was to direct all funds to the development of video games, in contrast to previous evaluations that it is not financial. His decision increased IBM earning by 25%.",
        "To conclude, in my opinion, working in a high ranking position should be done for a specific amount of time, afterwards the employee should retire, or transfer to a nother positon. By doing this, the company maintain the experience and knowledge of the senior workers, and at the same time allow young people the chance to direct the buisness to new directions."
