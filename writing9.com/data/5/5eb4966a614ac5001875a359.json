        "The education system does not provide youth students with enough information in order to protect their health. This essay agrees with this statement because in the most of schools there is no ability to take a nutrition related subject and the sport and recreation is marginalised.",
        "The main problem is that students are overwhelmed with a lot of different subjects they need to study and they do not learn about important health data. Our system puts on the first place subjects that are important for us in order to enroll in better universities later and get better jobs but they don't teach us how to eat healthy and to maintain active lifestyle. Students need to spend majority of their time studying for demanding subjects and a school curiculum is left without department that teaches how to take care of themselves. Recent research concluded that more than 50 of high schools have a problem with obese atendees.",
        "Furthermore, in today society there is surge in number of inactive minors and they have very little interest in sports. The most of their free time is being spent in front of tv screens, laptops and mobile phones while the rest of time they spend in their school desks. Only time they have sports is only once or twice per a week and that last for 45 minutes that is definitely not enough. A research study done by medical professors found that every human should have at least one hour of daily activity.",
        "In conclusion, schools should put more enthusiasm to make them a place where our younger generations can learn imporantce of healthy life. Thus, point of interest should be divided between educational segment and entertainment part and more time should be granted to physical exercise in the class schedule."
