        "These days many companies have made a proper dress code as a mandatory protocol for their employees. While such a measure helps in maintainanceof discipline as well as team spirit, for some people it becomes a financial liability to maintain several sets of uniform along with their regular clothings. This essay will discuss both sides of the argument.",
        "First of all, work culture within an organization depends largely on the physical environment in the working area. Despite of hiring the highly professional individuals by an employer, their success depends massively on the discipline and job atmostphere which can be achieved by imposing clothing standards. For example, gigantic Information Technology brand such as Google, has rule of compulsary uniform for all the members where its brand logo needs to be embroidered at the back of the shirt. Such small yet efficient measures had proven a bonus towards success of any kind of business.",
        "Next, sometimes such rules and regulations may create a financial burden for people whose finances do not allow them for such extra expenses. While several social responsibilities make their unstable, such added duty to maintain unifrom for work make their economic condition worse. For example, according to a survey took by the students of the Indian Institute of Management Studies, a large mass of Indian population who belong to lower class prefer job placement in companies where there is no compulsation on dress codes. This is a major issue for employers who do not provide official clothing sponsored by themselves.",
        "To conclude, use of standardized uniform is being used by several firms. Though such implications positively hampers the economic growth of the respective company, on the other hand these disciplinary actions create a sense of burden for lower class workers."
