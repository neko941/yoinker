        "In some countries, young adults who are below the age-limit to work are restricted for full-time work by the authorities. In my opinion, I completely agree with this because young adults being involved in workforce for day long would face serious health issues while they can not focus on their education and consequently lead to child exploitation.",
        "To begin with, young children being engaged in permanent work can not take their study seriously. This means, having wasted most of their day time working, they would struggle to find adequate study time which will lead to obtain poor grades in academics and eventually would drop-out from primary or secondary levels. For example, many developing countries where child labour is accepted, permanent child workers are prevented from entering to universities due to their work responsibilities.",
        "Another reason to support this idea is that working full-time would put them at risk of being affected by health problems both physically and mentally. Some jobs require physical activities, which would result in under-aged children to suffer from serious health conditions. This would also put mental strain on them while performing physically demanding jobs for all day long. To illustrate, percentage of children taking mental health support is higher in south asian countries where children are allowed to work full-hours from the young age.",
        "Finally, working children would fall into victim of child exploitation. In other words, being under the age-limit for 8hours jobs, they are not protected by laws which result in receiving low wages while working equally as compared to adults. However, some destitute families require their offsprings to earn which would bring financial stability for the families, but the problems associated with full-time jobs for youngsters would outweigh that benefit.",
        "In conclusion, disruption in education, having serious risk of being ill and getting lower remunerations make the notion of forbiding children to take part in 8hours jobs appeared to be effective and other countries ought to be encouraged by the success of such measure."
