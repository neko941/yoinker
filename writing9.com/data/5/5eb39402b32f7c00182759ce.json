        "Well it\u2019s clear we see the trend of marriage all over the world and especially in India the mindset on marriage is quite different. Most of the people convey that marriage should be encouraged and especially before attaining age of 30 because they believe its best for both individual and society. I don\u2019t agree with the concept of such things.",
        "Firstly, I myself want to put in the shoes to convey about this topic. Right now, I have attained age of 30 but someone cannot expect me to get married because there is lot of roles and responsibilities, I haven\u2019t reached to that pinnacle point for me to get married and take care of one more additional person to the family. For instance, I don\u2019t have a suitable job and am unemployed in such situation not only I can marry but no girls parent will give me a girl who is not earning in this competitive world. Another instance will be of my brother who got married at 31, its obvious things take time for me to decide on that. So, as you see there is no plausible cause to get married at 30 when things are still not settled and only when its right time its better to get married rather the believing in a myth",
        "Secondly, I don\u2019t see how it\u2019s good for individual and society and what way it contributes other than contributing for growth of population. Let\u2019s consider a life of celebrity many don\u2019t get married soon because they have their dreams and goals, and they don\u2019t like to get stuck in the reality of marriage which hinders it. Although, they are not married they do good to the society by donating money during difficulties, doing social service. Its always a personal choice of when one needs to get married.",
        "Even though some say the form of giving birth depletes in female if they marry late due to less egg Fertility decreases but I don\u2019t believe that, since I have noticed people getting pregnant at age of 40 and there is lot of medical advancement of invitro fertilization (IVF) where people can still make babies.",
        "In conclusion I like to say there should be no need to encourage for marriage before 30 and people should decide what they want and when they want, then only it good for everyone."
