        "In contemporary era, children are less well behaved and always a topic of discussion to many parents. Some People are showing interest in physical punishment to get their children disciplined. This essay will argue why spanking children is slightly disagreed despite some people argue that they are against it.",
        "Few people believe that love is merely enough to raise their children rather than punishment. They think punishment is not only way to change off-springs behavior. Few children will turn to introvert if they are punished for subtle reasons and there is a possibility that they would not express their thoughts despite having good one in their mind.  To illustrate, recent article in Times of India states that 10 percent of children are afraid of their parents rather than showing respect. To sum it up, punishing children to few parents is not acceptable in this generation.",
        "Smacking is not agreed by certain people, I understand it, however, there are some positive effects with it. If the children are molded properly during their young age by hook or crook, they will come out with flying colors. Some children are very rude that parent finds no other way to control them. For example, a famous personality said: \"Indeed, Parents always have a right to punish children, for their bright future.\" To add it up few think that smacking will give temporary pain and fruitful result in long run.",
        "This essay argued that smacking children is inappropriate while some people still punish children physically. To Conclude, according to me, punishing the children in this 21st century does not seem to be civilized."
