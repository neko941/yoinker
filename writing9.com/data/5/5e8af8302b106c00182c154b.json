        "With the advancement in such modern technologies as TV as well as the Internet, it is quite acceptable to be aware of foreign states by staying at home. However, some argue that going on excursion is needed so as to acquire competency about other countries. I believe, although mass media suit budgets of individuals, travelling can help to gain expertise as well as ameliorate social skills.",
        "It is generally accepted that travelling is important in order to obtain experience, as people while travelling abroad are capable of discovering new culture and traditions for themselves. They are able to be familiar not only with the lifestyle of those foreign individuals, but also make some friends, who may make their journey remarkable and teach them a lot related to the history of particular state. Last year, for example, I have travelled to Venice, even though it was a short journey, I did improve my self-esteem and social skills by holding colloquy with local people. Furthermore, it was a good opportunity to unwind myself and be far away from clich\u00e9d routine.",
        "However, it is also valid to state that being informed about other countries through virtual world is even more pocket-friendly, as it provides us with credible data and image of certain state. Moreover, it does not require physical effort: hence, this is more conducive for the disabled. For example, the elderly who suffer from such particular afflictions as cardiovascular and gastrointestinal can struggle while travelling, so that social platforms would be better option for them.",
        "In conclusion, although we are given broadcast media, which can endow us with pleasure at some point, travelling has helped us considerably acknowledging sheer bliss in terms of meeting another society as well as accustoming oneself to alterations in life."
