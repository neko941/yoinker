        "From the first day, human interaction has played a very significant role in this life. We can't live without socializing with people; because everything in the world is a result of cooperating with others. But, interacting these days is not same before. It has changed due to one reason: technology. Technology now is in the hands of everyone, where easily can reach to any point globally. So how has technology affected this?",
        "At first, contacting was very simple and not complicated. For example, people had to visit each other to know the latest news about a certain subject or person. In other words, if you were living abroad, you wouldn't be able to communicate every day because it will take a very long time for your massage to reach.",
        "Nowadays, interacting is much easier that before. For instance, with just a phone call, you can know every single thing about every person in a country. Without spending much time, without losing effort, you can contact your friend that lives 4000 km away from you. That is a very huge development in this world.",
        "Is it positive or negative? we can know this by analyzing both sides. It can be positive because it makes everything easier and better. Also, it is too cheap so every person would hold a phone and talk. However, it can be negative because it is making people far a little bit from each other.",
        "In conclusion, I believe that everything has pros and cons. Technology is helping us in communication. But in the same time, we have to take care not to take its disadvantage so we can have the maximum benefit."
