        "Spaces allocated for parks seems to be smaller as population number is rising. Urban areas are directly affected as more and more people choose to spend their leisure time in parks. This essay will argue why parks should be not destroyed for  building houses instead.",
        "Public gardens are a necessity in the cities. Although many people  live in an apartment and work in offices, many choose fresh air when thinking to relax. For instance, in a city like Dubai, despite tall towers and buildings there are almost 100 parks with amenities that satisfy all ages , starting from infant to an old person. Parks had been a place where families and not only,  who live in the cities, choose to spend their free time.",
        "Government should look into the recreation garden situation and instead of choosing to increase the number of houses, I personally think that they should build taller buildings instead. In this way people can still live in the city, moreover, anyone can choose to stay near their home in a park rather then escaping into the villages. For example, a recent research had shown that in big cities people are choosing not to travel but to spend their free time in a park under open sky, just to avoid the crowd and time wasted on driving.",
        "This essay argued that recreation gardens like parks should not be replaced by dwells as more and more people choose a different way of entertainment  which can be find in it.  No matter how many will choose to live in urban areas , i consider that  trees, lakes and even a kids playground will be always welcomed in crowded areas like cities."
