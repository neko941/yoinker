        "Technology has come a long way, from desktops used solely in offices to laptops utilised universally. The internet, of course, is home to a plethora of information and universities are availing themselves to this tool. It is ,now, no longer a requirement to travel half way across the world to earn a better education. Students can learn from the comfort of their own homes as long as they have access to the internet. So, are there really any ramifications of universities offering such an option.",
        "Opponents of this development, would argue that universities are merely providing such courses to obtain an additional stream of income. That is to say, online courses aren't very effective and they are a scam. It is well known that you do not receive the exact same education you would, had you been physically present at college as the study materials provided online are insufficient. Moreover, clearing any concerns one might have is rather challenging and engaging in group activities ceases to exist.",
        "On the other hand, advocates of online courses consider it a blessing for numerous reasons. One of it being the cost. Learning a course online is much cheaper than having to travel abroad and pay for accommodation in addition to the astronomical tuition fees. This facility also allows students from all walks of life to have a chance at higher education. If an individual has a machine and a wifi connection, there is nothing getting in the way of expanding ones horizons. Furthermore, the prospect of working whilst  studying is very much possible. Since lessons can be learnt at ones own time and a strict schedule need not be adhered to, getting valuable experience from the real world is feasible as well.",
        "In conclusion, having carefully weighted the pros against the cons, I believe that universities offering this option is generous of them. While there maybe be short comings of self-studying the cost and time management of taking up online courses defeats them by a landslide."
