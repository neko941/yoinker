        "The increase in juvnile crime rate is major concern of the civilised society. The sizable protion of younge criminals belongs to poor families, where parents are not able to devote time for proper teaching to the children. I support the view that the crime rate can be controlled by proper parenting techniques.",
        "To begin with, the juvenile criminal are forces in to crime by circumstances due to lack of basic facility. They may not get proper food and clothes from poor gurdians, so they may resort to stealing of this things. Furthermore , the habit of stealing leads them eventually to bigger crime where the situation goes out of control and lend them in prison. For example, many juvenile home has criminal who has been caught shop lifting and goes to jail , where they come in contact with seasoned criminal and learn bigger crimes . Therefore,  if parents provides them with basic needs and good habits they will not travel on path of crime.",
        "On the other hand, the parental education and training is very important to impart good habits in children. The children learn what they observe therefore parents need to stop bad habits like drinking , smoking and using bad language in front of children, which is very common in slum areas or poor families. Thus, the majority of young person lands in criminal act by obersving their parents without giving much thought to consequences. To illustrate , many juvenile criminal admits that they have been resort crime by observing their parents drinking or gambling in front of them. So the education of parent is equally imporant as their children.",
        "I conlude that the young offendres are reflection of the community they have been borugh up. The government can focus on slum areas and poor people where they can be taught about basic parenting skills. To educated parent with proper parenting technique is the best way to stop rise in juvenile crime rates."
