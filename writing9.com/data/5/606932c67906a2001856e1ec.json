        "Most of individual like face to face interaction with teachers while others believe that  it is easy to learn in the group because it will provide them opportunity to share their ideas and discuss it in brief. In my opinion, the best mode of learning is in group as individual can develop critical thinking skills and gain more confidence to speak in public.",
        "Some people think that they are myriads of factors that supports group study. The one of most conspicuous factors from studying with three or four member. It will help to boost up the confidence while speaking in the public. There are number of people who are unsure how to talk in the front of audience.Besides this, when students study in the batch they can learn more easily just because of every individual have new ideas and each of them think in different way by sharing their views with each other they can learn more frequently. For example, in Sydney there are number of university which assigned group assignments to the students and working on the assignment they  learn  various things such as cooperation, time management and sharing.",
        "On the other hand, some people believes that face to face discussion with teachers and feedback from them help the individuals to improve over their mistakes. Moreover, it will help them to find out where they are lacking from and  tutors will suggest the ways so that they can overcome the problems which they are facing during their studies. For instances, in India when students prepare of competitive exams they  go for one-on-one discussion and then their mentors provide them instructions  in which they need  corrections.",
        "In conculsion, although taking classes from quailified examiner provides the platform to the individual  to give good performancein exam but doing study with the number of people have more advantages because  with that they can learn new things from others and  get intellectually strong."
