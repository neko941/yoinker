        "In this contemporary era, now individuals prefer to set up their own business rather than working as an employee. I think the main reason might be to work freely and to have a fame in employment profile, however it may have some demerits and I will elucidate my views in the subsequent fragments.",
        "It is ubiquitous that in this mad rat race life every person wishes to task without any stress and it is only possible if that person is an entrepreneur as these people can set their limits of work schedule and profit according to its own taste. What is more, people who are employers are respected by society a lot and they are also popular among politicians as well as among local people,for instance, Mukesh Ambani is one of the prominent personality in India and he is very popular among governmental authorities as well as among the dwellers of the country. So because of these two reasons people now want to have their own business.",
        "However, there are certain demerits, predominantly, the future in business life is uncertain, sometimes people gain so much profit that it took years to count money, but sometimes due to unforeseen circumstances such as natural calamities or emergency in country, these industrialists become bankrupt also. Secondly, lack of funds for infrastructure of buildings or for providing salary package can also become one of the major factor for collapsing of the business as employees prefer to trial efficiently only when they acquire high salary.",
        "To recapitulate, people these days want more fame and flex time work so that is why they prefer to have their own business however, there are certain cons of it."
