        "A number of criminals involve in evil task once they return from sentence. This essay clarifies why felons are repeating the illegal activities after returning from jail such as not getting opportunity; thereafter, it discusses the measures like ensuring participation in the economic activities of a country.",
        "One of the principal reasons is not getting opportunity to be the part of the community. The community treats these felons poorly, and the people never let them integrate to the society; therefore, criminals never get a better opportunity, although they may have excellent competence to perform various sort of tasks, which competence the society does not possess. Furthermore, there is no social integration program by the government in many parts of the world for these offenders, who have returned from jail. Consequently, criminals have no other option but repeating the crime. In Bangladesh, for instance, Police Association has published a report, which claims that 85% of the felons had committed crime again after fulfilling their sentence. Therefore, the issue of participating in criminal activities by the felons is justified.",
        "In contrast to crime, participating in economic activities is the major challenge for criminals.  Criminal are trained in the jail, but the government training during jail time will not provide fruit unless it has been ensured that the society accepts felons as citizens of a country; subsequently, the government need to play a significant role and ensure employment and integration. In England, for example, the government has an integration plan for lawbreakers, which has involved more than 30% criminals in the society in last 5 years. Consequently, these sorts of measures are required by the state.",
        "In conclusion, felons are taking part in illegal tasks due to lack of opportunity in the society. The government ought to participate and help them to be part of the society via providing employment according to their competence."
