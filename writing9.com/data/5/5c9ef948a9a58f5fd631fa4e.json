        "Education has always been of greatest concern eversince the beginning of human civilization for the same united purpose of complementing inherent human incompetence. As an apparent result, it is constantly updated with more diverse and inventive techniques, which leads to the abolishment of obsolete ones. Rote learning, which people are rather ambivalent towards, is one of these methods. The essay below will discuss both pros and cons of this technique.",
        "It is obvious that the very nature of teaching and learning is memorizing facts if closely observed. When it comes to academic subjects, students can by no means comprehend the whole abstract systemized knowledge all at once, therefore, imprinting merely the formulae, phonics or signals seems to be the only choice left. Take language learners for example, the first step all of them have to go through is learning by rote the alphabets, then words and sentence formation rules. This also has proved to work like a charm for young children who have unsophisticated perception. Moreover, a frequent reinforcement does more good than harm since human brain have to deal with knowledge fade, or in other word, it assists knowledge retainment. Recapitulation is prerequisite in this process, otherwise, the information people attempt to absorb will eventually fall into oblivion .",
        "On the other hand, when one enter higher education in hope to pursue advanced knowledge and more complexity, rote learning starts to rear its ugly head. The first manifestation lies in the applicability in the mastery of practical knowledge. Since learners comprehend such information solely by its superficial meaning and in the absence of different contexts in which it is used, they struggle to establish a system by themselves. Consequently, theoretical wisdom cannot bring about practicable applications, or even become time-wasting and fruitless. This approach is usually condemmed as \u201ccramming\u201d or \u201cspoonfeeding\u201d in countries that favour modern education.",
        "In conclusion, everything has its flaws, and that is when other educational methodologies come in handy, support different stages of learning and enhance the competency of people. In my opinion, the advantages and disadvantages of learning by heart are of equal significance and the users themselves need to be judicious to pursue their goals."
