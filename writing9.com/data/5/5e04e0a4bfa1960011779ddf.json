        "Nowadays, world poverty is not as severe as it used to in the last decade, but some of the developing countries still face to solve this problem.",
        "Some research indicates that \u2018dilemma of poverty\u2019 comes from the lack of education and the gender inequality. The shortage of \blearning leads to the shortage of choices in finding suitable paid jobs. Simple jobs like handy works are paid cheaper than skilled works. The money they earned is only used to buy for their own basic livings and no more for studying. Then it comes backward to the shortage of education. Poverty still comes in its round.",
        "My resolutions for reducing the poverty in the developing country governments are:",
        "First of all, reduce the difference in salary incomes of male and female labours. Though they have the same education level, men are often paid better than women. So, the economy is less attractive to the second half of the world who are still alive. If the unemployment is developed, the poverty, therefore, is raised.",
        "Second of all, pay more in literacy development with more attention to the girls and women, especially in the rural and the farthest sides of the country which hardly touch.",
        "Last but not least, give some assistances to some chosen areas which women are used more than men, such as traditional works like handicrafts, small agricultures or textiles\u2026"
