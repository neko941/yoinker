        "As societies have developed over time, we have witnessed lifestyle changes as well. This has also impacted the hobbies of the children, where they are now more inclined towards spending their time on computers playing games rather than indulging in physical activities such as sports. This has been due to easy access to computers which, in my opinion, has more drawbacks than benefits.",
        "Firstly, the primary reason for children being more occupied in front of their computer screens playing games is the easy availability of the said equipment. With advancements in technology, it is deemed absolutely necessary for any household to have a computer machine, whereas before these developments, children used to go out in the evening and get themselves occupied in physical activities. For example, a study conducted by Cambridge University suggested that the number of children who indulge themselves in sports after school have declined by considerable amount as compared to the children who were born and raised two decades back.",
        "Secondly, the parents are now more concerned about their children's safety therefore they prefer to keep them engaged in the activities where they are way less prone to physical injuries or any other dangers. What else can be considered to be safer than home? This is one of the other reasons why this trend has been on a hike.",
        "Finally, i believe that this is a negative development since the sports help children to become physically stronger, which helps them become healthy individuals. For instance, many of the sportsman such as Ronaldo and Wasim Akram have lived longer and healthier life than an average person. Moreover, sports also teaches important soft skills such as team management and working alongside people, which is absolutely important for any person.",
        "In conclusion, I beleive that the ease of availablity of computers and changed behaviour of the parents are the primary causes of this trend, however, the benefits associated with the sports are extremely important for one to be successful and healthy in future. Therefore, young ones should be encouraged to do more sports than playing computer games."
