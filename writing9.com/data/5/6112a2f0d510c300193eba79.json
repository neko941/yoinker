        "It is true that the fauna and flora is diminishing at an alarming rate. This essay will explain some underlying factors that give rise to this phenomenom and illustrate some solutions to tackle the problem.",
        "The devastating effects of industrialization, compounded with the increasing garbage from this process is being blamed for making plants and animals dying out. Forests, where used to be habitable for many rare and wild species, are being currently replaced by new invasive cities and buildings, thus directly displacing and killing them. Industrialization has also accumulated wastes produced from the manufacturing process, and some companies have deliberately littered it to rivers or sea. This has poisoned sea creatures, and the diversity of animals and plants has decreased as a result.",
        "In fact, the damage was calculated while some measures such as forcing companies to use alternative energy with no waste or banning deforestation have been given out in order to protect natural habitat, but some bureaucratic governments are never serious. To me, the most plausible solution is yourself. We, as individuals, could push our governments and companies to meet their commitment by only voting for politicians who are aware of environmental issues or only buying products from environment-oriented producers, so that these entities would be forced to care about the species\u2019 living zone. For example, voting for Joe Biden, who committed to protect the natural habitat as a mission in his presidency in the upcoming US election could be a great way to tackle the issue.",
        "Although many natural species are dying out, if we can identify the aforementioned reasons, and realize that each individual is a key, the problem can be solved."
