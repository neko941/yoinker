        "Nowadays,traffic congestion has become a global issue.To tackel this problem,some pepople think that law of enforcement agencies should provide free of cost transport round the clock.l partially agree with this given statement because I do not think that hit is a viable contribution to resolve the traffic jam problem",
        "Firstly,arangment of free vehicles for so many people for a long period mean direct effect of budget.to be more obvious ,it would be a huge burrdon on budget and certainly becomes difficult to manage .secondly , arranging transport at no cost will directely effect the comfort fector of passenger.when a large no of people rush towards govt.provided facility it would cause restless to the commuters and less fruquncy would cause ulong standing for passengers.again ,condition become worse and people will tend to use thier private vehical.for instance,Lahore is thickly populated city of Pakistan.here govt has started a program of metro bus service to attract the people towards public transport and to decrease the private automobiles on the road.but,this resulted complete failure for attaining the main goal.hence,this project became a white elephant for Pakistan burocracy.",
        "On the flip side,it would be more effective to construct wider roads as well as New network of roads to provide better Space for vehicals that would be a milestones in controling the low sepace problem.in addition ,law of enforcement agencies should keep in view the comfort of trevler as well as the frequency of buses and train but the charges should keep minmum as compeared to private conviance.so people will surely attrect towards government transport",
        "To sum up ,government should adopet the new mathods of construction roads and provion of viable transport for the ease of public at low cost rather than providing uncomfortable means of transport at no cost to make people more anoxious ."
