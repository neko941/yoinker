        "Every country is growing day by day and everyone prefers those countries which have a plethora of facilities. Countries are becoming more and more similar because people are able to buy the same products anywhere in the world and nowadays, it is easy to access every item in each country.",
        "To embark, I believe that it gives a positive impact or development because people are able to get their desirable items very easily without any barrier, they can get whatever and wherever they want, for example, a few days ago, one of my south indian friend, he visited me and want to eat 'Dosa' which is a special and traditional dish in the south, by a single search through the internet on my mobile, I found the specialized available restaurent of that food and ordered it for the dinner and made him propitiated. This clearly shows that due to gloabalised world, everything is possible and accessible.",
        "Similarly, this development creates a positive impact on our society, for instance, Apple iphone, it made in America, assembled in China and available throughout all over the world, moreover, technical staff for the repair and maintenence are available in every country, furthermore, it helps in the reduction of unemployment and it is contributing to strengthen the economy of the states, in addition to, if we take an example of clothes, shooes, watches, cars and other plenty of things of different brands of different countries so we can notice that anyone can purchase the international brands from their home country.",
        "In contrast, it may be some negative effects also, globalisation causes loss of cultures and diversities of many countries but taking the advantages in view, we have to accept this modernisation.",
        "To conclude, globalisation and similar way of life in different countries made life more luxuries and comfortable than in the past so this phenomenon should be accepted by many people among countries."
