        "In many countries today, there have been an increase in the time children spend playing video games with a reduction in physical activities.  This trend is due to inadequate parental guidance and it has deleterious health complications.",
        "A major reason why children spend more time on computer games is because of poor parental guidance. Many parents now have busy work schedule which has limited the time needed to supervise their children. Thus, they neither educate their children on the benefits of sports nor set limit on the use of mobile devices and computers. As a result, young ones are introduced by their peers to combative games for instance, Call of Duty which is designed by its programmers to be addictive. This has resulted in more time spent on video games.",
        "A significant development when children spend more time on video games rather than physical activities is health complications. These problems result from sedentary lifestyle associated with passive recreational activities. For example, in many industrialized countries, there have been a rise in childhood obesity and cardivascular diseases due to the inactive activities of young one. More so, animated games played on mobile phone may expose child to accidents as their awareness and response to the envronment is reduced. This would be avoided if children participated more in sports.",
        "In conclusion, the inadequate parent-to-child supervision makes children spend less time on physical activities and more time on video games, resulting in health problems. Efforts gear towards improving parental guidance should be encouraged."
