        "Massive migration of young people into metropolitan cities in an attempt to find a better life is a major concern in many countries. As more and more young people are leaving the countryside, average age in many rural villages have raised considerably. This demographic change may have serous consequences and should be adressed urgently.",
        "The results of negetive migration of young men and women from periphral areas have drastic effects on the economical situation. Since the vast majority of these areas rely on blue color workers performing manual labour, many factories and farm owners can not find enough working hands to perform the required job. As a consequences many buisnesses are loosing money and are forced to shut down. Another main problem lies in the fact the increased average age lead to higher needs for medical and social support which, in turn, further increase the finicial burden on the city expensses.",
        "Despite the above mentioned, the are several changes which could be made in order to reverse these trends. Initially increasing work places options, especially for people with academic education such as university personal or engeneers, may shift the tide and cause people to stay. Also improving the local education system may convince many children bearing families to remain in te countryside. Finally, tax reduction and social benefits may also assist these peripheal areas and convince people to remain.",
        "In conclusion, negetive migration from the countryside to major cities is an international concern and have severe social and economical effects. Despte that, there are ways where we can change the tide soo people will stay and enjoy its beuty."
