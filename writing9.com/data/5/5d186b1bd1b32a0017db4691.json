In many cases, people being monitored are unaware that this is happening. Do you think the advantages of this development outweigh the disadvantages?",

        "It is true that the prevalence of technology use in tracking people\u2019s communication and behaviour with the help of cellphones or security cameras has become increasingly popular around the world in recent years. Although this trend exerts negative effects on our daily life to certain extent, the advantages it offers are even more significant than its disadvantages.",
        "On the one hand, the act of using tracking devices to monitor whatever people say or do has several obvious drawbacks to their lives. First, this practice partly restricts humans\u2019 freedom as well as invades their privacy. For instance, people are likely to feel less free and comfortable to do daily tasks when they know to be watched all the time by others. As a result, this acts as a deterrent for people to enjoy their lives fully. Moreover, if such personal information collected from supervising equipments leaked out and are utilized for wrong purposes , citizens would even have to suffer from more serious dangers such as blackmail. This, in turn, could certainly trigger great concerns for national residents, also lead to their annoyance and strong oppose to those technological facilities.",
        "On the other hand, there are more important benefits of using technology to follow people\u2019s behaviours. One of these advantages is that it makes enormous contribution to investigating process and punishment crime of the police. For example, records from surveillance cameras could greatly assist the police to trace back criminals much easier and faster or prosecute them with more compelling evidence in court. In addition, when people realized that they are videotaped or recorded all the time, they have tendency to be more thoughtful of every action. For instance, the presence of CCTV everywhere discourages petty criminals such as shoplifters and pickpockets from committing offences for the fear of being recognised by others. This, as a result, acts as an incentive for humans\u2019 better behaviours, which benefits not only individuals but also the society as a whole.",
        "In conclusion, the use of technology to monitor every gesture and action of residents by enhanced security brings about more benefits than drawbacks. I recommend that those technologies should be developed better in the future."
