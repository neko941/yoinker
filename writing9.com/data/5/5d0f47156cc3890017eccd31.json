        "Some people believe that teachers have responsibility to expel disruptive children from the class in order not disturb other children. In my opinion, it is not appropriate way to treat them and it can lead them to be worse not only in the school but also in their future. There are another appropriate way for best solutions this problems.",
        "Firstly, expelling the bad children from the class is not have any advantages for them and the class as well, even though sometimes it can also lead to negative influence.",
        "According to the nature of kids, no children possess such a kind of behavior as an inherent. If one child has such a kind of character, it can be assumed that they grew up in a family in which they had never learnt how to communicate with the society and how to help the society since they had born. As a consequences, they become aggressive and disruptive children to their environment. Our society, especially teachers, should help them in the school rather than doing some inappropriate method, for instance, asking them to leave the class or ignorance them.",
        "Furthermore, there are some effective solving methods dealing with such a kind of misconduct by children. Teachers should emphasis on monitoring them and guide them. By that it means, teacher should let them to involve in some school activities so that those children notice that they are taken care by their teacher and other students and they can learn some good characters from other children. Besides, teacher should make other students to understand and help, for instance, inviting them to participate in sport or asking them to sing or dance together rather than neglecting them. As a consequence, they will feel more happy, secure and confidence in their neighboring",
        "In conclusion, the bad behavior of children are not their inherent. Teachers should not treat them to become the reckless person in society.  The duty of teacher are to teach all the children to become a good person for community."
