        "The use of nuclear technology has been debating over the years due to the effect of its applications. Many people believe that nuclear power is bad for human health but some people believe that it provides cheap and clean energy and the benefit of nuclear technology provides better advantages than disadvantages. I agree that nuclear technology provides more advantage than disadvantages and I will explain my reasons.",
        "The introduction on nuclear technology in the medical field and drastically improve human\u2019s health. The application of X-Ray in the medical field has enable the doctors to diagnose their patient and provide accurate treatment. The basic usage of X-Ray on human chest allows the doctor to check on patient lung\u2019s condition or if there\u2019s any infection. On a more advance technology, usage of X-Ray on human brain allow doctors to check if there\u2019s any blood clog in the brain which may impact the patient intelligence. Patient who suffers from accident will need to go though X-Ray to check for any internal organ damage and bone fracture. From the X-Ray image, doctors and provide better treatment for the patient.",
        "X-Ray has also been widely used in the food industry. X-Ray has been used in the food industry to detect foreign material inside the packed food or beverage. Before the introduction of X-Ray, most food and beverage manufacturers only use metal detector which only limits to the detection of ferrous, non-ferrous and stainless steel. However, with the introduction of X-Ray, non-metallic foreign materials can be detected such as glass, ceramic and stone. All these foreign materials can be a potential hazard or chocking hazard if accidently consumed by people. Company may suffer huge losses due to customer complaint or any product recalls.",
        "In conclusion, the benefit of nuclear technology has far outright the disadvantages. The usage of nuclear technology in the medical industry has proven to improve human\u2019s health and reduce complaint and food recalls due to foreign material found."
