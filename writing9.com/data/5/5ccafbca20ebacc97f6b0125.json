        "The quality of life in large cities is decreasing. If something is not done to combat this issue, the quality of life will continue on decreasing.",
        "More and more people move into large cities in order to avail the facilities which smaller cities don\u2019t provide as much. Larger cities have more job opportunities for people,and provide\u00a0 more health care facilities, more educational facilities, and more entertainment. However, as more people start moving into large cities, the demands of people start to outweigh the supply. In Dubai, where I live, for example, so many people had moved into the city last year that there were more people and less housing units to facilitate them. When the demand becomes more than the supply,\u00a0 the price of everything starts to rise.\u00a0 Therfore, the rents started to reach the peaks. This forced people who wernt able to afford the skyrocketing rents to move into smaller and cheaper apartments, or to go on sharing apartments with one or more families. Supply demand imbalance has also caused food to become more expensive, forcing people to go for alternative, cheaper products of lower quality.",
        "If we start to work now, we can help improve the quality of life in big cities in the near future. Construction companies need to plan ahead and start constructing more housing units from now. Furthermore, more of local food should be produced in the country to provide people with cheaper food alternatives in the growing market",
        "In conclusion, larger cities have lower the standard of life for many. However, if we start to work now, we would be able to combat this problem in the near future"
