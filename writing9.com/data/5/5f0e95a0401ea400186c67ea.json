        "Like it is generally agreed always, on a continuously changing world, ways of affecting people can be shaped various. Peoples that are living on the planet with an advanced media industry consume visually products rather than written things. This essay will argue why some people have been choosing from new kind of technologies about communicating from visual kind of things such as photography or film and why the written things such as mail and newspaper always will be chosen by old generations and will not to be chosen by young generations.",
        "As a matter of fact, in a new brave world, people behaviours are changing. Human instinct loves to express his/her personality with communicating tools to other humans which are their friends, relatives, neighbours or communities that have contacts with his/her. And an impressive video, picture or photo may cause an effect more than a long written essay about himself or herself. If we think social media that is a very good example of this, one picture can tell us a lot of thoughts, feelings and ideas swiftly because time is the key element of this generation. They do not want to lose time for anything like takes fifteen minutes or half an hour for reading something. A shot will give you the idea or feeling in seconds.",
        "However, some people from older generations never abandon the idea of the best way to telling a story is writing. For instance, all good books are written. Of course, reading a book will take time but, most of the people who love to read see that like a pleasure of life. Also reading a newspaper can be a pleasure for some people for example on the bus while going to a job. So it depends on what kind of habits or addictions do you have about contacting people. The modern world and older world react differently on this situation.",
        "This essay argued that, on a changing modern world,  people need to understand that the admires of generations could be questionable from which side do you want to look, some say speed is everything so we need to use visual tools to communicate, on the other hand, some say old school always the best so we need to use already known way to contact and no need to hurry. In my opinion that is a choice which people decide by himself or herself through the way of desires of human nature."
