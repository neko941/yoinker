        "In this contemporary era, news plays an crucial role in every individual\u2019s life. It is very vital for folks to gain information about the world. However, there is both good and bad news , both are equally important.",
        "On the one hand, humans cannot live without news. The first and foremost is that common people should have knowledge about what is happening in the world, what is going on in the share markets . Moreover , they can also know about which new rules that high authority will brought into action. Secondly, news are very beneficial for adults to gain a general skills, which is needed for every person. Due to this they can improve their reading skills, vocabulary, comprehension and brain connectivity. For example, a survey taken by the Time US newspaper, in America in 2016, was that 87% of the majority focus on the good news.",
        "On the other hand, some bad news are also very good for human beings. Firstly, in the news, youngsters should know about how bad the community  in this nation who killed and steal humans just for money. Secondly, most  TV channel shows bad news on television and the internet such as bank robbery, murders, thief, big accident, wrong information and bad things on it. Which gives a negative effect on children and elders. They do as they see and hear news. To illustrate, a survey taken by the Time of Newyork newspaper, in America in 2018, was that bad news has increased from 64% to 78% in the past 4 years.",
        "In my opinion, both news are very good for the public. As bad news can depress a few people with negative content and good news can motivate a few people human with positive content. So media should focus on both bad and good news.",
        "In conclusion, I want to reiterate my words that good news gives a general and basic knowledge of words, study, games and culture related, but it is also gives a negative impact on adult's minds."
