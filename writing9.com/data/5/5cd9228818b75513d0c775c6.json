        "These days, raising the question of whether universities should be opend to everyone, regardless of their ages nor their academic performances, or it should remain a place for well-qualified students. Although only accepting for top higher-score students is prominent, I believe that university-level education might be acceptable for people with all ages.",
        "There are a host of reasons why universities want to filter out its students by academic performance. Firstly, to gain specialized knowledge, students have to possess the good general knowledge they desire to apply, which is assessed by passing the examinations with flying colours. Technical fields as an example, to program a software, IT-ers might be proficient in programming language theories and algorithm as well, which only well-qualified students could meet. Secondly, the academic barrier partly helps students reduce their time and money waste. This is because if they insist on applying to the universities whose courses are too rigorious for them, leading to the fact that they feel disappointed or even be dropped out.",
        "However, university should be opened for all applicants regardless of their ages and their abilities. This is due to lack of study opportunities in the past, which is as a result of wars or family background. In fact, every year, there are lots of adults taking the university entrance exams in Vietnam as they did not have money or time so as to go to the university when they were younger. What is more, the results of admission exams accurately evaluate one\u2019s abilities that are determined by factors such as experience, communication. The proven clues is that Harvard university approve the appliciants as long as they expressed their determination and persuasion. As a result, students who graduate from this place, are almost succeed.",
        "In conclusion, I believe that universities accept the candidates without consideration of their academic performances is more imporatant than choosing outstanding students."
