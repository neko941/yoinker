        "For the past few decades, the historians have noticed young generation forgetting their ancestor\u2019s culture and tradition that had been applied for centuries. Some puzzled the reason of this forgotten valuable history. There are a few possible factors for this issue.",
        "First of all, the advancement of smart technology has had caused the youth to indulge into these gadgets instead of learning about their roots. Thanks to the enhancement of the cyber world, the world is changing in every aspects of life almost constantly. Shockingly, the people tend to hook up in social media are becoming obsessed with these so called \u2018trends\u2019. Therefore, these trends slowly extinguished the flames of the belief and heritage in the young\u2019s mind. For instance, the humble traditional saree clothing has been modernized to point the clothes is merely plain bra and long skirts and apparently this style of wear is known to be stylish, sadly. Besides that, children these days are less exposed to these unique tradition by their own parents because of their hectic working life. In turn, by the time they grow older, it will too late for the parent to instill these values onto them.",
        "In my opinion, it is clearly a negative development to the society as adolescent tend to be attracted by the exhilarating yet rotten ways of thinking. Furthermore, the moral values that have been held up for so long by past descendants will be diminished into a thin air. As an example, these youngsters are prone to involve in horrifying activities such as vandalism, gangsterism, and drug abuse.",
        "To sum up, I strongly advocate that the loss of these magnificent culture will only jeopardise the future of this future generation. Therefore, instilling the value of the heritage is absolutely crucial especially in this era."
