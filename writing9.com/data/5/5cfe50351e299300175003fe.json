        "First of all, information is that thing which is fruitful to everyone in different aspects such as scientific research, business and the acedemic world. Having information is a good source of knowledge, therefore, it is beneficial to share as much as information as possible. I agree that some information is too paramount and too valuable to be shared freely.",
        "To embark that I believe, information plays a vital role in everyone's life because it helps a lot in every circumstances, for example, from acedemic perspective, teachers should give different informations on a daily basis to student because it enhances their knowledge and it may help in developing their way of thinking. From business perspective, for instance, if someone has a plethora of knowledge of business then he will never be scared before starting a new business, moreover he would already know about either his business will reach at its highest level or not.",
        "On the flip side of the coin, it is generally believed that some information is too important to be shared freely. For illustration, an information of a good touch or a bad touch which is usually given to children is too valuable to be shared freely because this information is paramount for children because they do not know about this information in their childhood, furthermore, informations about their own nation must be given freely to children. In addition to this , information about trafic rules should be given at free of cost since childhood because it reduces the accidents.",
        "To sum up, some general informations which must be known by everyone should be given freely, otherwise, the information in the acedemic world and scientific research should be given at some cost."
