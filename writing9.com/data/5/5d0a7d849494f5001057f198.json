        "While some individual are of the opinion that the goal of tertiary  education is to help degree holders get  well paying jobs,others  believe that   greater benefits    for both  individuals and society  at large  are  gotten in  graduating from a university . I am of the opinion that there are far reaching  advantages  seen when people are done  with  studying in higher   learning  centres as it improves the Gross Domestic Product of a nation as well as a rise in  healthy state of its dwellers.",
        "On the one hand, some persons opine that being a degree holder secures a luxuriant job. In other words, when they pass out from higher institutions, they end up clinching great working opportunities as a result of the  courses they studied in school. For example, most Medical Doctors bag a well paying work  upon graduation from the university because  of the professional courses they read  in the university.",
        "",
        "On the other hand , a lot of others are of the view that there are wider benefits to be gotten from tertiary institutions  which are  beneficial to both the masses and to the society and i agree . Firstly, it increases the revenue of a country. As a result of the professionals and skilled man power of the nation,  they produce products which are taxed. This,therefore  generates more money for the nation . This is further  simplified in  Shoe plaza located in Aba,Abia state. Here,a lot of the artisans are graduates from various universities where they learned shoe production . The government places a certain amount of money as tax on the products and this  yields money in return, elevating its  financial  status",
        "Secondly,  an advancement in the health status of the masses is seen. Since a lot of  professionals such as medical Doctors are   always available, a lot of medical interventions such as outreaches,sensitization programmes   are put in  place to enlighten the masses about     ways of preventing various ailments, thus reducing morbidity rate .",
        "In conclusion , while people may  vary in views, i am of the opinion that tertiary education has a wide range of  benefits to the masses and to the state as the economic status of a state is improved as well as an  increase in the  health status of the masses ."
