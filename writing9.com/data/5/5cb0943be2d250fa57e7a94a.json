        "There is a believe which says that our personality is destined at the time when we born and the affect of our growing live on our personality is small. I believe that our experience, development and other factors of our growing life has more influence on our personality and in this essay I will explain why.",
        "First of all the characteristics that we born with can be easily changed during our growing life. For example, I grow with many friends and one of my friends in particular was very active and communicated with more people than I did but after years he became less sociable and quiet. There are many other examples which support this point. Such changes may occur due the many reasons.",
        "There are plenty of factors that could change our personality. We experience many changes in our lifes and the reason for them is environment in which we grow or people that we communicate with. Sometimes our cultural background can affect us too.",
        "However, our personality could be affected by our ancestors. For instance, we gain some of our personality treats from our parents or grandparents same way as we gain our appearance and looks from them. Nevertheless, this influence does not affect us more than any other factor",
        "In conclusion, I should say that all the factors could affect us in the same way and it is hard to call one factor more influencal. But it is not destined at the time we born because during the our life it can change whether we want it or not."
