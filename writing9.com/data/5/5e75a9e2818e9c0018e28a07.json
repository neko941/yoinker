        "Mobile phones bring many convenient to our fast-paced society. However, the usage also direct attention to the many that concern on the underlying problems. This essay will discuss those hiden issues related to society and health, and why I am totally agreed to cell phones bring less advantages.",
        "First, with the vast amount of social apps such as Facebook, Instagram and among others are connecting us more than before. Those apps installed on a mobile phone that has equipped with Camera, Video and GPS, has changed the way we connect with our close one. When we update status like on vacation, on shopping and on the gym, this has posted a huge risk to ourself that someone with bad intention will follow us. For instance, news had reported a young girl posted her selfie at one of the shopping center in Kuala Lumpur with GPS enabled, the girl was raped by a group of 4 strong men in the nearby car park.",
        "Next, mobile phones once considered as telecommunication tools, expensive, and heavy, but now it has made us do more wonders. Because mobile phones are so afforable, which fully installed with quality lens, touch screen, and light weight, that every walks of life are having it, we are so used to have a mobile phone with us irregardless of where we are. Some kids, for example, without the control from parents have installed many different kind of games. As mums and dads are busy with their works, they leave their children with cell phone. These kids are always spending excessive time through the week on the small screen. Therefore, it is very common to see young patients being diagnosed with eye related problems.",
        "In my opinion, portable phone should have controlled by all parties. If we let the problems persist without regulation, I will foresee the crime rate and diseases are getting worse. As a result, the disadvantages is overtaking the advantages that cell phone can do to us."
