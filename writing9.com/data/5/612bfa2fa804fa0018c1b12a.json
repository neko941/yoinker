        "Issued related to failure and its coping mechanism are frequently being discussed these days. Growing concerns are becoming heated questions among the people that acceptance is the key to stay satisfied during crisis situation in life. While this view is rubbished by some critics who oppose it. Both sides have their logic to support their opinion which will be discussed in this dissertation before coming to any conclusion.",
        "As fas as the matter is concerned , I would like to stamp the mark on the view that acknowledging the reason behind the failure has a remarkable impact on the people. The first and foremost point that strikes my mind is that it helps you to know the reasons why it happened and what happened. This helps you to fight stronger and to stay focus towards your goal. Another noteworthy notation which caters our attention is that it boosts your level of introspecting yourself which in turn aids in improvement and structured lifestyle. This matter can be explained precisely by citing an example of a survey conducted by The Hindustan Times. It reported that majority of graduates were not satisfied from their jobs and salary and it was the biggest reason for them to jump from one job to another which lead to instability in life.",
        "Probing ahead, another aspect of this matter deals with its opposite side. Some people are in favour of seeking different options in life to come out of such failures. Firstly, to know where you want to see yourself and to know your strengths. This way such humans will be able to move in direction of what will gauze them satisfaction. In addition to this , with the advancement and increasing platforms which help to sell talent, people should pursue them as a part time job which not only help them to gain extra income but will also keep them happy.",
        "After cogitating on a great deal of thought and discussion the conclusion to be drawn here is that everything has its own significant value what is required is to have an optimistic approach and a positive attitude. Therefore, People should consider introspecting themselves for the reason behind their unhappiness and cross these barrier by not just acknowledging but also by finding means to overcome them."
