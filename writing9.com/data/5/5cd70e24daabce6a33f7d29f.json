        "The important of education to any nation cannot be overemphasized. These days an increasing numbers of people are opting to travel abroad to obtain college and university degree. This essay will argue that the advantages of studying abroad greatly outweigh the drawbacks.",
        "Admittedly, there are some minor disadvantages with the choice of traveling overseas for study. First and foremost, most students struggle to effectively communicate with the tutors and the people. This language barriers hinders their progress and it could also result in a major academic setback. As an example, most Nigerians who traveled to Spain for study, get discouraged and return home owing to their inability to comprehend the message being pass across in classes and where they live. Another drawback is loneliness. In other words, they are all alone in a strange land without the usual close connection with friends and families. If not closely monitored, the loneliness could result to been homesick. Because of this, it is apparent why communication issues and staying alone could be considered at a problem of overseas study.",
        "",
        "Despite the disadvantages above, I believe that the benefits of study in a foreign country are immense because it broaden horizon. Undergraduates are able to learn new cultural and social life of the host country. Upon graduation, not only will they receive a foreign degree from an institution, but also vast knowledge of what is obtainable in the nation. This is supported by a recent study conducted in India, in which social skills of those who studied overseas and those who did not where analyzed with AI, findings revealed that having foreign study experience provide greater insight to issues of home nation.In addition, it sets the graduate higher than others in the local job market. People with international degrees are considered first during recruitment at the expense of those who obtained their degrees in local universities or colleges. Thus, studying abroad offers advantage when seeking for job and it improves knowledge.",
        "In summary, while studying outside country of birth has the disadvantages of language barrier and being alone, I hold the view that the gain are greater than the minor demerits."
