        "Nowadays, world is suffering from traffic congestion. To eradicate this problem, many countries spent huge amount of money for the easier usage of bicycle. In my opinion, Yes, bicycle usage is the best solution. As it reduce traffic and accidents and moreover, they are environmental friendly.",
        "To embark upon, road accidents and traffic problems are the major issues of any countries in the world. Driving vehicles on a high speeds leads to road accidents. People drive on a high speed to reach quickly to their destination but a small miss calculation on road results into accidents. One clear example, In India approximately 8 road accidents happens daily. The usage of vehicles are more and more due to which there is so much traffic on roads. especially, during peak hours.",
        "the usage of bicycles for sure lower the rate of traffic problem and also road accidents. Bicycles does not need a space like other vehicle. One of the clear example is the space which two vehicle occupies it can easily replaced by the more than eight bicycles. Eight bicycles can be ride at the same time on the road by replacing two vehicles. Further more, speed limit of bicycles is very less as a results there would not be any road accidents. Bicycles does not release harmful smoke like other vehicles they are environmental friendly.",
        "To conclude, I would like to reiterate that for healthy life for a citizen. Government should spend good amount for the comfortable usage of bicycles as they reduce major road accidents and traffic jams and furthermore they are the best solution in term of keeping environment clear and healthy."
