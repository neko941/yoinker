        "Recently, there is an increase in the number of shopping malls opened for a long period of time in many countries. In my opinion, it has pro's and con's on both the buyers and the neighborhood in equal measure.",
        "The increased number of shopping hours promotes convenience for the shoppers and more job opportunities in  the local community. People can purchase items at any time that is feasible for them which helps them to keep up with the hectic work schedule everyone faces in today's era. For example, a student who also works may need to visit the mall at odd hours due to time constraint. More so, shop owners will require more labour to cope with these long hours thereby promoting employment. These jobs which are usually done in shifts are flexible and enables people to have more than one job or even work while studying. Thus, this trend becomes a positive development to the shoppers and local community alike.",
        "However, the high criminal risk to the shoppers and increased financial burden to the local community are the drawbacks. Firstly, shopping especially at odd hours poses danger on the shoppers due to exposure to robbery attacks, kidnapping and other forms of vices. To elucidate, the Nigerian police department in 2018 has warned that the increased number of hours shops are opened has concurrently led crime rate to 70% as against the 20% seen in 2017.Furthermore,financial burden is placed on the local community due to services such as security and traffic regulation which must be maintained to cope with long operational hours in shopping centers. The above makes it a negative development.",
        "To conclude, the increase in shopping hours which promotes convenience and employment also at the same time increases crime rate and financial burden on both the shoppers and neighborhood  on equal scale. Therefore, it is essential for nations to weigh both sides before imbibing it into their society"
