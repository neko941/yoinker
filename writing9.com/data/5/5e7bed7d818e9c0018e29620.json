        "As we look into our surrounding people we realise that each individual varies in accepting different situations in different ways. Some think accepting the situation as it is, no matter how bad the situation is would be a right thing to do. While some argue that it's better to overcome the situation by taking certain measures. This essay will discuss about the contradictory view that people have upon handling certain situations.",
        "On one hand, accepting things how they are is a preferable choice for most of them. This category of people develops this mindset because of their current circumstances and not taking risk attitude. They feel taking action would further spoil their current situation and try to adjust to things as they are. Most of the employees don't change their job even though if they're paid less because they are not certain about how the future job would be and try to comfort themselves in their current jobs.",
        "On the other hand, putting efforts to change things which aren't favourable is most likely choice for some of them. Trying to take measures to improve the situation gives them immense satisfaction which can further makes their lives better. For instance, When i was unhappy with my boss behaviour towards me, i straight away confessed to him and as my boss took it sportively he understood his fault and never repeated again which made my job easier.",
        "So, is to better to react or adjust? Well, it upon each individual, but from my personal experiences i rather prefer to react than adjusting myself to a given situation. Adjusting to things will not change them further and lead to dissatisfaction. But when you take enough action to change things, you might end up being happy and would never regret about the actions that you take."
