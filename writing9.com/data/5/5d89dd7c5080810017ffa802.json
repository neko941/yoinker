        "Increasing trend of international sports competition increased the value of sports person which reflects in their earning and that since to be unfair. Compared to other professions whereas for some people it is justified this essay elaborated both views to draw logical conclusion",
        "Today, sport has become a popular profession were the youngsters follow them. To such an extend that most sports persons has gained their own brand value. It is true that the carrier spam of every sports person confined to the consistency of their performances and the earning during that period has to cover their life. In a real sense, the successful sports person has attended such level with their endless efforts,  sacrificing their family life and many deserving expect of life. The earning and the prizes are their hard earn amounts and that credit cannot be taken from them. They represent their nation and gain, name and frame for self as well as nationally. Too rich to the national level all sports people clear many competition barriers which justify their earnings.",
        "On the other sides, a group of people considers those huge earnings as unfair when they compare the level of earning other important professions. To quote an example of a soldier who risk his life for the sake of the nation and a sports person only risk their careers but the earning gets multifolded on since logically unfair. It is seen that many sports people who get sudden exposure of money either get into their wrong practises or get blind folded with the money. Such sports person start living the life of a celebrity and gets digressed from their sports performances. The sportsman some time getting to Marseille practices like match fixing and ruins the state of the nation. Certain reknown cricketers of the country like India, South Africa and Pakistan got into such practice which shatters the confidence of sports lovers.",
        "It is true that the earning of sports person is unfair if the take undue advantage of sports being gentelment's game most sports person claim with integrity to eareds nations justifies their earning."
