        "An increasing number of people believed that animals should be treat well as humans and they are having the same right as mankind. However, others think that it is necessary for humans to use animals to fulfill our daily needs such as food, clothes and doing experiment. Both perspective contain the same right but I personally support with the first thinking.",
        "First and foremost, it is commonly believed that animals can develop the same emotion as humans, thus, people are not allow to use them in any kind of activities. Furthermore, animals are able to fell pain, worry, depress and etc while torment by humans. To illustrate, when a younger horse is being attack by humans, it's mother will definitely worry about it and try the best to protect the younger horse.",
        "Nevertheless, some people support the opinion that humans need to use the sources on animals to produce our daily needs. Skin on animals namely crocodile, cow and snake are able to produce clothes, wallets and shoes that are necessary for humans to use. In addition, chicken meat, beef and fish contain the nutrients which humans needs to consume everyday. Therefore, animals must be employ by mankind.",
        "From my point of view, I think that humans should being nice to animals. Other than that, our technology is become more advance compare to last time, hence, it is possible to produce vitamin that contain the same nutrients as animals.",
        "In the conclusion, humans have the responsibility to protect and being nice to animals as they are also a life which is valuable as humans."
