        "Day by day means of transportation is developing, for the reason of it the products all over the world may be sent in a few days. We can't stop the progress even if we want. But I can say without any doubt, exchange of goods among the countries has a significant role today's life of the population of the planet. The first one is it may lead healthy competition between different brands. For example, Coca-Cola and Pepsi. These companies always have contention. The first brand is international and the latter is national. Our native company increased the quality of the sparked water. In other words, the consumers  usually believed to have a good product as a result of completion. Now many people in Uzbekistan prefer Pepsi than Coca-Cola because of its major advantages.The other pro of having the same backwash in dissimilar societies. As a reason of this process, a choice of various things among the people. The A-list means that buyer can afford the product relying on his mount of money. If he does not have much income he will buy cheaper products for his expenses. For example, it is statistically proved the poor constantly buy Chinese goods and the well-purchased can accept the things made in the USA, Russia or the highly qualified outcomes of China. As a conclusion, I can state that we are gifted to be able to get everything from other parts of the world."
