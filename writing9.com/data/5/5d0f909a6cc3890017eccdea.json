        "In many countries, there is an immense income disparity among people.  There are some masses are earning astronomical salaries.  While it is believed by some that this distribution of money is beneficial for the nations, others opine that renumeration should not be allowed by the authorities after a specific level.  In my opinion, having high salary is a sign of a country's wealth;  However, limiting high salary would bring more equality.",
        "Surplus rationale are there to substantiate the idea to allow people to pay extremely high salaries is valuable for the country. One of the benefits is, excessively high wages can incline the brain drain from overseas.  To make it more clear, people who are highly skilled and talented, like to go to that country where more salaries are got.  In a recent survey it has been revealed that many foreign employees in Belgium, who have proficiency , make a major contribution to the country's growth.  Another benefit worth mentioning is,  more taxes are paid by high-income people, which can lead to thrive economics. To add up, more renumeration will be provided by national authorities for poverty and specially abled people through income tax revenues by erecting more hight quality infrastructure such as education and health system and shelters.  Consequently, significant high payments would be benefits everyone.",
        "On the other hand, salary levels should be framed by the governments  Primarily, competitiveness beyond a certain point can make human life awful if the salary could not be checked and the authorities from the intense competition it creates along the giant disparity of incomes in a society . Hence, masses get into the rat race and compare them with others rather than enjoying what they already have. Ultimately, this mentality results in stress and tension. Secondarily, the wide range of income can lead to criminal activities. This is owing to the fact that the poor people would find it extremely difficult to earn high salaries through legal means,  and might get enticed into traps of easy money. Therefore, greater equality could be that poverty and crime rate fall if the government should not let wages being higher than a definite level.",
        "To conclude, although the enormously high salary may benefit a certain section of the society, it leads to unhealthy competition and a spurt in criminal activities. Thus, in my opinion, it would be better, on balance, for governments to set a limit on the highest earners in community."
