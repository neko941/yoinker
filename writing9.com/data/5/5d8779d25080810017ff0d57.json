        "In this modern world, every nation want to reach on the moon and mars. However some people opine that it is better to spent money on other things insted of space exploration. I certainly agree with this notion which i will discuss in the following paragraph.",
        "To begin with, it can not be denied that we are living in the era of technology where few countries like china and america has reched to the moon and they are also leading countries in terms of space  exploration as well. However, it is a also fact that there are number of countries in the world which are very poor and in some areas of these countries people are starving for food and water so it is more ethical to spend  money on such countries and area. For example, in my country India large number of pople lives in below poverty which means they don\u2019t have enough food to eat and also they can not access good medical facilities as well.",
        "Furthermore, government spend money on basic needs it helps to nation to grow in everyfield. For instance, if peoples are more educated and physical fit then they can work hard for country and helps to increase productivity of country",
        "To conclude, it is a fact that to compete with other nations it is very necessary to top in every field but basic needs is more important than any other things as we are humans and to be physical fit and educated its our first priority any thing else."
