        "There is no denying technology is ubiquitous, omnipresent and touches pretty much every aspect of our life. The original intention of technology is to make our life more comfortable and easier. However, advance technology brings forth negative effects, and the most obvious and detrimental impact are environment and relationship degradation. I can\u2019t find any option other than to argue that the benefits will outweigh the negatives if we omit technology from our daily routine.",
        "To begin with, technologically advanced urban arearesponsible for more than 90 % of global greenhouse gas emissions and transportation contribute for a large portion of that. This makes the planet\u2019s overall temperature rise, and causes extreme weather events like drought to happen more often. More often than not, whenever the earth gets damaged, the deleterious effects are always irreversible.",
        "Subsequently, with the rise of the internet and social media, we spend too much time isolating ourselves and disconnecting from the real world in order to maintain the perception of being connected. Studies show that people would rather spend hours on social media websites than to join clubs and organisation to make real friends. Technology was supposed to connect us, but we\u2019re more disconnected than ever.",
        "Last of course not least, technology like Artificial Intelligence (AI) has reduced humans need to undertake mundane or laborious, yet machines do not have any emotions or moral values as human does. There is a real danger of AI increases unemployment if machines can do a job more efficient and at less cost. Experts predicted that around 5 millions jobs will be lost to AI over next five years.",
        "Based on the evidence and examples I have presented, I am strongly inclined to conclude that technology brings more harm than good."
