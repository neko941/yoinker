        "On the one hand, it is undeniable that several actions should be taken as soon as possible for preserving natural resources. Around the world, most industries are using fossil fuels to manufacture their productions, which ultimately will lead to the depletion of these resources. If global institutions required countries to give their agreements on reducing the amount of gas or oil used every day, there would be few responses from countries unless there was another resource to alternate. Thus, a series of actions would help to obtain the fuels usage reduction of all countries. It would be from conducting a wide range of campaigns to raise public awareness and producing a more effective system to take advance of unlimited natural resource such as Sun\u2019s heat to be the more cost-effective alternative source. As a result, all countries will gradually switch from limited sources to this kind of energy.",
        "On the other hand, encouraging people to use fuel-effective devices and vehicles would be a better solution instead of forcing countries as a whole to reduce their consumption. While gas and oil still play a critical role, many countries have launched new products to help reduce the amount of resources needed to use. Hence, global citizens should also take responsibility by switch to these innovations. For example, using electric, pedal bicycle and fuel-effective car instead of older version of motorbike and car.",
        "I personally believe that actions on lessening the fossil fuels consumption should be taken by global countries and citizens at the same time would be best."
