        "In today's modern era, nobody can imagine life without internet. Internet totally changed our lifestyle. All human are dependent to computers in these days. This makes our life easier. I am partially agreed to the given notion. In my perspective, it has more advantages then disadvantages. In the following, paragraphs we will discuss in details.",
        "At the first glance, through the social websites everyone feels connected. To explain it, the majority of people have their social account where they can upload their daily routine tasks such as, images or videos. For example, if someone is living abroad, he or she can talk to their parents through video call on whatsapp or through other applications. Thus, they feel they are talking as face to face with them. In addition to it, internet is a great source of information. To illustrate it, students can find study materials by surfing the internet at anytime or from any corner of the world. Furthermore, it provides not only the information, it also very useful for entertainment like, playing video games or watching movies or doing shopping.",
        "Although having beneficial factors, it also has some demerits. Firstly, adults and children are using it all the day as they addict to it. Which is not good for their health. Moreover, no doubt they learn many things from the internet but from the long use they develop heath issues i.e. obesity, weak eye sight and slow brain and so on. Another most important negative point is false information. Sometime, users put wrong information on internet that may cause of fraud or misleading.",
        "To conclusion, Internet is a wider platform where you can find any information, play games, video calls, online shopping or chatting at very low rates. But be careful or false information and parents should limit the time for their children and keep an eye on their search history to avoid any loss."
