        "Nowadays it become debatable on which is more important in work place, the appearance of the worker or the work value. Some groups say that the employees should invest in presenting themselves by smart dressing while others argue that job performance is of paramount importance. This essay will explain both of these notions.",
        "To begin with, people in working organizations propose to observe a proper decorum in terms of appearance and dress code in the work places. The reason is that being presentable and dressing properly can boost the employee\u2019s confidence and moral. According to an international firm Ernst and Young, making dress code for their workers has a positive feedback. They come to the office wearing semi-formal attire which makes them feel very professional thus they act more professional. Enhancing self-confidence proves that it affects the way people do their jobs.",
        "On the other hand, people opposed this idea because they believe that the employers must put more attention in the performance of the employees in terms of work. An institution or a company relies on the quality of jobs the workers give to maintain the standard. For example, the Apple ( a multi-conglomerate company) let their workers to come to the work place in any attire they want as long as it is decent. They focus more on the skills of their manpower to produce high end products with the best quality for the general costumers. Skills and hard work plays a vital role in better job performance.",
        "In my opinion, these two factors are beneficial not only to the company itself, also to the employees but the quality of work outweighs the other. Dressing smartly is a good way to encourage the employees to be aware of their appearance especially those working in the corporate world because they have to deal with people in formal business. However, they must not forget to do their best in the jobs given to them. At the end of the day, it is the way a person performs his/her  job that matters more regardless how formal or fashionable his/her clothes can be.",
        "To conclude, the employers should encourage their workers to be free in choosing what clothes they want to wear as long as it is proper and remind them to value the work they do utmost."
