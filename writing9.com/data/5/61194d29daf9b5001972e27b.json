        "In the last decade or so, we have seen an alarming rise in crimes throughout different nations. A lot of  people believe that aggressive computer games and tv shows contribute to  an increase in rates of crimes., I strongly support this viewpoint as, it causes behavioural and psychological changes in many people, mostly youngsters.",
        "Video games play an important role in increasing violent behaviours. A victim of these games are usually young children, who spend their out of school time on this which in turn has a negative impact on their behaviour. For example a survey conducted in the maldives in 2019, after the release   of call of duty shows that there has been an increasing number of bullying and aggressive behaviour at school in the past few years..surely because  they copy what they see on television which  contributes to these changes.",
        "Moreover the new trend in television series, violent crime genre  has also caused mental and psychological changes in adults as well. A lot of t images are shared on social media and many people are desensitised due to this. For example it\u2019s reported that after the introduction of television series money heist ,  there has been an increased number of reported break ins.",
        "Above mentioned are few example of negative impacts on population due to violent images and games. Hence in my opinion since many such  programmes and games are made to profit the respected companies and corporations, it comes with a cost, that is the cost of mental health of people."
