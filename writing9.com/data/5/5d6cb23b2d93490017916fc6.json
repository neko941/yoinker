        "I\u2019ve shifted from Dwarka so half of my furniture was left which I\u2019m bringing it now. Also, because of the drilling machine and so much labor working in my flat the noise is heard. I\u2019m changing the wood work and the tiles of the flat that is the reason it is taking so much of time. I can understand the disturbance you are facing because of me but I promise I\u2019ll ask the labor to shut the doors and windows before starting their work, do their work quietly and fastly.",
