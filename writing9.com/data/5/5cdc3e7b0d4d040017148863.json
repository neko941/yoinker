        "In recent years we have witnessed drastic changes in our climate. One of the major causes for this is because, the environment is being constantly destroyed and we have to ensure it is protected.Few people believe that individual are responsible to protect the nature whereas other few people say it is government responsibility to safeguard it.This essay will discuss both the views, and in my opinion it's the government who has to protect the nature.",
        "On one hand, we individuals are responsible for destroying the nature. We cut myriad of trees for our personal needs,and this leads to more pollution and climate change.To ensure the well being of the nature, people should plant more trees so that the pollution is reduced.For example, there are many NGO that work together and ensure that sufficient trees are planted regularly. People can enrol in these activities and can plant trees so that our future generation will have a fresh and healthy surrounding to live. In fact, a study shows that if our nature is destroyed at same rate our future generation will live in a planet without trees and will lead to extinction of mankind without oxygen.",
        "On the other hand, government need to ensure that environment are protected by not destroying our forests. Government must ensure a robust law is implemented to protect the environment and have a separate department to protect the nature and increase the size of current population of trees. For example, the karnataka government has ensured that the Bandipur forest is under their control and each year there is a significant increase in the population of the trees and also increase in number of wildlife is seen.",
        "To conclude, government and citizens both have to ensure to protect the nature for future generations. But it is the government who has to implement strict laws to ensure no one destroys nature and also they have to protect the environment."
