        "No doubt, learning is never ending process. Learning provide great source of knowledge and communication skills ,which is helpful for leading wonderful life in society. A segment of society believe that,  parents should teach their children about how to be a good citizen in society,  whereas others argue on this trend , they recommend that children have to learn from their school. This essay will further  elaborate  the both views in upcoming paragraph,  thus will lead to a logical conclusion.",
        "To embark on, there are various reason, as to why people believe that children should learn ethics from parents to become a good member in society. The first and the foremost reason is that , children will obey the words of parents rather than the teachers. parents are the first teacher , which things cannot be teach by teacher ,while parents can teach easily to their children. Parents should teach basic quality such as  respect ,obedience and honesty. Parents can teach those quality which play vital role in society in child's early stage. for example,  many countries parents  give knowledge to their children,  which express children's character in  society. In addition to, parents teach their kids about responsibility and moral values because education is start from home and home is a first school for juniors. Children learn from their parents that how to perform duties with honestly and obey elderones. Thus , parents perfect for teaching.",
        "However, other believe that school is the best way to learn behaviour in society. There are several reasons behind this statement. Firstly, school prepare the children to be a good member in society , because most of parents are working different jobs.  sometime they don't have time to teach them, but school is that place where children spend maximum time,  therefore they can learn perfectly. furthermore,  school not only helpful for education but also aid for  curricular activities from,  which children learn different things and morals.  Hence, school is perfect place to learn social values.",
        "By the way of conclusion , both arguments carry equal strength and significance . In  my prospective , parents can teach their children with sufficient environment that how to be a good member in society ."
