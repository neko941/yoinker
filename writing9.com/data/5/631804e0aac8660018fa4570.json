        "With the booming  development of technology, it is find easy for human to set foot on  far-flung regions, While I can understand  that this development can bring certain merits for human civilization , it is my firm opinion that  it is likely to wreak havoc  on nature.",
        "On the one hand, A school of thought holds that the appearance of human footprints to the remote areas can do wonder for  both science and tourism. There are an enormous number of unveiled secrets that can be tremendously beneficial for researchers to conduct their studies. For example , There is a high possibility that scientists can  accidentally discover  ancient ruins or fossils of a mysterious, alien creature in previous civilizations that people are not exposed, which helps them supplement data and clarify the secrets of ancient civilizations  that is potential to serve  the future science of human history. In addition , the pristine beauty of these areas draw usually attentions of  travel enthusiasts, which  renders  their options  more diverse for holidays with one-of-a-kind experiences",
        "On the other hand ,  I would firmly assert that these positive aspects are overshadowed by the demerits. When people have a easy approach  to primitive and thin  populated areas, they are inclined  to migrate  and start their business as the standard of living in mega cities is  high and difficult to accommodate the needs of them. This will create respective response waves that cause people to flock to these lands uncontrollably, and lead to the repercussions that the nature here will suffer irreversible damage such as mass deforestation or industrialization due to poor environmental protection awareness of people.",
        "In sum , it is my firm conviction that the potential hazardous risks of access to remote environments outweigh the possible upsides for the aforementioned reasons."
