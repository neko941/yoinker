        "Some individuals believe that it is a parents responsibility to teach children on to become a good member of the society. While many others argue that the school is the place to learn about it. In my opinion, both play a crucial role in shaping the kid\u2019s behavior in the communities.",
        "Parents influence on a child is undeniable, they play a huge and important role in every kid\u2019s life. Most of the children learn how to behave in the society by looking at their parents, that is because kids often tend to imitate elders to learn something new. Fathers and mothers must impart the children about basic values of the society, like treating others with love and respect. Without proper guidance from the loved ones, they usually misbehave in the public and might turn in to a bully or a rouge at some point of time in the future.",
        "School is another part which is inseparable from anyone\u2019s life, kids spend most of their time in these institutions. Teachers must encourage and teach them on how to be a better citizen, Not just force them to be successful in academia. It is their responsibility to train the younger ones in all aspects of life, Children with good moral values and best education always destined to be successful in all possible ways.",
        "To conclude, parents and educational institutions have an equal role to play in a kid\u2019s life, one without the other is not a successful combination. Not everything can be taught by a parent nor a school, it has to be amalgamation of both."
