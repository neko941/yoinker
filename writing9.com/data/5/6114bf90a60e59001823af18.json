        "The popularity of sports has increased in our modern society. While it is considered an important tool to bring development in the society, a different view holds that sports is just a leisure activity. This essay will throw light on both these perspectives, although in my opinion physical games play a key role in the development of the society.",
        "A healthy society signifies a developed society and physical activities play a significant role in ensuring a healthy society. In modern times, due to increased job pressure, many young people are experiencing a lack of energy in their daily activities. Under such scenario, participating in outdoor actvities is an alternative to help the youths to feel more energitic and lively. Those individuals can better perform in their work environment and bring about more innovations and developments. An multinational company, for instance, once reported that employees who indulge in physical activities perform better than those who do not. These consolidates our view that sports can lead to the overall socitial development, highlighting that health of the youth influences the health of the country.",
        "Sports, however, encounters a negative review from a section of people. They believe that it is nothing more than a free time activity. The positives of the games are neglected by that population section, who states that the critical time lost while participating in such events has more repurcations. Considering the fact that today's job requires long term involvement, sports should be considered a free time activity. For instance, one CEO highlighted the fact that because employees tend to over indulge in outdoor activities, the company is losing precious work hours. This opinion, though cannot be neglected, however fails to consider the benefits of outdoor games.",
        "To conclude, different views are held by various section of the people regarding the utility of these physical games, but sports as a medium of socitial development cannot be ignored. While sports is a leisure activity, to diminish its status as only a free time activity is far fetched."
