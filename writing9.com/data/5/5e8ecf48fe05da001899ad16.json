        "There is nothing wrong to say that people have became workaholic nowdays, to meet their family demands, due to which they are burdened oftenly. Psychologists suggest that a person could remain completely calm and peaceful to alleviate stress, I agree with them, however, I think there are other alternatives too. This essay will shred light on those measures in the following paragraphs.",
        "To begin with, people should know to demarcate between proffessional and personal life. This is because, it creates a balance in the life, and if family members are happy, person gains the strength to perform well proffessionally. Furthermore, a person should indulge into homecare activities like: gardening; the pleasing scent of flowers boost positivity in a person, yoga; keeps not only mind and brain but a body healthy too. It is a common observation that people, who spare time for such activities have performance worth praising at work in comparison to those, who does not. Therefore, slight balance and some good habits can assist to stay stressfree.",
        "Moving further, a person can plan a short trip at weekends, to nearby places. The reason for this is, when we meet our kith and kinns, joyfull moments are shared which helps to overcome stress. Moreover, nature can also be utilised as a tool in this run to relax. To exemplify, my father, who is a nature lover, goes for morning walk daily. He says the combination of cool breeze and smooth sunrays, freshen his mind. Thus, either travelling or time with the mother earth could be beneficial.",
        "In conclusion, although the wise heads of the society suggeat to remain inactive for a short span of time during day, I ponder that other measures like: good family moments, gardening, exercise, and small trips could be fruitful too."
