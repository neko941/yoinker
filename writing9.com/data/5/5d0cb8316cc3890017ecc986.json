        "It is often thought that government's investment on the arts is a waste, therefore such funds earmarked for it should be utilized in other areas such as building roads and hospitals. I completely disagree because the arts is not only an aspect of people's lives that they derive pleasure and entertainment from but it is also a potential source of huge revenue for government.",
        "The first reason I disagree is that art is inseparably tied to the way of life of the people. It is an essential aspect of life that people draw a lot of inspiration from. Also, it is able to spring up an uncommon feeling of ecstasy and euphoria due to it ability to entertain people. For example, the annual Oloke Art Festival, which is irrefutably the biggest art and culture event in my country, is known to attract personalities from all  walks of life. Majority of these participants attests to the euphoric feeling that comes with viewing the art gallery at Alaafin Museum, the venue of the festival.",
        "Another reason I am convinced that spending on cultural arts is not a waste is that it has a huge potential for revenue generation. As an example, so much money can be made from  art exhibitions, dance trouping, and organization of theatre or music carnivals. As a matter of fact, when this money spinning venture is fully explored by government, millions can be earned in revenue. While it is important for government to also spend money on other areas such as building roads and hospitals, the art can be a good means of making money to fund all these and many more.",
        "In view of the above discussions, the arts is a pivotal means of entertainment as  well as revenue source. Therefore, I implore government at all levels to improve on existing art facilities in order to generate more money which can be spent in other areas."
