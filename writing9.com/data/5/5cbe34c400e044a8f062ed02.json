        "Due to recent developments and advancement in technology and transportation, travelling around the globe and commuting to work from distant areas has become abundantly easier. While I believe it forces the many people to adapt to situations their not comfortable with, i believe it also  allows many people to explore outside of their comfort zones and experience cultures besides their own.",
        "The liberation of being able to live and work anywhere around the world, although a luxury to some, to others the constant fear of having to adapt to new environments is overwhelming. Every country, wherever you go around the world demands social interaction, and this is not easily done when one is not used to the language and social cues of a new land. For example, in Japan it is socially unacceptable to enter a house with your shoes on, this is seen as a sign of disrespect. However, if i am a foreigner coming to live and work in Japan i might not know this fact, thus forcing myself into social isolation. Undoubtedly, the ability to adapt to certain cultural scenarios causes a great disadvantage to the development of technology and transportation.",
        "This being said, I believe that the progress that has been made in communication tool and transport vehicles has greater advantages than disadvantages. The ability to be anywhere on this earth in a blink of an eye is now possible because of these developments. Lands which used to take humans months to travel to can now be reached within hours. Many families had to plan their trips months in advance and cut their household expenses in order to afford their annual holidays. Now because of internet travel websites and airplanes discounts, travelling has been made more accessible. A 2018 study showed that ticket prices drop up to 18% 6 weeks before bookings, this allows individuals and families to save money instead of spending all their savings. If this isn't worth any of the risks that could happen then I don't know what is. Therefore, affordability and accessibility are made easy with very effort on the parts of the people travelling.",
        "In conclusion, living and working is part of our human nature but this does not  mean it has to be difficult. In fact it has become extremely easy due to transport abilities and all the different types of communication. Although one disadvantage is that you must quickly adapt to new environments you're placed in, My opinion is that the advantage of accessibility and the cheap trips that can be obtained are far greater."
