        "It is argued that many folks like to live in different countries. I think there must be no restrictions on where to live and freedom of movements, because there are many benefits to it, slight drawbacks are there as well.",
        "In my opinion, people must be allowed to move freely between countries and live where they choose, provided they observe all the rules and regulations. Highly educated folks will be of great benefit to the country he lives in. For example; if a scientist decides to move to a specific country, his skills will be utilized there. Businessmen tend to travel frequently, hence, by restricting their movements, many businesses can suffer, which can affect economy. There are many opportunities for actors in USA, if an actor from another place wants to have a better career in acting, then he will definitely like to shift to USA, which will be more convenient to him, therefore, not allowing him to live in America may be detrimental to his career.",
        "There are some cases in which people should not be allowed to move freely between countries and live where they choose. For example; a person involved in criminal activities must not be allowed to roam around and choose residence of his choice, without being held accountable and punished for his activities. Similarly, people suffering from sporadic diseases must not be allowed to travel freely, without proper screenings and treatments.",
        "In conclusion, the world belongs to the human beings, there must be no prohibition on them travelling around or living some where, but on some occasions rules and regulations must be taken into account as well."
