        "Teaching mathematics at school is often debatable among parents. Some",

        "There are growing number of opinions on teaching mathematics in school.",
        "Some parents believe that it is unimportant and should be removed.",
        "They have reason  because calculations are becoming more tedious, so that can be solved by computers or calculators. A university of Melbourne professor says that \"90 percentage of calculations can be solved by using computers\".  These parents have good reason to believe that mathematics is no longer a relevant subject in school.",
        "On the other hand, parents who believe it is unimportant to learn mathematics in school there are some parents who believe it should be remained in school curriculum. They have reason because learning mathematics increases cognitive skills, particularly at a young age.  Recent  implication done by university of Calgary professor says that \"the logical thinking is high for the students who do mathematics regularly\". These parents have good reason to believe that it should include in their syllabus as a fundamental subject.",

        "should be taught at school. This essay discussed the various reasons why parents hold these views and whether mathematics should remain a part of students school study."
