        "In recent years, criminal trials have been televised in some countries to allow the public an opportunity to watch them. If asked, I tend to believe that it has more fruitful outcome than being disadvantageous and in the enusing paragraphs I will allude to these arguments further.",
        "Discussing the merits, the principle advantage is showing criminal proceeding on the television is that the entire judicial systems is open to the public to watch and supervise. While general public is knowing about legel right and crime laws. Foe example, western countries where the minor hearing to be broadcasted on TV because of the aim is reducing crime and awareness of people. Another benefit is that opening the doors of the court room allows the public rights to information. This phenomenon affects in different ways and people gain some detail about laws. Finally, judging the criminals on social media, the national police force is showing their power to the citizen. However, the crime rate would be reduced and this positive change will be lead people to a peaceful life.",
        "On the contrary, there are some drawbacks of showing judicial proceeding on TV. The main disadvantage is the coverage that the criminals can turn them in to a celabrity. This can negatively influence on young generation. For instance, in America Simon hearing broadcast on the online platfrom, he is addicted to the drugs, after that drugs consumption increase. In further conflict, governments do not have a right to show people life.",
        "In conclusion, I firmly believe that the advantages are more than drawbacks an dthis trend is still beneficial to both the society and the government, but negative side do not ignored."
