        "The only way to improve safety of our roads is to give much stricter punishments on driving offenses. What extent do you agree or disagree?",
        "People have different views on how to mitigate car accidences, and one of the most arguable notions is that governments should enact more stringent regulations to punish offenders that are relevant to driving crime. In my opinion, I just partly agree with this argument.",
        "It is cannot be denied that traffic accidents are causing various severe consequences for society, and in fact most of the accidents come from disobey road regulation drivers, so stricter punishment on traffic law is considered as a vital solution for deterring those road violators. For instance, in many countries drunk drivers could be charged up-to thousand of dollars or event detained for a few days in jail and prohibited to drive car for the determined period of time. Therefore, drivers in those nations become more and more aware of traffic regulations and illustrate the improvement in the attitude of obeying law, because they know the severe outcomes of their risky conductions.",
        "On the other hand, besides focusing on imposing harsher punishments, government should not neglect on other solutions to address traffic accident issue. Firstly, educational option should be considered as a potential solution. For example, in Vietnam, Law enforcements come to school in order to explain to student about the likelihood that disobey road regulation can cause to commuters the vast number of severe effects and consequences. Secondly, increasing legal driving age could contribute to improvement of road safety. Maturity in controlling vehicles plays an integral part in controlling vehicle safely. In most countries, over 17 years-old teenagers can acquire a lawful driving license, however the rate of causing accident from youngster is likely higher than that from adult. Hence, the older you are the more awareness about safe drive you pay for.",
        "In conclusion, the stricter punishment can contribute to improvement of safety of our road, however the others options could be considered as alternative solutions."
