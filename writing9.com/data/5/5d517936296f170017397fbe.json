        "Nowadays, a great number of electric appliances were used in household, such as television, microwave, oven and rick cookers. The impacts of it should be considerate. Personally, I think the positive effect is more than the negative effect.",
        "The major advantage is that the high technologies of those appliances provide people an efficient live. For instance, using the wash machine is saved time in cleaning clothes. If the wash machine was not invented, people need do all processes by themselves, include putting water, adding laundry powder, cleaning clothes, which spend hours. However, the machine release people\u2019s hands by doing all the steps in an auto way. Therefore while the devices do their job, the time which was not enough to wash clothes could be spent on multiple things. As the result, the living efficiency of live is improved.",
        "On the other hand, when more and more electric equipment are used in house, the using of electric power would increase, and most of electric power is produced by fuels. Consequently, that growth will add the CO2 in environment, which is the main reason of climate changing, such as global warming. However, this situation would not last for long when nuclear which is replacing fuels becomes important as energy resources. For example, the electric that powered by nuclear in France was doubled in ten years, So the disadvantage of it will lower in future.",
        "In summary, I think while the negative impact of numerous household goods (television, microwave, oven and rick cookers) is decreasing, the positive side of it is more."
