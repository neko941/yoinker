        "Trends in fashion in many climes is the major influence bon clothing and hairstyle choices by people. The reason for this degree of influence plagues the mind with questions. It could be that modernization has caused the shift. It could also be the effect of advertisements. The drift caused by current trends in fashion would be closely examined in this essay.",
        "From time in memorial, fashion decisions have varied as a result of human evolution. The early man needed no more than animal skins to clad himself with, however, as he evolved,fashion tastes also got more exquisite. Consequently, man started to synthesize leather from skin, wool from sheep hair and yarns from cotton balls. This was inevitable as a result of technological advancement that accompanied modernization.",
        "Similarly, updated advertising strategies employed by fashion houses have sneaked into the minds of unassuming persons causing them to want some certain things or styles and to see these choices as the new rave. It is common knowledge that advertisements drive subliminal messages. Repeated exposure has an almost hypnotic effect, thus, people drift towards certain choices as marketed by the manufacturers.",
        "In my opinion, there are both positive and negative sides to the situation. Humans must move with technological advances or be left in the dark. Being in vogue invokes a feeling of achievement. It promotes an air of self importance and boosts self esteem. On the other hand, if the drive to be in vogue cannot be justified by oneself, it is therefore a needless craze that could become unhealthy.",
        "In conclusion, trends have greatly influenced personal choices in several places and may continue to. However, it could become irrational if more conscious efforts are not put in place individually to maintain sanity."
