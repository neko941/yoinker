        "Some state that global warming is the greatest difficulty that the world\u00b4s population is facing nowadays. It is agreed that this is an important issue, and it must be dealt before it is too late for the environment. Firstly, this essay will look into the causes of global warming, and secondly, it will discuss how this problem could be solved both by the community as well as by the governments.",
        "There are many origins of this issue that can be found, such as the gas emission from the industries all over the world. This is because the carbon dioxid in the air alters the ozon depletion, which stabilizes the ammount of solar energy that goes into the planet, and therefore the overall temperature in some parts in the planet. For instance, the worlds temperature rose more than 2 degrees in the last 30 years, according to the World Health Organisation.",
        "One of the solutions argued is switching from autos to move trough the city and start using more environment-friendly public means of transport. This is because the quantity of automobilies in the metropolis are increasing in the last year, causing more and more contamination of the air. A research made by the University of Columbia shows that the carbon emissions from personal vehicles reach up to 20% of the total air contamination.",
        "In conclusion, global warming is an issue that is more important than many people think, and it should be treated that way. Not only by the individualsregarding things like using public transport, but also by governments, that are the ones who should encourage the population to do so."
