        "One of the highly controversial issues today related to whether a few of people are equipped genetically to become a gifted person, or it is required through the conventional methods of learning and challenging work. In this essay, I am going to shed some light on both points of view.",
        "On the one hand, there are people who argue if one person is born with an inherited talent he do not need work hard to exhibit his skills. The main reason for believing is that many famous athletes and musicians have shown their progress and achievements since early age. One good illustration of this is the famous musician, Mozart, who is effortlessly capable of composing music when his early childhood. Therefore, it is easy to see why this argument has gained support.",
        "On the other hand, according to other people, training plays a crucial role to become an exceptional player or musician, because children can learn different skills to get to success in a particular field. Nowadays, various institutes are established with purpose to practice to people in special skills such as playing guitar courses or football schools. Thus, it is obvious that this viewpoint is credible and realistic.",
        "In conclusion, both arguments have their merits. However, I tend to believe that both an innate talent and training are the best combination to achieve admirable results."
