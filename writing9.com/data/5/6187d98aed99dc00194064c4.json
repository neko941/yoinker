        "The given maps illustrate the alteration of the place from 1986 to the present. The general overview here is that there is a noticeable discrepancy between the two maps after the construction takes place.",
        "According to the first map, it can be seen that the town consisted of the only one main road running from the north to the south along with the two shops, a post office and a farm to the left side which was the river next to it. Moreover, there was a large house with a garden and a primary school and farmland on the right of the main road, with the bridge across the river to the north.",
        "In the present, the farmland on the left side of the main road has been gone to make way for a new circular pattern street, on the opposite side, the large house has been turned into a retirement house with where its garden stood there is now a new small road. In addition, the farmland to the north has been also disappeared to make room for a new street and the expanded school. The shops have all gone, being replaced  by a new small road. It is noticeable the bridge remains unaffected."
