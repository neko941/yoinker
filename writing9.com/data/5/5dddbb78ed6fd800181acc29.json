        "In the present day and age, people are biased, while they follow the news. Although some experts assert that following local and national news is helpful, others contradict this supporting the international updates. While I stand neutral agreeing with both the views, owing to their respective benefits like being apprised about local government policies for the former, career progression for the latter.",
        "The merits of one sided argument about following the local news is expectional, as a person would be informed about the latest stand of the governing bodies, pertaining to several things.",
        "Furthermore, while the government thrivingly works day in and out to enhance a plethora of its measures for the welfare of its citizens, a responsible individual ought to be updated to understand the impact on their day-to-day life. Taking India as an example, the Indian government, which launched a new helpline number for the safety of women, was proved to be extremely benefical after it was announced on a news channel, as women called to escalate numerous security threats posed to them. Consequently, a well informed person about the governmental procedures is better than someone who turns a blind eye to it.",
        "While it is also worth pointing out that being knowledgeable about the global events proved to be note-worthy, especially when it helps in future career based decisions. To explicate this further, several individuals who has a strong desire to attain the global exposure by moving to a foreign country, ought to know the international events, which helps them in several aspects like immigration policies. To limn, considering the Indian under-graduates as an example, most of these students who carry a dream of graduating from an American university, should be well aware about the nations volatile immigration reform procedures.",
        "In conclusion, having analyzed both the aforementioned reasons, a curious person should be well aware about the local and international updates, which could deter their life's to a great extent."
