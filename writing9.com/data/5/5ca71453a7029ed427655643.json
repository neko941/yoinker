        "A balanced diet, or eating balanced meals, is the key to a healthy life. To what extent do you agree with this statement?",
        "Even though a balanced diet is vital in maintaining good health, there are other factors which contribute to a healthy life. People in some cultures do not eat a balanced diet and only have access to limited food sources, whereas they still have good health. In fact, there are several factors other than a diet which contribute to a healthy lifestyle.",
        "It is critical to have a lifestyle which is relaxed and free from too much stress. While people in the past did not always have a balanced diet, sometimes existing only on potatoes and bread, they lived healthy lives because there was little or no stress of the kind that afflicts urban residents today. Secondly, in contrast, many people today have sedentary jobs and then come home and sit in front of the TV and eat junk food. They often enjoy relatively good health.",
        "In addition, the importance of exercise and an active lifestyle in good health is widely acknowledged. Although it is not necessary to have a gym membership or exercise vigorously, it is essential to stay active throughout the day. For example, those who rarely exercise and are seated at desk jobs for extended periods are often very overweight, and studies have shown that this leads to a higher risk of diseases such as diabetes, heart disease and some cancers.  Greater, those who follow an active lifestyle suffer less illness and also report a greater sense of overall wellbeing.",
        "Thus, although stress cannot be entirely eradicated in your life, through adopting a healthy approach to diet and exercise, we can eliminate health issues."
