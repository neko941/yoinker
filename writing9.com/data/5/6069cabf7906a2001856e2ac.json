Moreover, due to advancement of technology everyone fully depend on the robotics things they do not want to waste there energy to learn things because they get everything on their phone, laptop, computer or things.

        "On the other hand, tuition of new mother tongues are very beneficial because it enchance the knowledge about new culture and helpful to communicate with other people easily. Furthermore, if individuals are use their technology to translate the language sometime occurring the technical error then what they do so if things are in their mode they can quickly answer the other one.
