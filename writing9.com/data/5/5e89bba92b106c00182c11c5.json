        "People's opinion differs as to whether devoting money on art is fundamental or it can be disbursed somewhere else like health and education. Although there are some robust altercation against but I confide that the government should spend more on health and education sector. However, I shall scrutinies both views in the subsequent essay.",
        "On the one hand, there are two presumable significant factors why people argue for more investment in art. First of all, art helps to abolish people's stress. The inhabitant gets refreshments by practising art. Masses of the contemporary world live a stressful life where art can be benignant for them to lead a peaceful life.",
        "Another cause why inhabitant might argue for that is, art boosts human's self-esteem. Dwellers become better concentrator when they live on art. They concentrate much if they exercise art on a daily basis.",
        "On the other hand, despite the above arguments, I still uphold the view that bureaucrats should invest more in health and education sector. There are two prime points why I deem for that. One is health. It is our mandatory needs. The equipment we have in our hospitals are not enough. The authority should upgrade all this with high-class facilities, and obviously, cabins of medicals need to be updated as well for the patients.",
        "Eventually, education is also our primary need. Education often addressed as the backbone of a nation. An educated citizen can be efficacious for a country. And to do that, government should take some serious steps towards it as it shall bring pleasure. Take an example of every developed country who are rolling this world right now. Every state that is in top today, there is a because, and it is education.",
        "In conclusion, it can not be repudiated that art has some benefits, but I surmise the merits we may get from the health and education sector can vanquish it easily."
