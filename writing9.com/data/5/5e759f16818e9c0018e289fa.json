        "In recent years, there is a widespread phenomenon that people spend more time browsing social networking websites than they used to be. Many people believe this is a bad trend. Personally speaking, I completely agree with this statement.",
        "Undoubtedly, Using social network application has its benefits. It could help people maintain a close relationship with each other at a low-cost. In the past, people have to use phones or write a letter to stay in contact with their friends which could be very time-consuming. However, by using social applications such as Wechat or facebook, people can send text momentarily and receive immediate responses. This could help us save a lot of time.",
        "Nevertheless, the disadvantages of using social network applications far more exceed the disadvantages. Firstly, the Majority of the contents or videos on the social networking website is very intriguing to youngsters, which distracts them from concentrating on their study. For instance, while I was attending middle school. I was so addicted to the gaming video on Facebook. I even watched them in class. They are far more interesting than class content for me at that moment.",
        "Meanwhile, since people are so addicted to social networking websites, they are more likely to impair the feeling of their loved ones. With an excessive amount of time spending on electronic devices after work or school, people spent less time on more meaningful activities such as have a meaningful conversation with your family.",
        "In the society level, criminals could also use social networking applications to conduct illegal activities. Since many social networking websites have a low-level of supervision. Criminals can use them to organize crimes without detected by authorities. This is extremely dangerous to our society.",
        "To conclude, It is crucial to limit the time people spend on the social application in our society. Otherwise, we will just indulge in the fiction world which does more harm than good."
