        "In future, it is expected that science will play a pivotal role in order to decide the age of human beings. Some people find it good because there would be a great possibility to fulfil their dreams if someone is capable to live for many decades whilst others argue that living for very long is quite expensive option. This essay will discuss why being alive for many more years is good but why surviving without means of science is superior.",
        "To embark on, staying alive for more number of years with the help of advanced technology is certainly a good option as one would be able to set and fulfil long term dreams successfully. For example, there are various machines used to enable heart beats in an individual such as oxygen cylinder in medical departments. In short, using machines to raise human's age is extremely beneficial.",
        "However, being dependent on science to live more is quite dangerous as people tends to suffer economically. In addition, It's really a bad idea because machines can never replace the natural processes by any chance. For example, making people's age higher usually needs another person all the time to monitor the instrument on which one's life is based. It goes without saying that, make people live by some sort of life support affects people's wealth adversely.",
        "In conclusion, living for many years with the advancement of technology is not far in this modern era. This essay discussed why living for more span with the help of support system is good but why rising the age from machines can be a problem. In my opinion, allowing people to live for many decades leads to a financial issue."
