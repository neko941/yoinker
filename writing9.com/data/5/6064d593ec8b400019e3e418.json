        "Supermarket chains have been improving for decades. It can be seen that many supermarkets are opened in every part of place like both cities and village.Therefore, small traditional businesses are confronted by negative consequences because many people choose to shop in supermarkets rather than these.Some people say that the less demands of local business\u2019 will cause the elimination of local communities.I\u2019am of the opinion that the aforementioned situation about supermarkets has an good impact on local society.",
        "It is evident that there are reasons why supermarkets are chosen by customers rather than traditional markets. First reason is supermarkets offer customer to variety of products because of strong commercial connections with abroad .In this way, traditional businesses lose their sales force because many of them cannot reach these products . This is because many different products are exported from advanced countries like Holland or USA , and these countries ignore small business.Another reason is that advertising enhances their brand values in",
        "supermarkets.Generally traditional shops can not allocate money for this because its budget limited for this sector.To exemplify,In Turkey, we can see that the brand of Migros advertisements on tv or the social media applications.Therefore, they have a chance to attract more prospective clients.",
        "For the local communities, they can benefit from supermarket sector because this sector offer them to job opportunities. This chance stems from these markets\u2019 workers needs because they have lots of section like case, store, products, transportation. Moreover, if supermarkets increases, they give a franchise to people. In this way, they can have their own workplace.For instance, wallmark is the popular supermarket in China.Many locals say that this brand offers us labor force ,and also being boss in own store with pay a little bit money for the trademark of wallmark. It is worthwhile to note that local farmers can benefit from supermarket sector because many of them buy fresh vegetables from them.In this way, manufacturing in the field of agriculture will rise.",
        "To sum up, the power of supermarkets\u2019 in variety of products and advertising leads to elimination of traditional business.However, local society can make use of its opportunities like job sector.Attaching importance to using these occasions falls to domestic people."
