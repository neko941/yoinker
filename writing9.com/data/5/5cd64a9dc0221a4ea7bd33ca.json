        "In this day and age, due to the rush of life, most people are being exposed to the imbalance between their work and other aspects of lives. While there are a wide variety of factor leads to this problem, steps can be taken to tackle the issue.",
        "The loss of equilibrium stems from several reasons which can be represented by two main ones. First and foremost, most people choose to work for extra hours with the hope of higher income. In recent years, the expenses people have to pay for living is increasing but their salary; therefore more and more employees have no choice but to work even if their worktime was over. Secondly, the workers, especially the younger ones, are more likely to spend more time on their work because they want to avoiding pressure from family, which leads to more pressure in their lives. According to a survey conducted in 2017 in Vietnam, 70% of attendees said that they liked working than staying at home because they wanted to postpone the marriage.",
        "Although the imbalance in the life has negative effects on many aspects, there are various solutions to cope with the problem. Initially, the presence of a logical and flexible would be integral for people who find themselves tired of the job. When scheduling work everydays, they stand a great chance of realizing what is important to them as they should list it in the first place. Additionally, it is clear that some work require high intensity; thereby resulting in the stress of workers. In this ocassion, it would be better if those people have a short vacation to relax and enrich their spirit.",
        "In conclusion, working is never being an easy job as employees have to sacrifice their time and other valuable ones. Although there are many people fail to balance between their work and lives, I believe that they still many opportunities to find the balance again as long as they try."
