        "In recent times, as a result of tremendous growth in tourism industry, more and more people are travelling to other countries for higher studies, medical treatments, business and tourism, which have sparked heated debates about whether visitors to other countries should follow the culture and tradition of host countries or the host country should show a willingness to embrace culture from around the world.",
        "On one hand, some people believe that travelers should adapt to the culture of their host countries and feel happy with the idea of trying new things. People often have this opinion argued that people not only consider travelling as a way to relax but also they think it is a chance for self-improvement and exploring the world. Travelling is a good opportunity to try new things such as traditional cuisine, music and customs and those who just travel to view landscapes waste a perfect chance to learn something new. For Instance, people who have visited places like India, Egypt or China have been very excited when they tried the local food or wore the traditional dress. An experience like this broadens people\u2019s horizons and enriches their knowledge.",
        "On the other hand, it is also believed that there are several advantages to respecting diverse cultures. To start with, it creates a cosmopolitan environment in the country and develops a sense of tolerance in people. This attitude will benefit them when they visit another country. Another benefit of embracing diversity is that it makes life more interesting. Variety, after all, is the spice of life. When people belonging to different countries live in one place everyone will be able to enjoy a variety of cuisines, wear different kinds of cloths, celebrate exotic festivals and learn several languages. This not only makes life interesting but also helps the local economy. The United States, European countries, and Indian countries are home to people all over the world. Their success and growth rate are a result of their willingness to accept the best talent from all over the world irrespective of their cultural background.  Seen in this light, it is clearly unfounded to claim that embracing diversity endangers local customs and cultures.",
        "After having discussed the most pertinent points of the issue, I believe that, while it is true that a nation can benefit from cultural diversity, it does not mean that local cultures and traditions should be ignored. They should be promoted too and a nation can encourage visitors to follow local customs. However, in my opinion, imposing them on visitors is unwarranted. Visitors who follow local customs also benefit. They have better chances of blending themselves with local community. They also enjoy greater degree of acceptance. To conclude, a host country should always welcome diverse people with diverse cultures from all over the world. However, this should not be at the expenses of the local culture."
