        "Nowadays, the internet has significantly changed the society to share and consume the news. This essay will discuss the associated issues and possible solutions to overcome it.",
        "To start with, the internet has allowed humanity to connect with one another easily, hence allowing us to exchange new information quicker. Due to this, many news that are spread are likely to be hoax and fake, since they are generally not confirmed by the authorities. In 2015, for instance, the USA police believed that they have received a threat from a group of terrorists. Upon long investigation, they discovered that the threatening information were apparently delivered by high-school pupils. Nevertheless, this can be avoided by allowing the government to be more involved in spreading the news, in order to limit the incorrectness and increase the validation of the information in the online world.",
        "In addition, these days, the online consumption has increased at an alarming rate. The 'Economist Youth' stated that both the older and younger generations often spend 8hours every day on the internet through their phones and computers. This is mainly because of the fact that it is easily accessible everywhere and anytime, which lead to a problem in lack of communication in the real world, as people are likely to be attached electronically. However, this can be conquered by decreasing the use of internet and raising awareness to physically communicate with each other.",
        "To conclude, although the online world has caused humanity to share fake information and consuming it at an alarming rate, this can be overcome by allowing the government to validate the news and limit the use of the internet among the society."
