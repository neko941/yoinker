        "Older personnel are believed to be much more instrumental than their younger counterparts for an organization, according to few individuals; however, others give credit to young staff. In my opinion, owing to their agility and cost effectiveness, young individuals prove to be more beneficial to a company.",
        "On the one hand, people believe the elderly staff is more advantageous to a corporation because of their being equipped with valuable skills such as leadership as well as loyality. Interestingly, these traits could prove to be handy in circumstances when quick decisions need to be made and without much deliberation, senior employees act sensibly and fast, which mostly works in the favor of company. Furthermore, owing to their years of working experience and higher remunerations, they are quite satisfied with their current roles. This results them to be reliable and loyal to their employers as they seldom switch jobs. Consequently, this helps organizations to trust them and let them oversee crucial management responsibilities.",
        "Nevertheless, on the contrary, others and I support that the young workers have the greater usefulness since they are able to be forge in any way. In other words, the young talents are receptive to change, hence they can be trained in a particular way that will not only help them to learn and grow but also will benefit the company. For instance, a company trained its all employees on a new online software to expedite the production, to which the youngsters learned it instantaneously.",
        "Additionally, the younger workforce always fits in the budget of employers. To put simply, most of them usually have little to no prior work experience. As a result, they are hired at low wages, which benefits the recruiters. Indubitably, this helps businesses to minimize their expenditure and make substantial amount of profit.",
        "In conclusion, although elderly employees are skillful and faithful, I personally feel that young employees are more useful to a corporation because of their adaptiveness and affordability."
