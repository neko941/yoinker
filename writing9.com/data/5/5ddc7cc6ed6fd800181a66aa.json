        "Children could learn fast in their childhood. Is television the right source? While some argue watching television helps them learn perfectly, I believe allowing kids to engage in other activities helps them grow intelligent.",
        "To begin with, there are various harmful disadvantages of watching television. Firstly, too much of screen time would not only makes an immense affect on child\u2019s eyesight but it also creates a great impact on the development of their brain. As per the recent survey published by American Health magazine, 60% of school going students has eye-sight problems due to watching television. Secondly, there are dreadful health conditions like obesity and nausea are developed among the adolescents. As a result, they become lazy and would not be able to concentrate on studies. Consequently, the growth of an individual deteriorates.",
        "Nevertheless, the parents and teachers play a significant role in the physical and mental conditions of a youngster. They should encourage the young one\u2019s to participate in extra-curricular activities which enhance their analytical skills. The parents should, proactively enroll their children in any cultural or sports classes which would boost their interest in school and studies. Besides, during the free time, they should be allowed to involve in tasks of their hobbies so that they are not devastated. Apart from this, the family members should interact with the juveniles to keep them engaged which strengthens their bond with them. Subsequently, it helps maintain a positive health.",
        "In conclusion, although few debate allowing kids to watch television has no harm, I disagree to the assertion that allowing students to participate in other tasks helps enhance their skills."
