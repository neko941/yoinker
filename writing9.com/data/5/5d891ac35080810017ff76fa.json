        "There is no doubt that today\u00b4s technology has come with good use in many areas of society at large. However, since the last decade modern technology sush as television, smartphones and video games in my belief have resulted in having a negative impact, especially towards the youth population and their free time.",
        "Firstly, young people nowadays have a much wider range of choosing which activities to proceed with during their free time because of today\u00b4s provided technology. However, because of this, the youth have tended in some ways to become more introverted and asocial due to lack of social interactions with other people. For instance, a lot of time is spent on passive internet surfing sush as watching youtube videos or scrolling through social media feeds, which in turn have lessened the opportunity of being social and to create connections with family and friends. Moreover, the human ability to emphazise when conversing has become highly jeopardized in the younger generations as the tendency to  misunderstand has drastically increased.",
        "As to face these issuses, young people should begin to spend their free time more wisely. Parents should use stricter rules and prohibit their children to spend too mush time in front of a display. People in general, especially the youth should use their limited time to something meaningful, self improving and towards more physical activities sush as climbing, cycling or swimming.",
        "In conclusion, Young people are spending to mush time in the digital world and other passive actions. They should therefore aim for activities which involves both interactive and physical excersises in order to get most out from their time off."
