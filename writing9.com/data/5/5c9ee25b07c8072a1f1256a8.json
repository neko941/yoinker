        "While  it is not uncommon for students to wear uniforms  as  attending schools, some people believe  that it  might have an impact on their personalities . From my perspective, I totally disagree with this  .",
        "There is no doubt that the uniformity creates equality between members in any institutions of education . This, therefore, enables pupils to integrate with others regardless of their origins. On the contrary, if teachers give schoolchildren the freedom of dressing any styles of fashion, not only will it cause them to neglect the duty of study  as their main concerns are to express themselves through the clothes, but also trigger jealousy in classes. Besides, while rich individuals swell with pride with things  they wear, not to mention some of them are inappropriate, those  in low-income families may have a sense of being  unconfident  and struggle to  establish  relationships  with others.",
        "People who harbor the view that wearing uniforms affects children\u2019s individuality might argue that there exist  other ways for adolescents to define themselves. For instance, by playing sports, showing a good ability of learning  or taking part in clubs, students will expose their striking features. But , that is not to say that we should not encourage boys and girls to bring his or her favourite clothes to schools. Getting to put  nice dresses on makes them more confident, which may  give them  the impetus to study better.",
        "To summarize, it is essential for every learner to wear school costume . Nevertheless, we should alternate uniform days with non-uniform days in order to ensure that children feel comfortable and there should be rules of dressing on casual clothes day."
