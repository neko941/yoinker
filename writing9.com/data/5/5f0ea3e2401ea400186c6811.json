        "We have progressed rapidly with the technological revolution over the years. With this  advancement, our environment  is undergoing a process of change which most of the times is not pleasant for us. Undeniably, technology has simplified and enhanced our quality of living but at the same time, it\u2019s misuse has brought up some discomforting issues which are detrimental for the stability of our environment. Now, to solve the anomalies of our ambience, what should we do, that\u2019s a burning question for us. Should we change our lifestyle into a  simpler one that we used to lead in pre-technological era or handle",
        "machinery to solve our environmental negative issues, that will be discussed later.",
        "I believe, environmental problems could be solved by implementing technology in a proper way, instead of exploiting it. Because, uncontrolled usage",
        "of modern devices and machineries have created the problem with mother nature. For an explanation, we can have a look at some incidents that are happening around us, for instance, deforestation, which means cutting down of trees indiscriminately, that is highly pernicious for every living creature. Because, it is a tree that makes our ecosystem balanced, at the same time, maintains the approximate ratio between oxygen and carbon-dioxide. Not only that, to free up more spaces for industrial set up, we are filling our rivers, as a result, aquatic lives are being endangered. All of these are the results of excessive demands of industrialization that impelling our nature on the verge of ravage.",
        "Therefore, to reduce the harmful effects, we should you our technologies. As an example, to diminish solar radiation, georeflection technique could be used. In this method, mirrors could be implemented at selective area to reflect UV radiation. In addition to",
        "that, CFC free refrigerators can play a significant role in the reduction of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Besides that, hydroelectric power plant could help to lowdown the consumption pressure of fossil fuel based electricity. Furthermore, thousands of alternatives are there for thinking to conserve limited energy resources. Thus, technology can make a new way to deal with environmental problems.",
        "So, to me, it\u2019s quite unnecessary to abort technology to solve environmental errors. To illustrate, we can look over some other problems that are not linked up with technology. One of such one is the population  rising problem that is alluding problems to the environment. Because, the more is the pressure of consumption, the more will be the exploitation of natural resources. Therefore, only leading a simple lifestyle won\u2019t be a permanent solution, I believe. Hence we should use technology to solve recently cropped up problems.",
        "To sum up, the appropriate use of technology can outweigh the problem of falling back in living style and that requires mass awareness on the pros and cons of the tech world and goodwill to save nature."
