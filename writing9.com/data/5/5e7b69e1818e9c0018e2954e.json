        "There has been endless argument about whether the old generations\u2019 traditional opinions on lifestyle is approriate for the young or not. This essay will analyse both perspectives before giving conclusion.\r\rIt is undeniable that there are certain reasons why old people\u2019s ideas might be useful for younger generations. Firstly, it is because they have been through many ups and downs, they have many experiences. They can provide those wisdom to younger one, as a result, the young can avoid getting in troubles in their life by listening to old people\u2019s advice. Secondly, there are moral values from previous generations are applicable to modern life. For example, the tradition of hard working is undoubtedly beneficial for younger generation in the dynamic job market nowadays. Moreover, there are a lot of national traditions that old generations can contribute to future generations and by following them, young people are preserving a part of their culture.\r\rOn the other hand, there are many old ideas that have become irrelevant in modern life. First of all, there are many misconceptions from the elder about gender roles or same sex marriage. It is sure that there is no place for these ideas in open-minded era. Furthermore, modernisation and globalisation are happening at an accelerated speed so such misconceptions are definitely obstacles in developing society. In addition to this, if the young generations are overdependent on those advice, they will lose their creativity and their ability to adapt to changes in modern world. Therefore, the society will become unchanged and eventually, underdeveloped.  \r\rIn conclusion, although there are ideas that can be unsuitable for modern life, younger generation should consider the old\u2019s wisdom and national tradition as valueable"
