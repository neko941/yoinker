        "It is an incontrovertible fact that today, the quality of life in urban areas is declining and people who live in there always complaint about numerous problems which, they are facing. This essay examines the possible reasons and suggest some solution to curb this problem.",
        "To embark with, there are two main reasons why the living standard of life in cities was worse. The first and foremost is environmental pollution, which increasing day by day because of people and technology advancement. Today everyone have their separate vehicle in cities also, the construction activities which creating the air pollution. As a consequence, they are suffering with the breathing problem like asthma, chornic respiratory or skin allergies. Apart from that, another major concern is population the rural people are moving to the urban cities because of better life. But, it lead to problem such as, accomodation and life expenses. For example, in Delhi and Mumbai most of people are homeless and they have not enough money to fulfil their needs.",
        "There is almost certainly no one solution to this problem. However, one option has to be to do counselling the public to aware of environmental problems. The authority should offer the better facilities in rural areas and should improved the urban and rural linkage can make important contribution in improving the situation. To instance, if cities and villages are linked well with effivient public transport, may people would not shift to big cities.",
        "In conclusion, I tend out saying that to solve this issue governments and volunteers should go hand in hand only by this way they can solve this problem like they are the environmental pollution and population."
