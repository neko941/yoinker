        "Undeniably, Governments are responsible for uplifting the standard of living of its nationlists. It is often argued that government should spend the money in order to improve public facilities rather than in the arts. However, I do partially agree with this statement and points related to this will be elaborated in the upcoming paragraphs.",
        "To begin with, Investments made by Government in the field of arts have following merits. If state will put efforts to construct an academy where public will be taught multiple skills, it will be quite beneficial for talented population. To be more precise, if there will be an institution where people can learn dance, music or such other things. it will help them to showcase the talent in front of others and they can also make their futures in that. To quote an example, in India\"s capital New Delhi, Government has opened number of such academies at affordable fees which helps talented individuals to come up and learn furthur. It brings a ray of hope to those who cannot afford expensive academies.",
        "However, it will be not be a wise decision if Government will spend maximum amount in arts. Instead, they should invest more in public services. Firstly, investment should be made in building up more recreational centres. This is because, there people of all ages can spend their leisure time in productive activities. Also, Government needs to construct more parks with number of facilities. It means that parks must have swings for children, an airy room for yoga and other exercises, safe drinking water and sanitation facilities. To paradigm, in Punjab's City Ludhiana, there are number of Government maintained parks such as Rakh Bagh, Rose Garden with all such facilities.",
        "To sum up, it is reiterated that Government should invest more in public services rather than in the arts, as its advantages outweigh the benefits provided by investing in the music or theatre."
