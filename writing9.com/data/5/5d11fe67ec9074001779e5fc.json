        "In some cases, companies ask candidates for their private information like personal interests and their marital status. It is often argued that this is helpful to know a potential candidate better and improves the chances of selecting right candidate whereas others disagree as this knowledge could be used to introduce bias in the selection process beyond professional requirements. In my opinion, companies should not be collecting personal information from the candidates during application process.",
        "Asking personal information may lead to discriminatory practices in the hiring process which can affect the chances of a good applicant. The employers may prefer a single candidate based on the assumption that an unmarried candidate might be able to work longer hours. A company may prefer a person with an interesting hobby, thinking he or she might bring more vibrancy to the work place. According to a research done by LinkedIn, 38% of the company\u2019s HR managers have responded that particulars regarding marital status could impact chances of someone getting hired for a demanding job.",
        "However, another school of thought says that this helps to know the applicant better and helps the company in hiring the candidate which seems to be more suitable based on interests and family obligations. This will help them in matching the right person with their own expectations. For example, a demanding job which requires long working hours may be suitable for an unmarried person.",
        "In conclusion, even though many believes that seeking personal information can contribute in selection process positively, I believe that this practice could prove to be more harmful than useful as it can lead to discrimination in hiring and may drive a good candidate away."
