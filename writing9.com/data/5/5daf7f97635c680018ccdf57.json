        "In England, elder people resides in retirement houses most of the time together, where they will get looked after by caregivers. often those old people homes are funded by the government. In my opinion, I think it is fair that the government should pay for elderly housing.",
        "It is considered by many that old people deserve to be treated with utmost care , as they have no mean of income beside their pensions, paying their taxes along their working years gives them the right to benefit from the government retirement plans.For instance, in my country over thirty percent of payroll to any employee is deducted by the government for taxes and retirement pension.",
        "Moreover, A drastic increase in the cost of living in the past 10 years is the reason why families nowadays can not afford to pay for the retirement houses, which is why the government should carry that burden off the shoulders of the families, For example, according to a study published in The Independent there is a correlation between the inflation rate and families abandon their old people at governmental retirement houses.",
        "Furthermore, a legislation should be done to preserve the elders right in living under good conditions with the care they deserve, because this affects the whole economy and entire societies, to illustrate, the happiness indicator of the countries who provides elder care is higher than the countries who doesn't provide that sort of care to their citizens.",
        "To sum up, preserved right for good care, financial burden on the families and community rights are the main reasons why the government must fund the homes and care of the elderly."
