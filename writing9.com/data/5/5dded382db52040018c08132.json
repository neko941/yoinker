        "Nowadays, children need to learn a great number of lessons, and they have lots of tasks to finish. As a result, they should work hard with having no time for entertainment. From my point of view, I am in favor of that children have taken more pressure from the society than they used to do.",
        "There are two reasons accounting for the changes that children have been living under more pressure. Firstly, the society is now in fast development, children are usually asked by their parents to work hard so that they could keep pace of the fast deveiopment world. Consequently, they devote themselves to study and as a result of which they have no time to play. On the other hand, adults tend to focus more on personal success. As they do hope that their children become successful in their life, they commonly ask their children to compete with each other. In addition, teachers at school usually have a list related to children`s grade in every subject, which have made children under huge pressure.",
        "Compared to the past times, the society had not changed a lot,and the pace of the society was slow. Children in the times only need to go to school and finish their lessons. Apart from this, they could enjoy their personal time because there were not much competition.",
        "To summarise, children have to do more and more things than they used to have. It is obvious that they have been living under more pressure due to the fast development wolrd.When it comes to me, I think parents should help their children balance their life,"
