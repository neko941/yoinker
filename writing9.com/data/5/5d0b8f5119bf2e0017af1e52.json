        "Historic buildings depicts the culture and tradition of a nation. Therefore some people opine that there should not be any fee to visit public buildings like Taj mahal memorials and many more atleast for non adults. As authorities should intoduce our historical background to their upcoming generations. I strongly agree with this notion. In the upcoming paragraphs, I will elucidate my viewpoint with more relevant examples.",
        "To commence with, allowing children to eplore historical sites without any charge trigger the crowd of young generation to visit such places. For instance, it has been observed that free things always excite the oosprings to have a look and enjoy it once. In this process, they will come to know about their country;s heritage and they will not be in any dilemma as it will not hurt their pockets, in contrast to, the situation if they have to pay for it. Moreover, for short picnics and trips they might pefer to go to these places with their friends and families.",
        "Furthermore, visiting such spots fosters their interest in the subject of histiry and aid them to perform extraordinarily in their academics at school level. For example, it is rightly said 'a picture is a worthy than a  thousand words. Exploring such places help them to remember the incident and the person  behind it more easily than reading textbooks. In addition to this, free visits for children encourage educational institutions to arrange such tours for students more frequently.",
        "In the nutshell. I would like to pen down by saying that keeping free visits for non adults to places like museums and historic sites is a great way to promote significance of history among the new generation."
