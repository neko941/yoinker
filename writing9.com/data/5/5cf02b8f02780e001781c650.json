        "While some individuals choose to give help and support directly to the needy,others would rather offer money to national and international charitable organizations. Although,giving money personally to people who need them creates a relationship between the donor and reciepient and ensures that the monies are used for its purpose,charitable organizations guarantee fair and equal distribution of funds for needy people and in my opinion,this is the best method of rendering help.",
        "One the one hand,offering help directly to those in need ensures that these funds gets to the individual in due time.This is because it boycotts the barrage of paperwork associated with release of funds in charitable organizations.Furthermore,it prevents incidences of embezzlement of money and corruption because there is no middleman therefore,the money is handed over to the individual who needs it.For example,over the last three months,two directors of Non-govermental organizations have been probed by the economic and financial crimes commission because it was observed that while people donate large sums of money towards helping the poor,these men line their pockets with these funds,giving only a minor fraction to the less privileged.",
        "On the other hand,i think that giving monies to charitable organizations is a better way of rendering help because it eliminates bias and ensures fairness in the distribution of resources.For instance,people may decide to give money to only people who they like or who look a certain way.Also many people may end up providing help and support to the same individual without knowing thus while one person gets alot of help,other needy persons are neglected. Charitable organization also ensure that a larger number of persons can be helped.This is because they are more organised therefore they can recieve help and support from all over the world and reach out to people not only in their vicinities but also in other underdeveloped countries.",
        "In comclusion,while peoples opinion may vary on the choice of whether to offer help and support in person or through national and international charitable organizations,I strongly believe that the latter is much better as resources can be fairly distributed and a larger number of person can be helped."
