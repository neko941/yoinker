        "In recent times, educational system demand student to learn on all the syllabus whereas others believe that it is essential to concentrate on the subject they usually excel than others. This essay will discuss the pros and cons of these views.",
        "To begin with, the advantages of acquiring all the areas of studies clearly can be seen. They will gain vital knowledge and skills in every aspect of life which will be useful as they grew older. An artist not only requires drawing and show their art talent but also, they need to know how finance themselves to support their living expenses. Therefore, students can be versatile and at the same time, becoming a better citizen to the society. Despite of that, studying a number of subjects at the same time, can be extremely stressful and burdening for the adolescents. Sadly, this cause them to drop out of school or unable to cope up with the studies.",
        "On the other hand, learning only specific types of the subjects helps to further strengthen the potential in them. Moreover, it boosts their confidences level that they able to achieve something they desire and work even harder. However, one may lack in other aspects which may be crucial for their future and desperately seeking for help to solve it.",
        "In conclusion, based on my perspective, it is for the best to concentrate all the topic they need in becoming an all-rounded person. In spite of that, teachers or lecturers need to give them space to nurture into the field of their preference."
