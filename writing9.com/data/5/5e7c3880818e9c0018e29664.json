        "Arts and music forms an pivotal role in curriculumn planning in schools in the modern era. It is essential for students to have a learning of arts and music in their school. In this essay we will argue why this type of curriculumn is substantial for a child's overall development.",
        "On the one hand, students who learn arts and music as part of their learning are seen as more cultivated than those who do not have it in their curiculumn. Arts and music evolve the child's motor skills and helps the child to develop his social, personal and artistic expression. A research by famous montessori founder Maria montessori says that making arts and music part of a child's learning will ascertain better cognitive and kinetic development of the child. However, this also makes students learn to express their feelings and thoughts through this medium.",
        "A recent study by Harvard shows that offspring whose learning has happened alongwith arts and music is expected to perform 70% better in his career and life later than the other who did not get the opportunity to learn this way. For Instance, when a student learn a butterfly life cycle process through diagrams and its illustrations it quickly resisters in their mind. Another study by harvard says music connects right brain to the left brain and hence, at that moment a human mind learns that spontaneously. To illustrate, a student can remember multiple songs at a time but it becomes difficult to recapitualte multiple concepts at same time.",
        "To sum up, arts and music plays an important role in holistic development of a child to an adult. All schools should consider this as part of their curriculmn and try to incorporate formal learning through artistic expressions and musical patters."
