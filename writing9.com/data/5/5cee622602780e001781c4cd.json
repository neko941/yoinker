        "Libraries have been source of information and entertainment for years. With easy  access to electronic books over internet many open that public libraries are no longer required, however many other contradict stating the essential. Both the views are discussed in enjoying paragraph along with personal opinion.",
        "To begin with, public libraries are generally centrally placed, getting to them requires commuting to their place of location. People find it difficult, as with internet , study material of any type such as text books, novels are easily available online, sitting at their own place. Further more, libraries are open for specific hours a day ,limiting their access . More over,searching for books on long shelves of library hall is tedious task ,requires referring to number of indexes to search a required book. Hence, aforementioned off putting factors are responsible for decrease in popularity of public libraries, making there future need doubtful.",
        "However , libraries have always been famous among individuals seeking peaceful and isolated environment for study . With so many destructions at home people generally find it difficult to focus  at their dwellings; for both knowledge seeks and bibliophiles no place is better than library. In addition to this, government managed libraries are free source of knowledge for many educatees. In developing countries such as Bangladesh, India where where internet accessibility and penetration is minimal, public libraries are must. In addition to this, libraries hold authenticated study materials, with leisure of books holding historical and contemporary references.Thus, it is evident that libraries are important components of social infrastructure.",
        "To conclude, in my opinion libraries are essential requirement of any society, the books they contain hold literary and historical treasures. Also, there presence comforts the life of persons seeking  knowledge, along with those part taking book reading as a hobby. Thus, need for government managed libraries is unquestionable."
