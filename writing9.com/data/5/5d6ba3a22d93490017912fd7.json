        "Billions of people around the world and still we have one best athlete in each sport. Quite astounding! Some achieve this feat because of their natural ability while others have to pave theirs through hurdles. In this essay, I will be discussing how the two sides of coin keep on competing in the world of sports.",
        "Some geniuses are born with gifted talent. Time and again, history has witnessed two great athletes competing in sports wherein one nurture their instinctive traits and other has to sweat the brows to get to a higher level. Let us consider the example of how Pele made his mark in the world of football with striving resilience on one hand and Maradona on the hand thrilled the spectators with his prolific mavericks.",
        "And even today, these differences exist in modern football as a way of rivalry between Messi and Ronaldo. Sir Alex Ferguson, a former manager at Manchester United holds the opinion that comparing Messi and Ronaldo is a waste of time simply because the former is 'from another universe' having possessed with extraordinary abilities and latter is an epitome of what human beings can achieve through hard work and persistence.",
        "Many of those who bet their money on born geniuses may tend to forget that even they need practising. Though being considered as the one with an abundance of natural talent, Mohammad Ali turned his fortune only through consistent hard work. Therefore, I would like to opine that success is impossible without putting in constant efforts.",
        "No matter how much gifted, an athlete needs to keep on striving hard at every juncture. It is like an iron rod that rust with time if not put to use from time to time. No wonder why we have so many successful sports personalities coming from the different facets of life performing at a competitive level and only one stands out from the rest. And sometimes, they outclass even those who are so-called 'God-gifted'."
