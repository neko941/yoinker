        "People like to dress in different ways. While some people believe that clothes helps to judge an individuals background and character. There is certainly a question in everybody\u2019s mind when they get ready \u201cAm I dressed appropraitely for the occasion?\u201d.  I, certainly feel that outfit is the mirror of one\u2019s personality and this essay will further argue in favour of it.",
        "Individuals simplicity can be known by the way one\u2019s dresses up. People who are humble and modest, tend to wear clothes which doesn\u2019t attract much attention.For instance, Saints  who believe in simple living and high thinking, mostly wears either White or Orange coloured simple plain garments. Further, it makes them easily identifiable from a lot of general people. Thus, these simple clothes speak for the Saints.",
        "Different  clothes tell  the background of people. Grown ups generally like to wear their tradional dress on festive and other important occasions which signifies the impact of culture on them. If we attend any wedding of two people from different cultures like North and South Indian, it would be easy to distinguish them based on their clothes. North Indian ladies especially from Punjab, generally prefer to wear heavy embroided Suites and like adorn themselves with expensive jewellary. Thus, clothes tell about their Punjabi culture and their extravagent nature.",
        "To conclude, the way people like to get dreesed up is quite important, as it speaks quite a lot about their background and simplicity.  Certainly, I agree with the statement in view of above points and feel that clothes acts as a mirror to one\u2019s culture and character."
