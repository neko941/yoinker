        "It is a true that proper food consumetion has become healthy and disease free.while some people think that diet and health is self responsibility to take care himself, others believe the government should be responsible for improving the health of their nation. Therefore,ahead of my opinion, both the views shall be discussed further.",
        "Examining the former view,there is no doubt that individuals must take some responsibility for their diet and health. It is a fact that adults have free will and make their own choices about what they eat and the exercise that they do.For example, they eat junk food or street food,furthermore,they know about these food are high calories and less nutritional value,so its regular eating can result in obesity and cholesterol problems.However,people eat lots of fruits and vegetables and avoid much oily and junk food if you really want to maintain a good health.",
        "Considering the latter part of the topic,governments helping to reduce these arguments. Ruling body making strictly laws regarding chemicals and adhesive use in food items.These toxic liquids should be totally banned and the government can ensure.If people are forced to eat foods that have unexpected chemicals,they would suffer from dangerous diseases. In additions, using unauthorised chemicals,selling expired and low-quality food should be forbidden.As a result, the government initiative can greatly reduce this unexpected corruptoin in the food industry and they fine for this crime.",
        "To conclude, I would argue that although individuals must take utimate responsibility for what they eat,governments also have a key role to play as only they can regulate the food items,which is encourages poor and poisonous diet."
