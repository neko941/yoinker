        "In order to improve financial wealth, nowadays, numerous individuals immigrate to major cities. This phenomenon has direct impact on not only economic growth but also social development. In my perspective, the government should either encourage people to stay in small town or enact particular policies to deal with this problem.",
        "Because of a large-scale immigration, both people and society in higher-tier cities are facing with a wide range of problems. One of the most prominent urban issues in recent decades is unemployment. in a little more detail, many ruralites who relocated to populated cities lack qualification for proper steady jobs so they are forced to do  temporary subsistent occupations or even unemployed. Another issue is the increasing social problems such as high crime rates. As a result, in some urban sites such as Detroit or Baltimore in America, after 10pm, fear of crimes even confines some townies in their homes. Furthermore, due to overpopulation, the air quality pollution has been exacerbated. More recently, Sai Gon and Ha Noi, both of which have been troubling with immigration, climbing on top of chart 20 polluted cities in the world in recent months, according to Air visual.",
        "However, there are various steps that government could take to tackle these problems. Firstly, they could issue policies which include giving tax reductions, moving industry and jobs to provinces or improving the qualification of local workers, in order to create more and more economic opportunities in lower-tier regions. Secondly, they could invest money in the social amenities such as hospital, school, infrastructure and recreational facilities to keep ruralites stay in their home towns.",
        "In conclusion, governments could certainly implement a range of measures to encourage resident to live in less-developed regions."
