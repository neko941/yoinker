        "Purchasing stuff from the Internet is quite common in the present life. Online shopping makes humans\u2019 life easier and better. However, I do believe that everything has a loophole. Humans are going to develop the network to serve their needs. Therefore, it is very important for people to aware of the benefits and harms of online buying",
        "Modern life has plenty of online services which allow people to book a ticket, do groceries shopping or purchase some books. There are many reasons to raise up this kind of market. First of all, humans are looking for fast, convenient and comfortable. Ordering from the Internet can help them save the amount of time. They do not need to come to the store but still have a variety of choices. Secondly, customer service is upgraded too. Now, most of the company have a department which called as delivery. Meaning that all of the stuff will be distributed to every customer by the suppliers. Lastly, online markets allow humans to buy different things from different stores, which is the most advantage.",
        "There is no guarantee that online shopping is safe. It is facing problems every day, especially scam. The Internet is the most powerful tool now in every country. Sometimes, people can promote or sell their products without any check before they public products\u2019 information. Therefore, no one except the seller knows the truth. It already happened in many cities and there were a lot of victims. Unfortunately, police cannot catch all of the scammers, so victims lost their money forever. In addition, customers\u2019 data can be hacked because of the lack of information protection on the Internet. Hacker can easily get in touch with the buyers\u2019 bank account and stole their cash.",
        "In conclusion, I do agree that online shopping makes our life easier than before. However, I did mention, everything had drawbacks. In fact, the loophole of the Internet is much dangerous than others. In my opinion, I advise that people should be more careful about online markets by researching about the suppliers before we purchase and become sober buyers."
