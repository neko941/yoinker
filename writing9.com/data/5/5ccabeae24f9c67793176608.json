        "Home Education was widely accepted in the past,due to reasons related to quality and distance. Many argue that home tutoring should be confined in the past and not permitted in this civilized time. In my opinion, I agree that home schooling is effective and efficient. However, I also believe contemporary schooling is important",
        "It is known that the home is the first school a child attends. The home inculcates good attitude and morals in the child. Its a haven that is safe; free off bullying and racism, reliable; caters for the special needs of the child and favourable for learning and skill impaction. The one-on-one interaction between the tutor and the child creates room for quality of academic instruction and intellectual development. Statistics has shown that homeschoolers score at or above the national average on standardized test,and have been accepted into international lay acclaimed universities, like Harvard university.",
        "On the other hand, modernized schools possess a reservoir of professionals, well grounded in the various subjects offered. For example, the mathematician teaches every aspect of mathematics, and nothing else: the French instructor who speaks and teaches French: the geographer who teaches geography and the list is endless. A modern school provides the child with both formal and informal means of learning; classroom learning and practicals, and also a platform for social interaction, which is Paramount to the mental and physical development of the child.",
        "In conclusion, though home schooling provides a one-on-one method of instruction, which improves the quality of education for the child , the child lacks the opportunity to socialize with its peers as seen in modernized schools, which is fundamental to a child's mental and physical development."
