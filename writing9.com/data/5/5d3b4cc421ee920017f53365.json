        "Owing to the increase in the trend of online shopping, it is believed that stores in the metropolis and suburbs will eventually shutdown someday. This essay  agrees with this view and will explain the reason in terms of the convenience and various options online shopping platforms offers to individuals over physical stores.",
        "To begin with, one of the major reason for this uprise in online shopping is the  convenience. This is because people can have easy access from wherever they are  and therefore, do not have travel,  drive a car or take public transport which would cost them to get an item that can be accessed just with a click on the phone.   For an example, I order  my dresses and jewelries from the Asos online store located in the United kingdom from my residence in Nigeria. This comfort online shopping gives has contributed to it's elevated patronage that outstands physical stores.",
        "Another point to consider, is the luxurious choice of product that are available on online. This means that, people have many options to choose from, as a result of the enormous number of stores online customers can never run out of options.  Whereas, in  physical shops, the owners most times run out of supplies and designs that appeals to all customers. For example,  my town has many schools and As a result, the stores are   mostly stocked with children shoes and few designs for adults, hence compels buyers to use the internet to get varieties for what they want.",
        "In conclusion, it is evident that the convience and alternatives online platform encourages in due course sell out physical stores."
