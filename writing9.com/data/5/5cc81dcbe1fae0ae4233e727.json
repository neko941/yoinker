        "Nowdays,women have equal job opportunities as men,however many ascertain that women and specially those who have children  need to stay at home and speand a huge amount of their time raising their family,and getting financial support from the government.I totally disagree, becauce i believe that a woman can be independent and earning money and  at the same time being a mother.",
        "On one hand,when a woman is not working but instead staying at home raising the children that can have a positive impact to the familly.In addition,children need someone to take care of them so a mother can support them both physically and mentally,by staying by their side she can always protect them and teach them good manners and how to behave properly.Moreover,in order to have a wealth life some financial support it is needed,government should support mothers by giving them a monthly salary so they will be able to raise ther children without worrying about money.",
        "On the other hand,every woman wants to be independent end having their own job and money and be able to support their family.Therefore,having a family is not easy and it requires a lot of money to cover all the necessities,for this reason working mothers have the right to be a part of the workforce.Consequently,they will be able to help with the bills ,provide a good life quality to the family and also have a career.",
        "In conclusion,speanding time with the family is essential but in order to survive it needs financial support either from the government or by employed mothers.I disagree that mothers should stay home because they deserve a place in the workforce."
