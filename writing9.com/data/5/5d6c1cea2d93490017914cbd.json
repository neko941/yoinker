        "Success has many fathers, failure has none! This has prompted many scientific studies on what contributes to success, is it the physical strength of individuals and teams or the mental fortitude? In my opinion, success comes to those who have the right mental attitude. In this essay, I will discuss the arguments along with examples to put across my point.",
        "In today's competitive environment, not only the difference between the physical strength diminished between the competitive teams but also the preparation methods have become standardized. Due to this, the only competitive advantage left is the mental attitude of the individuals and the team. How does one perform under pressure determines the final winner?",
        "A good example will be a recent cricket world cup final where the team with the right attitude won the cup",
        "To further strengthen my point of view, there have been numerous examples where the winner with seemingly less physical prowess than the competitor had won. A recent example will be the boxing fight between Joshua and Hay, wherein, Joshua lost even after being more physically fit.",
        "However, the proponents of another point of view will say that one needs to attain a minimum level of physical fitness to achieve to even compete at the same level. I would like to highlight that adhering to professional is an entry ticket to professional events and sports. It is the winner that is decided after reaching a certain level of proficiency",
        "Furthermore, the applications of the right skill and tactics is determined by the development of your mental aptitude instead of the physical strength you possess. Whether you are an athlete in your prime physical conditions or a team with able-bodied players, it is the application in the critical moments that will determine the winner.",
        "In conclusion, right mental attitude is the key to success in this competitive environment."
