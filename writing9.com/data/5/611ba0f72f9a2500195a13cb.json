        "Just recently I saved my best friend from a rash decision. We had a small get-together last Friday evening. And I noticed that he was acting aggressively and losing his temper at the smallest thing. I asked him what happened, and he said he was thinking of quitting his job.",
        "Of course it was obvious that this decision would impact his life significantly. So I decided to interfere, but I didn\u2019t want to put too much pressure on him, so I just said something like \u2018 I\u2019m here for you if you ever want to talk\u2019.",
        "Just as I expected it appeared that he decided to quit his job because he had a conflict with a colleague. So I realized that this decision was emotional, not logical. Moreover, this meant he wanted to quit a job without another one lined up, which entails uncertainty and having no income for an indefinite period of time. So I decided to help my friend because I\u2019m convinced that this is what friends are for. And I think it\u2019s natural to want to make someone you love and care for feel better again.",
        "I didn\u2019t tell him that he needed to calm down. Instead, I just listened to him and let him vent. About an hour later he realized he was blowing things out of proportion and that he just needed to talk to his colleague face-to-face before the conflict got out of hand"
