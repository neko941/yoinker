        "Pollution is getting global concern which is majority due to the pollution, which leads more rubbish and lettering. Some argue that every individual need to take responsibility to clean streets in their surroundings, whereas other feels that local authorities should take care of this. In my opinion, government should enforce certain rules and provide proper facilities.",
        "To begin with, government have to take step to providing some regular facilities and proper dumping places. Proper garbage truck that can pick up from daily basis, so people cannot spill their dirt across the street. For instance, in my country the government of India initiate scheme of Swatch Bharat, in this scheme they gave two dustbins to every household. People have to dump their dry waste and wet waste in different buckets and then every morning garbed truck came and took both waste, by dividing those waste into two part it will be easy to work for them to recycling.",
        "Government responsibility to clean streets and highways. People are paying taxes to the government and they expect. Local authority should take more and more staff for this purpose. They have to make collecting system and rules that people have to follow them. For example, overseas have a system of cameras that and record everything across streets, if any citizen try split or dump trash anywhere suddenly their inform to local police office and they gave you fine ticket.",
        "To recapitulate, both the local authorities and individuals take responsibility to clean city. Consequently, government should educate people them. Moreover, they should prepare proper infrastructure of waste management."
