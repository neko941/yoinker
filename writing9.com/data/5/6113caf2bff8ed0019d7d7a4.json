        "Nowadays, people prefer to switch their jobs from one organisation to another rather than working for the same company permanently. This essay will discuss why working in the same firm has the benefit of job security, but why having their career in different associations has better opportunities. In my opinion, working for different organisations is advantageous than working for the same company.",
        "Some people believe that working for same organization all their life is benefitual for long term prespective . I firmly disagree with the above statement as working for same organization will cause lack of social interaction between new employees . Certain people wont acquire good social skills in communication due to the cycle of same employees in their respective organization. Moreover , working with same organization will cause the lack of job experience as the respective person is fully commited to same organization. For instance, research have shown that 90% of employees suffer lack of job experience when searching for a  job in new organization due to the this.",
        "However it is benefitual to work for different organization as respective person will get a whole new environment which he has never witnessed before. Social interaction will be improved due to communication with new users . Moreoever, the employees will get a better experience of job and might also increase his job experience boosting up his confidence",
        "In conclusion, this essay discussed the positive aspects of both working for the same company as well as for different organisations. In my view, being employed in various organisations has significant benefits than staying in the same firm."
