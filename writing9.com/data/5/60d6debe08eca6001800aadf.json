        "It is considered by advertising is the best way to make people buy products, While there are others who think that not many people care about advertisement of things. In my opinion, advertising of the product is more attractive for people who care about brands, design, and trends, but some people exist who think only a particular brand and their favourite.",
        "On the one hand, there are a variety of commercial advertisement and public advertisement. Some advertisement is made like film, is including some stories as well. It gives people make to think again, Also these gives people feels touching, pleasure, sad it means that people can think again and choose the product again. Especially in terms of public advertising like stop smoking, stop suiciding-it is including number for counseling. When people that kind of advertisement. People accepted what they says and people can call them. It is important for people\u2019s health and lives.",
        "On the other hand, some people that they do not really care about advertisement. For example, In these days, too many advertising everywhere so some of them hate advertisement of the product. Firstly, people has a favourite things, brands and company, therefore, they just buy the product from a particular company. For example, like apple, Samsung, LG. because these are a big company and already has a good quality of products. What\u2019s more advertising is very similar in these days. They product a similar quality of  the product.",
        "Finally, in my opinion, sometimes advertising has a high effect at consuming products for people because those gives pleasure and very creative which people never thought. In contrast people who has already a particular company and brand it is not necessary it.",
        "In conclusion, some public advertisement is a good effect for people\u2019s health and lives. But some people do not care even hate commercial advertisement."
