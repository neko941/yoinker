        "Foreign country, where different language is spoken can create problems for immigrants which is not a subject of concern for the natives but for people who migrate there, it can be nightmare. While humans can adapt to foreign styles of living quicker, but during those period due to language barrier it can lead to some serious as well as practical problems. I completely agree with this statement with my supporting points below.",
        "Generally, insufficient knowledge of foreign language means language barrier which often results in difficulty for communication. In addition to that, lack of communication skills lead to difficulty in making friends or acquaintance, which as a result can make a person feel isolated in foreign nation. Unfortunately, isolation can often make human brain unhealthy. A good example of this can be, my nephew who went to United States for his higher education suffered same issue in his first 3 weeks after he arrived there.",
        "Regarding to practical problems, foreign language might make an individual challenging to adapt foreign culture as well as hard to get a job. Even if an individual try, it will be difficult for him/her on daily basis while living far from home country provided that they lack essential foreign language. For instance, many Nepali workers are facing very basic day to day problems in Gulf countries as they are unknown of language spoken there.",
        "To conclude, serious practical and social problems caused because of language issue in foreign country, is present mainly in developed country. Furthermore, this threats can only be solved unless there is proper knowledge of foreign language to any foreign travellers."
