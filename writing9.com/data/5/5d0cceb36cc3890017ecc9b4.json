        "This essay is about the social services, without any financial support to high schools and teenagers. Some peoples believe it should be compulsory part in schools for all students. Especially working for the charity organizations, to help poor people and sport them in their lives. These kind of social activities are quite important for the children's, who are young and energetic. I am a strong advocate of this approach for the high school programmers.",
        "Hence, it\u2019s also depends on the school culture, and their preferences in teaching skills. Such as, if there primary goal is just to teach them a technical stuff only, then that wouldn't make out youth interest to help the unstable families and peoples around us. Moreover, this practice shouldn't be limited to educations institutes only, we could even help out neighbors and family members. Despite fro the charity organization, the direct help to the acquaintances will be also valuable. For example, the student in the same class, who deserve a financial support is more deserving person than others, and he/she can immediately get benefit from our help.",
        "Furthermore, In the study campuses, students are keenly interested to lean, not only education as well as, ethics and humanity. Additionally, by just pushing them little bit can make huge change in our future generation to always mercy on deserving person.  Particularly, I guess, they could even take responsibility of family or an old widows womens, who cannot survive in the expensive with without and financial support until she gets some better opportunity to manage her life expenses in better way.",
        "To conclude, in my point of view, helping others is more important than, sports in the  institutes, the younger people will learn the humanity, and they will become a decent and wise person in society and useful assets of the country."
