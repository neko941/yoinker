        "In reality, a high demand in transportation can be largely seen in the urbanized area incurring a huge sum of money on it. However, it is not the same case in the rural region. There are few possible issues inducing these factors and through that solutions can be made.",
        "First of all, as the population in the city grew drastically over the years, ordinary mode of transport such as car is not sufficient enough for them. This is because, high volume of cars in the road leads to traffic congestion causing inconvenience to the public. Therefore, other types of transportation such as commuters, public buses and train are accessible for them to go to and from work more quickly and congestion free. On the other hand, the number of people living in the countryside is considerably smaller than the town, thus the government assumes they do not have a problem of travelling around, but the residents there said otherwise. For example, their cars broke down more often due to poor condition of the roads and they are having trouble in finding other ways to travel.",
        "Fortunately, there are feasible solutions with the collaboration of the government and the citizen. Firstly, the higher authority especially Transport Ministry, need to fulfil the demands of the people resides in the rural area as they too pay the road tax. For example, constructing higher quality roads and increase the number of public buses will help them to travel to place efficiently. Beside that, more job opportunities should be available in the countryside so that more people can live in here rather than in the city.",
        "In conclusion, I believe that the root cause of this situation is due to the overpopulation in the urbans instead of the rural. Luckily, with more job demands and better transportation, will definitely make living in the countryside easier."
