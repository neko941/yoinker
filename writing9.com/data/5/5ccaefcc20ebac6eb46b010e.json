        "Academic evaluation is an integral aspect of learning process to validate students level of understanding and competence. Excessive importance has been attached to testing recently, its preparation and writing examination mounted pressure on the young knowledge acquisitors. This essay will discuss in details why students should be evaluated.",
        "To begin with, teachers does lots of work by preparing what to impact into their students on daily basis, coming to the class to transfer every information necessary for the students to know concerning each subject. Such subjects can be used to test students understanding at the mid or end of the course. For instance, tutors prepares notes to teach prior to the class. However, teachers will not prepare or write examination for students but, rather examine them.",
        "Furthermore, students who attends classes in school has to be examined whether at the mid or end of each term or semester, this will prepare his mind right from the beginning of the class that he has to be serious, both on class work and the ones to be done at home.",
        "One example of this is, a student who spends extra time in studying what was taught in class on daily basis and read ahead of the next class to know better.  Conversely, students level of understanding has to be tested.",
        "To conclude, this essay discussed prominence given to testing in recent days and the pressure mountings on young students. I believe it is necessary for students to be tested on whatever has been taught, as this will comend the efforts of the knowledge impacter and encourage them to influence more young lerners"
