        "Criminal trials can be watch on public television broadcasts in certain countries. Although, there are benefits  and drawback of this trend. However, I argue that televising criminal trials has more disadvantage to our society than advantage.",
        "Certainly, there are some basic advantages of showing the criminal trials on television. The public can learn a lot of court proceedings and low system of the country by watch them at their homes. In the other words, if you becom a victim, you can deal with more knowledge. In addition, seeing criminal trials gives a warning to who thinking of crime. As a result, it can help to reduce the crime rate. For example, the United States government reported a 15% decline in the wrongdoing among youngsters in 2017 due to the televising of the law courts.",
        "On the other hand, I believe that showing the trials on public television is more drawback to society than profit. They may learn how to escape criminal punishment. Additionally, some people who thinking of crime, may learn how to not arrested from trials. Another inperative concern is sometimes young ages could be the victim or criminal. In both cases, showing them faces and family members during the trails may cause psychological confusion as well as in this society or who watched television. Therefore, public television broadcasts of criminal trails can be affect not only criminals but also victims.",
        "In conclusion, there are both of benefits and disadvantages in this arguement. I think that the damage could happen due to the airing of criminal proceedings would have more detrimental effects on the society than the benefits."
