        "Although art is considered a vital aspect in all the traditions all over the world, less numbers of people admires art and opt more to the science, technical and business fields. The modern era requirement of advance knowledge is one of the main reasons of this change of mind and there are certain measures to bring focus to the art as well.",
        "The main reason of people opting to the advance fields is owing to the fact that modern world demand more technical, science related and business minds people as compared to the art. The world has adopted the modern way of lifestyle and have made many inventions, which in turn required people to participate and compete by remaining in the domain of the technological, sciences, and business prospects. According to a recent survey in the USA and Canada, for instance, the chances of acquiring jobs for technical and science fields is 70% higher than those having art knowledge such as paintings, sculpture, and music. Thus, the modernization in the world is the primary reason of people focusing more in science, technical and business fields than the art.",
        "However, there are several measures which could bring focus again to the art field. Firstly, schools and colleges should include art subjects in their curriculum and gives equal importance to them, which they give to science and technical courses. This is because it would motivate students to opt for art fields such as painting, drama, and writing. Secondly, parents should be the advocates of the art field to their children and taught them that art also plays crucial part in their future prospect. Offspring\u2019s in their early age are more likely to get motivated to what they are taught to. Therefore, schools syllabus comprising of art subjects and parents guidance and advocating art to their children are some of the ways of keeping focus in the art.",
        "In conclusion, despite the fact that the art has critical role in all the cultures around the world, people tend to focus more on science, technology and commerce than the art. Innovations and changes in the world which required advance knowledge is the main reason of this alteration of minds. However, giving equal value to the art in learning institutes and parents encouraging their children to the art are the two primary solutions to build interest in the art."
