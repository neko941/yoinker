        "The main function of university has become a hot topic of discussion these days. Some people perceive that graduates should obtain adequate practical skills and knowledge for the future career while others believe students should be able to have access to knowledge which suits their own interests. In my opinion, universities should fulfill both roles.",
        "Some people believe that graduates should learn essential useful skills in the university because it is significant to the future\u2019s career. Students who choose occupation such as doctor or lawyer which has clear career paths will benefit a lot from this as it enables them to pay more attention on improving their ability and avoids them spend time studying some useless subjects. for example, you have to complete a two years degree if you want to study law in Japan and many students believe it is a waste of time. As can be seen, this is more suitable for students who have decided their future careers.",
        "Conversely, some says that students should opt courses according to their personal preferences as some students may not have a specific career goal when they enroll at university. In this case they need to be taught some general subjects such as philosophy or English rather than practical modules. For example, nearly half of business management graduates from my college last year chose jobs that not related to their major. Therefore, it is detrimental to them if we force them to learn unnecessary practical skills.",
        "People\u2019s opinion towards the main function of university is various. Some people say that useful skills should be provided to graduates while others believe courses based on students personal preferences are more important. I\u2019m inclined to believe that both purposes should be fulfilled by the university to satisfy different needs of the students."
