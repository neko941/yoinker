        "I am writing to let you know more about my ielts study progress, that I aimed at to present: my English learning progress in the last 2 months, to test my informal writing, when it comes to a report writing. Finally this report will be a benchmark for of my English level overall, in which we will determine my strengths and weakness in English; to fill gaps and to take an effective decisions referring to your feedback, as you are my perfect English teacher whom can give me a complete feedback.",
        "Despite the fact that the time I have allotted to prepare eilts exam was not enough, nevertheless I had the opportunity to access many reliable resources on the internet those I came across during my English learning. I have looked through and explored more efficient variety of official resource from --DELETED LINK-- , --DELETED LINK-- Cambridge English, --DELETED LINK-- --DELETED LINK-- --DELETED LINK-- In Use, Grammar In Use and many more resource those I have absorbed from multifold knowledge, ideas, tricks and techniques that all is about eilts preparation and different types of English generally, whereas, I have already realized that unofficial and unreliable sites, books and references may cause misinformation and misleading. And all of these references and resources recommended by the experts of  Oxford www.oxfordonlineenglish.com.",
        "I have planned to complete an intensive course of ielts preparation within 3  months with going deeply into the four major parts of English; reading, writing, speaking and listening. During my intensive course I have immersed deeply into the multifarious kinds of English language such as grammar rules, vocabulary range, parts of speech and many more supplementary activities such as exercises, then I have took numerous tests in the aforementioned websites that\u2019s absolutely reliable and free; to determine in advance my English ability to what extent I can be scored in the real tests which leads to know more about where I am and where I am going to be the next months. All of the tests I passed through, I have scored in average 75-90 out of 100 as are showing below images. According to The Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFRL) this level is equivalent to upper intermediate to advanced level; radical change! As a result of this commitment, I have accumulated more than 3,100 new vocabulary specially those used in ielts academic writing (AWL). Also I have tried to answer all the ielts essay model questions. However, apparently I have completed almost 75% of what I required to be familiar to enter the ielts exam.",
        "Although, I have read all the possible essay model questions in eilts writing task 2, my major concern in ielts test is writing task 2, which is tricky and we all know that, the formal writing is very sensitive that needing to pay more attention wherein this type of writing sounds more natural, which used to present literal language rather than colloquial, slangs contractions, abbreviations, jargons and totally informal language. So that,  we need to take one more month of revision and must focus on more deeply this part of writing specifically academic writing task 2, using any official books and references whatsoever.",
        "To sum up, I want to admit that I have made a noticeable difference in the English since when I have connected with you, and now I think I have one more a great chance to step toward the right direction of any aspect of my life include to speak English fluently as it\u2019s the key of education,  the key of job opportunities and the lingua franca of this era."
