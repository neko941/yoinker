        "Generation gap between young people and elderly generation including their parents and baby boomer has become wider as a result of differences attitudes and ideas. Nowadays, lacking of understanding in family has spread into every countries so spreading time together to do a activity such as watching television and having a chat among family is decreasing significantly. This essay will discuss what are the differences between these two generations and what problems might be caused.",
        "First of all, advancement in technology has lead to a generation gap in this modern world which is a main reason of this problem. Children tend to spend most of their leisure time with this technology devices including computer and mobile phone so child would not discuss any problems with their parents and grandparents. On the other hand, elderly people when they have problems would discuss and consult with someone who has more experience. Another difference that we could see clearly is the view on work. young people would like to be owner business while most of elderly people thought that being employee has more secure in term of income and stable. Thus, when these two group of people have a discussion about work, they all are totally different view on work.",
        "All of the differences idea and attitudes between young people and their parents have caused a lot of problems. Firstly, children start to not obey their parents and ignore their value time with family. Secondly, a lack of having a chat in family cause a stress level and stressful is the root of many health problems.",
        "To sum up, this essay discuss what are the differences ideas and attitudes between young and old people and what problem may be caused from the difference. From my perspective, this problem should be solved by listening for each other so a generation gap would become smaller. young generation should listen their parents and their parents also have to accept what generations like, want and need."
