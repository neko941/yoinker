        "Mess media like t.v and net providing opportunities of being a celebraty to the pupil who use internet. This became a current wave with merits and demerits ,which having an effects on larg scale to the society we live.",
        "The idea of being renowned and fame became an addiction to this generation who used to stay on virtual world then real life. This concept of clelebraty keep themselves busy with making own videos or capturing news and views on their smartphone without concentrating on real life doing which they should finish by time. This dependency of using internet leads a very unhappy family time with unsucessfull career ,that effects mentel and physical health . For instance , if we see the tiktok stars, who most of the time are busy on shooting own motions then doing study or household works or concentrating on job,  reflect their addiction of being noted by other. They ,insted of focusing on the real works of living, are  after the unrealistic world fame . Recently Bangladesh ban this apps, because of its excesive use of young star then being on study, shows the harmful side of the chance that internet and media providing to be a star.",
        "On the other side, the tendency of being fashon style sometimes gives people lucky chance which they are looking for and awaited for long. Many diractors of t.v shows sellect their new faces with the help of this currently popular tendency of shoot down him/her self. To illustrate , if we see the talent hunt programs of Bangladesh we easily can sum up the cnances people getting from televation and internet to light them up. This bring hidden skills of persons on air and provide the push they need to be well-known. Raising super stars is a perfect show of this kind telent hunt program. on my view, it is a great platform to perform which offer hope of being a star to the people who never imagine of it , and make them confident on their skills.",
        "In conclusion, although inetrnet and t.v bestow human a possiblities of expressing themsleves, we should not go with flow and must have control on using net and may not let it over come the real life of us."
