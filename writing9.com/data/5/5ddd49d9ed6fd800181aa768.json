        "After the beginning of the 'Industrial-age', men have been taking the high-position or salary all the time, where women deprived of this position. Once it is thought that, women are not capable of handling the crucial situation or they are not like men or they are unable to make a decision that is helpful. But the day has been changed, women are coming through after confronting many impediments. Moreover, the participation of women into the workforce remained unsatisfactory level, so I think the Government should encourage women to join more, to maintain equal opportunity and maintain the balanced workspace in the overall economy.",
        "In before, men are the main earning person in a family, where women contributed to the family, household work, caring children etcetera. In many conservative societies, women are not allowed to work outside. As a result, the Gross Development Progress (GDP) of these countries become low, gender discrimination, women education etcetera problems coming into the view acutely, and the big problem is women's workplace gradually contained into the home, that actually not good for a country. No country becomes developed without equal participation of both men and women.",
        "The government can persuade women, manage proper education and many other facilities, that they can encourage to join the workforce. Women have equal ability to compete with men neck and neck. For instance, garment workers in Bangladesh are the best example of women empowerment, millions of workers are working in this sector, and contributing to the country economy. To minimize the patriarchy from society and establishment of women right, Government has no better way to privileged women come in front of society and should reserve a certain percentage of the job for greater achievement.",
        "In conclusion, it is clearly shown that only Government can encourage women by creating safe workplace and safety, proper training for particular job, after all, can reserve certain percentage for future achievement."
