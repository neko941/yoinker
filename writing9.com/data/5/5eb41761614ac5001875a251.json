        "Some precentage of people believe that to be an effective sportsperson, one need to have a nature capability. Other cotegories of people think that, hard training and practice are more important.",
        "On the one hand, today in our country there are many talanted athletes. Some people argue that being a professional athlete is an innate ability. Needless to say, if we look at the history of some talanted people who play sports they have indigenous capacity, because their descendants, exactly to say, their parents or relatives are also well known representatives in this area as talanted one. Also, some scientists say that, it called a natural faculty which pass from generation to generation. An example of this, our sportmasters who have achieved several high results without any hesitatio. For example, the world boxing champion Shakhram Giyosov. His father insists that, it is a natural ability for him to succed in this. Because both his father and grandfather were professional boxers.",
        "On the other hand, some people say with confidence that, the secret being strong and experienced sportmaster is definitely a regular workout. As I mentioned above, others view is different and can be an exception. Spotrs experts say, that natural aptitude is not  sufficient experienced. To be become a professional, you need to do exercise regularly and workhard on yourself. I support my opinion with following example. Who is famous and experienced in this field. Leo Messi has been interested in football young age and has been involved in the sport on a regular basis. As well as these efforts have brought him fame and professional experience.",
        "To sum up, I think only the natural ability to be a master of sports is not enough. I believe that, the best way to become a successful is doing exercise and working much on yourself."
