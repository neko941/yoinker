        "In this modernized world, it has been observed that grandparents are resisted to spent quality time with their grandchildren. According to my perception, it has several negative impacts on a child. This essay will discuss grounds behind my opinion and justifications in the ensuing paragraphs.",
        "To begin with, there are several reasons for the above mentioned situation. The first and the foremost one is, it may lead many children on a wrong path. To be more specific, staying away from family and especially spending very rare good time with grandfather/mother will effect the life of youngones. They will tend to adopt bad habits such as smoking, consuming alcohol and tobacco. Consequently, this may result in many severe diseases. To illustrate, more than 50% of hostel students are found to be suffering from dangerous illness due to intake of alcohol amd drugs.",
        "Furthermore, despite being apart from their gaurdians, grandbabies lack behind in gaining cultural values as well as family traditions. To elaborate, at an early age children are shifted to hostel for their better education. Hence they are unaware about their culture and resist themselves to follow the traditional values and ocassionally if they attend any family function, they find themselves as a alien their. To give an example, anoe of my cousin named Dhruvi is staying in Canada since seven years and attended the marriage of her friend and felt very alone.",
        "To conclude, this essay discussed the outcomes of aforementioned situation. In my opinion, being a grandchild of my family, it is mandatory to spend some quality time with grandparents, it is due to the fact that they have abundance of knowledge related to culture."
