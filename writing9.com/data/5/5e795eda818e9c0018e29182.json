        "The governments need to expense money on train roads than others.",
        "The public policy of any country needs to expense her wealth for the sake of development so that the policy maker should follow the way which has more efficiently than others.From this conscience, I agree that government should spend money on railways than others.",
        "Firstly, its have to say that train plays a vital role in the economic progress of a country while other vehicles are doing as well. Secondly train is the cheapest method of transformation of human being, their goods, animals and more secure than other cab for the accident. In the meanwhile, people around the World are used to get in trail to go a long distance while other transport is not followed often, though  somebody has private cars. Moreover, if the railway is constructed for first time, it will be long lasting for years after years.On the contrary, the other vehicle road doesn't persist in better condition for one or two years, that's why it should be repeared one year later what is undoubtedly expensive for an underdeveloped or developing countries, the loose of money in the developed countries. However, there also need of roads except railways because the train is a timetable mode of transmission, whereas the need of peeps around is not  depending on the time.So it will be better to give the glance to this street as well as railways.",
        "After all, it should be acknowledged that as we follow train in our daily  life, mostly, so it's needed to expenditure our GDP on railway construction and buying of new rail to spread it throughout the countryside.",
        "In the bird's eye, railway investment will be the best dictatorship and the decision of the government."
