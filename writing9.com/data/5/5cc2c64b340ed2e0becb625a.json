        "There are increasing numbers of news on TV and paper with images. Images are widely used, because the press believes that users will acquire the information easier. The photos are more vivid compared with plain words.",
        "Although words are used more often than pictures, the pictures sometimes more beneficial to convey complex conception. For example, when I was child, I was not at good at math. Even simple multiplications, I always made mistakes. However, if there were images with apple or other fruit, I would do the calculation quickly and correctly. Consequently, I imagined fruits when I do some mathematics exercises without fruit. Even pictures of imagination can help me understand better.",
        "Besides, using images can decrease the time we spend on learning. When I learn some complex ideas about computer programming, it is hard to get the precise definition about differences between reference and pointer. But the picture with house and people makes me grasp the idea instantly.",
        "Pictures are good for people to understand quickly, why the news and magazines don't use it very often? The reason is that a good and matched picture takes more time and money than plain text. Journalists will spend more time on think about a understandable image which can express their ideas very well. Moreover, the images occupy more space in paper, reporters have to add more pages or cut other contents. Therefore, one article with image will cost more than one without image.",
        "To summarize, even the images increase the expense on time and money, the effectives of image is so obvious and useful. Therefore, there are millions of news and TV use pictures to transfer their message."
