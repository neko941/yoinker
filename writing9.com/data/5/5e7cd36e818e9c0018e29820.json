        "Nowadays, the issue of whethet to go on a vacation during public holidays has become a concern for many. A considerable number of people believe that this kind of event might be harmful for the tourist destinations and enviroment. By creating another free time like holidays, they believe that this problem can be solved before its turned into a global problem. This essay will discuss the main problems of this event through the medium of WTA (World Travel Agency) and Greenpeace.",
        "With the advent of enhanced MODE OF transportations, humans realized that this could be a huge oppurtunity for them to travel all around the globe. However, because of the limited time they have, the only chance they get to travel is public holidays. In these days, CO2 emissions and other harmful features shows a dramatic increase in tourits destinations. The reason for this is the crowd of the place. WTA just released an article about this topic that says \u201c During public holidays, close to 68 percent of the citizen decides to travel. While they travel and visit the tourist attractions points, almost 93 percent of them leave their wastes and harm the enviroment. By adding CO2 emission level, we can realize that the destinated touristic place\u2019s air pollution shows an record-breaking increae.\u201d Travelling is our right, but damaging our enviroment isn\u2019t. If we want this places to be seen by our children, we shouldn\u2019t harm it like that.",
        "In order to reduce this crowd and pollution people create, vital steps must be taken. By creating more free time for the workers, people will have a variety of time to travel. With this step, the crowd of the place during public holidays will be decreased. Informing travellers about aformentioned features like CO2 emission and waste will be major reminder for them to not harm the enviroment of the destination. Greenpace started an advertisement showing the outcomes of the damage to the place after holidays. With this advertisement they have managed to reduce CO2 emission and waste level to almost %27 lesser. By telling people what may happen if they destroy the place they travel, we can help them to understand the main reasons why this beauty should be protected.",
        "In conclusion, travelling during holidays is something ordinary. However, because of the lack of time people have, they all decide to travel during their only free time which is holidays. Because of this, the tourist destinations get crowder. Hence, they get dirtier. Air pollution and waste level increase at an extraordinary level. Solving these problems require essential steps. At first, by creating another opputunities for people to travel, they will stop travelling only at public holidays. Also by informing them about the damage they cause, we will help them to realize the beauty we must protect."
