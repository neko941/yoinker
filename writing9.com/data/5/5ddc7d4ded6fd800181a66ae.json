        "It is often argued that students should be engaged in academic activities during their leisure time while few believe it is like pushing them forcefully. Is personal space not necessary for kids?  According to me, allowing pupils to participate in educative activities yields better results.",
        "On the one hand, imposing studies and study related tasks to children may not only make them feel stressful instead it also reduces interest in education. As the proverb \u2018All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy\u2019, kids who are always indulged in such activities are the most lazy ones. Moreover, forcing the children to always participate in educational projects disallows them to pursue their interests because of which their morale is hurt. This may also result in neglecting their studies which could be horrendous in the long run.",
        "On the other hand, instead of wasting time on video games or watching movies, if juveniles spend their time on practical activities then the rational skills among them increases. Moreover, they develop a habit of experimenting which keeps their mind active. Furthermore, by involving in such activities, it makes them think out of the box as it develops their analytic skills. It makes the young ones ready to face the competitive world when they complete their studies. Apart from that, the school going kids who are vulnerable to get distracted, will stay focused and always be streamlined and thorough with the syllabus. Subsequently, the kids will always be intact with their curriculum.",
        "In conclusion, although there are various debates whether or not children should be engaged in learning activities during their free time, I believe the kids should be allowed to participate in such activities to boost their analytic skills."
