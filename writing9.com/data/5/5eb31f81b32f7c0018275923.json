        "Every guardian opt for better chances for their children. Some would argue that school help children in learning new skills; however, others say learning from various curriculums is best for the future lives of young adults. Although school plays an important role in learning expertise in particular field, I believe for acheiving educational credentials in future, young adults should have wide range of subjects to choose from.",
        "On the one hand, basic eduation in school enhances child's ability to choose the activity they are interestred in. That is to say, primary and secondary enables teaching through fun activities by providing knowledge and resurces, which is also essential to avoid overload on children and they learn more efficiently and quickly. For example, a recent survey conducted by The Age revealed that 60% of kindergarten in London provides interactive learning to pupils by games, which ensure ehnanced cognitive skills and better grasping among children. Nevertheless, this method of teaching no doubts proved remarkable progress but subsequently makes youngsters skillful only in limited areas.",
        "On the other hand, studying various subjects at school makes young children capable enough  to borden their horizone of knowlegde, which can be utilised in academic education for higher studies. For instance, candidates, who are interested in continuing further education ought to have wider option to access the subjects of their interest, in which they can have a promising carrer later in life. Therefore, I believe gathering knowlegde about wider range of subjects could help them study further and in choosing the job of their interest.",
        "In conclusion, even though school gives an opportunity to young adults learn skills and expertise to some extent, I consider, various academic subjects could help them to  acquire qualifications for further studies in University."
