        "Dressing style is the most important thing to everyone particularly who works in an organization or company, it will show the quality of the employees work and how smartly are them.  But not all organization judge the employee's work based on how smart are they dressing.  The employee's appearance can be shown from different part based on which department is the employees working.",
        "Some organization has the requirements of the employees who want to work with them. When the employees had been selected to work in front-office in the organization so, they must have to dress smartly and neatly. Because they are the eyes of the organization who will meet the client and guest. For example, there will a situation that the employees need to meet the client outside of the organization head office. Even though the meeting outside of the organization office the dressing of the employees will be the first impression for the client and guest before the meeting was started by them. If the employees do not dress up smartly it seems like to give a chance to the client and guest to cancel the meeting, so the organization will lose their client and it will give a huge impact to the employee\u2019s carrier in the organization such as the organization will fire them.",
        "On the other hand, when the employees had been selected to work in back-office in the organization, so they do not need to dress like the front-office employees because most of the back-office employees do not require to meet the client and guest. For example, the employees who are work in the Information Technology department, because they focus on the client data and other transaction in the organization, of course, they do not need to dress as smart as the front-office employees but have to dress decently.",
        "In conclusion, the employees who work in front-office need extra requirement in dressing style than other employees, because those employees can be the representation of the organization."
