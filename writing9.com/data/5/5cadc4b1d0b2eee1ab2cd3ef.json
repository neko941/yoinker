        "When it comes to decreasing the hazardous elements consumed through meals, having a balanced diet of the utmost importance. The plain truth is that the nutrition-balanced meals would eliminate the accumulation of hazardous factors which exert adverse impacts on human\u2019s health.

However, the balanced diet might also guarantee the sufficient provision of fundamental nutrition, such as protein or vitamin. Henceforth, this activity not only halts the cholesterol-related problems but also ensure the normal circulation in human\u2019s body.",
        "In comparison with the benefits deprived of eating balanced diet, conspicuously, people should also take up regularly sports to gain active lifestyle. Inferred from the fact that carrying out daily sporting exercise could be likely to foster the caloric burning process, which prevents the obesity.
