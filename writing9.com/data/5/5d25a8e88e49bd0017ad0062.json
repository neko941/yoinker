        "In the recent years in many countries, many people has been sleeping lesser than before. A healthy sleeping duration is from 6 to 8 hours but this not been achieved by most of the working adults. Insomnia is referred to someone who has sleeping difficulty and unable to fall asleep resulted in sleeping lesser than required.",
        "There are many reasons for people to sleep less than the required duration. First, stress from work maybe a huge factor. This may happen when someone faced a difficulty to solve a problem, unable to meet project deadline, made a huge mistake which may resulted in loss of work, demotion and so on. Apart from work, stress from family could also be another factor when both husband and wife had financial difficulty to meet ends need. Secondly, many people has been busy fulfilling their night life with various schedules such as networking event, social outgoing, clubbing and all these night life will lead to insufficent sleeping time.",
        "Having insufficient sleep can have impact on both individually and society. Someone with insufficient sleep will not be productive at work and resulted in low work efficiency. Our brain will not be able to function well and our thinking and reaction to questions will be slower. The recommended sleep duration of 6 to 8 hours per day is to allow our body to rest and at the same time, it serves as auto-recovery for our body to heal and increase immune system. Without sufficient rest, we may be able to fall sick easily.",
        "The impact on society cannot be neglected too. Accidents on the road may increase when road users fell asleep while driving and resulted with unwanted injuries and casualties. People may tend to quarrel more when they didn't have enough sleep and resulted in weak harmonization in the society.",
        "In conclusion, sufficient sleep duration is important to maintain a healthy life and increase work productivity. All adults shall aim to achieve a minimum sleep of at least 6 to 8 hours per day to allow our body to rest after a whole day work."
