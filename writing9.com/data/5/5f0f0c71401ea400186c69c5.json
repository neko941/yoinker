        "Currently, many medias communication are using more images and less words to be easier the interpretation of their news and to cause more feeling in readers and viewers. This essay will argument with two reasons why news with pictures are more effective than without those.",
        "The first reason, is that every new has objective such as helps, donations or business. Pictures above disaster news show real conditions after of a natural event, in order to request help. For instance, in 2010 Haiti suffered an earthquake of magnitude 7.0 causing deaths and damages in many cities. Because of different publications with pictures, Haiti received helps of the other countries, arts and soccer players. As a result, people donated millions dollars and food tons. It helped to easily recuperate economic and physical aspects of Haiti. The images caused a lot of impact into people and generate charity and generosity.",
        "The second reason, is that movies companies always put images in newspaper or TV show to release their new films and series. Because is typical that people often take a look at the picture before watch it fully. For example, Game of Thrones series usually put relevant images every season in media summarizing an important act into the series. As a result, this series was the most seen in the world and generated million dollars profit. The images caused great interest into people.",
        "To conclude, all news are pair with any images. Because they are becoming more interesting that large information, so people prefer view an image than read a paragraph. For this reason, nowadays all magazines or TV show are using that as a marketing strategic."
