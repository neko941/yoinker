        "In my opinion, i agree that the young today spend a large amout of their leisure in shopping centres because it can bring negative influences on the youths and the society.",
        "First, spending too much time in shopping centres consums lots of money although they earn much money or not too much. For youngwomen, everytime that they see the product which is saling, immediately they buy although sometime they don't see the cost. They spend a lot of money on clothes, cosmetic, shoes but they don't use it regularly. For example, youngwomen see the jeans which is saling about 50% and they buy it without thinking and trying. But later, maybe they just wear it once or twice or if it isn't fit with their body, they will throw away or give it to another person and it is so wasted.",
        "Sencondly, going to the shopping centers in their free time can decrease their affective work and the communities can suffer from a decrease in the intellectual level because people are more interested in leisure pursuits rather than focusing on their work or study. It is undeniable that an avenger women spend at least two hours doing shopping while shopaholics can deflate their worked or studied hours to go to shopping. The student usually stop reading a book and go to the supermarket nearby if someone request them to go out. The young people could slack of their acquisition knownledge. The economy also suffers due to less work being done.",
        "In conclusion, i beleive that this trend has an overall negative on both the young people and the society as a whole."
