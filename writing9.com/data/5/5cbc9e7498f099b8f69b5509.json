        "People are traveling a lot more than they did before. The travel could be due to higher studies, medical treatment, business or just as a tourist. Some school of though hold that visitors should follow tradition and conduct of the host country. Others are of the opinion that host nation must embrace cultural diversity. In my opinion, visitors must respect the local culture and host country should accept cultures from around the world.",
        "To begin with, if a country accepts diverse culture, it creates a cosmopolitan environment within the nation. The country develops a sense of tolerance and this attitude will benefit their people when the visit other countries. For instance, the United Arab Emirates, despite being a Muslim country has several churches and temples, so that people from all religion can practise their faith peacefully. Another benefit of accepting other culture is that when people from a different country pays a visit, they bring along with them different ideas and knowledge. This exchange of views benefit both the host country and home country of the visitor. For example there are several Indian restaurants in streets of London. This is possible because a lot of Indians visited The United Kingdom and the English people were delighted by Indian cuisine and hence the bloom of Indian delicacies in The UK. This has benefitted both India and The UK economically.",
        "It is true that a nation can benefit from cultural diversity but it doesnot mean the cultures and tradition should be ignored. They should be promoted too and host nation should encourage visitors to follow local customs and trait. Respecting culture of the host nation increases horizon of the visitors and promotes them to have a better interpersonal dialogue with the locals.",
        "To conclude, I believe visitors must respect the tradition of the host country. A country should also accept cultural diversity but not at the expense of losing their cultures and heritage"
