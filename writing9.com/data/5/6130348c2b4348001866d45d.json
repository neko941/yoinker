        "In the current scenario, Traffic Congestion has been one of the most daunting problems experienced by most of the urban people in towns and cities. In this essay, I am going to highlight the causes and the remedial measures to be exercised in order to solve this hurdle.",
        "Firstly, let us take a look at the causes for the traffic crowding in cities all over the world. To start with, there is a tremendous growth in population in recent years and particularly, in metropolitan cities which ought to see a rise in cars in the city. Furthermore, due to lifestyle enhancement in urban societies,rural people migrate to urban areas which further leads to traffic related problems. The another reason for constant usage of car transport is the unreliable and ineffective public transport as these services have been reduced due to lack of proper funding. The third reason is that society has, in general, become more mobile and in order to lead a luxurious and comfortable life, are greatly inclined towards car as their mode of transportation.",
        "When it comes to remedial measures to solve this problem, we all should rise together to eradicate this issue. The government should provide reliable, decent and safer public transport facilities and initiate optimum funding for the same. This would encourage citizens to use public mode rather than their own private vehicles. Also, government should enhance the roads quality and suppress potholes to ensure smooth functioning of transportation.",
        "Taking everything into consideration, cities are facing severe traffic related problems due to population growth and poor facilities. However, there are several things that government could do to address the given problem and also we, being the responsible citizens must follow."
