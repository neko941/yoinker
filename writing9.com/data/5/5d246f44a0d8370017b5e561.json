        "There are homeless people in mostly every society. Few people think that we can help them through financially support. I completely disagree to the idea. This essay will argue that why financial support does not help in elimination of homelessness and what  alternative methods can be chosen to decrease the number of homeless people in society.",
        "Although many people think that providing money to unsheltered people is most effective way of facilitating, but the fact is that mostly these people are lazy and habitual of asking money on streets. Additionally, most of the homeless people are addictive to drugs. The money given to them would be utilized in buying of drugs and the main problem of homelessness will remain there. Recently a study conducted in a journal of social awareness for society, stated that the number of homeless people remained same even though they were given a handsome amount of cash to buy homes. Therefore, the homeless people do not spend the financial aid efficiently. Hence, there must be alternative ways of helping them.",
        "However, the financial aid should be utilized in creating organizations and institutions where the homeless and poor can learn new skills to support themselves and their families. The process of learning does not only reduce the unsheltered people in the society but also lowers the crime rate in the vicinity. For instance, a local government in Punjab, Pakistan initiated a project in March 2018, which not only teaches poor women the skills of beautician, nursing, child care and driving but also giving them monthly money to motivate them in learning. This helped them in getting jobs and living honourably. Therefore, the poor and needy people need proper skills to earn and live comfortably.",
        "In conclusion, treating the homelessness is essential in building healthy society but monetary in not the only solution. There are other ways in which these needy people can be helped."
