        "People\u2019s opinions differ as to whether or not students should be studied together, while there are some arguments against that students should study by themselves would be more efficient. I still believe that it is appealing when we study alone.",
        "On the one hand, studying in groups impacts not only positive for several reasons but also negative facts on pupils. Firstly, studying along with their friends helps them to gain more knowledge. This is an opportunity to better understand the topic by discussing and can get more important and desperate closer to important events such as exams and assignments. Lastly, collective learning can boost motivation from the progress of others. Many students derive energy from being around other people and look forward to learning and discussing material with classmates. Having a study group will also make learners more accountable. Other people are counting them to help with studying, so it\u2019s less likely that they will skip studying. However, your study could be interrupted anytime. There are many people in the group so it is inevitable for them to say off the topic. Moreover, if the abilities of the members mismatch too much, then the pace will further slow down.",
        "On the other hand, I am inclined to believe that self-study brings many merits. Firstly, it shapes an independent learning attitude. Students normally have the ability to deal with all difficulties themselves instead of asking for help from teachers or peers. In particular , students would be capable of addressing academic problems independently which is considered as a benefit in today's society. Secondly, study in solitude can control over study schedule. When students study alone they can plan a study schedule that works best for them and take breaks when they please. When students study in a group, the priority is finding a time that works for everyone, not finding a time that is most effective for studying.",
        "For the reasons mentioned above, it seems to me it would be worth-while for learners to  study in solitude."
