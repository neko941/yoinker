        "Individuals in different parts of the world purchase trendy apparel and ensure that their hairdo is in line with the current trend. This essay will discuss reasons for this and its resultant effect.",
        "Some categories of people buy outfits just to follow the trend. They always like to be seen wearing a modern brand. Most times, they do it to feel good about themselves while some use it as a show off.  More also, hairstyles are chosen based on the current trend. This is common among the female folks. It includes fixing of artificial hairs, cornrows and dreadlocks. For example, the contemporary style at the moment is keeping of natural hair. In addition, individuals especially youth likes staying fashionable as a result of peer pressure. They spend a lot of money on things in vogue just to keep up with their friends as they don't want to be seen lacking behind in any new fashion trend.",
        "However, this present day lifestyle will cause more harm than good. This will result to irrelevant spending and lack of savings. People who are stylish in a trendy way lack the ability to save up for raining days. New attires as well as hair styles are evolving on a daily basis and most times, the savings are touched to satisfy their desire leaving important things unattended to. For instance, fashionistas spend irrelevantly on items they already posses just because of little modification on the new one. Additionally, they tend to get involved in social vices such as stealing and prostitution When their desires can no longer be funded.",
        "In conclusion, the need to stay up to date in fashion world and keep up with the  standard set by friends and the society is the justification for the collosal upsurge in current fashion trend. Notwithstanding, I think it shouldn't be encourage as this will limit the ability to save and also lead to social vices which will in turn affect the society negatively."
