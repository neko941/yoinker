        "Indeed, the information provided by reporters should be true without any contamination. Is the right message delivered? While few argue not all reports published are true and some debate that media is run by the influenced people, I believe the truth is not revealed completely.",
        "To begin with, the media, which is the most successful business throughout the world mainly, focuses on attracting people rather than delivering the right news. Moreover, their only motto is \u2018more the controversy, more the followers, because of which the people are afraid to face the media. They mainly target the celebrities and businessmen to grab the attention. The pre-eminent example is the downfall of famous football player Zidanine Zidane who was cornered for being rude to the referee. Besides, the crime rate is growing rapidly knowing the fact that the media is corrupt, the fear of being penalized is deteriorated among law breakers. Subsequently, the truthfulness in news is adulterated.",
        "Furthermore, the main concept of a newspaper is not only to publish an article instead, the right fact to be delivered to the citizens. As most of the people start their day by reading a newspaper or watch news on television, it is the basic responsibility of press to pass over the statistics to the believers. The people, after reading the articles in the paper get carried away with the emotion due to which the mindset may be disturbed. Therefore, the media should portray the facts without making any changes. Apart from this, they are influenced mostly by the rich because of which, they are bribed easily making them succumb to alter the data. Consequently, the main function of paper is compromised.",
        "In conclusion, I strongly believe, although the information passed by the media or the press is eye catching, all that is printed is not accurate. Therefore, any news should be validated before it is accepted."
