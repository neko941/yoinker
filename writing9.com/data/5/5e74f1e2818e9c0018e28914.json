        "People af art, such as craftmen and instrumentalists are generally considered to be dependent on funding and therefore society in some countries are believe that they have to be financially supported by government. I strongly agree with that statement because of the benefits they could bring to the world in general.The essay will first look at how artists can help to solve some ethical issues and then discuss the advantages they can bring to nation.",
        "Speaking of musicians, according to statistics they are one of the most persuasive persons all over the world. Millions of people,especially from young generation,follow them and their ideological values. Thus, by their art they can spread vital information to the public in order to increase their ethical knowledge and make them aware of global problems that are needed to be taken into account. Consequently,people of all ages begin to think globally. Moreover,music is the universal language of mankind. When words leave off, music begins,in other words,by music any human beings may find inner peace. Hence,it can work like a cure or even psychological support.",
        "Moving forward, performers not only affect human's mind but also may enhance government revenue. They somehow provide their motherland with a number of tourists,to be more specific with their admirers who keen on seeing their idol's homeland. Furthermore, artists also make a contribution in different charity organizations and so help to solve global issues.",
        "In conclusion,even If talented individuals like musicians sometimes are considered to be useless they can enrich a country's culture and so justifiably deserve to be financially supported."
