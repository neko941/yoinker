        "In the world nowadays, people gain money in the variety of ways with their talents and abilities. It is true to say that the total revenue of celebrities is more than the politicians. In my view, this is a positive development and I will support my idea with the following examples and reasons.",
        "On the one hand, there is a considerable difference in earning annual money between famous people like celebrities and politicians. Remarkably reasons make this diversity such as a positive position in society. For instance, superstars which were spent a significant time of her/his life to become an outstanding person",
        "by means of playing movies with its problem and difficulty. Therefore, they become a popular person with",
        "positive and amiable appearance, among young and elder people. Moreover, the advertisement and commercial company suggests a well pay contract to advertise their products. Not only they earn considerable money but also they possess influence on the highest rate of people. What is more reason is an investment company which is searching to find popular people to investigate with them; However, people who have politic responsibility, politicians, almost become an aggressive figure among society. This may be caused by their politicians and rough decisions which are unpopular.",
        "On the other hand, the advantages of diversity in gaining money between distinguished people",
        "and",
        "statesman is more than disadvantages. Possess impression among the society after that becomes a pattern and template of people, especially youth people are one of the benefits and acceptable reason to be a consider that this is a positive development.",
        "In conclusion, to convert a popular person among society with a kindly picture has more benefit such as an unbelievable income that the unpopular person."
