        "Nowadays, it has been observed that many people tend to stay in different cities over their lifespan. This is in contrast to earlier times, when people mostly lived in a particular city all their life. There are pros and cons of both which I will be discuss in detail.",
        "On the one hand, living in a single city has the main advantage of familiarity. Over time, one becomes knowledgeable about the city in terms of its climate, various facilities that city offers like nearby hospitals, schools, shopping complexes etc. This familiarity is very helpful in day to day life. A sense of comfort also comes with living in a single city as one knows most of the city and immediate neighborhood area. This also becomes disadvantage of changing cities often as one needs to constantly learn about the new city which may look very challenging to certain people.",
        "On the other hand, main disadvantage of living in multiple cities over course of life is that one gets to experience different cities in terms of their culture, climate, career prospects, traffic, pollution, facilities etc. Such things have a huge impact in day to day life. There is a popular saying: A frog living in a single well thinks that this is the whole world not knowing a whole new world awaits outside ready to be explored. For example, Bollywood icon Amitabh Bachchan lived in a small city before moving to Mumbai where he realized his career dream of becoming an actor and earned super stardom. This wasn\u2019t possible had he stayed back.",
        "In conclusion, in my opinion, one should be flexible enough to explore different cities and opportunities that it offers and then make an informed choice of where to settle down, if at all."
