        "With the advancement of education sector supply of labour to all industries has increased. Due to this fact, nowadays, youngsters come into the job market with plethora of knowledge on the job they are aiming to do. This has created a competition in the market with the existing employees. This essay will explore the problem of software developers in software idustries in relation to evolving technologies and suggest early retirement plan as a possible solution to overcome this problem.",
        "In software industries technology plays a bigger role and it evolves every day. A fresh graduate comes to the market with all up-to-date knowledge in the latest technology unlike, the already available employees. Further, a fresh graduate will be cheaper compared to seniors who are already employed. This tends the company to hire more fresh graduates than investing hefty money in improving the knowledge of the current employees. Unless a current employee update themselves, new graduates will soon become a threat to their existence in the company. For example, recently a famous Tech company layedoff hundred software developers at the age fifty to higher five hundred new graduates.",
        "However, to overcome such problems, one possible solution could be to introduce an early retirement plan for the senior developers. This will enable them to be ready to face the retirement phase well, without encountering it in surprise via a layoff. Recently, a famous tech giant in the United States of America, as their company policy, introduced an early retirement plan for it's software developers with a pension scheme.",
        "To summarize, problems such as evolving technology in software industry will always create a competition among yongsters and older developers. However companies should look for solutions such as early retirement plans to mitigate those."
