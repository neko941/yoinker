        "Governments collect taxes from working individuals for the upkeep of the nation. However, some people advocate that they should not be liable to pay any amount and should keep all the money they make. This essay argues in favor of this statement as it helps in raising the standard of people and decrease the corruption in the official departments.",
        "Firstly, a salaried person would be able to have more cash at this disposal, if does not have to pay anything in the form of tax. One can fulfill a lot of dreams from this extra money, which will improve his standard of living, and will further help in raising the Happiness index of the country. For example, a person earning Rs 10, 00,000 annually has to shell out 20,000 in form of income tax. If a person retains this amount, then he can use it to go on a trip or buy a new furniture which will definitely make him more happy. This is clear, that more cash helps in raising the standard of people.",
        "Secondly, less money with the authorities helps in curbing prevailing corruption among them. Authorities would be having limited amount of means to develop the country\u2019s infrastructure and they would use it to the optimum level. For example, bureaucrats misuse the hard earned penny of people by using it in unnecessary tasks. When they would be having limited means they would think critically and make the best use of the available resources.",
        "To conclude, the notion of not paying tax to authority will help in the overall development of the country by improving the happiness index and reducing red-tapism ."
