        "It is sometimes argued that in sprite of the technological development, there will be increasing number of newspapers consumed in the future. I completely disagree with this declaration.",
        "The first reason why I think online newspaper is a megatrend that will take the place of newspaper soon in the future is that online newspaper is extremely handy, especially in the industry 4.0 era when each person get at least one own technological device, reading news on the internet may be the priority choice of them. Bringing the smart phone and accessing to internet, they can practically catch up with the flow of the information around the world and don\u2019t need to bring the papers that make their bag heavier.",
        "Another reason is that the information on the online information always in the state of being revised regularly and the reader can grasp it in about some minutes. In the past, the readers had to read the newspaper carried to them every morning while in the today\u2019s world, the readers can keep themselves informed whenever they want. They can even smoothly find out about the old information kept as archives in the memory of the website.",
        "Last but not least, it\u2019s free to read an digital newspaper while you have to spend money to read physical one. Even the cost of newspaper may not costly much but reading news on the internet can help the readers to diminish a portion of their spending compared to those who are not.",
        "In conclusion, I do not believe that newspaper can constantly be the main resource of the information source."
