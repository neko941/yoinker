        "In the modern age, it has seen a considerable",
        "increase in global tourism. There are some areas have depended on tourism for their income and at the same time, it has had an impact negative on our societies. However, there are both pros and cons associated with this trend, which the essay will discuss them here.",
        "On one side of the argument, there are people who argue that the benefits of tourism considerably outweigh its disadvantage. The main reason for believing this is that countries\u2019 income will be increased enormously the great tourist influx. Hence, it will help to improve the standard of living for local people, and meanwhile, an economy in these countries will rise. For example, developing countries liked Thailand and Indonesia have become the playgrounds of tourists from more affluent ones. As a result, these countries were focused their attention on this aspect and made tremendous works to attract exponentially tourists.",
        "On the other hand, It is often argued that",
        "tourism can have an adverse effect on the natural environment. This means the building of facilities and infrastructure can destroy the habitat of wild animals. In addition, it can create pollution and waste. One good illustration of this, what we see nowadays in numerous tourism areas of an accumulation of waste and a sabotage the beaches to build huge hotels for guests.",
        "In conclusion, I believe both arguments have their merits and cons. On balance, consequently, I feel that the drawbacks of tourism far outweigh its benefits."
