        "The issue of obesity is increasingly prevalent amongst school aged children in Australia. Many people believe that schools should be proactive in promoting the health of these children by monitoring their food consumption and exercising levels. This essay will illustrate why I strongly agree with this opinion.",
        "Children lack the maturity to think about and maintain their health properly. A lot of young children are drawn to \u201caddictive\u201d foods that are high in sugar and fat contents without knowing the effects of these foods on their health. Schools therefore need to educate children on nutrition and the effects of eating unhealthy foods, e.g., weight gain and other health issues. However, education alone is insufficient; it should be accompanied by the monitoring of food consumption and exercise output. This helps to reinforce the importance and implementation of healthy eating and exercising habits.",
        "While parents play a major and crucial role in maintaining the physical health of their children, they may be too busy to ensure that their kids are eating healthily and exercising regularly. Therefore, many parents may expect the school to assist them in this important task. Educators can collaborate with parents by recording what each child eats during recess or lunch time as well as the level of their physical activeness throughout the day. Since children spend one third of their time at schools, this is a valuable opportunity for the Australian educational systems to help combat the problem of childhood obesity.",
        "In conclusion, I fully agree that the schools in Australia should take the initiative to monitor children\u2019s food consumption and exercise output. This will help children effectively practice healthy lifestyle habits and share this responsibility with the parents."
