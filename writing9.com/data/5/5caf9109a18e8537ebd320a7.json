        "Most of the medical practitioners think that people do not do much physical exercise in current time. In this essay, we are going to explore the reasons behind this issue and will recommend some useful solution.",
        "A group of medical doctors believe that a number of people do not spare sufficient time for their physical activities to maintain their health. One of the key issues is that a number of people go to bed very late at night. They also think that physical exercise means that an individual has to get up early in the morning for jogging that is a completely wrong ideology. To counter this issue, first of all, an individual has to change their lifestyle. To have a well-maintained life people need to make a schedule for their daily life.",
        "Another issue is the addiction to modern technologies such as social networking websites, Computer games, and long TV series etc. Teenagers mostly spent their free time chatting with friends or watching TV and fail to spare valuable time for physical exercise which ultimately is making them physical and mentally weak day by day. It can have drastic effects on human physical and mental health. Therefore, the government needs to arrange debates or seminars on a national level to highlight this issue or an individual need to motivate their friends or family members to join the gym. Also, government health department needs to make parks in every society to attract people of that area.",
        "In conclusion, ever one needs to understand that physical exercise should be one of the important tasks of daily routine because it will directly effect the human body and indirectly thinking ability."
