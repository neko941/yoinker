        "Increasing number of fathers nowadays stay at home to cater for their children as mothers become breadwinners. While this is caused by the ever increasing emphasis on gender equity, girl child education and woman empowerment, it is an unwelcome development.",
        "Over the years, so much emphasis have been on women empowerment and gender equity and this seemed to have relegated men and fathers to the background in the socioeconomic sphere. Women now becoming more ambitious. In addition, rising cost of living among families have pushed mothers to also take up jobs. These jobs sometimes pay better than that of fathers, so fathers may give up their job to become househusbands for the sake of their children especially if it is expensive having a nanny. These are the 2 main reasons why fathers babysit and cater for children and mothers are out there providing for the family.",
        "Housekeeping and taking care of children by fathers is one of the cultures downturned by  modernism and civilisation in the world today. The question is are   fathers naturally built to cater for babies and children? Even  from childhood, instinctively, a girl child is homely and attend to house chores far much more than a boy  and women are naturally endowed with all that is needed to nurture babies and cater for children. An example of this is the breast milk for a hungry baby, which we all know has no substitute, not even the best of infant formulae. Naturally the body chemistry and neural wiring for mothers are meant for children's care giving, whereas that of a father is hustling and providing for the family. Any change in tide against nature such as this, is always a negative one. It is indeed a social malady and its repercussions will soon befall the world in the future.",
        "In conclusion, children's care giving by fathers is a family ill because it is unnatural. Its causes are, increasing family economic demand and women empowerment and its negative effects will soon manifest in our societies if this trend is not reversed."
