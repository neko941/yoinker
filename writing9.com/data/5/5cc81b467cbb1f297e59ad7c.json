        "Nowadays, the crimes are rising at very alarming rate ,specially between children . There is no enough social and sentimental education by their parents and teachers  ,and is considered to be the primary cause for such crimes. I agree with this statement as lack of closeness in the family and the artificial intelligence at school.",
        "Firstly,many children below 18 do not have the essential learning from their parents,resulting in an increase in the rate of crimes among them. This is because both mothers and fathers need to work in order to earn money, which results in growing up the young in a parentless environment with lack of social and passion meaning. They ,for example,are looking for these meanings by having bad friends to socialize, which will lead them altogether to harm the society and themselves by doing unmoral issues such as rubbery.",
        "Secondly,the growing rate of crimes also comes from the way of teaching pupils at school. In some cases,technology is applied in most of the classes recently,which lack the emotional connection needed to motivate children to learn, and, as a result the young will be effected by such a situation and look forward to playing violent games,which will impact their behavior and encourage them to commit crimes in the near future.Furthermore, some educators have an extremely rigid teaching style,which encourage learners to have unethical behaviors.",
        "In conclusion, committing crimes amongst young learners  can result from lacking of social and passional learning by parents and instructors . Doing crimes at a young age will have a detrimental influence to the children and society as a whole."
