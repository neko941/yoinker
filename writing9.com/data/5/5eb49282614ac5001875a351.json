        "Although agriculture has been incredibly improved in the last fifty years, many people suffer from the lack of food around the world. This essay will discuss the main reasons of the food insufficiency including economic inequality and climate change. This essay will also suggest solutions to reduce famine around the world including massive investments in agriculture and reduction of pollution.",
        "The third world is the most concerned by food insufficiency. Firstly this problem is connected by unbalanced budget of those countries. The lack of fund and investment to provide agricultural equipment contribute to slow the development of agriculture. Therefore, the agriculture is generally made by traditional ways and remain insufficient to feed all population.  In additions, the consequences of pollution have been observed in many African countries where the soil is more and more dry, and the desert is moving several kilometres per day reducing the availability of agricultural soils.",
        "To help those populations; the western world should take more actions and review the amount of investment in poor countries. The investment should target agricultural field and provide modern equipment to make massive agriculture. Also, they need seriously to reduce pollutions by taking strict measures. For example taxing highly all polluting industries.",
        "There is a growing number of starving people around the world. While developed countries can master this phenomena, other populations are dying from famine. Governments must be aware of the dangerous causes to this insufficiency and develop agriculture by modernising equipment and keeping the environment safety and soils fertile."
