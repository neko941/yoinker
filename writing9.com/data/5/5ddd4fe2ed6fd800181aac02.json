        "Dear Sir,",
        "I am writing to complain about the Television set I recently purchased from your online store.",
        "My name is Queen Joseph, a regular online customer with ID number B65GQ1. I work with Tescom Limited and I acquired a Samsung Television set from the just concluded black Friday sales.",
        "Last week, I received a call from your dispatched rider asking if they can dropped the Television with my residence security since I was not home at the time of their arrival. Unfortunately, when I got home and tried setting up the Television, first thing I noticed was that the remote buttons were not responding even after swapping different batteries. Next was a crack on the monitor and this made the picture incoherent. Moreover, the sound quality was shaking and low despite increasing the volume to the end. Hence, watching my favorite crime series was abortive as there was no Universal Series Port (USB) to connect flash drive. I spoke with a customer representative two days after and she assured me of an immediate retrieval and replacement of a new set of Television which was not carried out. I called last week and spoke with a new representative who gave the same assurance like the previous and still no support has been given.",
        "Following the circumstances surrounding the faulty Television set I received and the nonchalant attitude of your store assistance, I request an expedited service to be rendered either by replacement of a new Television or a full refund within three working days.",
        "Thank you as I await your swift response.",
        "Yours Faithfully,",
        "Queen Joseph."
