        "Work wear attire has been a hot topic lately. Prior to the 21st century, men and women conformed to the notion that one must wear formal clothing to work. But today's citizens are questioning the status quo. The possibility is a correlation between dressing smartly and the quality of work is something I seek to investigate.",
        "Organisations such as banks are rather rigid in terms of dress code, but there might be a logical reason behind this. Given the nature of the job, which involves interacting with customers and clients on a daily basis, it is important to dress appropriately in order to send across the right message. It is commonplace for people to form an impression based on ones appearance. For instance, wearing slacks and a coat and tie could signal seriousness. Whereas, showing up to a meeting in a pair of shorts might be construed as a lack of respect or interest.",
        "However, the resounding success of technology companies such a Google proves that appearance has nothing to do with the efficacy of an organisation. People at Google, starting from the CEO dress casually to work. The atmosphere and values of the company is such that, fulfilling your responsibilities are paramount and the clothes you decide to wear are a triviality.",
        "To conclude, I firmly believe that if appearance does have a significant impact on the prosperity of the company, individuals should dress smartly. But, if this isn't the case employees should have the freedom to dress as they please as long as it doesn't interfere in their day to day tasks."
