        "Nowadays, technology advancement in agriculture does not able to provide food to everyone in the world has become a controversial issue. Although, availability of  new method and equipments have increased the production of growth, while, still not everyone is get benefited and accessed by it. This is because of growing population and limited quantity. This essay will discuss problem and possible solution further.",
        "On the one hand, of the aargument, rapidly increasing population has less quantity to used it on a mass level. In other words, growing demands is not able to be fulfilled by the limited available store of food. As per 2018 survey by FSI, Wheat production was recorded in high amount as compared to past years, but at a same time according to population record for 2018, it has risen 65% more from the 2017. Moreover, the case of wastage, not managing and preserving available quantity properly by means of cold storage and good Godowns are also the causes of this situation. Hence, about more than 10% of the world's population is not able to get it for their foor requirements.",
        "Regarding some measures to solve this issue, everyone has to become aware that available food have their limited access. Firstly, every nation's government must has to arrange one body regulate cold storages and godown, by doing proper inspection. By this, food which is stored, could be preserved for long uses in the time of scarcity. Secondly, everyone should has to understand the importance of food without wasting it. If there is situation, it can be share to needy by some authority or by on an individual level also. It is all done by awareness programs by government. The last possible solution, by controlling the birth-rate, demand could be limited which would benefits the present day person.",
        "In conclusion, despite increase in technology advancement in agriculture, everyone is not able to fulfilled by the food requirements because of surging demands. All it can be conqured by taking measures of awareness, proper management and controlling the population growth."
