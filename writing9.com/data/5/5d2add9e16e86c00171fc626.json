        "A language serves as a medium to communicate and converse that is vitally important as of other important needs. Some people believe that speaking of a foreign language in a foreign country can be troublesome and can seriously affect the socializing and where we need to transfer our information. To invalidate this believe we shall be discussing why inhabiting a country where you will have to commute in its native language wouldn't be a problem.",
        "Speaking a foreign language is difficult as to speak you need to have prior list of vocabulary and the words to join all vocabs in the sentence and that should be understandable to a local person of that area. Problem arrives when it comes to the week sentencing and not being able to deliver the idea what you want to deliver and that particular time. Considering a language as a vast pool of words, ideas and phrases, one would never be able to master it without a proper study over this subject. Take a man for example who went out of his native country for any sort of work and could speak of a language of his destined place but he would face much difficulties in communicating as the thought process would cost his time from thinking of the idea in his own language to translate it into new language and deliver it. Therefore, a much struggled life of a person will ensue.",
        "On the contrary, this idea of Social and practical difficulties becomes invalid because to speak a language you do not need to learn whole system of speech. Many a natives also make mistakes and do not have complete knowledge of their own language. Everyone agrees upon a point of language being medium to communicate but the point they misses out that it is not the whole world and is totally not necessary to master and one can socialize with his just sound knowledge.",
        "To conclude that where ever you live having even just a sound knowledge and understanding of the native language of that area you can easily go with all activities and not much problem to be faced for what that many a times does not matter. In my opinion language must be kept as language and not the scale to measure the problems for being familiar or unfamiliar to it."
