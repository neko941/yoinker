        "In the world today, people are becoming more fashion conscious and this is evident in their dressing and hairstyles. In my opinion,people desire to look classy and fashionable in order to fit into the society and this has in turn led to so many illicit practices.",
        "Firstly,people dress according to the fashion trend in order to appear rich and sophisticated. Some do this because of the nature of their jobs. For instance,celebrities,actors,actresses,musicians and models) dress fashionably and also make the latest haistyles with the latest makeup on their faces in order to look appealing to their viewers.Most of them wear clothes or carry a particular hairstyle in order to name it after them. For example, in the 1990*s a particular beautiful,low cut hairstyle was named after a Romantic and Blues(Rand B\") musician called Toni Braxton.",
        "On the other hand,the religious society and most cultural groups condemn trendy fashion because of its negative impact,especially on our youths and even marriages.A recent study has shown that many Nigerian universities enforced some draconian laws regarding indecent dressing in schools.This is as a result of girls wearing revealing clothes in order to be fashionable or attract the opposite sex,thereby leading to rape. Boys prefer to wear singlets or T. shirts with a crazy hairstyle.some of them even colour their hair and this attracts cultists,thereby luring them into armed robbery.",
        "Another point is that some married women feel jealous when they have friends whose husbands are rich and can afford sophisticated clothings and human hair weave-on for them.This makes them feel that their husbands are unable to provide for them and in most cases,they commit adultry in order to meet up with such class.This can lead to divorce or seperation.",
        "In conclusion,dressing fashionably is not bad,provided one dresses decently and makes resposible hairstyles that will not lead to illicit practices such as rape,theft,cultism and adultry."
