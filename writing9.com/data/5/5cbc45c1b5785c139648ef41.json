        "Parents tend to provide their children with plenty of toys. This essay will suggest that buying a large no of toys makes the children build greater intelligence is the biggest advantage of this and children develop an introvert personality is the primary disadvantage.",
        "Kids are bought a big no of toys by their parents so that they utilize their mind continuously to learn new things. Now a days the toys available in the market are more of intelligence based toys where kids have to think wisely and use their mind to be able to play with toys and it is a known fact that more the mind is utilized more the sharper it becomes. For example, a Rubik\u2019s cube is the kind of toy where, to match the specific colour pattern the player is supposed to think of different patterns and the way to arrange the cube in such a way that all the sides have the same colour on all its rectangles.",
        "Despite the advantages, playing with the toys have created a sense of reservedness in the kids. More the kids are engaged with the toys more they remain inside the house and don\u2019t tend to go out and socialize with other kids this, in turn, causes them to become shy and reserved. A recent survey carried out by local children society reveals that the kids who tend to play more with toys and remain inside their house have a sense of reserved and fill shy to face big gatherings.",
        "In conclusion, guardians offering plenty of toys can be advantageous for kids to make them brilliant, however, they must be careful about the choice of the toys as kids engaged in playing with the toys show a sense of reservedness."
