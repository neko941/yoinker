        "Tourists visit the historical places and museums more than the native people. This essay will discuss some reasons for this situation and provide possible solutions to tackle this concern.",
        "It is a human tendency that we generally take things for granted which are in abundance or easily accessible. This is one of the reasons that local people do not value the artefacts, history which is near to them. They have grown up hearing the stories about the ancient culture and historical events of the place. Therefore people neither take interest in the story nor do they make effort to verify the content. Furthermore, they know shortcomings of the museum or site and human psychology always give far more emphasis on drawbacks than to benefits. For example, it is estimated that more than half of the nearby population has not visited the Taj Mahal in Agra which is one of top tourist destination in the world. Locals thought they already know too much and give more importance to demerits rather than appreciating the beauty of the Taj Mahal.",
        "There are two possible mutually exhaustive solutions to abate this problem. Firstly, a inclusive approach is needed. Local people should be involved by conducting trivia, quizzes about the said destination so that they get to show off their knowledge of the place. In this process, they may also realize their knowledge gap and it may pique their interest further. Secondly, nothing is better than good publicity. An advertisement consisting of unknown facts about the fabulous past, artefacts etc will substantially draw the locals. After that, word of mouth is all will be needed.",
        "To conclude, the reasons such as half knowledge and abundance deter the locals to visit the destination of historical importance. But targeted events such as quizzes, trivia to increase their involvement and good publicity can promote the tourism to their local pride by native people."
