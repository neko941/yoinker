        "My 6 years old cousin started his very first class at 1st grade which does not same with  almost children in recent time . Throughout his first 6 years, his parent didn\u2019t take him to kindergarten as many others  kids because they strongly believed that they could become their son\u2019s best teacher. Until, they recognised  that the kid couldn\u2019t quickly adapt to new school\u2019s environment.  In fact, there is a widespread belief that parents are children\u2019s best teachers. Although the statement is a controversial one, I completely disagree with this opinion for two following reasons.",
        "Firstly, it\u2019s easy to see that parents are not perfect enough to complete the imperfection of their children.  There can be no doubt that people and things in the outside world can well contribute to the development of the youth. The first reason for this point of view is that there are several skills which children cannot learn from their own parents such as communication, teamwork and\u2026. Essentially, children might get such skills whenever they have chance to contact with several factors in society. Particularly, a child who was early taken to the community and had a chance to communicate with others is always more confident than the others who didn\u2019t . In other words, in this case, society and other stuffs  in it have become a sufficient teacher to children.",
        "Secondly, owing to the development of economy, parents are hectic with making a living. Hence, they are definitely not able to stick to their sons or daughters 24/7. It seems that  fathers and mothers have only 10 hours per day to instruct what their kids should do or not. Therefore, most of the time, the adolescent associates with community and is affected by this part of society . As a result, society coincidentally becomes a part which effect on children\u2019s improvement.",
        "Although, there are many supporting opinions for the statement \u201cparents are the best instructors to kids\u201d because they can well- understand their kids from daily habit to thinking. However, if we carefully considered every single feature which need for the development of a child, we would see that society and its parts play vital roles for the development of teen-agers.",
        "In short, despite the common thoughts of most parents, we need to weigh up the pros and cons of this teaching method in order to find out the most proficiency way to instruct and develop children."
