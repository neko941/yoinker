        "We all done things in the past that may had succeed, or failed, however, to argue that the proportion of past experiences contributing down the road in one\u2019s life has very diverse point of views.",
        "To those who believe the process of elimination, history is always a source that they learn and pick up things that know they shouldn\u2019t do in the future. In my case, when I was in teenages, I was a heavy smoker, at peak time, consuming staggering 3 packs a day, as a result after 10 years, I found there are multiple white spots that precived as damaged area on my lungs showing in my X-Ray scaning. From that day of my lesson learned, I stopped smoking ever since.",
        "Some people take a very contrast view from that, which abstracting patterns from the past is an option failure by defult. The world well-know investor Jim Roger once said:\u201d Anything you know that\u2019s true today is going to change tomorrow.\u201d In other words, implementing the old knowledge to interact in a consitant changing envirenment is arragont and surly wrong. In my opinion, I think he is right to a point where the surroundings of our lives are not as the same as  in the past, therefore, we should be awear if what we learn from the past is going to rely heavily on the outside conditions of the future, then, what we learn may not gain us much help.",
        "In conclusion, people have diverse point of views on the effectiveness of learning from the past. However, one can argue that\u2019s good because a heavy smoker had learned to quite smoking. One can say that the envirenemnt in the past will not be the same as the future. My opinion is to be aware of the setup of the past envirenment."
