        "Nowadays, there has been reduced in the sleep pattern among people, in many parts of the world. This trend of less sleep is due to the immense competition and pressure to reach a certain goal in life. To fulfill their desire, people get into rat race and work for long hours by compromising their sleep.  It certainly damage once productivity and also it has a indirect negative impact on the society.",
        "At present, the pressure of achieving goals is very high. Usually earlier there was not many expectations about life, but now to show case a good status in the society people work so hard, that they don\u2019t even care about to relax and get a healthy sleep. The prestige of buying house, cars and branded things is the driving force for a long working hours by compromising on a sleep.",
        "However, this rat race cost a lot for a person and society. Less sleep reduce the productivity of an individual which in ultimately effect the whole society. The performance level get reduced and at the same time real potential of a person cannot be seen in their work or for the society. Such as, a cricketer who have to perform well in the matches but, if that cricketer does not get a good amount of sleep then it is not possible to score good runs, it is scientifically proved.",
        "To conclude, to achieve their personal goals people tend to work more and sleeps less. But this effect the performance of the individual and it\u2019s very difficult to give 100 percent in work, this low performance reflect in the society."
