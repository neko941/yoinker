        "It is a common phenomenon these days for the modern companies to permit the employees to telecommute or work from their convenient place. I strongly believe, this scheme offers benefits for both the employee and employer, such as flexibility, work-life balance, and loyalty to name a few, which outweighs the drawbacks of the policy.",
        "On one hand, telecommuting is proven to be advantageous in many ways, that impact both the employees and employers. Firstly, it enhances the flexibility of the employees which positively impacts their productivity. For instance, from my past experiences I know that many of my colleagues' work effeciency was much higher when they were providing support from home. Further, studies have shown that working from ones comfort zone can increase the productivity more than working in office under stress and less comfortable environment. Secondly, from an employer's perspective, this scheme helps them to save the cost stemming from renting a big physical office space. We all are aware of how expensive a commercial space can be. Additionally, the companies get good results along with satisfied employees by ensuring them a good work-life balance via telecommuting. Overall, working remotely makes a win-win situation for everyone.",
        "On the other hand, the biggest challenge of working outstation could be this system might not fit for every company. Since this policy reduces human interaction, people tends to loose vital corporate skills, such as interpersonal skills and team building capabilities. These skills are very crucial to make decisions and ensure the performance of any department in an organization. Moreover, these days the functional departments does not work in the silos, rather better communication and working hand to hand helps them to solve critical problems and make the institution profitable. Therefore, the advarse impacts of this policy could be bad decision making and failure to achieve synergy amid departments.",
        "From the above discussion it can be concluded that working from home facility might have some drawbacks; however, the dynamic advantages it offers are way more impactful, which make everyone content. Hence, the benefits of telecommuting surely outweigh the pitfalls."
