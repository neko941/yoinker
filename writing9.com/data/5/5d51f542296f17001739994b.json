        "A large cluster of people opine that public network websites such as Facebook has been influencing both personal life and society negatively. However, in my opinion, i completely agree that it is keeping people away from each other and creating violence over the religion.",
        "To embark on, people are giving their most of the time to these social sites. In order to become famous and indcating others about their life's every moments, people are making their self busy on this. For instance, my cousin brother has an account which is following by 2k people. He set a target to reach that account with 10k followers. He uploads video after offering his half day in editing that video to do so. Even though it takes their lot of time to earn that money, they blow it on expensive things that they can post about it over the social sites. For example, there are many videos about unboxing costly gadgets.",
        "It is irrefutable that it has huge impact on the society. As the complexity of controlling the social network data, it is hard to ban the spreading of false information. It is easy to broaden fake news about religion which is the main cause of violence and hates among them. The wrong statements by the politicians is easy  due to hacking of their account. A good example of this is a riot on the streets of Punjab where 60 Sikhs were killed as it was all initiated by a hacking of an political statement about muslim.",
        "To conclude, although it is impacting them negatively, people are becoming habitual of it. People are passing their time on it instead of spending time with their family which results in separating them from others. Also, dividing people among religion"
