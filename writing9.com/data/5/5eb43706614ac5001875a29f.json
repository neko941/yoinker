        "One of the widely discussed issues nowadays is climate changing. Now people are beginning to realize that global warming is big problem, which have every country. In this case, some people supposed that globalizer countries are liable to fight with this problem. However, others, myself included, support the opinion, entire all planets humans are answerable for defensive and keeping safe the nature.",
        "Firstly, it is well known, that developing countries has low-level condition than progressive countries. What I mean here is that developed nations cause of poor economy can not pay more attention to environment and combat climate changing. Due to the fact that their government struggled with more current difficulties like a lack of clean water, starving, wars with neighborhood.",
        "On the other hand, globalizer countries have more opportunities for solve this problem. There are a couple reason. The most important factor is that progressive nations are blamed for surrounding pollution because they were able to build a bulk of factories and produce not environment-friendly products. In this context, I mean Industrialization process, which began in 18th century in European countries and was first step, which lead to climate changing.  Secondly, developing countries are much more successful in finance.  As a result, they can allow to research and find new ways to combat global warming.",
        "In conclusion, taking everything mentioned into account in our final analysis, we can say that the Earth is our main home for all countries and we all should protect the nature every day. When humans pay attention to surrounding every day it can lead to better result than to avoid this problem and give the responsible to progressive countries."
