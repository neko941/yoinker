        "The government investment in the arts is generally considered to be a misuse of money, and it would be more productive if the funds were invested in any other sector of society. Nevertheless, I take the view that Art is significant to human being wellness and it deserves to be funded by governments.",
        "It is a common belief that art is a luxury as it seems not to be essential to living if compared with other primary human needs such as alimentation, shelter and health. Furthermore, the act of producing art is not seen as a work shift but as leisure time. For this reason, some people think that their money paid on taxes are sponsoring the laziness of artists.",
        "However, it is impossible to imagine our World without art. It has been present in our history since The Rock Age. The cave painting is a relevant illustration of how human being needs to register the facts, be creative and express themselves through the arts. Moreover, Contemplating a work of art has the power to inspire, leverage knowledge, spark thoughts and change lives. Religious paintings from the Renascence are examples of how visual arts were used to connect people with God.",
        "In conclusion, to consider art as triviality is a total misconception. I am convinced that the arts are an asset in our society. For this reason, the government must subsidise them to guarantee that everyone has access to them."
