        "It is widely acknownledged that potentials relating to musics, sports and others which have sticked to people since they were born are thought that they are possible to be trained to master .There are several views and opinions given in this essay.",
        "Obviously, child are known that they are straightforward to learn the new skills as musics , arts or sports but with the potentials of each individual they are able to learn these techniques which seem to be natural for child when they are born more effortlessly than the other child without these potentials. However, this skills have been the optional subjects in the educational system as the way of developing their natural talents rather than the type of subjects that play the role in improving the brain function or physical function for each child. For instance, child lack of natural abilities for musics, sports or the others seem to be challenging to adapt the skills despite being well-educated.",
        "In constrast, these abilities are possibly trained or improved for child lack of this if they are really keen on learning or practicing them as their hobby. For example, there are the enormous number of big name megas stars or even well-reputated sport players who do not have the natural ability of their section but they are succeed in their section base on the process of making their abilities outstanding. Moreover, these type of sections not only has reliance on the potential but also bases on each individual hobby and willing.",

Additionally, the natural abilities also play the essential role in being optimal at sections such as musics, arts or sports."
