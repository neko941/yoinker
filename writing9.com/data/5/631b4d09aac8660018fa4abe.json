        "Holding savage creatures in the cage is unmerciful behaviour for this reason zoological gardens must be closed and the wild animals should make free. They belong to the environment.",
        "In the first place, zoological gardens are so safe for endangered animals because they can reach food easily and they are protected from other predators and hunters. Moreover, zoos are great places where people become socialized. Children can see animals that have never known. However, no creatures desire to live in a closed area. In addition, because of being exhibited to hundreds of people, they feel stressed, and unhappy so they have some medical problems. Thus, the menagerie has to close permanently.",
        "I side with, zoos should be banned all species need to live own habitats. For example, when the lion keeps in a cage it loses its ability to predator and then you release it into nature it can not live a long time also it can not breed. For instance, In according to scientists percentage 70 of eagles that are kept close have health problems and this special animals can not fly long distances. When I visited  eagles I have never seen flying also their beaks and claws were very long and unhealthy.If the government punish the poacher for hunting or capturing maybe menageries will not find species to display for people then places will lock.",
        "In conlusion, zoological gardens are supposed to lock down and these places should not be visited where animals can not be free. People should be sensitive to this situation."
