        "Nowadays, the number of students who are willing to study abroad are continuously increasing. I will try to explain pros and cons of this movement followed by reasonable conclusion including my own opinion.",
        "In one hand, Studying different country opens the great opportunity to meet people from all over the world is the one of its benefit.Therefore, individuals who graduated foriegn countries tend to have wider knowledge about what is happening in the world. Morever,  graduaters from high ranked universities such as Harward, MIT, New-York have higher chance to find work with considerable salary as well as the larger possiblity of achieving the  pursued career.  Furthermore, students who completed their course in foriegn universities with better quality standarts give better contribution the development of their own country compared to the graduaters from local universities with poor quality requirement.",
        "In the other hand, the reluctancy of coming back to the mother country is the one of its drawback. Those chosen to stay tend to observe the advantages of the living in foriegn country. For instance, according to the Mongolian statistics center, just above 50 percent of Mongolians who went to study abroad are coming back to their home country since the life factors including stress free and safe environment, fair job marketing,comfortable transportation are more suitable to live compared to their own hometown.",
        "To sum up, Although, It is hard to judge the advantage and disadvantage of current action, I personally hold true that benefit of this trend outweigh its disadvantage since its further contribution of country's economical and social development is essential."
