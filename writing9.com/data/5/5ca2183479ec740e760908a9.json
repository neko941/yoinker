        "Printed books are not considered as necessary as it was since we can now get access to the Internet. Personally, I partly go along with this statement.",
        "First of all, books themselves are, as far as we have known, great source of information synthesized from the beginning of time. In fact, on the eve of the printing press\u2019 invention, people used to to make handwriting books which is, to me, a very complicated and time-consuming process. Secondly, they are traditional tool that we are of in the first place. A good example of this is that parents often showed us books to encourage reading more. Finally, books make it easier for poor-conditioned people to improve their background knowledge by reading.",
        "On the other hand, Internet is one of the most convenient invention of human beings due to its benefits bringing to us. Initially, Internet allows us to have quick access to knowledge. For instance, we can look up a new word much quicker via the internet rather than by a dictionary, a traditional means of storing and explaining glossary. Moreover, this global network includes a wide range of books with latest edition uploaded so that we hardly need to purchase one when it is available online. Lastly, it provides us with a limitless storage to save experiments and knowledge permanently which seems impossible to books.",
        "In summary, books particularly do benefit us; however, the Internet remains undefeated because its undeniable advantages aforementioned to our daily routine."
