        "Hardly anyone would deny the fact that due to the rapid advancements in technology, communicative competence of individuals has transformed in a palpable manner. Those technologies have been proved to have a great deal of influence on diverse fields and this trend has both merits and drawbacks in turn.",
        "To begin with, developments in three main domains have been mediated by the technological appliences. First,  from the educational perspective,  thanks to the strides in digital learning tools, studying from distance has been applicable . In other words, it is no longer difficult for learners from remote areas to interact with educators and submit their assignments.  Secondly, business people have also been taking advantage of communication gadgets ,since those appliences pave the way to keep in touch with foreign entrepreneurs and transacting business. Finally, on an account of social networking sites,  the users thereof are capable of making friends from overseas countries via Internet.",
        "On the one hand, the trend has benefited people in a host of positive ways. By way of illustration, people have an advantage of staying in contact with relatives and friends who dwell on faraway places with the help of such applications as Imo, Facebook and to name but two. On the other hand, those gadgets have also served to discourage people from real interactions and face- to - face communication.  As a result,  hardly do people show preference to converse with beloved ones in real life.",
        "In conclusion,  technological advancements have had a noticeable impact in terms of education,  business and communication. Not only does this consolidate relationship , but also render people to become isolated."
