        "various controversy has emerged as to whether the main problem in environment is the endanger species, but others claim that still more serious environment problem should be valued. In this essay, I will illustrate both sides of viewpoints and offer my opinion.",
        "It is no doubt that some species are going to be endangered in the following decades. For instance, with the rising temperature of sea, some corals along the coastal line are already extinct due to the fact that they could not afford the heat in their habitat. Also, in order to having more space to build factories, human takes away animals' habitats for our own interest.",
        "However, there is still plenty of crucial environmental damage that people should aware of. The overuse of the natural resources causing deforestation in many countries around the world and the land cannot recover anymore. Furthermore, in order to fulfil consumers\u2019 needs, numerous economical crops are planted in the foothill, this leads to mudslide become happened more frequently.",
        "Environmental problems are not only in visible but also in invisible way. Air pollution is the best interpretation. Tons of carbon dioxide are emitted by cars and factories, these contaminations are already decreased the air quality, and even damage the ozone layer, which can protect human from excessive ultraviolet.",
        "In conclusion, there are too many environmental problems nowadays, and I consider each of them are equal vital issue that everyone should notice. People can recycle more and try our best to make do and mend to make individuals contribution to environment."
