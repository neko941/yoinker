        "Secondly, there are many drawbacks of learning foreign language at starting level of children life .The most important aspect is parent contribution at home .Because of, children parent with children in native language .While , their children learn foreign language at school. If, this thing happen student give up their learning  because of this issue he was inmature at this stage .In daily life children feel burden on their mind because their teacher teache him other knowledge while they speak native language with socials .",
