        "The pros and cons of living in small communities depend on your personality. Living in a small country had a lot advantages and disadvantages.",
        "I assume the first among other benefits was to live healthy. The air conditions were quality as there was no air pollution so depend on bad conditions diseases were less. Low stress level was another gain for healthy life. Secondly, the low cost of living was the advantages of urban areas. Rental fees and grocery costs reduced less your budget so this situation provided an opportunity to spent other needs. Thirdly, persons living in small communities were helpful and supportive so they helped to you for all things. For example, you needed a lot of money for your child spending, they lent money easily.",
        "I think on the negative side, rural areas were often poor and lack health services, employment opportunities, and entertainment activities. There were lack of health services because rural areas\u2019 population were fewer, so governments didn\u2019t build hospitals or health complexes. Therefore, the number of unemployed people was high, there had fewer job opportunities, so lack of money trouble started on communities that weren\u2019t too big. They wanted to enjoy in spare time but lack of entertainment venues didn\u2019t offer them, so most of people were bored and unhappy. Limited options for fun such as theatre, cinema, and swimming pool affected badly social development of children living there.",
        "In my opinion, the disadvantages of living in rural areas were more than advantages. Living healthy was excellent but that wasn't more important than a good education. I didn\u2019t want to live in a small community while I knew these disadvantages.",
