        "Majority of the people belives that the violent content in the TV shows is the  primary reason of agression in school children. To some extent I believe these content should be banned from a programs boardcasted for young audiance. In the following paragraph I will explain the reason for my notion.",
        "Firstly, TV shows with the brutual content should be banned for the youth, as they increase the aggressiveness among the school children. Secondly, horror and action movies with the agressive content always provoke the young audiance to perform the stunt. For instance, due to the Wrestling World Cup kids has viewed the action content ,hence they ended up imitating the same in the resedential society; therefore, majority of them suffered with the fractures on their hands.",
        "On the other hand, same tv shows are viewed by majority of kids but all are not aggreesive in nature; thus, the TV shows are not the major factor of violence among the kids. In addtion, Children with the positve attitute are not impacted with the surrounding . They understand the impact of content in shows and don't try to replicate the action scenes. Thirdly, youth were violent even before the TV was invented. According to the studies, one the major source of viloince is illetracy, as  the majority of junivile in the US prison are illetrate.",
        "In conclusion, it is clear form the above examples that illetracty is the key factor for the voilence among kids. Consequently, while banning the curuel content on  a TV channel , government should take initiavte to promote the education among kids."
