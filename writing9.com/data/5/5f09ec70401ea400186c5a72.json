        "Nowadays, more people prefer to travel around the world with low cost flights has been increase significantly, therefore, some people believe that travelling with low cost flligh will increase pollution in the atmosphere. I completely disagree that banning the flights will not decrease air pollution as they other factors brings many probelms to the nation.",
        "Undouthbly, many people wants to go abroad because of low price of the flights which is cheap and quicker than transportation on the ground. For example, planes are faster than cars, however, motor mobile also cause pollution in the air as well as air transportation. I think that any transports can increase rise in carbon dioxide level in the air. Going abroad with expensive flights tickets also increase pollutiontion which is similar as car ownership.",
        "Nevertheless, some people think that travelling overseas with inexpensive planes tickets cannot air pollution from getting worst. Moreover, restricting cheap flight tickets does not prevent other probrems from rising as they are various factors contributed to causes many more issues. In my view, banning and stopping people to purchase tickets to go on holidays abroad will have a negative impact on economy overall.",
        "In conclusion, travelling abroad will not cause many more problems either using air transport or auto ground transports. From my perspective, purchase cheap flights cannot be banned due to impact on economy and limit choices of tourist, in addition to that, cars also produce more toxic substances more than planes. Goverment must spend more time reducing use of transportation by empasise on advancements of transportation to lower carbon dioxide in the atmosphere."
