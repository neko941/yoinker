        "The god gifted reserves are many for instance, oil and clean water which are being utilized at an extremely soaring pace. As these resources are on the verge of extinction for the future generation due to limited in quantity. However, such problems can be tackled by opting relevant solutions.",
        "Firstly, the primary obstacle which originates from such massive usage of these resources is scarcity which will affect the prices. To exemplify it, inflation can be seen on the prices of different types of natural resources, particularly oil and fresh water. Secondly, certain commodities which are limited in number will get extinct in the near future. In addition to this, survival in the present becomes difficult for certain section of society already as resources are less and the prices of essential natural products are booming and also reached apex position. Thirdly, deforestation is the root cause as trees are the lungs and lifeline for human survival and excess trade of them decrease the amount of oxygen present in the environment. Hence it is indeed too dire to ignore.",
        "To mitigate the challenge, government officials should come forward and provide awareness programs among all the section of society regarding minimum or no usage of vehicles which consumes oil in big quantity and should also take major steps to educate about the environment at the global level such as individuals support the cause by planting trees every weekend which leads to afforestation. Moreover, Government also subsidize the industrialist to establish eco-friendly industries and open desalinization plant to resolve the concern with fresh water. Therefore, all these steps make the environment in a good stead as far as their augmenting care and safety s concerned.",
        "In conclusion, I would like to reiterate that although natural resources are essential part of our daily life to utilize it, proper actions should be taken to preserve it for future generation."
