        "In present, several countries have the serious social problem about a lack of residence in citytowns, and they believe only the administation can improve it. As this statement, I totally agree with it because the government can operate the policy to expand jobs to rural areas, and They can develop countrysides to more convenient to live in.",
        "Firstly, one of the reasons why I agree is the administation can operate the policy to extent an employment to outside the cities. Japanese's government, for exaple, they are able to stop a huge number of people to move in the cities. Because they reduce the tax imposed on the companies which are relocated in the rural areas. Therefore, many factor move out to outside the cities. From this result, young generation have the job  in their hometown. Moreover they do not need to move into the capital city. It can decrease the issue about housing shortages.",
        "Secondly, to reduce a lack of home, the government can solve this trouble by increasing facilities for more convenient in countrysides. Based on my country, a large number of people relocate to the capital city which is Bangkok because they require an ease of transport. The government solve this issue by increasing public transportations such as buses, local taxies, subway and so on. From this result, people who desire to move into Bangkok change their mind so, a lack of housing in city is lesser than before.",
        "In conclusion, the trouble of home shortages in the downtown can be improved by only the government. In my opinion, I absolutely agree with it because they can operate the policy to extend the employment to rural areas, and they can develop outside the cities to more convenient."
