        "In the present, public debate has been going on over whether teenagers become more arrogant and disrespectful to elder or not. Presumably, I absolutely admit that nowadays Thai youth have less respect toward the older person for the following reasons.",
        "Three main factors support the idea of increase in whippersnapper among teenagers. The primary factor we need to take into consideration is the development of technology and internet which make young Thais can search any knowledges whenever they have the questions as the primary method instead of asking from their parents. Moreover, teenagers think that they are smarter than adults because they have higher educational degree. For example, some parents just graduated from elementary school whereas their children have master or doctoral degrees. A third reason for my belief is that parents seem to be conservative in youth\u2019s perspective. Most of elder do not know how to apply digital technology and innovation to enhance the quality of work, regardless of smart work.",
        "Despite that adult are conservative and lack of technology knowledge, I admit that older people always have more experience whether working experience or art of living as they have passed numerous difficult situations, and overcome those obstacles to be successful in today, for which we can find plenty of evidence from our own experience.",
        "In summary, I would argue that Thai youth have their own way to make their decision, which some of it may contradict with the idea of adult. As the result, teenager do not respect and being arrogant. Accordingly, it would be generally advisable for both adult and teenager to make understand each other for a better society and developing Thailand."
