        "People have different views whether companies should collect personal details from prospective employees.While there can be some instances of misuse of this data, I believe this data collection is useful and can be used to increase employee satisfaction",
        "On the one had when corporations collect personal data from job applicants, it can be used to know more about the personal aspects of the person.Companies can design and plan activites as per the employees interests and once the applicants joins the organization he can told about the same by the human resources .For example if a person likes football he can be told about the companies football team and be connected with the follow employees who also like football. This can help the new joinee to connect with fellow co-workers more easily and also allow to fit into the new work environment with ease. Campanies can also design employlee welfare schemes like family health isurance schemes as per the applicants marital status and the same can be communicated to the person when the job offer is made.So this can help the job applicant understand the various other benefits that the company can offer apart from the agreed compensation.",
        "On the other hand, personal data collected should not be used in hiring decisions. Uttermost care should be taken that hiring managers are not made privy to this data and their hiring decisions are not influenced by this.Organizations should make sure that the private information about the candidate is kept confidential and is not disclosed to the general public.This data should only be kept with the human resources department and once the applicant joins the company it should not be used in any way that can lead to harassment or discrimination.",
        "In conclusion I can understand why some people may have reservations on sharing personal information but I believe if proper procedures and checks are followed this can help both the organization and the prospective employee."
