        "In some parts of the world there is still remarkable scarcity of food, as a result it is highly valued in those regions. However, in urban areas, particularly in the developed nations food wastage is becoming one of the colossal concerns. This essay will outline the reasons behind this problem and suggest ways to restrict the level of wastage.",
        "To begin with, two major factors are contributing to this global issue. Firstly, the rising income of population, which means more disposable income. For instance, in recent decade, an average family can easily spend around 2000 dollars on monthly expenditure, whereas in olden days, roughly 50 dollars were spent monthly for food and entertainment. Secondly, the modern throw-away culture, in which all products are treated as disposable, is another culprit. Since it is not uncommon to find valuable household items such as television and washing machines around the bin, it should be unsurprising to find half of the family\u2019s groceries binned without concern.",
        "Public awareness is an indispensable tool to curb this issue. Campaigns against food wastage should be initiated and population must be educated on the importance of conserving food. For example, various TV channels already came forward with such initiatives to educate people regarding the consequences of food wastage and the detrimental impact it has towards the environment. Furthermore, people should be taught how to shop smartly and proper ways to store food.",
        "In conclusion, it is impossible to sustain life on earth without food. Wastage of food is a global problem that needs urgent attention. Unless efforts are made to shift the public consciousness, this issue will only escalate. Therefore, cumulative effort by both the government and individuals is essential to tackle this matter."
