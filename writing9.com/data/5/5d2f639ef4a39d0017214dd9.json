        "It is the fact that people are migrating from country side to cities in most of the countries. There are several reasons for this situation such as better life prospects or better education and also few visible influences too. Both the aspects are explained in the ensuing paragraphs.",
        "Discussing the reasons the most common one is better job opportunity.  This is because cities are blessed with good infracture and facilities which attract many multi nation companies to start their business over there . For instance, Bangalore is known as the IT hub of India and 70% of IT engineers all over India are working here. The other cause is education facilities. By this what I mean is cities are offering world class schools/colleges with  high standard teaches. As a result, 90% of the students who passed out from these colleges able to tackle interviews and job in MNC's. Furthermore, city life is more convenient , everything is accessable and nearby such as hospitals, schools, shopping malls.",
        "The mentioned causes have some impacts too. The formost effect is seen on traffic which is a detrimental issue in most of the cities due to the increase in people . Many of the metropolitian cities time taken to travel to a destination is calcualted in terms of time not by kilomenter.  For example, in Mumbai to reach to a 2km away destination on a working day would take half an hour. The other repercussion polution. cities are getting poluted day by day. there is no space exists to throw garbage, increased motor vehicles are causing air pollution and green gas omissions. As a result, people are getting affected by many diseases and moreover endangered animals are increasing.",
        "Thus, to conclude the topic, it can be finally commented that although migrating from villages to cities has some advantages , we should take care of our infrastructure and nature for the future generation."
