        "Firstly, Grandparents are very affectionate towards their grandchildrenchildren they will take the proper care of the child. Whereas, child staying with grandparents their bond will increase and also grandparents know how to take care of a child as they are experienced ones. Children will get to know about old stories, games. Children will learn other qualities from grandparents such as respecting elders, helping them.",
        "For ,example children get to know about history of how the world was earlier they will get descriptive ideas.",
        "Secondly, keeping children at held care centre will learn to live alone at a very young age. However, in infant ,care there are several other children of different caste, religion and language. Moreover  will  tolearn make a bond and mingle with other children not only that but also children will adapt to this environment at an initial age.",
        "There are some drawbacks of a childcare centre. Children are not treated properly and full attention is not given to them therefore they are misguided.",
