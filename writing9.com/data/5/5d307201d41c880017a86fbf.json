        "In the not- too- distant past, the print media, particularly newspapers and magazines, were one of the most significant sources of information, knowledge and entertainment of the rank and file; and although latest technology has been increasingly taking over our traditional sources of information, I believe that there is a limit to the scope of e-books, and therefore, the conventional publication is not completely replaceable. First and foremost, technology has become incredibly affordable and approachable in this day and age. A couple of decades ago, for instance, smartphones were not yet introduced. As a matter of fact, computers, albeit available, were notably uncommon, and hence, were exorbitantly priced. These days, however, majority of the people own sophisticated gadgets, including, but not limited to, smartphones, laptops, tablets et cetera. Hence, it can be anticipated that electronic and online books will keep only becoming an almost- perfect substitute for print journalism. Having said that, it is conspicuous that the reach of e- books is highly limited by its readers and the writers alike. It can be well stated that there are a number of people, especially the older generation, who still have a preference for the traditional publications. They tend to not get out of their comfort zones easily. Besides, there is a significant percentage of writers who opt to get their books printed as a hard copy. Whether a writer prefers a hard or a soft print is dependent on his or her preference and the difference in psychology. To conclude, although I do believe that the latest trending technology is swiftly taking over our lives, and one of the areas most affected by it is the medium through which we used to read books, newspapers, magazines, journals, and various other periodicals; however, there, definitely, is a niche of the readers and writers of the printed versions of books and other publications that cannot be substituted."
