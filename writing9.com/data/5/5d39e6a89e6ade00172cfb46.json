        "Computers are an important aspect of education in the modern world. It is a view held by some that certain subjects, such as arithmetic, are better taught using computers. While, others are of the opinion that there are certain features of learning, which cannot be replicated by the electronic device.",
        "Teaching is evolving and no longer is dependent on the pen-paper study. Classrooms are going digital and becoming interactive. These new changes have encouraged children to enjoy their schooling period. A boring, tedious topic like math, which was a roadblock to many pupils, is now an enjoyable period in schools. E-classrooms enable mere black and white numbers to appear as vibrant symbols arising curiosity. Moreover, there are also audio-visual ways that excite the learner.",
        "Since, the dawn of the Internet individuals from a kindergarten child to an adult are glued to their screens. An increase in the usage of blue light screens has decreased the use of classic old reading. A class teacher hence can no longer hold student\u2019s interest. The invention of fun way learning has certainly ensured two-way interactions.",
        "On the contrary, there is a limitation to the reach of this medium. Certain methods and concepts to be applied can only be taught through educators. The art of teacher student relation is necessary for flourishing education. There are certain behaviours that cannot be replicated by an artificial being.",
        "To conclude, although the rise of digital devices have replaced much of our surroundings it will definitely take time to catch up with our education."
