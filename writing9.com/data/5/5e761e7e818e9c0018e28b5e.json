        "Spending money on craft is not a waste of money. profession is something that conveys the human soul. You can understand a lot through craft.",
        "craft is something sublime and beautiful that helps a customer to know all the refinement of this earth. This includes paintings, sculptures, architecture, films, and especially music and literature.",
        "Some people do not understand craft and prefer to live a real life, getting entangled in everyday problems. Such people are doomed to an empty existence, because such concepts as the elegance of nature, the transfusion of colours or the sound of a violin are not available to them. It just doesn't matter to them. It is much more important, in their opinion, to devote time to science and work.",
        "Others consider profession the main asset of a woman, and cannot exist without it. Such people get excited as soon as they see the first edition of an old book or an original painting by Vincent van Gogh himself.",
        "But there is a third category of people. These are those who create works of craft. First of all, these are amazing and talented people who were born geniuses. Such a customer was Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, who composed famous musical works. Alexander Pushkin, who became an idol of classical Russian literature, also belongs to such people. The list of talented people who have created amazing works of craft is endless. After all, throughout the existence of the nature, craft was created. Initially it was rock paintings, myths and legends, later it became frescoes and various architectural structures, and finally it came to paintings, music and literature. And at the end of the 19th century, cinema appeared. All this is the history of profession. Something that is extremely important for the human race and its development. After all, it is craft that allows a customer to see the style of the earth.",
        "Looking at the picture in the gallery, we see the depths of the sea, the inaccessibility of space, the style of human existence. Listening to a piece of music, a customer can hear the sound of waves, the trill of a Nightingale, and the sound of the wind. profession is an extension of nature. It helps a customer to think about the beautiful, to see it in detail.",
        "Without craft, a customer would have long ago plunged into a spiritless earth. Therefore, it is very important to protect cultural monuments and create them around the earth. New galleries, museums, cinemas - all this is very important. After all, it is thanks to craft that a somebody remains a customer."
