In other words, for a child it is very important to learn lots of things related to his or her future life and the process of learning ought to be online as they can easily find anything whatever they want to know.Furthermor, learning should be interesting for a child.So if a child follow the materials from online for reading or learning purpose then it would be more easier and less time consuming which ensure better performance and better result.For example, children are always find to excited with computers or mobile phones and these excitement helps them to learn to learn anything without any boringnes.",
        "On the other hand, it is often believed that children should be focus on printed materials such as books,newspapers and magazine to enhance a child reading skills as these materials are always made for specific topics. There are lots of things to learn but this is not possible for anyone to learn everything and thats why children have to be emphasis on certain topics which is very difficult if they go with the online materials because there always a various renge of topics which makes children confuse.Another reason to support physical materials is they do not have side effects such as eye strain cause by electronic gadgets.",
