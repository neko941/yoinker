        "In some countries, either developed or developing, some of the people at very high positions control lots of wealth. This creates an imbalance in society, so often people think that government should control the wealth of a person. But extreme wealth is good If people use it for national or societal progress. In my opinion, earning a high wealth is good. There are many reasons which support my opinion.",
        "Firstly, Extreme wealth can be generated by doing businesses. If one creates a successful business, it creates lots of jobs. A successful business also shows a nations progress. For example, in country India OLA is very successful business . It connects drivers and riders through a mobile app. Now OLA\u2019s owners making a lot of wealth but at the same time they are solving two big problems in India. Now no one needs his personal vehicle to commute from one place to another in a city. Also traffic problem is resolved due to limited number of vehicles used. So if one is accumulating wealth to solve the society problems than it is beneficial for a country to allow people to accumulate wealth.",
        "Secondly, people are driven to do hard work, if they are rewarded. Money is a form of reward which pushes people to do extreme hard work. Materialistic things help us to do daily tasks more efficiently and swiftly. For example, a person who is at the position of CEO can not waste his time on daily commute just to save some money. he must reach on time for all the business meetings. So expensive commutes helps him to do his job perfectly.",
        "On the other hand, in lots of cases people accumulate lots of wealth and use it only for their personal pleasure. In many cases , celebrities are seen doing drugs. Their children spend lots of wealth in late night parties, expensive clothes and cars. So it\u2019s a responsibility of government to give warning to these people.",
        "In conclusion, I would say that controlling high salaries would impend the growth of a country, but at the same time government should be aware the money should not be used in detrimental ways for human progress."
