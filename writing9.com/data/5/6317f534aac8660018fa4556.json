        "Nowadays, people surmise that travelling by air should be limited due to the fact that it causes serious problem and consume a lot of fuel resources in the word. I somehow agree on this matter.",
        "There are a lot means of treavelling, by land, by water, and by air. This means of transportations are great help for individuals who travel a lot beacuse they are able to go in one place and in another. I would like to give emphasis on travelling by air, It is more way convenient due to the reason that it is time-saving and more convenient. For intances that you can easily reached you're destination in a matter of limited time. By this, you are able to have a lot more time to accomplished task. Thus you can use your time to something that is way more important.",
        "In addition,  travelling by air is costly it involves more money as it offers more convenient to people who opted to choose this means of travelling. And what's more the services and experiences that the people who are working on this platform can offer. For example before boarding on planes you immediately get a place where to wait for your time to board which is comfortable because it is air-conditioned and comfort rooms are readily available. And once inside the airplane, in- Flight workers assist you immediately and offer food that is included in your service. Then it will not only end after seving food but until you leave the premises of the airport which decreases the level of stress you get by travelling.",
        "Another reason, is some place are only capable to reach my means of airplane that is why people nowadays are still choosing to travel by air because there in no another option for them to choose. For intances places like Batanes, although you can reached this place by sea. Still the government has not tried doing it and no option to travel by sea for tourist and visitors",
        "I conclude even people wants to restrict air travelling because the detrimental effect to the global fuel. There are still more reason to consider travelling by air."
