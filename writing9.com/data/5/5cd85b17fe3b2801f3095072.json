        "Recently, there has been a debate on whether museums should be free or not. While many museums impose a certain amount to be paid, others allow patronage at no cost. This essay will argue why the positive sides to this outweigh the disadvantages.",
        "To begin, people who think charging for museum is an overall negative development have their reasons. One of them is that, it restricts the categories of the population that can access to facility. Because of the price, which is considered exorbitant at times, the poor in the society will be discouraged from visiting the museum. Additionally, they argue that the entrance fees reduces the patronage. Unlike the high patronage in the past, there has been a drastic drop in the number of people that visit a museum in Jamaica, due to recent introduction of payment. Therefore, the pleasure of using the museum is inaccessible to some citizens. Thus, from their point of view, it should be free because of these disadvantages.",
        "However, fixing a price to enjoy what a museum has to offer, has more advantages despite the few demerits. Firstly, the funds generates can be channelled into maintenance of the structure. This will lessen the financial burden on the owners. Secondly, it increases the value of the services rendered, as people generally place more importance on what they pay for. Furthermore, some other forms of entertainment can be introduced from the earnings. For instance, drama or music shows can be organized. A good example is the introduction of a comedy program, fortnightly,  in a museum in Lagos, Nigeria, recently. This was done using the money paid by patronizers. Thus, the merits of charging for usage of a museum are numerous enough for this to be continued.",
        "In conclusion, the demerits from payment for museum use pale in comparison to the advantages, therefore, measures for continuation of this should be put in place."
