        "Punishment is a method of correcting and improving someone's behavior towards their mistakes. I think to some extent it is right way to teach people.",
        "It is important for children to learn from their mistakes. It help the children to differentiate between rational and irrational behavior. By punishing children for their mistakes, teacher and parents can teach them a lesson. So,  that next time they do not repeat the same again. For instance if refrainment is not done to childre. One can take it for granted and repeat it again and again. Lack of punishment leads to ill behavior and ignorance  in an individual. It can provoke the curiosity in them. Most children likely to repeat the same because of lack of punishment.  Creating fear in early age  in children about their irrational thinking Can help them to not act in same way later on when they get adult. It enhances their discipline attitude towards society as well as in everything .",
        "Sometime punishment act as a motivation in many children.  It not only helps in their academics but also encourage them to maintain it.  Punishment should not be in a physical form. Giving warning them can also helps Insted of using physical refrainment. The teacher and parents should be polite and try to make their children understand about what they did and how it can be  improve.",
        "To conclude,  there are many ways of learning and teaching.  In early age children tend to be more fragile and innocent. So,  it is responsibility of the parents and teachers to make them understand about their mistakes instead of using harsh punishment as a tool to correct them."
