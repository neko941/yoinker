        "In the 21st century, nuclear power plays a very important role on earth in providing the efficient, cheap and clean energy. On the other hand, nuclear weapons are the major factor in maintaining the world peace. I strongly agree that the benefits of nuclear technology are far greater than the cons, if only safely used.",
        "The discovery of nuclear fission and fusion reactions in the 20th century changed the way the humans lived ever after. At the same time, subsequent invention nuclear weapons have been posing as a greatest threat to the existence of humanity. As per the available data, there are 7 countries that perfected the capability to manufacture the nuclear weapons. The scare of use them in conflicts has been haunting humans.",
        "There were some high-profile accidents in nuclear plants in the recent past, like in Chernobyl, Russia and Fukushima, Japan. These disasters are posing as a grave reminder to the humanity on the destructive power of nuclear potential. However, since the technology is rapidly evolving, harnessing its energy is turning out to be safer than ever before.",
        "Earth is running out of natural resources, humans are extracting the fossil fuels in huge amounts like never before to power the people\u2019s life. This can\u2019t continue forever, ultimately destruction of earth will lead to the extinction of humans. Nuclear science is one such technology if safely used, it can help humans to preserve the earth to the next generation by supplying clean, reliable and cheap energy",
        "To conclude, I agree that advantages of nuclear development outnumber the disadvantages. its energy is like a double-edged sword, it can either be used for good or bad. Only by people\u2019s collective effort, the benefits can be harnessed to the maximum extent."
