        "Nowadays, there are 2 different approaches to studying school-student, according to the first one, specialized subjects should be taught to the student who are already 15 years old, the second is about necessarily of studying all subjects for the whole school period. The two approaches come with a set of advantages for school-learners. In the first paragraph I am going to shade a light on the upsides of the former type of education and in the second one on the benefits of teaching students all subjects over the school life.",
        "The approach to divide school subjects on those that should be learned before and after exact age of students is beneficial due to the changing ability of student to understand information in different periods of their life. In other words, some specialized subjects require special knowledges and skills, that children might still not obtain because of the lack of experience and theoretical knowledges that are supposed to be learned only in the age of 13. For instance, teaching a 10-year-old to understand the basics of economics can be too unsurmountable for his brain, because at that time he still doesn\u2019t fully understand the basics of mathematics.",
        "In terms of another approach, when school administration stands for teaching students ordinary subjects together with specialized ones, the main advantage is that it provides schoolers with opportunity to broaden their mind in different directions, by pursuing additional information. It gives them a head start over the other students that have started to learn these subjects only from the age of 15.",
        "To conclude, although both these approaches have its good sides. I consider teaching students all the subjects throughout school life as a right step in the development of today\u2019s educational process. As soon as students embark on understanding diverse spheres of science, they will have a bigger chance to realize their educational aspirations."
