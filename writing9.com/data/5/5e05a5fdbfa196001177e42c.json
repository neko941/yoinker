        "In new era, technology is growing at a pace. Every single day something new is comping up which helps human to live an ease life. In today\u2019s topic, we will discuss about the recent developments like e-books, how soon they will make the newspapers, magazines materials disappear. While others believe that these types of publishing will never expire.",
        "With the scientific research, person life is becoming much easy. We don\u2019t need to rely on anyone until and unless we have computers and smart phones with us. For instance, if we have good android phone with a good internet connection, we can search anything, anywhere at any time. We have so many good applications developed which provide us the latest books at a reasonable price. We have newspaper and magazine application also which give the current update of the market that is going in the world. Within the fraction of minutes, every small news is getting refresh on the websites. In terms of education, many students tend to download the e-books as they are much cheaper.",
        "On the other hand, some people are against it. They don\u2019t want these kind of media to dissolve. There are some disadvantage of having the online stuff. The appearance of electronic device such as brightness which can hurt the eyes, if reading for long. Moreover, other symptoms such as migraine problems and neck pain are caused from using electronic devices.",
        "From my perspective, I will recommend to use the digital material. Firstly financially it is not expensive as we just need to have a good internet connection. No longer need to carry books and other reading stuff.",
        "In conclusion, the revolution brings many benefits to our lifestyle, but has drawbacks also.  The internet can provide us all the material, which makes our life easier, but using them for long can lead to many health issues."
