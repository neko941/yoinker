        "Many people believe that economic progress is of paramount importance for a country. While I agree that progress in the economy is essential, I suppose that there are other factors which are equally pivotal.",
        "On the one hand, there are two key reasons why economic growth is seen as the most important goal in a country. Firstly, a country with a healthy economy is capable of providing more job opportunities for its citizens resulting in the fall of the unemployment rates. Secondly, having a healthy economy means that the government is likely to have more budget to spend on public services and infrastructure. For example, the government would invest more in improving public transportation such as: buses, trains .  This could lead to the improvement of the residents' quality of life.",
        "On the other hand, I would argue that other progresses are as significant as the economic factors. As every country has their concerns about environmental problems, the ability to protect the natural environment is highly appreciated. A country which fails to protect its own environment means that it will be unable to protect the citizens from environmental disaster. Moreover, justice may contribute to the success of a nation. A nation with justice would help its citizens to raise their voices if they are not treated fairly, therefore leads to a safe environment for the residents to settle in.",
        "In conclusion, while I agree that economic progress is a fundamental goal for a country, I suppose that protecting the environment and providing justice are equally significant."
