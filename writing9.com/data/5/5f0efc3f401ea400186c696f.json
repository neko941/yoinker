        "It is argued that the action of inhaling and exhaling the smoke of the tobacco or drug is considered as a crime at the present time for that reason this activity is prohibited by many nations\u2019 governments\u2019 around the world. This essay completely agrees with this statement because smoking the cause of many health problems and it create an air pollution.",
        "The act of smoking injures our fitness the reason for this the cigarette is one kind of poison for human beings anatomy. Furthermore, it is creating a complication in respiratory process and might be possible to cause a lung cancer.

So, if governments of many united are ban on smoking in public place. Thus, It is completely favorable and valuable decision.",
        "Smoking is one of the major reason behind air pollution at public places because, The activity of exhaling the smoke of cigar is left in air then this will mix with normal air and create a pollute air that is very harmful for human being as well as trees also. For instance, Report of 2009 by the pollution control department of Gujarat, declared 20% people have suffered air pollution problem at railway station, parks,  Bus station, etc. So, prohibited smoking at public places by authorities\u2019 of states, It is good for the people. Moreover, For kids and senior citizens also who has allergy with smoking the smoke.",
