        "Firstly, a social media website can connects people. My sister Mina lives in the Czech Republic and I can share my mother's birthday and my cousin's wedding pictures with her via facebook. She would know that we are healthy and miss her very much. In old times it was impossible to connect people who lives at abroad. I remember that my aunt who lives in US could call only once or twice a year, because she could not afford the expensive international call fee. We missed her a lot, therefore we exchanged letters. However the letters take long time to get here. The problem is, you have to pay to make a intenational phone call. Also you need to pay for the stamps, and international stamps are cost a lot. For a social media website you don't need to pay anymore, if you are already paying for the internet and a lap top or a smartphone.",
        "Secondly, you can learn foreign language more easily. Right now I am learning Czech language to visit my sister Mina. I would stay for her house for a while and I don't want to be a burden for her.  Before 10 years ago it was impossible to find a language exchange partner who speaks Czech in the South Korea. But right now I am having three language partners from Czech who want to learn Korean. The Czech language lesson takes a lot of money from me, therefore I am happy that I can practice my Czech with my language exchange partners. Now I am ready to order groceries from Czech supermarket with Czech language. If I did not have help from my language partners, I could not do it. I took an advantges of a social media website and could have those language partners. Without a social media website, I could not practice my Czech.",
        "Thirdly, your world could become wider. I know nobody from North Korea. The information of North Korea is kind of confidential in South Korea, you get only one view - South Korean Goverment's view on it. I belived that everything the goverment told me is only one true fact. However, when I learned English and Chinese, I googled North Korea and found out that there are lots of different point of view of North Korea. I am not saying that our goverment view is wrong. I'd like to know more information and different kind of viewpoint before I form my own opinion. With a social media website, I could know lots of American's point of view on North Korea, and it was very interesting. The sea of information is not only for political problems. I found out a pizza recipie from the Naples and it tasted so great.",
        "For summary, I would like to point that a social media website is affordable. It can work as free international phone or commnunity board. And you can find a language partner if you are learning a new language. Lastly, people can exchange various opinions about everything from political problems to food recipie."
