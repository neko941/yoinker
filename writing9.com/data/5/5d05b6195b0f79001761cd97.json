        "English language tests are one of the mandatory requirements for successful migration either for study or employment purposes. Nowadays, there is a rise in the number of people who take this English tests such as the IELTS on the computer rather than the paper based test. This essay will explain both pros and cons of this method of testing as well as why the advantages surpasses the disadvantages.",
        "The use of computers to carry out tests has several advantages. Firstly, many tests which are carried out with the use of computers saves both the time of the candidate as well as the examiner. This eliminates the waiting time usually spent on waiting to get test materials as well as results not being available immediately. For example, last year I had a computer based aptitude test for a job, which was over in 30 minutes after which my result was displayed immediately. Also, Resources are saved through the use of computers. These computers will be used subsequently by other people as there will be no need to purchase new sets of test materials.",
        "On the other hand, the use of computers can pose certain limitations, one of which is that it is not cost friendly. Having to spend a lot of money to purchase the computer is of great limitation. For instance, a consulting firms involved in testing candidates for jobs recorded to have spent about half a million on the recent purchase of computers. In addition, the maintenance of these computers are difficult. Computers needs regular updates to function properly. For example, Every computers needs antivirus installations on them so as to avoid loss of information associated with the tests conducted.",
        "In sum, although the cost associated, as well as the regular maintenance needed poses a setback to the use of computers for testing. In my opinion, the time it saves and the ability of its subsequent use makes the advantages overweigh the disadvantages."
