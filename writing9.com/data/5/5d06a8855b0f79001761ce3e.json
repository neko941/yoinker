        "The gap year is a year after high school which students use to explore their various interest. Some may prefer to work while others travel to various places. After the gap year the student may decides to go on with their career. Merits and demerit of gap year will be discussed.",
        "Many students usually work within this period of time so as to raise money to further their education as high school is known to be so expensive and this helps to raise financial burden off their parents shoulder. Also, it gives students time to introspect and consider fields they might have never had interest to study before now.",
        "Furthermore, as many would prefer to work others may wish to travel to different parts of the world and explore new things,learn  different cultures and Languages,meet people and also make friends.This gives them a better idea of the outside world and improves their personality. In addition, activities done during the gap year can be added to the students resume to boast it for more jobs after school or part time jobs while schooling.",
        "As every garden has weeds,similarly,the gap year also has its downside. The student may not like to continue studying when he starts making a lot of money. Secondly, traveling and touring at this stage may bring unnecessary exposure to certain things that might be of negative influences to the young school leaver. Finally,one year is too long to stay out of school. Therefore, so many student find it so hard to catch up with studies and homeworks after this period.",
        "In summary, students should endavour to use their time wisely during the gap year as it has a lot of advantages."
