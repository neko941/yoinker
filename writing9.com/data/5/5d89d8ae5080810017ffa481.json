        "Primary prevention of chronic diseasess is an important goal nowdays among many health care centers. According to some physicians, increasing the availability of sport centers is the most important method to improve public health, becase it will lead to increased physical activity. Others, including myself, think that sporting centers will have a minor effect on public health, and that other measures, such as educational programs to promote balanced diet is needed.",
        "Increaseing the number of publically accesible sport centers will have an effect on the amount of physical activies people perform regularly. By providing sport centers which are located nearby residential areas, and are free of charge, many people engage in daily physical acitivites. As a consequence, chronic illness such as high blood pressure and diabetes can be prevented. According to the Israeli health office, in the last decade the average citizen increased the daily amount of pysical acitivity by 20% and the rate of diabetes has resided by 5%.",
        "In contrast to the above mentioned I, and many other physicians, believe that incraesing the amount of sporting facilities will have a minor effect on the public health, and that educational programs to promot balanced lifstyle is substantially more important. Teaching our children about the importance of a balanced diet and the horrific consequences of smoking and consuming alcohol, can help our children in eating and living better and healthier. By doing so, we can prevent major illnessess such as diabetes and obesity. To illustrate, health education has decreased the amount of obseity among the Israeli pediatric population by 10%.",
        "In conclusion, Although increasing the amount of sporting centers will promot physical activites, other solutions such as educational programs to promote healthier lifstyle can assist more."
