        "education of the youth is always the important issue that lots of pay attention to. it is widely believed that children under 18 years old need to study full-time and in my opinion, i agree partly with this statement.",
        "first of all, it is true that without full-time study, children can earn more money and become more independent. indeed, instead of spending time on going to school every day, they can take advantages of these time to seek full-time jobs, make ends meet and do not have to depend much on their parents",
        "however, hardly do kids find good jobs with stable if they do not complete their study programs .due to a lack of academic qualifications and knowledge, students will not have many opportunities and priorities when they apply for well-known companies or organizations compared with other people who have various academic achievements.",
        "furthermore, attending full-time education helps kids to be safety and develops stably. in fact, under 18-years-old kids do not develop completely about both physical and mental health physically and mentally so they do not know exactly how to protect themselves. they may be made use of by others as well as be easily injured. in addition, when they go to school, they can meet and have a variety of peers that they can easily to talk and share everything to their friends instead of meeting person who are really hard to find the same thinkings because of the age differences.",
        "in conclusion, although leaving school makes children becoming more independent, i believe that it is better for them to complete study programs until they are 18 years old."
