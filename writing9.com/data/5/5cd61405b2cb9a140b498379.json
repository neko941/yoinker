        "The eradication of poverty in under developed countries remains a very controversial issue. It is common for affluent nations to offer monetary aid to resource-poor countries. It is thought that well advanced countries should channel their\u00a0 aids to other areas besides financial help as the latter has not helped to solve the problem of poverty. I totally agree with this notion. In my opinion, countries should give more of",
        "such as provision of infrastructure and services rather than money.",
        "First and foremost, poor countries are most often than not led by corrupt and greedy leaders. Embezzlement of funds and foreign aid is the order of the day. It is in the best interest of this countries that services be traded instead of money. For instance, in Nigeria,it is public knowledge that most of the financial help from rich nations are used to fuel the extravagant lifestyles of our politicians, rather than give money for subsequent projects like building infrastructure,these countries should instead provide the materials and manpower to build structures themselves for the benefits of the citizens.",
        "Furthermore, the exchange rate of the different countries can cause significant problems. The monies when converted to the currency of the receiving country might not be sufficient to carry out the project it was set aside for. In addition, bad economic policies in poor countries can result in gross mismanagement of funds which defeats the purpose of the aid in the first instance.",
        "In conclusion , although financial aid can help destitute countries. I totally agree that other forms of age should be used to help this countries because of the problems of corruption and bad government policies."
