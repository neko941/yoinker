        "Since time immemorial, physical games have been a favorite recreation. Nowadays, people who spend hours and hours watching sports are thought to be wasting their free time. Though some might diasgree, I believe that watching sports has certain benefits, and this essay will provide reasons as to why.",
        "Starting with the reason why some people tend to think enjoying a match\u2019s broadcast is a mere waste of time. In their point of view, it is not much productive as fans may spend the same duration on learning some skill. Consider a guy who learns an art like painting in his leisure time. He is far better off watching sports, as not only will this amuse him, but will also empower him with a skill. Moreover, the advocates of this view often claim that watching tv displays may cause some health problems like decreased visual acuity. Indeed there have been a few recorded incidences where excess blue light exposure caused myopia. For the above reasons, they believe that sports fan should revise their policy of entertainment.",
        "On the contrary, I am of the view that sports induce enthusiasm and encourage people to do physical activity themselves. In today\u2019s fast paced world where most of the people have sedentary lifestyles and suffer from persistent health issue.Athletes can be good role models to curb the rising health issues. Lets Take an example of a popular athlete, like Cristiano Ronaldo, whose fitness plan is followed by millions around the world. Furthermore, sports help to spark up patriotism, as people tend to forget their differences and support their national teams. Surveys show that events,like World cups and Olympics, reduced the crime rates significantly. Thus, one can not deny the role of sports in decreasing health problems and uniting nations.",
        "It can be concluded that some people believe that the time spent on watching sports an be utilised on some productive activity as looking at liquid crystal displays affects one\u2019s health. I, however, suggested people should watch sport as a fun activity because it motivates people towards healthy activities and reduces differences among people."
