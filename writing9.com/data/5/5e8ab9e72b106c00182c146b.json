        "The car has both Advantages and disadvantages, but in my opinion jeep has more application so I say that a van has more Advantages.",
        "It is so important in life, let's see why this is so important in life.First application of care is you can travel long distance without any difficulties.second is you can go sit properly in the automobile-bus Where on the motorcycle after 1 to 2 hours you can feel the tiredness because of not properly siting methods are available in the bike. Third one is that if you want to go outside in the rainy season you can go without getting wet in the rain, Also there are many applications of a van.",
        "It also has Disadvantages but compare to the advantages we can say that the automobile has more advantage and less disadvantage.If you see the drawbacks of the it, then first comes in our mind is pollution, but in my opinion, it has less pollution compare to bikes and any other vehicle because if you want to go Vadodara to Surat and you have four persons in your family if you have  a van, you can go in one vehicle with four persons but, If you don't have this automobile service then, you can go with two motorcycles and compare to van Bikes has more pollution.",
        "The main advantage of owning a car is it gives the freedom to travel. If you have this then you don't need to be limited to fixed routes and timetables. Moreover, an owner can take is/her family members with him/her and other necessary goods whenever he/she wishes which might have been impossible otherwise. In addition, personal cars give comfort while travelling on the contrary, to the public buses which are so crowded and disgusting. You can read books, listen to music or even can play with kids while you are in your own application, but those all seem to be impossible in a public transport. On the contrary, owning a this automobile product is very expensive. The price of the jeep, the cost of the tax, insurance cost, fuel cost, driver's salary,  repairing etc. All must be considered before buying  and that is why it is out of reach of the middle-class people.",
        "The conclusion is it has more advantages if you differentiate between the two you get more advantages of this vehicle."
