        "Due to rise in population in many places, the demand for homes has increased. The lack of space for new buildings is a caveat which can be solved by building homes in the countryside while others do not want to build new homes in the country side to protect it from damaging. The matter is a subjective and a debatable issue. My conviction is that sustainable development of real estate in the country side will not only provide the homes for many, but will also keep it unharmed.",
        "Food, shelter and clothing are the primary and most important requirement of human beings. Rest of all the preferences come later. For example, it might not be possible for individual to live unharmed without any kind of shelter even for a week. Undoubtedly, this problem cannot be left unaddressed or there will be civil unrest among the population. There is no choice but to build new homes.",
        "Preserving countryside is also important and some believe that homes should not be build at countryside. Some may argue that new infrastructure may be created in the city itself by raising the floors in the existing buildings. Further, they may also argue to optimize the use city infrastructure as many flats may be kept vacant and buildings unused. Their argument cannot be denied but it can never solve the problem completely. The importance of preservation of our green lands cannot be undermined but they are nearly not as important as shelter for some people. We would have to expand and the model of sustainable development can simultaneously address both the concerns. For example, cities should regulate and optimize their current resources, so that minimum impact on the countryside can be ensured. Further, the real estate development just outside the cities should be ecofriendly & minimal.",
        "To conclude, the expansion of cities into the countryside cannot be stopped as it is too vital, but it can be minimised by efficient use of existing infrastructure. Further, regulated and sustainable model of development can ensure protection of countryside along with construction of much need houses."
