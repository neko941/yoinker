        "Publishing content on an individual's secret life is liberty, has been thought by many people. On the other hand, a few understand that it should be managed. Is media a boon or a bane for a person?  Both key concepts need to be discussed.",
        "It is an undeniable fact that media has become an integral part of society. Although it has adverse effects on people's lifestyle when media sources such as newspapers, TV, and mobiles have an access to their privacy. If news about family dispute becomes public, then relationship between members,will be affected. Not only quarrel between them increases, but also society glue eyes on them. For example, husband and wife relation ends up in the court when puts under media scrutiny. Furthermore, they may feel scare while going outside. Sometimes they are asked irrelevant questions by media persons which leads to violent situation. As a consequence, their private life has spoiled.",
        "However, media becomes boon when it is used with wisdom. If press prints articles and news without involving personal life of pupils, then it marks as a prominent part of society.People, who have habbit of reading daily news, can broaden their horizon. As they learn about variety of topis like fashion. beauty, health, tourism, science and technology etcetera.Essays related to health helps them to get rid of problems that is obesity, diabetes. Hence, it benefits to people thrive and become extrovert.",
        "According to my opinion, it should be used to alleviate the knowledge rather than to discuss about secret disputes and happenings of every individual.",
        "In conclusion, media is an imperative source of information. Considering all the grounds, it has merits as well as demerits. Plausible steps should be taken by government to stop media entering into people's life."
