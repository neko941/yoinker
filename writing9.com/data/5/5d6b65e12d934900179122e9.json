        "In the present world, violence computer games and movies are increasingly embraced by individuals particularly youth and children, however some critics are on the conviction that such violence stuff should be abandoned by government since they trigger real violence and aggression in society. On the other hand advocators mention entertainment aspect of them and assert that the reason of violence does not justify such a prohibition.",
        "It is believed by opponents that exposure of violence films and games should be prohibited by government as they raise the sense of aggression among individuals in the real world and desensitize them to the crime; they assert that this adverse effect can be more devastating with regard to the children who are perfectly affected by them since they are not mature enough and as a way of illustration they point out the rising number of shootings at schools.",
        "On the other hand fans of such kind of movies and games cite entertaining perspectives of them. They refer to violence games and movies as healthy recreation that could simultaneously raise social awareness of threatening circumstances in the real world as well as speed up their reaction to possible dangers. Moreover they mention high turnover in this industry which is not reasonable to be prohibited. They declare that although a number of studies have been reported the direct correlation between violence in media and violence in the real world but an assertive claim have not been stated so far.",
        "In conclusion, however there are a great deal of implication with regard to the relationship between exposure violence in movies and games and violence in the real world but a definite opinion has not been asserted yet, so I assume it would not be justifiable to ban these kinds of films and games as they play an important role in individuals recreations and economic sector."
