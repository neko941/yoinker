        "The issue of foreign aid is often raised in modern political debate. Where is the aid money spent? Who needs it the most? In my point of view, rich countries should give financial assistance to undeveloped countries in the right way in the priority sector.",

It is not only save lives in the case of natural disasters but also help rebuild livelihoods and housing after the disaster. Furthermore, aid can help increase food production and higher literacy rate. It is also provide to solve the problems of refugees, rehabilitation and many other problems.",
        "Millions of people living in poor countries lack education, health, human rights and so on. The best way to help poor countries would be open good educational institutes, good health centers and creating job opportunities. Although money makes a good opportunity for poverty reduction, investing their education and health would be extremely benefic.",
        "Unfortunately, financial aid is misused by the recipient countries due to corruption and financial mishandle. In my point of view, to prevent misuse of donation the best way is provide services and technical to these recipients instead of money. In this way, local government can\u2019t control the aid money.",
        "In the end, international aid should continue to give money with other types of support like investing on education and health. Because it may enable them to become more independent and move forward."
