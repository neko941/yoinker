        "It is indisputable that viewing TV and reading books are two of the most ubiquitous leisure activities in our contemporary life. Some people firmly believe that reading books rather than watching TV is a better way for its beneficial influences on the development of creative imagination and language competence. Personally speaking, i give my unreserved support to the belief.",
        "on the one hand, reading has been praised as a superb measure to enhance a man's comprehensive capabilities icluding imaginative ability and linguistic competence. first and foremost, it is a process of active input and thinking. Although TV offers beautiful movies with special effects, the images are passively absorbed by viewers. Therefore, gradually people who watch TV all day long lose the tendency to imagine and think actively. Unlike watching, reading enables us to reconstruct what we read in our mind and spark ideas even in nearly every situation in daily life. To illustrate, children who read a detective novel have to create the different roles' images, actions, facial expressions and story plots in their heads by themselves. The creation is definitely an indispensable part of imagination and creativity.",
        "On the second hand, reading helps readers appreciate beautiful expressions. Language on TV programs is generally coarse and disorderly. In addition, it is aired once and for all so TV shows often involve using spoken languages, which people use in daily conversations to convey their thoughts. In contrast, written materials are carefully polished before being published so they contain elaborate grammatical structures, well-chosen words and strictly logic coherence. As a result, people who are really keen on reading find it usefuk to learn how to use language effectively to express their mind.",
        "In conclusion, i hold the view that reading plays a more active and effective role in bringing imaginative capabilities into play and boost language aptitudes. Just as an English philosopher said \" Reading makes a full man \"."
