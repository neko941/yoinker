        "Education plays an important role in a child's life. It maybe academic or life skills. Some people claim that teachers should further educate children in moral values while others think only academic education should be taught by the educator. This essay will discuss both views of the statement.",
        "On the one hand, a student spends 8 hours a day in school and is in contact with teachers almost half the day. As a teacher  the valuable knowledge that is imparted to the children is during this period is important. For example, the educator can advise the child if he or she is not showing empathy towards another",
        "student. Therefore, a good teacher should be an all rounder who is able to teach not only the subjects but additional good values and discipline",
        "On the other hand, there is so much stress on teachers to cover the subject syllabus on time that most often teachers do not need the additional workload. For instance, a government school teachers in Malaysia teaches 45 minutes each subject for 8 classes per day. She has no time to oversee a child's behaviour and correct it. Parents and caregivers should be responsible to correct and discipline the child.",
        "In my opinion,  teachers, parents are caregivers should be responsible to nurture and discipline the child. Although academic studies is important moral values are equally important to shape the child into a better human being. This is made possible by the people who spend most of their time with the children.",
        "In conclusion, as teaching is a noble job both teachers and parents should do their part to ensure that a child's education is wholesome and not one sided."
