        "In recent decades, because of technical development, online courses came in picture. They are welcomed by most of the students, while the remaining object the decision. Let's, discuss the advantages and disadvantages of both the views in the latter part of the story.",
        "Regarding the advantages of internet classes. Firstly, students will have flexibility to study from the place there are in, unlikely going to the classroom. For example, A particular person who is working has an hour and want to learn the course from his workplace, he can learn from the place where he is right at that point. Secondly, It can be viewed multiple times and can contact teacher if further help is required. For instance, if an person doesn't got the clarity on the information, what was presented in the first sesion, then can view more than once, until he got the clarity. Third, this type of course may not required huge infrastructure. For a sample, For thousands of people to learn the course, the tutor requires a small room with web access, instead of huge class to accomodate all the students.",
        "Looking at the disadvantages of the above, Major disadvantage is the lecture will not be knowing whether the listener is able to follow the topic, because of no person contact. For example, the presenter can just present the topic,as he may not be knowing whether his students are able to follow it or not.",
        "In Conclusion, considering the above point on both the ends, At present situation, I recommend going with online courses. It benefit the students as well as college, by reducing the expenditure."
