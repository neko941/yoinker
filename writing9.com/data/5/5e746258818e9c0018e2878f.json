        "It is one of the fundamental duty of authorities to spend equal amount of money on sport facilities as they do on college libraries. Physical activities function as an important facilitator to improve health of the students which yields positive impact on their studies as well. I strongly believe that college administrators should equally concentrate on academics and sport facilities. This essay will explore the reasons for this:",
        "To begin with, there is no doubt that scholars and toppers are helpful in building reputation of any educational institution. However, the role of physical education in the life of under graduates cannot be overlooked. In today\u2019s era, due to advancement in educational system, an intense pressure is put on a student from the college as well parents to score higher grades in examinations. Thus, this type of stressful circumstances leads to depression if the student is not able to fulfill the expectation of his family and academician. Therefore, it is vital for every university to have sport centers and invest in sport functions, so that candidates are able to cope up with the hectic situation and work hard in their academics as well.",
        "Secondly, everybody nowadays is leading sedentary lifestyle due to busy schedules. Less importance is being attached to physical health of candidates. Sports and fitness activities help us to live a healthy life. Universities should help in building overall well-being of student by creating recreational facilities for them. For instance, a student who does not indulge in any kind of fitness activity might makes his brain dull, thereby making it difficult for him to indulge in studies.",
        "In conclusion, I personally believe that equal importance should be attached to health and educational facilities. Therefore, universities should allocate their budget equally to the sports and libraries."
