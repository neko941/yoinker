        "Currently, the discourse regarding enrollment into university is increasingly topical. Some people contend that low income and high income students cannot afford higher education. Although I strongly disagree with the idea mentioned because of its academics impact, the university should ensure the low economic income students can afford university through scholarships program.",
        "One of the vital arguments for every students can afford college is its the requirement to enroll in university is based from academic merits. This is because, in this issue, since academic merits can be use to considerate the appropriateness of prospective students. University can determine the candidate objectively. Gadjah Mada University is a excellent example for this; around 5.000 undergraduate students who accepted from various test entrance mostly come from different economic background. Therefore, regardless of each students condition, every individuals have a equal opportunity to afford higher education through their academic potentials.",
        "However, the idea can be backfire if university cannot develop the scholarships program for low income students properly. In other words, even though poor students can able to enter university through their achievement. In some points, if they cannot afford scholarship, the students face some difficulties such as cannot pay the tuiton fee regularly and should rely on part-time working. This is illustrated by a recent study by Stanford University finding this type of cases in several regions in the Indonesia and adverse academic record of the students. For that reason, to make higher education more affordable for everyone, university should assess the number of low income students more specfic in order to provide the scholarships fairly.",
        "To conclude, considering the benefits of requirement through academic merits, its highly reasonable that higher education can reach out any student that come from different economy background. Nevertheless, to keep poor student can afford higher education, university should make an effort to develop scholarship program."
