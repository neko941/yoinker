        "We live in a digital world. Computers have become a norm for a daily life these days. But still some people believe using computers every single day, is harmful for children. However, I personally don't agree with that assessment.",
        "Firstly, the education system is evolving with modernization of our society. Computers and other digital instruments have become a very integral part of that system. This makes it somewhat mandatory for the kids to have the basic knowledge of these devices. For example, lot of schools offer computer language fundamentals or programming classes to students. These help cultivate interest in pursuing the technical career, at a younger age.",
        "Secondly, I would agree that computers are not always used for educational purposesm but that doesn't imply that they always have adverse effect on young ones. On the contrary, some of the recent researches show that certain computer based games are actually good for their brain development. It teaches them skills like planning, time management, team building and other analytical skills.",
        "Lastly, learning is an evolving process and should not be restrcited to only textbooks. Internet opens up a world of possibilities to lern new skills and gain knowledge, if used wisely. In other words, imagine having no access to online libraries or articles to learn different talents, which are not always part of the school curriculum. Computers are necessary part of life starting from the grocery stores to banks to all handheld devices. Learning to use them at an early age gives them advantage to succeed in life."
