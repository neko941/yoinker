        "It is a frequently used idiom that \u201cwhile in Rome, do as the Romans do\u201d. This essay will examine whether visitors should adapt to the local customs, and whether learning a culture without knowing about the local dialect has any possibility.",
        "Visitors should definitely accept and get used to the culture of any nation they go to. To further extend, if a person visits an area where a specific dress code is followed, he or she should also be able to follow the dress code of the locality. Adapting to local customs will aid the local people to offer them further sentiments of hospitality. For instance, USAID conducted a survey in a community centre in Rawalpindi, where 71% of shopkeepers accepted that if a foreigner customer, wearing local dress, comes to buy some items, the shopkeepers do not accept money. Rather they gift it to the visitor.",
        "To learn about a culture, without learning the language, is a tedious task. The local people will always consider them foreigners and will keep a distance from the visitors. In addition, this will also impede the feelings of hospitality to be conveyed to the tourists, resulting in formation of a biased view about the locality. For example, if an individual visits Peshawar and does follow the dress code of the area, but not knowing about the Pashto dialect, the host will consider him someone who is not among themselves.",
        "To conclude, the idiom stating \u201cwhile in Rome, do as the Romans do\u201d is valid. Visitors should be able to adapt themselves to the local traditions. Moreover, it is important to learn about the language spoken by the natives."
