        "we are living in that era where the different, new and plethora of competition is occur in every stage of life, between the countries, in schools, in reality shows etc. I think a sense of competition in children should be encouraged because it is a time of compete rather than co-operate.",
        "To embark, I believe that children must have a sense of competition because it is beneficial for their awareness of competition since childhood because competition will also be increasing with their age, for example, when they are in the primary school, the competition of education and skills are also there, so they require some knowledge for handle it. Furthermore if we take an example of countries, there is a huge amount of battle between the countries such as the battle of army strength, environmnent, economy etc. In film industry, a new and talented actors and actresses are increasing day by day. In cricket, a plenty of new cricketers are coming, and they are showing their skills and performances, so it is paramount for encouragement of competition to children because it is easy for them to handle every situation in life and in every difficult circumstances they will find some solutions.",
        "however, it is generally believe that children who are taught to co-operate rather than compete become more useful adults because some people believe in peace, so they have a feeling of co-operate in every situation and their way of thinking is different, they think every work is done through silently rather than conflict but I disagree with them because in my opinion, competition should be occur because by this, everyone get an opportunity to enhance their skills and knowledge. They can easily overcome failures.",
        "To sum up, competition is a part of our life, so every children must have a sense of competition because it is fruitful and sometimes it is adventurous to have some type of competitions"
