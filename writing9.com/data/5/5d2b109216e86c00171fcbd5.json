        "It is often said that people working in entertainment are paid so much money. Many people believe that entartainers should gain this vary amount of money. Others, however, think that there are many important profession worth to be paid like entertainers or even more. While this point of view has value, I believe that paying this giant number is kind of exaggarated.",
        "In my opinion, professions such as Scientistics, doctors, professors and even school teachers should be paid almost same as entertainers. Firstly, the time and effort those people spending their life in to prove theroeis and inventions to wealth and facilitate the human beings or as doctores saving human lifes. Secondly, indevidiuals like professores and teachers worth big salaries and this is due to the fact that those people generate and teach our future generations which will be one day a step stone in countries developmental progress. Thirdly, there income does not reflect the amount of work they do. For instance, a top star movie like Anglina Jolie can easily make more than one million dollar by acting a one single film. This giant amount of money hard or may be never be reached by many people in their whole life no matter how hard they are work.",
        "On the other hand, Many will agree with the over pais for the stars, musicians or athliets because of reasons related to that paying for these professions depending on how much they will profit the producer organization per minute. As well as entertainment now consider to be one of the main modern manufactring to increase the economy.",
        "In conclusion, there is no doubt that entertainment is an important aspect in our life but the overrated paying for entertainers could has positives and negatives aspects. However, in my view the negatives outweigh the positives."
