        "For some people, when they get their first job, they do not have any idea of changing workplace throughout their working life. By contrast, others believe that working in different organizations exert the positive impacts on their career overall. From my point of view, I support the later opinion and justifications are as follows.",
        "On the one hand, there are some reasons why some people choose to stay at same workplace all their working life. Due to a long time of doing the same job, they have an advantage of understanding thoroughly how it works and also becoming familiar with the staff and processes. Therefore, they can work more efficiently, have a good salary and get the promise of greater promotion prospects. Besides, if they work hard and have a great contribution to their companies, they may gain popularity and their name will be recorded as an influencer in their organizations.",
        "One the other hand, I am of the opinion that working for different companies will be better for people\u2019s career overall. The first reason is that changing workplace can avoid the situation of getting stuck doing the same job year alter year. In some case, this can lead to boredom and depressed. Another benefit is that when moving from one organization to another, people can accumulate a wide range of skills and experiences. In different incorporations, people cooperate with different colleagues, work in different environments, thus they have an incredible knowledge in a range of related field and get much more interesting working life.",
        "Although we cannot deny the benefit of working for one organization, I am in favor of working for different companies brings overweight advantages for people as long as it is planned carefully."
