        "Computers are very popular in those days, people love to use computer for so many different things like learning, entertainment. Nowadays many people think that computer are teach in a classroom and children are able to use computer for learning purpose. However, other think that dependence on computer may have a certain kind of risk but according to my opinion school should provide computer for children to learning purpose.",
        "Firstly, dependence on computer is not a good think because there are many negative effect for using computers for example, children use computers for their learning purpose, but there are many children who played games in computer rather than learning. Moreover, using computer for long time also have bad effect on health for example, if children use computer for longer hours than it cause eyesight problem.",
        "Secondly, computers are increasing rapidly and classroom allow childrens to learn computers and done their learning task with the help of computers because with the help of this childrens are able to use new technology and also find interest in learning for example, there are some childrens who are boring, while learning and doing some academic work, but with the help of computers they find interest of doing academic work easily.",
        "To conclude, it is true that using computers for long time would effect on children health, but according to my opinion classroom should provide computers for learning purpose because with the help of this children are able to learn how to use computers and for those who feel borning while learning are able to find interest in learning."
