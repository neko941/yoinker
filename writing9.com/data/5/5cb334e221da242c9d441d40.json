        "Their is no doubt that spending a quality leisure time is extremely important for rejuvenating from busy professional life. While some believe that one should not spend his spare time with his colleague, I would agree with those who argue that people develop great bond while working togather, and if they are comfortable, they should spent free time togather.",
        "To begin with, some jobs are highly demanding and consume major chunk of daily schedule. People working in such jobs often face difficulty to strike balance between personal and professional life. Therefore, to escape from office environment, whatever spare time they get, they try to spent with their family and relatives. In contrary, If these people spend after-hours with coworkers, then there are strong chances that, because of same monotonous atmosphere is continuing after office, they may not get relax and in some case feel depressed also.",
        "However, I believe that humans are emotional creatures. We develop relations with people whom we spend ample amount of time togather. For instance, an average person spend more than eight hours a day in work field.  So, it is obvious that people make good friends over there. In fact, some of youth in office often get married to their peers. The reason for this is that congenial people often get better sense of understanding. Morevover, if peopel spend good time out side the office, their level of cooperation and trust will definetly raise, which gives seamless office functioning.",
        "In conclusion, although it is critical to get change from office surrounding and allotting more time for family, I feel that over a professional relation, we make friends for life at work place. Thus, there is nothing wrong to hanging out with them."
