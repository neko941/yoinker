        "Mankind has outpaced technological advancement more than its expectations. In the present scenario, if any work needs to be done then, the equipment is given more preference. Whilst, same household chores were done by family members earlier. There are merits outweighs the demerits of this trend.",
        "It is indeed a strange fact that with the rise in the use of machines, people are becoming more lethargic. Consequently, the population of obese people is surging day by day; the medical bills are increased. So, people should join a gym or have a schedule for physical activities. Moreover, the cost to purchase these devices is quite high. Many times one has to shell out more than he is earning. To add on, the service repair is also hidden charges that come along with time span.",
        "On the other hand, the key significance of using any tool to do a job is time saved by an individual. This time saved will be fruitful when the person uses it wisely and focus on doing other meaningful tasks that can help his growth in career. Moreover, the tussle to get work done from housekeeper is also not there. To add on, these appliances never get ill and one need not worry about odd situations.",
        "To recapitulate, there was a time when everyone lives the same rut life. In contrast, now they can grow more and live a life of their own after having these required instruments. However, personal wellbeing should be also not ignored because with machines decrease in physical activity can cause health issues."
