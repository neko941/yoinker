        "The world with the gender equality is the aim of human beings; however, due to ancient and outdated prejudices in the past, the women\u2019s role is often obstructed by men\u2019s one. From my own perspective, the female deserve a better treatment in this society to adapt to the new modern millennium.",
        "When it comes to the olden civilization in the past, women were considered as housewives by the virtue of their physical conditions. The plain truth is that a set of occupations in that time solely required the durable and sustainable strength which is conspicuously presented by the biological traits of men in terms of endurance and patience. For example, in order to serve as soldiers in the military, people have to meet the harsh requirements of the stimulations of the battlefields, such as rigorous training courses in the jungles or the deep seas, which is suitable for the male. Additionally, the past societies, including western and eastern ones, were in need of these such types of strength-related jobs; therefore, the position of the women was not highly appreciated.",
        "In comparison with manpower-related jobs, obviously, the femininity, nowadays, would be able to develop themselves in a variety of privileged fields. Inferred from the fact that the cutting-edge world has been shifting itself into the brain-based community, except housewives, which offers a practical opportunities for women who are intelligent and brilliant. Ms. Nguyen Dang Phuong Thao, CEO of the giant airline industry in Vietnam, is famous by her effective management and significant contributions Vietnamese community instead of her nuclear family. Henceforth, this gender should be entitled to thrive themselves in their beloved sectors.",
        "As aforementioned explanations, women should be treated by the innovative prejudices, which creates the equal society."
