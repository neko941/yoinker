        "Change is the only constant thing in life. it is inevitable in each one's life. however, it can be beautiful or can be painful but sometimes it is both.",
        "There are abundance of people around who spend their lives doing similar things which may include staying at one place, doing one job for the entire lifetime or staying at one firm decision always regardless of considering any new factor affecting the situation. i believe people like these are more stable and contented when compared to people facing constant changes in their life. these kind of individuals does not have to stress out on various things and remains uninfluenced by the fancy world where the people are busy showing off their expensive lifestyles by constantly changinf their houses, cars etc. Also, these people have become so comfortable in their own life and does not think of stepping out of their comfort zone.",
        "In contrary to this, there are people who does not like doing same things everytime and enjoy exploring the vast world of opportunities and challenges. these people are progressive people who like experimenting and discovering new potentials in oneself which can further help them achieve great heights. I think, in this ever-changinf society it is important to change and imbibe new lifwstyle according to our surroundings. As it is said that \"be a change you want to see\", so, by changing youself you are developing your skills of adaptability and adjustability which bring a lot of insights in an individual.",
        "In a nutshell, life is series of natural and spontaneous changes. we should not resist them and let ir flow. In my opinion, change can ne painful but nothing can be more painful as stucking somewhere you don't belong. Also, a change can be progressive or regressive depending upon what the outcome is and may vary for evry individual."
