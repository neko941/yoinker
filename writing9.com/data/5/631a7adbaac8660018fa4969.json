        "An increasing number of people have been noticed to transfer to the big metropolis nowadays. In this essay, I would emphasise the advantages and disadvantages of living in  big capital.",
        "People from the barrios or provinces tend to move to the big capital for more opportunities and increase their earnings. They definitely believe that living in the capital can provide a good and brighter future. Big establishments can be found which means it indulges in more job hiring and alluring compensation. The financial aspect is always been the primary reason for moving from a peaceful to a chaotic environment. Knowing that in the capital you could experience  heavy traffic pollution.",
        "Living outside the capital is less productive in  terms of businesses or careers. Only selected opportunities will be offered and in terms of work, they can have a stable job if somebody from the politicians will give an endorsement. This pertains to familiarisation rather than knowing what you have learned. Aside from this aspect, working in the province can be an advantage at times due to fewer expenses on food and transportation.",
        "In my point of view, preference wise in terms of cost of living I prefer to stay outside the city for there will be a bigger chance of savings. But, for careers and professional growth it is highly recommended to stay in the city so one can have  indefinite access to self-growth."
