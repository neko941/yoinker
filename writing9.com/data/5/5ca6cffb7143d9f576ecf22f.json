        "Due to the development of mass media such as televisions and internet, celebrities can now reach wider range of audiences and kids are not an exemption. In that sense, many believe that this scenario can have detrimental effects on children. In my opinion, I agree to this claim and I the reason for this will be discussed in this essay.",
        "A plethora of celebrities promote certain beauty and personality standards into the media. Since modern media covers almost everything about celebrities lifestyle, their influence on certain aspects such as beauty standards can reach sensitive audiences such as childrens. As a result, many youths will force themselves to imitate their idols to fit in the celebrities' traditional criteria of beauty even though it is has negative impacts on them. For example, children in the Philippines sometimes wear revealing clothes even though it is not appropriate and they do this kinds of  actions because it is what they see on media outlets which broadcasts famous people",
        "In addition, media coverage of celebrities can create drawbacks when these kinds of people commit inapproriate actions such as sexual offence and violent behaviours. Since these prominent people are influential, they can give children a reason to also commit unsuitable acts. For instance, after the media releases the news about a famous man in who commits sexual acts against a girl, there has been some records in which children recreates similar events based on what has been broadcast.",
        "To sum it all up , although media coverage of celebrities are common nowadays, there are drawbacks in specific audiences such as children. Since the youngs don't have enough maturity and experience, they can be easily influenced on what they see in different media outlets."
