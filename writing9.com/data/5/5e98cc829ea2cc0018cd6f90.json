That is to say, individual efforts to improve air quality will not give any results, and it's solely responsibility of our governments to reduce air pollution.\n\n\nDo you agree or disagree?",

        "Day after anotehr, the health and environment become essential topic to more people. The air we enhale has big effect on our body and nature, while air contamination is systematicly increasing and at unprecedingly levels. That is to say, ungrouped works to enhance air efficiency will not make significant output, and government has the sole responsibility to minimize the air pollution. In this essay I will tottaly disagree with this point of view.",
        "First and foremost, the nature quality is the responsibility of all of the members of the community, in addition to the government role to organize and legislate the required laws and order to keep the atmosphere pullotion at their lowest levels. To illustrate, societly councel should open all the communication channels with all citizens on how to enhance nature, and on the other hand, citizens must put this topic on their priority to work with the authority hand by hand, and step by step to pursue the needed efforts as two wings of the flying bird.",
        "Quality of air will not be sustained without the efforts of all of the community elements. Business men will think on their short term benefits before anything, moreover, authority needs them to secure the required jobs for all workers, which put the atmosphere at the end of priorities. In the contrast, the long term plan by community, will make the air quality a compulsory for living.",
        "In a nutshell, health is not an individual related issue, that he need to take care on his own, or an authority matter that they have to control it away of people. From my point of view, a balanced approach need to be maintained to save life and health of people."
