        "The inquisitive factor of a nation greatly depends on its inhabitants; it tends to rise significantly when there is inculcation of wide range of ethnic groups. I completely agree with the statement. This essay will elaborate my opinion on similar lines.",
        "It is often apparent that people adore various cultures enormously; moreover they love and respect each other\u2019s views and opinion to a higher extent. The country\u2019s asset is said to be the people itself, and it is they who decide the former\u2019s fate, Hence a fusion of nationalities will strengthen the nations bond as it will inculcate various cultures and generate new values.",
        "Nevertheless, I do opine that it is a natural tendency of people to get significantly attracted towards citizens of other countries and their cultures; they try to imitate them more often. Consequently, if a country includes people with various nationalities, each one of them can widely contribute to the society profitably by instilling their own learning\u2019s and attributes. For an instance, if an Indian citizen migrates to New Zealand in order to settle over there with his family, he not only will impact the country with the economy factor but also through his opinions and actions that would entice the locals.",
        "In conclusion, looking beyond the tabloids, however, it is evident that factors such as culture, views and economy to a greater level comes into play when we consider blend of nationalities in making a country more intriguing and enthralling. In addition, the aforementioned elements can also tend to be imperative as it is responsible for the humongous growth of the respective nation."
