        "It is commonly believed that pouring a lot of the governmental resources to unravel  universe  is absolute waste of them, however they better be utilized for public welfare. I agree that bulk of the governmental finances should be directed to meet basic needs of society, but space exploration also holds importance.",
        "To begin some argue that  expenditure of resources to explore universe is total waste of them. However, I opine,  acquiring the  knowledge of universe hold a significant importance in fields of  sciences. By launching satellites in to space scientists are  able to uncover the remarkable Knowledge about weather and  survival conditions on other space bodies. This is helpful in one way as we predict the worse weather disasters Beforehand and can make preventions and furthermore, in case when all the earth resources will deplete and population will exceed the earth capacity we will have a chance to migrate to an another planet with survival facillities. For  instance, NASA launched a satellite on Mars  in  2008 which  discovered, the foot prints of human survival  and along with presence of gasses essential for human survival .",
        "According to an other school of thoughts, government should spend generously to contribute to public good. I agree with this suggestion because  space exploration is highly expansive project  that  needs huge investment hence, developing countries like us better direct their finances to improve living standards. As we are lacking in  basics like clothing, food, education and employment it is the need of government to funnel tax payers money to more down- to- earth projects. Reforms should be introduced which are crucial to welfare of society such as free education and economical health care. For example, Imran khan introduced health program in 2011 in which poor people were provided with health cards to seek free health care.",
        "To conclude, government  on his first hand should try to provide basic facilities to public  as this is more significant and then pour money for space venture as its second priority."
