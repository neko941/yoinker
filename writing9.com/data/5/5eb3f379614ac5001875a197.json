        "Building a large factory seem to be a sign of developing in my community because it reduces a number of unemployment and create new job opportunities. Some group of people agree with building new factory because it is a good idea but I partly disagree with this statement. This essay will discuss the pros and cons of building a large factory and provide some of my opinions to support my view.",
        "Every factory bring a lot of advantages and disadvantages to every class of people. Of course, more jobs would be created by the factory for local people and it will help the local economics.For example, large company need a huge amount of people to run the business so local people could gain more income to treat their family. Moreover, It also provides small business opportunities surrounded the factory. A large factory bring a lot of benefits to both individuals and small business",
        "However, I believe that my community would be harmed by a large factory. Firstly, a factory would destroy the quality of the air and water in town. Factory bring smoke and pollution. For a long term, the environment will be hurt and people\u2019s health will be affected. Secondly, a large company would be destroyed the clam. A factory will cause the town to become too noisy. For example, we could be wake up from our dreams by the noise of the machine that run all day all night.",
        "To sum up, this essay discussed what are the advantages and disadvantages of building a large factory. From my perspective, it will bring more working opportunity for local people. But comparing with the cons, I strongly oppose with the idea to build a factory nearby my community."
