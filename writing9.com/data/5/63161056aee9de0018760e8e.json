        "It is a common phenomenon today that many museums and historical sites worldwide are packed by tourists rather than local people. In my opinion, as far as national culture is concerned, we ought to take measures to encourage the local to visit these sites.",
        "First of all, people are driven by an intrinsic curiosity to explore what they are not familiar with, and many deem what are demonstrated in museums and historical sites \u201cboring\u201d as they might have seen them on TV or heard about them in their daily life; furthermore, the rapid progress of economic and technological development in recent decades have also promoted the flow of people worldwide. As a result, people around the globe are no longer satisfied with what they can see in the locality but would like to visit exotic foreign cultures, which are usually well-represented by museums and historical sites.",
        "Such phenomenon is a dire issue that needs to be addressed as an understanding of national culture is the very base of national unity. Citizens ought to have a good understanding of who they are and where they belong before they can be united to work efficiently and create progress for the society. Museums and historical sites are the carriers of national culture, and we ought to take measures to encourage local people to visit them.",
        "Technological and financial measures can be used to promote locals to visit museums and historical sites. To be more specific, tools such as multimedia tours with music and videos could be applied to a museum together with the exhibits, attracting visitors both young and old; in addition, subsidies could be issued to locals, especially young children and students, as they are in the stage of forming a cultural understanding and are the future of our nation."
