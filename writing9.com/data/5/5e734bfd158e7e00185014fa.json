        "To save our inheritance is sometimes becames huge debts on goverment in maintainace and well keeping of Monuments, Musuems and Castles and all old historic buidlings. To pass such bills of expense is always hectic and create disputes amoung peoples. In such case development of new modern buildings are always prefreble by majority of public. I personally believe that old buildings should be kept and maintined well no matter what the expenses are. My thoughts and explaination on reserving historic buildings are as follows.",
        "Fistly, its stated wrong that historic buildings are expence on government as it created the revenue also for tourisum department and in some cases the whole state or cities completly rely on tourisum income. For instance, nighty to nighty five percent of income in cities like Goa, Shimla and Diu are generated by tourisum. Secondly, the monuments and castles refects the roots of our culture and heritage or out glorious history. which also represents life of kings, queens and royal families of past centuries with its preserved artifacts and valueable jewellries admired world-wide. Furthermore, It is preserved by many generations so now our generation is responsible to do the same and hand over the heritage to next generations.Lastly, It provides subjects and evidance to students of history, science, art and mainly to archaeologist.",
        "On the contary, modernasation in structures of buildings are widely adepted in the architecural socities due to its inexpensive nature and long term no maintainance nature. In today\u2019s scenario majority of people moving towards high rised towers which has more facilities rather than staying in mannor house.",
        "To sum up, i would say that heritage buildings are branches of humanities which must be handed over to new genrations otherwisw they will be clueless of  the great history. Thus, we must maintain old bulidings while creating new once."
