        "Every country has a significant problem in society like unemployment. It is one of consequences of globalization. In this case some people have an opinion that government can solve this problem if employed people have cell phone and free internet connection. As a result, they have much more opportunities and chances to find a job. Personally, I agree with this statement. Due to the fact, that this small action can help to solution many social, economical and psychological problems, which I will explain in this essay.",
        "Firstly, it is well known, than we live in technological age. What I mean here is that nowadays all news, job opportunities we can find in internet. Early people looked forward for job in papers or in advertisement. However, in contemporary world it is old trend. Many companies search labors in different apps and internet web sites like job.com or hh.com (head hunter.com), which offer many job vacancies for different specializations. Secondly, when jobless have opportunity to find a job with mobile phone and available internet, then it will solve different social problem. Because, according world research more people divorced, take drugs and become alcohol addiction cause lose the job.",
        "On the other hand, it can also be argued that government should not provide the jobless people with technology services. Instead, government can use this money for education new profession for unemployed people and organize new vacancies. This method will be more effective and productive as for jobless people so for government and country.",
        "In conclusion, taking everything mentioned into account in our final analysis, we can say that it is a good idea to find a little issue against unemployment and when jobless people will use this in right way than countries economy and citizen\u2019s life will be much better."
