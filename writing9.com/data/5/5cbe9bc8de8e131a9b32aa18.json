        "In the modern era, technology has become an essential part of daily life. Some people believe that technological developments have substituted people in work place with higher rate and is increasingly responsible in unemployment, while others think that it is not true. In this essay, I will examine both two sides of this idea and provide my opinion.",
        "From an overall perspective, there are some reasons why people believe that technology has replaced people at greater rate. Perhaps the main reason why I agree with this idea is that computers and machines have done works done by humanity in the past perfectly with better results and low cost. A good illustration for this is painting and resembling in car industry. Robots can take these works more effectively and accurately than workers can leading to unemployment in car industry.",
        "Despite these arguments, technology could human life become easier and more comfortable. Information technology enables current generation to communicate effectively. Thus, people are able to finish their works faster and have more time to enjoy the life. For example, we have email and chatting tools to connect to coworkers and customers nowadays. This could bring more productivity in business as well as generate more job prospects in information technology sector.",
        "In conclusion, technology is a topic, which is very relevant to modern society. Overall, I would have to say that I agree with the view in some extent that technological advances have replaced people in the work place at higher rate as a good reason is that technology products make people life better."
