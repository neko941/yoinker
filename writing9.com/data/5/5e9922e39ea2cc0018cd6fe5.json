        "The goal of every business is to be successful. The factors of success are many and people have varied opinions on this. A lot of individuals maintain that the amount of revenue a business earns is the most reliable and authentic factor of success. From my standpoint, money is not only the determinant of success but also the level of customer gratification, company\u2019s responsibility towards the society are some other ways to measure success.",
        "To begin with, money-making is one of the prime objectives of every business. As all the businesses in the world are profit-oriented, the more revenue a business earns, the better it performs. Without earning enough amount of money, no business can sustain in the long run in the intense competitive market, and even its competitors are likely to take its place or even acquire the entire business. To illustrate, in Bangladesh market, when the company B was failing to produce enough cash to meet its expenses and it was losing its market position to its competitors, the giant A company accumulated the company B. Without doubt, it therefore can be said that cash generation strengths a business survival in the market and it is an important purpose of doing business which measures company\u2019s success.",
        "Nevertheless, a business success is also measured by its customers level of satisfaction. This means that a small business with satisfied customer base can also be called successful business. For instance, a great number of street food carts in India have earned huge respect of people despite not having large capital like multinational food chain shops. This has been possible due to the cooking mastery of those food sellers, not their large investment and profit-earning mindset like the big companies. Added to that, a company can never expect to succeed without carrying out its responsibilities towards society such as- planting trees, helping the needy people, creating more employment etc. By neglecting these responsibilities, a business can never be recognized as successful by the people of society. Last but not least, a business has responsibility for its employees as well. The measures a company has taken to improve the welfare of the employees should also be taken into account while measuring its success."
