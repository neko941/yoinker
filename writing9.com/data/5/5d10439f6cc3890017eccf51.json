        "Cultural diversity protection has become a hot topic of discussion in the society as language extinction is increasingly being witnessed these days. Some people perceive that protecting language diversity is unnecessary because we will have an easier life if there are less languages exist in the world. This essay will discuss why preventing vulnerable languages from extinction is absolutely essential for us.",
        "People who are against language protection are justifiably worried that the existence of different language is detrimental to the globalization and economic development. They recently pointed out that nations tend to work and collaborate more efficiently and effectively with less language barriers. In addition, there are over 200 languages globally so massive financial burden will be put on the authority if we insist on protecting them. As can be seen, economic and social development could be adversely affected by doing this.",
        "Despite the potential risks associated with language protection, the idea that preventing language from extinction is not significant is absolute preposterous. Cultural diversity plays a crucial role in shaping our personalities as it enables us to broaden our horizons of life. A good illustration of this is that it has been found bilingual people tend to blend more effortlessly and easily with people from different backgrounds. Overall, the idea that language extinction is unimportant is ill-informed and could potentially lead to a far worse outcome for the society.",
        "This essay argued that people who are against of protecting various languages have a flawed understanding of this and underestimate the affects of what they believe. I am inclined to say that the protection of culture diversity is an absolute imperative that is entirely justified despite the minor and occasional challenges involved."
