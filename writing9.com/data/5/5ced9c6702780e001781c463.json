        "Consideration of health care has been changing recently. Participants of health care has started to support a new belief: \u201cPrevention is better than cure.\u201d",
        "First of all, I would like to indicate that I agree with this trend totally. Health ministries of governments should create new policies to emphasize the prevention than the cure. It is clear that the protection of health is cheaper and better way than fighting with diseases. The importance of this should be conveyed to the society. Therefore, health education needs to be developed. It is the best method to tell people about a healthy lifestyle.",
        "Furthermore, health budgets of countries also ought to be adjusted. They should spend money for preventative measures. It is going to be recognised over the years, it is more economical way than spending money on drugs and treatments. Not only society but also health care professionals have to be educated. They need to understand that the first aim of them is protection of the current health. They should not focus only the treatments, diseases or drugs. They should emphasize the exercise, nutritious foods and healthy lifestyle.",
        "Lastly, the role of the first step health services are very important in this concept. They should reach all age group of the society and recommend some activities for a healthy lifestyle. Not only doctors and nurses but also physical therapists, dietitians, psychologists have to be a part of these first step health services. The collaboration of these occupations might be crucial for policies of prevention.",
        "In conclusion, the governments should reorganise health budget and a large proportion of it need to be transferred from the cure to the prevention."
