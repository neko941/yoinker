        "In recent times, there has been an increase in the number of crimes committed by young offenders. While few argue that the main reason is the inefficient parenting skills, others think that is not the only reason. I strongly agree on the latter side of the argument.",
        "Parents do play an important role in the development of their children. Studies have proved that kids belonging to a happy family are better off compared to those who grow up in a disturbed house. Moreover, kids learn everything from their surroundings and it is important to have a healthy and positive environment.For instance, a child who grow up in a large family comprising of parents and grand parents will be developing skills much earlier than those from a nuclear family. Hence, it is undoubtedly clear that parents as well as a good home influence children a lot.",
        "However, we cannot put all the blame on parents for the bad behavior of their children. These days, kids learn and lot from school and friendships that they make outside school. Social media and televison also play an important role in modifying a child's character. There is a drastic difference between children who watch violent videos and news and the ones who is more into cartoons and educational programmes. In a way, parents can control this to an extent; but this has a limit. Many a times, parents wont be aware of what programmes children watch and hence will not be able to control them.",
        "To conclude, parents play an important role in children's life. Even though they are made responsible for what ever activities kids do, I beleive that it is not correct to blame them for all offences that that do."
