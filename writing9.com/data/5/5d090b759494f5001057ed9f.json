        "In mordern world, we are at the peak of technological advancements that has in turn created a huge impact in the society. While some argue that all the latest technology available is making people more sociable, others beleive that the effect is detrimental and has exact opposite impact. Here, we look into both the sides and conclude on why I support the latter group.",
        "On the one hand, some are of the opinion that world is becoming a smaller place due to all the new findings that we have. Internet and social networking sites have helped a lot in providing better platform for effective communication without having distance as a barrier. We are able to talk to people all over the world within a fraction of seconds. Whole world is just one-click away from us. Online chat rooms are avalable which helps people to find new friends and there by know others whom otherwise is impossible.We can even do a face-to-face call with the help of applications like Skype and Facetime. These clearly state the idea, need and importance of technical innovations.",
        "On the other hand, another set of people see this as a negative development. The main reason for their disagreement is the change that society has after the globalisation. People are busy making friends online whom they might never meet in their lifetime where as they totally forget their neighbours who stay just one house away. No one has time to mingle with each other and group activities no longer exists. For instance, a survey conducted in India reported that 65% of yongsters spend more than 90% of their time in the internet and is not aware of what is happening in the locality where they live.",
        "To conclude, change is always a good thing and every one should be having the mindset to accept it. However, in my opinion, even though all these changes bring people closer, this is having a bad impact on the society as a whole."
