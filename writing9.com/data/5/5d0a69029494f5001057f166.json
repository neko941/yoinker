        "Globally, it has been observed that people\u2019s fashion choices is greatly influenced by current trends in the modern day. This can be attributed to a number of reasons but personally, I am of the notion that this latest style is a negative phenomenon as it can cause wastage of precious money and time.",
        "The major reason people are motivated to select hair-dos and purchase attires with regards to contemporary trends is the inherent need for societal approval. In other words, people generally do not like to be perceived as being old-fashioned so they conclude that they must be seen in modern-day apparels so as not to be brushed aside. Furthermore, it is commonly believed that it raises one\u2019s status in the public since it is basically the wealthy population that can afford such sophisticated lifestyles. For example, it is no news that fans like to associate themselves with celebrities in the fashion industry by copying their clothing sense and uniqueness,which is mostly insignificant.",
        "However, I believe that making fashion decisions based on foremost trends negatively impacts the society as it consumes time and money. This is because fashion changes drastically and frequent pursuit of  latest in-vogue styles can be very expensive because these new trends are usually costly and totally avoidable. For instance, young adults who cannot afford expensive clothings, yearn for branded accessories, weird haircuts and tattoos just to feel a sense of belonging amidst their peers. Consequently, they engage in misconducts like theft due to the desperation they begin to feel. Also, this time can be spent more productively in other activities like their academics,sports,and talent-building.",
        "In conclusion, the need to be associated with affluence and high rank in the society influences people\u2019s decisions in terms of fashion but this trend is not helpful as it can be dangerous considering the future."
