        "These days, every time when you turn on the TV or flick through the pages of a newspaper, learn about the helping to developing countries with financial aid by some organizations. Some people believe that it is not the best manner. I completely agree with this idea and in this essay I will try to support my opinions with examples.",
        "In the first place, I think it is easy to see that funds should be allocated to education. What I mean by this developing countries don't have money or equipment to elaborate schools and educational centers. In addition children want to study but they don't have opportunity. Because of this, it could be plausible that enthusiast might be consistent with my viewpoint regarding this issue.",
        "Another reason why I disagree with this matter is that, providing fiscal aid to these countries is likely to make them become enslaved to others. What's more they cannot do anything without other's orders. From this it becomes quite evident that my disagreement to this issue can be supported.",
        "However, there is another argument such as first argument, it must be remembered that aid can be squandered on awfully wrong purpose. Unfortunately this is something that they ask aid for education but they use it for another thing, for instance, marketing or privacy works. From this, it becomes quite evident that my agreement to this issue cannot be supported.",
        "In conclusion, although it is a common belief that government and financial institutions should be involved to ensure efficiently usage of these funds. After analyzing this subject, it is predicted that the positive aspects of this debate will forever be stronger than the negative ones and because of this they should controlled hardly and this may lead to right way."
