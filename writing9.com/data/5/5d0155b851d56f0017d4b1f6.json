        "Nowadays, natural energy sources are getting exstinct. Atomic became one of the Alternative sources for energy. In present world because of growth of population, we should relay on Wind, solar and nuclear resources for power generation. Each one has its own advantages and disadvantages.",
        "Let's deal with advantages, Wind power cannot be available all the time and all the places, so as the sun light. In this case Nuclear power plant is only option that can built anywhere, keeping mind the place should be far from population. It can be generate using the chemical reactions and can provide electricity for almost all the cities. Because of this reason, it became an popular alternative source of energy to most of the countries. As developed and developing states requires huge amount of power for their industries and for household needs. As its difficult to meet all the requirement with available resources, only source to meet the requirement is atomic power generation. Eventhough cost incured to establish it is high but it's worthful considering the consumption.",
        "On the other hand, There are lots of diadvantages of using it. It should be constructed away from the residential area. If some thing goes wron entire city or area will be burned. Moreover, we know the consequences of explosion in Japan. Its not only dangerous but also risk involved in maintainence. If overlooked then there is not only hidden treat to life , but also environmental hazzard. Maybe, with this reasons, making us to rethink about it. So environment lovers are aganist to construction of these power plants.",
        "In conclusion, As there are both advantages and disadvantages, it's we need to decide based on the necessity and with the available resources. To my opinion, we can go with power plant under precautionary methods."
