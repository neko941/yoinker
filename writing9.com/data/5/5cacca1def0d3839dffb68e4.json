To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion? What sort of punishment should parents and teachers be allowed to use to teach good behaviour to children?",

        "It has been argued that penalizing kids from a young age is crucial to teach them the distinction between ethical and unethical. This essay completely agrees with the statement because retribution would enable them to learn from their mistakes and prevent them from having negative traits when they grow up. However, there should be clear demarcation as to what sort of punishment is acceptable.",
        "Penalties provide opportunities to children to realise and rectify their errors. If children are sanctioned whenever they commit a wrong deed like fighting, stealing, abusing cheating and rewarded on good deeds,  they'd learn the significance of both these actions. Moreover, they'll be more prone to making amends. A survey showed that in schools where children were asked to repeat their assignment thrice if they did not submit it on time, the students were more punctual.",
        "Retribution allows children to grow into responsible adults. Before teenage, chikdren are extremely malleable and if properly taught about what is good and what is bad, they would definitely incorporate good qualities in their personalities. Where explanations fail, actions (ie penalties) have pertinent impact. A study displayed that children who were brought up under proper supervision were less likely to grow into criminals than those who had no sense of repentance.",
        "Nevertheless, the punishment should not be ruthless. All sorts of physical torture should be abandoned and instead, the best way to teach would be to tell the children to do the thing again and again until they get it right. In addition, they should be expounded about what they did wrong and why it was was it inappropriate. Studies have proven that rewarding children for commendable acts helps them learn faster than abusing and torturing them for bad ones. Experiments done for toilet training of children are a classical example in this context.",
        "In conclusion, punishments should be a part and parcel of growing up as long as they're not physical. They allowed children to right their wrongs and grow into law-abiding adults."
