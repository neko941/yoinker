        "Friends are the treasure of life with whom you can share all your happiness and sorrows . Generally, like-minded people have a greater tendency to come closer and get themselves into an informal knot called friendship. But a friend who always gets agree with your opinions can\u2019t be able to bring any improvement or amendment in your views. This essay discusses both views about having friends always with same opinions or it\u2019s good to have friends with different opinions sometimes.",
        "The choice of our family members is done by Almighty and its pre decided before our birth. But friends are the people in our life which is chosen by us. Most of cases we prefer to choose people with same opinions, hobbies and interests as our friends. We feel more comfortable and open for sharing with like-minded people.  For example- We always feel good if our views are being accepted and respected by some ones. Usually we tend to share more and more with such counterparts and feel a sense of recognition with such people.",
        "On Other hand, having such friends who are always getting agreed with your opinions actually hampering your growth in one way or the other. Because being a good friend, it is expected that if he/she could be able to communicate the wrong in you in a positive way. Criticism always brings a better person if it is take in a positive way and you have zeal to improve yourself. But finding and intimating them is the primary task.",
        "To conclude, friendship is an important part of life and selection of friends should be done very carefully. So a good friend who keeps an honest approach to intimate your shortcomings is always admirable than a friend who keeps giving false praises."
