        "Nowadays, In developed countries like USA, Canada and England some laws have been made by their government to make people well-aware about their well beings and fitness. Banning smoking is one of the major laws made by authorities of these countries. I personally agree that it has far more pros than cons. However, This essay will discuss whether putting ban on smoking  at public places have more merits or demerits.",
        "Firstly, In recent past, due to the awareness via social media people have become concerned about their health. Thus, compromising on it even when they are not on fault is unacceptable. In this scenario, restricting smoking at bars, restaurants and other places of exposures governments decisions have been much appreciated due to its far-sighted positive and subliminal impacts. For instance, In a long run air pollution would be avoided, so people should let it be implemented.",
        "Secondly, Technologies have brought a lot of hazards already, including many health hazards like cancer and now to avoid it has become inevitable. Thus, The idea to impose ban on smoking can save us from more other issues like, damange of lungs and tuberculosis. As researches prove that, passive smoking is as harmful as active.In addition to this, our youth will be encouraged to avoid it and find it wrong when they do not see their adults are enjoying confidently while sitting next to them at a bus stop or cafeterias.Hence, On a national level an addicted and drug free generation would be raised.",
        "However, On the other hand, some people will disagree with the decision and consider it as an intervene in their liberty of acts and self choices. Furthermore, Questions have been raised widely as there are many other harmful and immoral practices are allowed at governments level then why not this? To answer them, Authorities delve deeper and try to fetch some solutions to satisfy these mindsets.",
        "To sum up, I undoubtedly believe that smoking should be banned at the public access places and should be discouraged at every possible platforms to get rid of its negative consequences."
