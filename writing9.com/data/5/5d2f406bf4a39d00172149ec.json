        "Some would argue that, it is good to make new friends through social networking sites. While others say one-on-one interaction is very much important. Although, social media platform is ment to connect people beyond countries. However, I believe personal meeting creats a magic in becoming genuine friendships.",
        "On the one hand, these day people spend most of their time on internet to work or study. So it is a kind of relief to make new friends through this online platform. One of the fascinating things about these platforms getting to know other countries cultures. For example, through Facebook social site, many people meet from all over the world. Getting to know each othere and their culture. But, I believe meeting someone personally get to know very well.",
        "On the other hand, true friends know about their feeling and it can happen only through personal meet and having a good conversation. By meeting and talking to someone we come to know about persons aura negative, positive and geniunity. For instance, Indian actor salman khan applied online for a movie role to a production company and he got rejected. But, when he met producer personally then Producer Company came to know about the real talent and the hunger for doing work.",
        "To conclude, I think true friendship is only possible through geniun face to face conversation, instead of virtual friedship. Because personal meeting gives an ultimatee attachment towards other person."
