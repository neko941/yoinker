        "Generally, newspapers and magazines are read by the individuals  daily to know about the current issues, which are happening around the world.These days, most of the famous peoples  private lives have been published in the newspapers  and magazines. In my opinion, it is irrelevant to provide this information to the public.",
        "Undoubtedly, there are several drawbacks.Most of the individuals are interested in the current affairs of the country, while they are least bothered about the private lives of the well known  person's. It is Unnecessary  to deliver their personal information.For instance, prince Diana would not be met with the accident, if the paparazzi's were not following the car, just to click pictures of her with the sports boyfriend. Despite  showing about their personal life, they can publish about the charities  and services.Which  brings awareness to the common  people.",
        "Nevertheless, there are few upsides.Due to this, dialies  and magazines publishing the content about the famous  people. Public do  get to know more about them. It's  kind of advantage to the celebrities, where they are being promoted freely. For example, individuals do know about this person's private life like marriages, award functions, and their daily routine.Even the marriage  of film actors, Deepika and Ranveer's was known to the public. The journals can publish, but not the embarrassing  or untruth aspects of this people . Just  for their own benefits to attract the public.",
        "In conclusion,few aspects can be published, but to an extent. Even they are like a normal  people and  they do have their own rights. So, in my opinion  it is inappropriate to publish about them with broad headlines on the front  magazines."
