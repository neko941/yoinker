        "It is commonly believed that pouring a lot of the governmental resources to unravel  life on other planets  is an absolute waste of them, however, they better be utilized for public welfare. I agree that bulk of the governmental finances should be directed to meet the basic needs of society, but space exploration also holds importance.",
        "According to one school of thoughts, the  government should spend more  to solve public basic problems rather than exploring universe. I agree with this suggestion  because, we  are a developing country and lacking in basics like education, food, shelter and employment.In  present challanges, it  is the need of government to funnel tax payers money to more down- to- earth projects and provide people with their basic necessities. Reforms should be introduced which are crucial to welfare of society such as free education and economical health care which in turn help public to elevate their standard of living. For example, Imran khan recently introduced the health program in which 2500  poor people are provided with the health cards to seek free health care and the government is supposed to pay on their behalf hence, providing a benefit to local prople.",
        "On the other hand, some argue that  expenditure of resources to explore life on other planets is totaly in vain. However, I opine,  acquiring the  knowledge of neighbouring planets holds a significant importance. By launching satellites in to space scientists are  able to uncover the hudden Knowledge about the  survival conditions on other space bodies. This is helpful in a way that, incase when all the earth resources will deplete and population will exceed the earth capacity we will have a chance to migrate to an another planet if any of them contain  suitable surviving habitat. For  instance, NASA  send a sattelite to Mars in order to find is there any posibility of life. That discovered evidences of  life and presence of gasses that can support human survival.",
        "To conclude, government  on his first hand should try to provide basic facilities to public  as this is more significant and then pour money for space venture as its second priority"
