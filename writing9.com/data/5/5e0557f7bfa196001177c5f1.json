        "A few European countries provide special practical classes to the children, ageing between 11 to 13, to prepare them for the word of work; however, other students go through same academic curriculum. This essay will brief about a few possible solutions to make children ready for securing a job for themselves.",
        "The first and foremost thing that schools should work on is to build infrastructure for simulating specific type of environment.",
        "Although, theoretical concepts must be cleared before undergoing a practical experiment yet pupils learn more speedily when they are put in the simulated environments. In addition to this, children can be assigned small projects to work on, related to the skills they are taught in each class. It would help in mastering the desired skillset as well as practical knowledge. As per the survey of 'Europe Times' in year 2018, children learn at double speed when they are given a real-like environment to learn.",
        "It is undeniable to say that some students are inborn talented, and exhibit the extraordinary traits. For such students, schools should help them progress at faster rate then others, because they have different abilities then other students. Special classes might be arranged for them to get best out of them. To cite an instance, as there are special schools for physically challenged and mentally disabled children, there should also be different schools for these special youngsters.",
        "To conclude, facilitating students with the cloned environment, matching the real-time industry, helps them having a close to authentic experience. Also, recognising the real strength of students and providing them with growth paln matching their abilities will help them excel in life."
