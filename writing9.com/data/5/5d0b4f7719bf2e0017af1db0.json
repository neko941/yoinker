        "Information technology has changed the way we communicate, such that it is often thought to reduce the time that people allocate to be with their friends. While some consider that this advancement has only damaged their social life, in my view, modern ways of communication has benefits that outweigh the cost.",
        "Compared to before, technology has never been more integrated to the way humans interact with each other. It has gotten to a whole new level where it allows people to communicate without leaving their houses., which was the main form of social interaction besides writing mails. Therefore, it is understandable that laypeople are worried that this ease of communication might jeopardise their social lives. After all, meeting people in real life deliver lots of non-literal aspects of human interaction, which are unquestionably essential and sometimes hindered by social medias.",
        "However, the advantages offered by non-conventional communication forms are often overlooked when people only focus to the negative impacts. Some decades ago, it would be just a daydream to talk in real time with someone who lived in the other side of the earth. Furthermore, not only people can interact with other humans from far away, they can now socialise with new people they have not known before as easily as they do with their best friends. Other perks can be seen in a larger picture, for example, it is now just some clicks away to gather mass participations for social causes that help those in needs. All of these would not have happened had it not because of progressive technology of modern communication.",
        "To summarise, today\u2019s forms of human interaction may cause some disadvantages especially to social aspects. Nevertheless, they also carry lots of advantages that surpass the negative effects. Information technology wields a great power for enhancing human\u2019s social life that has to be harnesses carefully in order to bring out the best of it."
