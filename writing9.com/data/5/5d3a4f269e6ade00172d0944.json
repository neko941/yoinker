        "With the development of technology, the opportunity to work from home has become a reality for many employees. However, although I concede that teleworkers can save costs and have more control over their timetable, I believe that there are many more serious drawbacks than benefits.",
        "On the one hand, I admit that working from home can save an employee a lot of time and money over the course of a year. For example, remote workers no longer need to worry about the cost of commuting to the office by public transport. Similary, the hours sitting in the car on the way to the office can now be spent at the gym or with family members, which undoubtedly helps people achieve a better work life balance. Finally, it could also be argued that people are more productive when they work from home because they are interrupted less by colleagues.",
        "However, even though I agree that there are benefits to working from home, I would argue that the drawbacks far outweigh them. Firstly, working from home rewuires a massive amount of self-discipline. Being able to be in your home space but still perform your work tasks takes a lot of dedication and self-control. Many people find themselves either distracted by household tasks or, worse, working far longer hours than they used to do at the office because they cannot separate their personal and professional lives. However, my strongest argument against teleworking is the damage it can do to your career. A lot can happen in twenty-four hours in an office, and remote workers often find themselves unaware of important develppments such as staff changes or new business. As a result, the danger of being overlooked for promotion is quite real and, in my opinion, losing out on career opportunities like these is much worse than having commute.",
        "In conclusion, despite the fact that on the surface working from home seems to give employees a better work home balance, in reality, it can lead to people working more but achieving less in their career. Therefore, I do not believe that the benefits of working remotely outweigh the drawbacks."
