        "In the past generation, it was believed that marriage is between two soul who are meant to live together. However, these days people often feel marrying for money holds greater values than marrying the person whom you were in love with. I think, the latter has more weight. In this essay i will discuss both sides to this and the difficulties with men and women go through in general.",
        "Firstly, few people are under the impression that money matter the most in their lives, as it is the source of bread and butter. Some feel that, being wealthy gives them prestige and pride. Taking the society as an example, people feel marrying someone who is rich would imply that they could lead a peaceful life. They could have servants for their houseold work and sit at home like queens. Forthermore, money is considered as a subtle form of happiness and this is why people fall as trap to it, as they get what they want at their fingertips.",
        "On the other hand,  some belive that life is just once and they should spend it with the ones who matter the most to them. I agree with this, as money could come any day and leave you any day. On the contrast, feelings cannot be bought at any point of time. Taking an instance of my neighbours, who are married for 30 years, i am meamerised to see their understanding. In addition to this, they have a son whom they love the most but they stay in a small house and are not quite well off. However, they are extreamly content in life and this i feel is the aim of life.",
        "To conclude, being wealthy is a part of living. Whereas, having someoen who cares for you for a lifetime is the ultimate success one can ever come across and i personally feel people should not be daunted by richness of the society."
