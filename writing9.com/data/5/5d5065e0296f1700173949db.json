        "Through history, there are numerous events that have changed our knowledge and achievements. Some people believe that these developments were nothing else than our society evolving from ignorance. Others, on the other hand, believe that every ancient culture had its greatness and achievements which should not be dismissed.",
        "Previously regarded achievements, such as inventing the weel, finding the use of fire or forging metal are not considered by many to be true achievements, as these happened trough trial and error, rather than true and exact science. According to this believe, great achievements comes after profound thinking and planning which indicates knowledge. Events that happened by chance, such as realizing earth's gravity or finding the dark matter, are a result of normal education and cultural development, and should not be looked uppon as true achievement.",
        "In contrast to the previously stated belief, many people think that every major finding should be appreciated and valued, and should not be critisized retrospectively. For example, although we are well aware that the earth is round, during ancient time, it was believed by all major scientists it is flat. This example emphesize that, knowledge which is considred elementary knowdays, was revolutiionary in previous times and should not be overlooked.",
        "In my opinion, considering ancient cultures as ignorant is foolish and unwise. All our knowledge is based on previous findings. To illustrate, the internet is based on computers, and computers require electricity, an achievement made 100 years ago. This illustrates, that the greatest findings of our time relies on previous achievements and, as a consequence, is equal in its importance.",
        "In conclusions, every society has its own great findings and development which are based on previous achievements. We should learn to value previous scientists and inventors, because they paved us the road to reach new achievements."
