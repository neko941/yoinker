        "At the present time, it is widely acknowledged that the bonds between family members are not so close as they used to be. Parents are no longer the persons their children confide in. In this essay, we will discuss the causes of this tendency and carry out possible solutions for this problem.",
        "To begin with, the distance between the members is mainly the consequence of their being busy with their jobs. In an increasingly competitive working environment, people are put under the pressure. Being urged to concentrate on their works all day long, parents do not have much time to calmly listen to their children\u2019s words. As a result, the teenagers who are looking for sympathy and support tend to lose their trust in their families. In addition, the advent of recreational facilities has diverted people from having chats with the members of the families. Their free time now is mostly occupied by playing video games or surfing the Internet. They gradually lose interest in communicating with the others. It usually comes to the fact that parents do not know their kids as much as the Internet does.",
        "To overcome this, significant steps must be taken. Work-life balance plays a pivotal part in daily life. The adults may establish a schedule where they have more spare time to spend with their families. At weekends, they can take their children to a theme park or go out for a picnic. Thus, not only may stress from work be reduced but also close rapport is developed between family members. The lack of closeness can be made up for by frequent conversations. Regular contact on the phone can be a good idea for distant relatives to stay connected.",
        "To sum up, close family relationship is surely maintained as long as each member realises the significant role it plays in our lives and we attach importance to it."
