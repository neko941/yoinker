        "Many countries nowadays are facing the high unemployment rate of young, qualified fresh graduates. This essay aims to give some insights into the causes of this issue and propose some possible solutions.",
        "The most significant reason for the problem is evidently the lack of practical skills of young people, despite being academically competent. During the training period, either at university of vocational level, students are often given too much work about theories instead of practicing exercises. As a result, they would later find themselves incompatible with the expected jobs, which often require working experience than education background. Take accounting as an example, since most graduates had to concentrate on remembering theories rather than practising them or learning to use accounting software, which is the compulsory requirement from any employers, they are likely to end up either working in irrelevant fields or becoming unemployed.",
        "In order to tackle this issue, it is strongly recommended that universities should adjust the curriculums by providing more mandatory practical exercises and internships to maximise students\u2019 opportunities to develop essential skills for the future career. This approach not only gives learners a good foundation to prove their competence in the labour market but also helps in nurturing outstanding generations suitable for the requirements of the economic development. For instance, hundreds of students from ABC university, one of the best education institutions in Vietnam, could easily secure a job owing to the extraordinary courses which allow students to practise intensely before graduating.",
        "In conclusion, to solve the problem of unemployment of highly qualified graduates, which is caused mainly by the lack of practical skills due to the theory-oriented programs, it is necessary that education institutions should implement more exercises involving applying theories in practical work."
