        "many individuals find it better to accept a bad position; like, a disatisfactory job or financial problems while the rest of the people opine that improving bad situation will be more preferable.",
        "On the one hand, some people accept the bad situation as they believe to just go with the flow. Whenever any bad situation accure they do not try to take corrective steps even if they know the result would be worse. This is perhaps, they want to learn from a bad situation; Moreover, A person can get success after being a failure or by learning from a bad situation; For example, when a student gets B grade for a literature subject with 69 marks, now when the teacher announces the result and give the answer paper to the students for reference, he finds the total of marks has mistaken, it does 70, with the 70 marks he will get grade A, but this time he did not ask the teacher to make correct, he wants to improve himself so he accept the situation so as his mind can work more than previously. So the outcomes after the bad situation might be a leading factor of being successful.",
        "On the other hand, other people do not accept the bad situation, maybe they are unable to live with the situation they take corrective steps to improve the situation immediately. They believe that if they do not respond to the bad situation it will become worse. Besides, they feel like they have to bear for a long time or lifetime. For example, A person who belongs to a poor family work hard from his childhood and try to become a good business person because he wants to overcome from the shortage of money; consequently, he and his family can come out from that bad situation. So, sometimes it is good to try to correct the situation.",
        "Here, in my opinion, A person should behave as per the situation. To respond on the bad situation or to let it be is totally dependent upon the situation, If there is a need of corrective steps then one should immediately go for otherwise it is better to let it happen and accept the bad situation.",
        "To conclude, An individual has to analyse the whole matter and only then one should decide whether to improve it or to accept it as it is."
