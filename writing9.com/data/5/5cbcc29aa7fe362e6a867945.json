        "In modern world more parents share the life as taking care of children by the father and earning money by the mother. There are some underlying causes of this situation and in my opinion it is a positive development.",
        "Firstly, in today's world there are equal roles for men and women in business life, which triggers more women to work for good jobs with competitive salaries. These women may pursue a successful career while their spouse takes the responsibility of their children and housework. Also, in business qualifications of employees are paramount and if a woman's skills outweighs her husband's, it islogical for them to look for a job for the wife to make a better financial plan for their children, because the chance to find a better occupation is increased by high skills.",
        "Second core reason for this sort of parental roles can be the skills to care for children. It is known that raising a child is an exhaustive task, which require great physical effort and sometimes leads to fatigue. Due to the fact that men have more muscle power than momen, it is more facile for male to look after the children than for female. For example, the father can easily carry his children while displacing from place to place, for instance, from park to home. Furthermore, they will possess sufficient amount of energy to challenge with their kids while playing games such as running competitions or another physical activities. Although men are not skilled for housework sometimes, household appliences help them to cook meals for kids and to succeed other fundamental housework.",
        "In conclusion, there are different reasons for men to take care of their kids while their spouses take the responsibility of working. I think this is a positive development for both men and women."
