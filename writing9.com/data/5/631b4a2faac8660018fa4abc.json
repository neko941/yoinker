Mostly, people choose their own car rather than public transport facilities. For example, a survey conducted by BBC news channel  showed that 60% of individuals choose their own car that travel Rather than public transportation.",
        "On the other hand, some people believe that bicycle is more beneficial as compared to car. Because it does not create pollution in the environment it is an eco-friendly system. The government should make new bicycle tracks in the city for public travelling by bicycle in the city. Bicycle has been also more beneficial for health issues it decreases disease  in the human body and makes the active body. Furthermore, the countryside area public has fewer diseases in the body because they live in a clean environment and they choose bicycle in a short distance as rather than car. For instance, according to the ,study the United Kingdom has cleaned the environment rather than other nations because it makes new bicycle tracks and provides city maps for each person.",
