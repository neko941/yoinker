        "Every household chores produce wastage, which can be recycled for further use. There is a controversy that, a definite amount of people think that the sufficient amounts of waste from home are not being recycled and the government should take required actions.",
        "I agree with the fact that, laws should be imposed on the citizens to recycle their waste products. Firstly, people will be bound to follow the laws and secondly, there should be some fixed procedure for recycling.",
        "It is obvious that, citizens of any country are obliged to follow the rules and regulations of that clime. Moreover, if the government makes the recycling as a legal requirement, people will tend to follow the rule, putting the wastage into a recycle bin everyday, in spite of throwing here and there, as they do their regular works according to the constitution of the nation. For example, scientists have shown that the percentage of the recycling product could be increased by 20%, if there are some strict rules.",
        "On the other hand, there should be some definite system about how the wastage would be collected from the houses and what would be the further process to regenerate it. However, the planned maintenance of these waste products not only will save the environment from pollution, but also will play a vital role in the country economy, as they will be able to use the product again, despite buying a new one. For example, if the plastics are recycled, the soil could be saved from being damaged, as plastics are non-biodegradable. Moreover, they could be used again in other forms.",
        "Finally, according to my opinion, for the sake of economy, as well as the environment, some legal action should be taken by the government to make the people habituated in recycling the wastage, which cannot be done without the help of the laws."
