        "Nowadays, more and more cities have been constructed by the development of economy. Building massive, magnificent buildings is the essential part of this progress. Despite this truth, some people think that the government should spend the money to make schools and hospitals better instead of focusing those sort of buildings.",
        "On the one hand, the investor are trying to make sizeable chunks of their investment in fabricating those luxuriant, impressive buildings. This is not only make the city more modern, but it also made the tourism industry of the city become more developed. So investment on constructing large buildings will be reasonable and important for a city. For instance, Kish-island where you can see modern buildings and shopping centers to which tourists are attracted also lots of money is invested there.",
        "On the other hand, those who oppose constructing these huge architectures for one conurbation highlight that the budget should go to other services that have direct impacts on local citizens on a daily basis such as schools or hospitals. By allocating money into important public sectors, local councils can assure greater access to such services for all members of society while building iconic landmarks superficially impresses tourists only. For instance, if there is an outbreak of deadly diseases or natural catastrophes, the work of many paramedics and health care providers will be what humans suffering from those situations truly need, not large stunning high-rises.",
        "In conclusion, the addition of gigantic, attractive buildings to a city could definitely amaze the rest of the world, but it seems to me that municipal budget should be allocated to medical treatments and educational institutes first."
