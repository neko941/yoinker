This essay will elaborate the reasons behind this choice along with merits and demerits of the self-employment.",

Apart from this, they could built dynamic source of income in their free time. For instance, web-designer can start his own blog website and earn from that too.",
        "However, business is always full of challenges especially includes Risk of money. The business can decline at any time with pre-indication. The covid-19 lockdown is one of prime challenges to be freelancer. Everything had shutdown suddenly.
