        "In the recent times, there has been a significant rise in the criminal activities all around the    world. Despite the fact, that the governments have made strict laws leading to heavy penalties and punishments offenders\u2019 tendency to go against the rules and regulation continues to be on the rise. This essay will discuss why some people continue to commit such offences and what can be done to overcome this soaring concern.",
        "There are a number of reasons why recommitting of crime is gaining popularity. The most significant one is the leniency of punishments. In most countries, laws are not very strict, the punishments are usually very insignificant which makes a person only a little guilty of wrongdoing. In India, for instance, the legal punishment for theft is only $200 which is insufficient in remodeling behaviour of a thief. Besides that, thanks to the modern day jails, wrongdoer are treated like customers, where they are provided with ample amount of resources, giving only a little feel of a punishment. Clearly, there are some rigorous actions that are required for stopping these people from reengaging in unlawful activities. .",
        "There are many measures that can be taken by the judiciary systems to stop the reoffenders. The primary one can be providing jobs to criminals, the primary motive for most crimes is money, by helping them gain an employment there is greater chance that they will lead to a better path in life. Another initiative can be involving them is community work. Just like many western countries, if all nations make it mandatory for criminals to serve in community services before going in the public there is a likelihood that their attitude towards life will change. Therefore, these two measures can be really useful in shaping the mentality of the offender.",
        "From the aforementioned discussion, it is clear that there are many reasons that entice people to recommit the crimes, but if the given measures are taken world can be changed place."
