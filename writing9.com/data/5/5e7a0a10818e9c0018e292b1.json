        "People have different approaches regarding a happy life.Some people believe that happiness depends on the person. While others reckon, there are other aspects which determine the level of happiness. Therefore, ahead of my opinion, both the views will discussed further.",
        "Examining the former view, there are those who say that happiness is self-responsibility. Undoubtedly, money plays a vital role in an individuals life. In the absence of it, life will be miserable because basic amenities are mandatory for each person and they can only be afforded with money. For example, clothes, food and shelter are the three basic necessities without which it will be definitely hard for a person to lead their lifes. Moreover, listening to a favourite song or watching to a favourite television shows and movies make them feel happiness. This, economics success and entertainment makes the fulfilment of people life.",
        "Considering the latter part of the topic, many individuals consider external factors extremely crucial for their joy. Other factors like, job satisfaction, helping poor people, health and family life are equally prominent to determine a person level of happiness. For instance, a doctor doing volunteer work in underdeveloped countries may have very little money but the reward of helping people and doing the job they are good at, brings happiness in itself. In other words, happiness can be found by using skiils the people are trained for and through job satisfaction.",
        "In conclusion, I firmaly believe that money play an indispensable role in proving happiness to mankind but to led a good family,health and skill passion are also vital."
