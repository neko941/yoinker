        "It is an arguable question that whether skilled and knowledgeable people from poor countries should be given chances to work in rich countries or not. This essay agrees with this fact that employees from poor countries should be allowed for jobs in rich countries as they have talents which can be used as a help in development of the country.",
        "The development of a country depends upon how much skilled its employees are. If a working person is having less skills he may take the nation to a better level. However, for best output, the person should be really talented in his work. The knowledge of people working in the country always take it to greater height. For instance, recent researches have shown that America has advanced in technologies because of the fact that they most of scientist are experts.",
        "Poor Countries really hold talented people but due to lack of opportunities they are not able to express them. Greater Talent requires higher wages which are obviously not available in poor countries. That\u2019s why people in these countries look for opportunities which value their knowledge. For example, recent researches have shown that around one third of highly skilled persons in countries having less economy are not satisfied with their wages. So they do not even perform best as per their skill.",
        "In conclusion, jobs should be allowed by rich countries so skilled persons of poor countries as it is benefit of high economic countries and also talent which is being wasted in poor nations will be efficiently utilised if they are paid higher wages"
