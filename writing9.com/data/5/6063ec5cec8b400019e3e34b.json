        "Novels and dramas are a reflection of society in general. What is shown in dramas is similar to what actually happens in our society. In most of many countries today, crime novels and dramas related to crime are becoming common, and individuals are adoring these types of shows and books. In my opinion, this is not a positive development for society as dramas and books can be an effective medium to sway the mindset of the people. In this essay, I will explain my viewpoint with relevant examples.",
        "To begin with, TV shows and books are a great source of entertainment and the favourite past-time of general public. In recent times, series and books related to crime are gaining more and more popularity. For example, the TV series named Prison break has become the most popular in the U.S on 2014. The series plots about a main actor planned to escape the prison. The primary reason for this is they involve such stories or characters which influrence the audience. Moreover, people start relate their life to this types of entertainments. Crime novels and books involve violence, robbery and murder, which people will think refresh them after a long at work.",
        "However, offence related a books or series contain content which is restrictly targeted at the select audience. This types of show cannot be watched with entire family. Also some people may inspired by such show and act out the same in their life.",
        "In conclusion, in my perspective, production houses and writers should create such type of stories which have a beneficial effect on society. They need to understand their work influence the masses and prevents all the bad behaviour of actors that people can be imitated by watching or reading crime's book."
