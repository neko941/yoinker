        "Cities are considered as places of opportunities of a more convenient life, but there are a multitude of risks which the immigrants are facing. I believe that governments would have solutions to improve the life in large metropolises.",
        "There are some negative impact on who hope to migrate to a large cities. On top of that, the overwhelming expense is main problem for those. Citizens of cities have to pay for their living much higher than it is in a small town or village such as the cost of education, treatmen, accomudation, transport and even food. Another issue, those are threatened by a range of serious environmental problems which affected their health. For instance , the air pollution is at an alarming due to emission from traffic, factories. It produces the sicknesses relate to lung and make the metropolises less suitable for children to grow up. Furthermore, municipal life is full of competition and it makes people\u2019s life depressed. Some has to compete to get in a public car, wait several hours in the traffic jam and fight really hard to get a decent job. As a result, city life can be unhealthy and stressful.",
        "To overcome some major drawbacks of living in cities, the governments should take to tackle these problems. Firstly, they  should control the prices of the daily commodities and build more high rising buildings to cut down the house rent. Secondly, the governments may bring in laws to ban vehicles in cities center and should introduce more public transportation with better facilities to reduce traffic jam. A third option would be movie industry and jobs to rural areas to diminish the pressure on the large metropolises.",
        "In conclusion, the governments should take care to people\u2019 living standard and make sure the rural areas have sufficient job for the residents here."
