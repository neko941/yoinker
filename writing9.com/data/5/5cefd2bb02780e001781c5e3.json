        "Various indivisuals provide private data to the companies, for accessing the softwares they require.Although security is a major disadvantage in providing the data, but the ease of getting things done through applications and staying in touch with various people through social apps are major advantages.This essay will explain how the advantages are very important to survive in this tehnical world and how the disadvantage which is mainly security is not a very valid one.",
        "Softwares are everywhere in today's world,and the reason behind the same is that they are needed by majority of people to carry on with basic tasks of their lives.Applications are a major luxury for people in the current times and with the advent of internet everything has become so simple and easy to do.For instance, nowadays people pay their bills,book their flights and trains through softwares.Furthermore, apps help people to stay connected with each other, no matter where they are in the world.Staying connected with friends and family brings a sense of comfort and joy in people and they do not feel lonely or isolated.The social media apps such as facebook and instagram are the perfect examples for this.",
        "Though these softwares carry the potential to cause a security threat on the lives of people, but it is a very rare situation.If people are careful enough to understand that they are sharing the information with the authenticated softwares only, then the chances of cyber crimes reduce steeply.Its important that people do not jeopardise their security by providing information without checking the legal rights that a particular software carries.Generally, the cyber security rules for the popular applications are very strong and they are under the eyes of cyber authorities.For instance,in the past year a major check on facebook was made to make sure that they are not misusing the personal data of people.",
        "In conclusion,softwares are needed to carry on with the simple tasks of lives smoothly and staying in touch with the loved ones,and we will have to give up data for the softwares to work.But, if the authentication of such softwares are checked before sharing data and only the popular softwares are used, then chances of crimes are steeply reduced."
