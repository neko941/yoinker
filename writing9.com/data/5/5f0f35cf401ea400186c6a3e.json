        "The trend of giving birth to the child at the early age is changing now a day. Parents are willing to produce child, at much later age as compared to the past. Their are many factors which support this approach, and their merits of this trend engulf the demerits.",
        "To begin with, there are two main reasons, why the parents wants to give birth to the child in their late twenties or early thirties. Firstly, the demands of the 21st century are ever increasing which is the main reason, for instance, every couple has certain goals in their life which they want to achieve in their early age, like buying a car, having vacation trips, having a beautiful house. The parents wants to fulfill these needs before pursuing the child as they want to give good quality life to their young ones. Secondly, the gaurdian want to save finance for their, yet to be born child, as todays expense are far greater than the past. Therefore, these are reasons why the gaurdian reproduce childrens at the later stage of life.",
        "The trend of having children at the later stage of lfe is gaining the momentum, as it has merits over the demerits. Firstly, parents are able to give more time to their children as they are much settled in their career, so running behind a job to fulfill their needs is not an issue, as it is in early age of their career. Secondly, the gaurdian are well equipped with the required money by which they can do, proper upbringing of their child, which might not be possible for the newly married couple. Thirdly, as their is saying that, people become more mature with time, so parents who produce child at the later age are more mature to takecare of their child. Thus, these are the pros which engulf the cons of having child in their late twenties or early thirties.",
        "To conclude, having child down the line has many benefits like, proper upbringing can be done for their childrens, as parents have required money as well as time and they are much muture to deal with the child at the later age."
