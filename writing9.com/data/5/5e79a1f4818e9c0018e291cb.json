        "Since the use of mobile become common worldwide, it is very usual to see people using it for different purposes. It is also become debatable topic for today's parents whether they should allow children to use mobile phones or not. I, however, believe that instead of giving mobile parents should teach their loved ones how to manage time as well as promote outdoor games for their Holistic development.",
        "To begin with, the supporters of mobile phones argues that these gadgets have benefit in learning things at fast pace and also help them to work effectively in their studies. First of all, this type of gadgets are equipped with various ftures such as pictures and videos visuals that help them to understand various aspect easily for example, children learn and grasp thing with ease as they see videos on various platform in mobile gadgets. Moreover, early understanding of such technology helps them in future studies. To illustrate, as children are already started to use it at an early age help them to perform well in the academic field as they have to submit assignment and other tasks.",
        "On the other side, the proponents of this Motif claim that this technology could destroy the childhood of every child. In the age of 5-10, parents must encourage their child to play outdoor activities and games which helps them to increase their friend circle and understand various social responsibility. Also, this helps to maintain physical health. To cite an example, when a child goes out to play they socialize with other children and do some fun activities that help them in both physical and mental development.",
        "In conclusion, it can be said that mobile phones have important in everyone life, but providing it at an early age is not wise. It deprived children of a varis crucial aspect of their childhood and in my view, parents should allow children to use mobile."
