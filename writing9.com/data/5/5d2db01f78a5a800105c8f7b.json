        "The university is a citadel of learning as well as an embodiment of knowledge. Thus, learners should decide what they want to learn. In the same vein, people should have total control in the choice of course they want to major in. Others, opined otherwise, they suggest that education seekers should partake in technology related courses as this have better future outcome. This essay would vividly elucidate both sides of the divide, before a reasoned conclusion reached.",
        "On one hand, people attending the university should pick the course they want to study, this is  because they would be more interested in that line of education. To simplify further, if a student identifies with a line of study, he follows it passionately. For an instance, when I wanted to enroll into the university, my country offered me a scholarship in system engineering because they wanted to build a space ship then, in spite of that, I accepted the scheme but few years later I was withdrawn in my second year in that university because I had no interest in engineering. Also, I failed all my core departmental subjects. Hence, it is undoubtedly important that, Interest should come first when choosing a career irrespective of the future advantage that particular field has.",
        "Seekers of knowledge, on the other hand, should consider learning information in computer engineering in their various institution. In doing so, they can be relevant in future. To put it another way, because of the advancement in technology and science some courses down the line will be of no use as such they will face out, any expert in such field will be of no good to himself neither, to the country at large. For illustration, the united nation labour congress released the 2017, official gazette which reports that some professionals in business and sociology will face out of the economy of the Uk and USA thus people should disengage themselves from studying such course in the university or in the colleges. It also state that, the top 10 employers of labour will require individuals from science related field. Moreover, what is the benefit of a field if it has no relevance after a few years even if one  is passionate about such course.",
        "To conclude, after analyzing both school of thought, I am of the opinion that although, a seeker of information should consider a field that have future relevance. Conversely, one should consider is interest first, as this will help to fuel the dying zeal when the challenges of that subject seems overwhelming or if one is not making enough remuneration from it."
