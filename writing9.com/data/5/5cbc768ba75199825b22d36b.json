        "Back in the days, the word violence seems like a taboo word to people, however, nowadays, people appear to be indifferent about the crime that has been circulating around the society. Recent studies showed that individuals who constantly watches violent movies and news about crime shown in the television has more crime records than those who doesn't. I am strongly agreed that violent shows that appeared in television is the prominent cause of violence in the country.",
        "Beginning of the World War days, the mankind\u2019s' opinion on entertainment changed drastically. They thought that suffering and impact of the war should be known by all over the world in order to give awareness to society on the hardships that people face during war. Nevertheless, some people think it otherwise. Shockingly, they think that it is some sort of entertainment where people can relieve stress. What makes it even worse, the young ones idolised TV personality in those brutal shows such as WEE and Smackdown where people are paid to hit each other. Therefore, young generation begins to follow their footsteps by terrorizing the public as it is a cool trend for them.",
        "Moreover, some assume that taking revenge and murdering people will make them famous. There were many proofs that psychopathic murderers kill or threat people so that they can appear in television screen. Ironically, seeing themselves appear in the screen makes them feel important. It doesn't matter to them whether people hate them or not, if the media giving attention to them. This may lead others to follow these criminals' footsteps to grab attention media's attention making them a 'star'.",
        "In conclusion, media portrays violence to get fame and popularity has leads to more crimes in the society. The media industry should stop publicising these types of shows to curb the crime happening in the country."
