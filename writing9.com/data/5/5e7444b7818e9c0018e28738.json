        "Many people aspire to start their own business instead of working in a captive environment. The foremost reason for this preference is the, liberty, which people get by working independently. Though this gives the impression to have benefits, but, it has his own drawbacks.",
        "On the one hand, working independently allows the individual not to be bound by the regulations and be compliant with the terms of the company. Many individuals who are employed in a company are answerable to their superior which occasionally makes uncomfortable. Not every individual appreciates of having someone to dictate the terms and adhere policies. subsequently, they are buried under the rules and regulations of the organization.",
        "On the other hand, being self-employed requires a great deal of skills and boundless professional abilities to achieve the goal. Primarily, it includes large investment to commence, which not only involves risks with no guarantee of profit. Consequently, with no profit, individual must bear all the losses and consequences arise from being self-employed. For example, Sebastian, founder of WeWork startup, invested a vast amount of money to kick start his business which eventually turned to be a bad asset. Later, this led to the closure of the company and going into bankruptcy.",
        "In conclusion, working independently may provide and owning a brand, but not every individual makes the right decision and stick to their goals."
