        "It is widely believed that there is no purpose of advertisements. And consumers just buy products that meet their needs. I totally disagree with this statement. According to me, I believe that advertisements provide information about the new upcoming products. In the next paragraphs I shall explain how advertisements at times help to expand choices.",
        "First of all, advertisements benefit consumers to see the new model of brands, they help to consider variety of products available in the market at affordable prices. For instance, advertisements helped me to buy my current phone by encouraging me with their brilliant advertisements that showed a very attracting prices. Similarly, through advertisements, people buy multi products.",
        "Second of all, advertisements are beneficial for both sellers and consumers. As a result of advertising, sellers promote their goods and services, and consumers can know the information of products including prices.  Moreover, they help consumers to make better decisions by seeing different products and prices. They also help businesses to grow and get attention.",
        "Although advertisements could be lies sometimes, they help to create awareness to see all kind of advertisements so that consumers can distinguish between the truth and lies. Also to save money through offers that some advertisements deliver.",
        "In conclusion, some companies lie about their advertisements. But I completely disagree that advertisements do not serve people with their needs. Needless to say that there are good and bad advertisements. But still they play an important role in the community by spreading awareness amongst consumers about products."
