This leads to a child's vision to go down and moreover the child can lose eat and sleep with these games. A further of this problem may be that computer games also have a significant impact on the results and the learning process of kids. For illustrations, because the game is like a stimulant, it is inevitable that children neglect to learn. As a result, children can feel bored whenever they see books and want to drop out of school. This leads to a downward learning result and the amount of knowledge in the classroom is zero.",

Firstly, parents should regularly take children outside to play with their friends and encourage children to play folk games rather than computer games. Secondly, parents should care more about their children, always ask about their children's learning situation, listen and share with them to help them be more happy and comfortable in their learning as well as development physiological mind of children.",

In addition, parents also need to have appropriate solutions for games that children enjoy such as listening, sharing, chatting with children. Therefore reducing the harm that computer games bring."
