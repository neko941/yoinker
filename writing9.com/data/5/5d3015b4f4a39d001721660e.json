        "In the modern era, stress is something that everyone experiences due to various reasons.It has become a national and an international concern in the society and large sums of money is being spent on research by many organisations and governments to tackle it.In this essay, I will discuss about the different sources and the ways in which stress can be tackled.",
        "Many of the people from the younger generation blame academic responsibilities primarily for the stress they experience. When students are presented with exams one after the other, they tend to get pressurized, which can potentially affect their academic performance thereby resulting in more stress than before. One way to tackle this would be to have continuous assessments in place rather than having one major examination which can certainly reduce the burden off the shoulders of students. Another effective method would be to introduce counselling services, free of charge to students where open discussions could take place between the individual and the counsellor. At present, the latter strategy is increasingly being implemented in many universities and high schools",
        "On the other hand,  people from the older generation often blame financial responsibilities as their primary source of stress. The responsibility to provide for their families and to pay bills and tax take a heavy toll on their lives. They are forced to work for long hours with very few holidays to make ends meet. This could put them under a tremendous amount of stress. In this case, I believe that it is the responsibility of the government to help them alleviate their stress. One way in which government could help is to provide interest free loans to such people. In addition, the minimum pay of an individual could be raised by a few dollars too.",
        "Latest research suggests that healthy food and exercise can contribute in reducing stress. Lately, more people have been taking up relaxation techniques such as yoga which clearly has a positive impact on both the mental and physical health thereby helping individuals alleviate stress.",
        "In conclusion, stress is something that affects every individual on a daily basis but excess amounts of it can have considerable consequences. I strongly believe that if the measures described above are implemented at a certain level, the stress an individual experiences can definitely be reduced."
