        "From time to time, people tend to move around from one place to another, many choose to go to the urban area for several reasons, and especially the young ones prefer to move away from rural area into cities. Certainly, cities have better to offer in all aspect, to mention a few, job opportunities, varsities and more facilities.  However, migrations as such, have left behind the elders and often some being forget, creating social issues and these have be look into seriously.",
        "One of the issues that arise, is that the growth of the population in the city has increased exponentially, leading to overcrowding. Everywhere in the city is loaded with people, this causes congestion and massive traffic jam especially at peak hours, usually before the beginning of office hours and school. In turn, more budget will be allocated to accommodate the surge of need in the city, more facilities and public infrastructure will be built, this helps to develop the city further, however, the suburban will indefinitely left behind, widen the economy gap between these two. Nevertheless, these can be mitigated, not by the people but government intervention and measure.",
        "Firstly, the government could help to improve the overpopulated area in the city by mean of decongestion. This can be achieved by encouraging corporations to move their offices to the rural area; incentives in the means of tax reduction can be given for those who are willing to relocate. Additionally, rental rate in these places are also much cheaper than the city. Likewise, university and educational centres can also be built with better facilities as more empty lands are available in such area. This then promote young people to more to suburban who wish to pursue further and also helps the rural area to flourish in term of cash flow as more demand for food and accommodation.",
        "In conclusion, government plays a vital role in city and rural area planning and development, as people migration will be decided by whether the need for betterment in terms of careers, literacy and lifestyle can be reach. A proper blueprint of development will be able to ensure relatively similar development in both suburban and city."
