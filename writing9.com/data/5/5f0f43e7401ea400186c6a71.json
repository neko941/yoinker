        "People have different views about whether government should invest in more fun on the development of faster public transportation or on more urgent issues such as poverty and health care.  This essay will discuss both views and provide my personal insight.",
        "To begin with the positives of innovation of the faster transportation, It can improve the quality of people\u2019s lives. In modern society, everything has changed fast and conveniently. Time is considered as one of the most valuable things in life by majority of people. By reducing the commuting time, modern people do not have to feel stress caused by traffic hour which is irritating and they can do something else during the time rather than being stuck in the traffic. It will definitely be what today\u2019s people want the most.",
        "Meanwhile, some critics assert that there are more urgent issues that need to be dealt with than the traffic. I believe that some of the problems occurring in somewhere in the society is directly related to people\u2019s lives such as diseases, health care, poverty and environmental problems. These issues should be the priority over the innovation of the technology as it is highly likely to affect the health and survivals. Therefore, I strongly think that nothing can be put before this primary issue.",
        "In conclusion, despite the enormous benefits that result from the development of the transportation, all the things that are connected to people\u2019s lives and health should be prioritized over than any issues."
