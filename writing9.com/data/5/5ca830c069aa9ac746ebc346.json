        "Travelling is considered by some of the people to become necessary for learn about other nations, while others believe that the effective method to learn about countries are depends on TV and internet. Both perspectives have merits and drawbacks. However, from my point of view, I think that travel is more significant for a person to well understand about a country compare to use the information from TV and internet.",
        "First and foremost, traveling provide a best opportunity for people to understand the culture of that country by his or herself. By visit all the famous places in that county, a traveler can fully understand how is the local people's daily life. Another than that, it is also able to try the delicious local food by ourselves. On the other hand, some of the people support the opinion that TV and internat allow ones to better understand about a nation. Many informations and resources that are provide from TV and internet is useful for traveler to prepare for the next destination where he or she wants to travel for.",
        "Furthermore, it is commonly believed that using most of the resources and information that come from TV and internet are the best way to start a new journey as all the informations are fully explain and it is very detail. Nevertheless, I believe that travel is still the effective way to find out more interesting fact about a country. For instance, some enthusiastic local people will teach the traveler their local language or even give something that are special in their country to traveler as a gift. Owing to this, ones can fully understand about the country through their personally feel and thinking.",
        "In the conclusion, these two perspectives have their own benefits on learning about a country as these two methods provide good ways for us to well understand about a country. However, I personally think that travel is the good method as ones can feel and try something about the country by his or her own."
