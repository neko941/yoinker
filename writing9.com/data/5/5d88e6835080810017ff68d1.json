        "Many big companies use sports to promote their own product. Branding sports and sportsperson can be beneficial as it brings glamour and money. However, in my opinion, there are various disadvantages to this approach as sports spirit is getting lost in the process of branding itself.On the one hand, having big companies as brand ambassadors for various sports have a prominent effect on the sports. For instance, MGF tyres sponsored hockey during the last world cup which brought a lot of money and that money was used to raise the standards of the hockey team, giving them good facilities, good and durable equipment, proving them motivation to perform better. Adding to this, in order to advertise themselves, they advertise the sport on the whole. Many sports that were lost in shadow for many years gets limelight, by advertisements it reaches out to more people who have interest in them and want to participate and make their country proud.On the other hand, the showy glamour and sponsorship have more disadvantages on the longer run. Many sports are caught up in the branding war, loosing the true meaning of sports. Taking an example of a popular sport, Cricket; with the introduction of IPL, cricket is now merely a branding stunt where various big brands invest money and buy the players to promote their goods. The players are fighting against their own team as a whole and moreover, cricket has lost its spirit as a sport.In the end, I believe that sponsorship is required for a sport to rise and reach out to common people but too much allurement and advertisement have overshadowed the true meaning of many sports and the process have made the sportsmanship spirit of the players to be lost."
