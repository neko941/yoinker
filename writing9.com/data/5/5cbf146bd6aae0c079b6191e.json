        "Mothers and fathers motivate their kids to work on some days throughout the week. This essay will analyze the benefits and drawbacks of this trend.",
        "There are many positive aspects of pushing children into employment from a young age. Firstly, they get to gain work experience and learn basic qualities like respect, and how to value money. This is because, a job usually starts in set business hours. Furthermore, when someone earns their money for the first time, it gives them insight on how to save and spend it. For example, when i was 12 i worked at KFC, it taught me to always be on time, because at first i was not punctual, as well as, it also taught me to respect my elders and how to be financially independent. Overall, this trend is advantageous.",
        "Despite the many benefits, there are also drawbacks. Many believe that a childs only job is to have fun. Therefore, any alteration in this ideology , like work, is considered child labour. The reason for this is that, kids cannot make their own decisions, so it is seen as against their will. In addition to this, in order for under 18's to be happy they should lead carefree lives, ridden of the burden of responsibility and finances, work has been proven to be detrimental to one's mental health. To illustrate, a study published in 1990 on the Childrens Work Commitee showed that 99% of children who worked under the age of 12 were morbidly depressed.",
        "In conclusion, there are many pro's and con's of youngster employment. In the future i hope that they are given the choice of whether or not they want to work."
