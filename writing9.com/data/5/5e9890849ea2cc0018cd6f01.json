        "Living in a healthy lifestyle is a vital need for every one. To stay fit and fine for that, a few people give more preference to join the gyms and health clubs. However, other perceive that following persistent everyday workouts are enough to keep our immunity strong and healthy. Therefore, I would discuss both aspects of the statement and the later with my own opinion.",
        "",
        "Now a days their are number of sports which are provided in the health clubs, people can choose whichever sport they want to do to make themself fit and healthy, especially when all these activities comes under experts supervision or well trained coaches. Moreover, they can get free suggestions regarding their health and diet from the trainers, but only after paying good amount of money for membership card. These kind of facilities or workouts only possible for the person, who agree to follow their instructions strictly, who do not feel any difficulty to chang their daily routine or eating habits and  one can able to pay for all charges.",
        "",
        "On the opposing side , everyday activities are well sufficient to keep the person healthy by following certain activity like climbing stairs instead of using elevator. If the person maintain these routines reluctantly then,  they do not need to spend their money on health clubs. These activities are also echofriendly like if they give more importance to walking for short distance work rather than using a vehicle, by this we can alleviate air and noise pollution to some extend. In addition, jogging in the park provid fresh air and beautiful nature view and to the other side, running on treadmills only comes with smell of sweat.",
        "",
        "To sum up above arguments, everyday activities are more affordable beacuse by following them the person can save his time, money and environment too."
