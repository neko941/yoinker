        "Nowadays, in many parts of the world, the crime rate has rose significantly among the teenagers. There are some possible causes for this increase, which I will discuss and suggest solution.",
        "First of all, statistics show that there has been an increase in violent, rubber even murder crimes among younger people. The main reason for this rise is that nowadays they are growing with lack of attention of their parents as well as teachers. Furthermore, children are not getting enough social knowledge at their school, so they don\u2019t know what is right what is wrong.",
        "Secondly, actions with robber and murder are becoming popular amongst youth. It happens because of they watch these kinds of movies and try to do what they have seen there. Moreover, films have an important influence on younger generation who influenced both by what they watch and hear.",
        "However, there is solution to tackle these problems. Parents must find ways to spend more time with their children.They should come up with such activities to attract them. For instance, playing together, walking, doing homework, going to sports classes. And the most important thing is to always tell them that they are needed and important in their life. Then they will feel responsibility for themselves and their family. As a result, they will be far away from such problems and troubles.",
        "IN conclusion, it may be true that there are some probable reasons for growing offence level, i believe if parents pay more attention to their children and control their leisure time, observe what they do, then the crime rate will decrease."
