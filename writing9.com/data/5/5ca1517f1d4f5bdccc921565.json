        "Nowadays, there is an upward trend in the number of students who opt to pursuit their studies oversea. While there are several advantages for those who do this, there are also some possible disadvantages.",
        "On the one hand, studying abroad brings benefits in some certain aspects. Firstly, it is the good way for them to meet develop education. Not only are teachers and tutors good/ highly qualified but study environment and modern equipment are also excellent, so students can do their best to achieve more successful in their studies. Secondly, they have many opportunities to discover and learn something new. They have chances to meet people from different countries and can widen their social networks. These may broaden their knowledge  of people and cultures which they have never known before if they have just stayed in their local regions.",
        "On the other hand, the disadvantages of studying at colleges and universities abroad cannot be overlooked. A negative aspect of this option is that students have to face culture shock \u2013 an issue that those who study abroad must overcome if they want to develop their career here. Overseas students often find not only different  customs and values but alsothe language barrier challenging, and it takes a long period of  time to adapt to life around them. Another problem faced by students who decide to study in a foreign country is homesickness. Living alone in an unfamiliar country without their family members and relatives by their side, these students often feel insecure and helpless . This mood is likely to affect their attitudes and working methods, and their productivities will be decreased.",
        "In conclusion, it seems to me that there are both benefits and drawbacks for students who choose to further their studies in a foreign country."
