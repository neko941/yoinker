        "Food is one of most crucial requirement for human beings. Too much intake of junk food results in various health issues in humans. I completely accord that fast food should be taken as a taxable item as it spreads lot of diseases, if consumed excessively.",
        "To embark on, in the past era, there was only one source of income from the male member of the family, so women were used to prepare meals and thought it as the core responsibility of herself, which in turn help other family members to enjoy home made food. In addition, there was a good rate of healthy people. However, due to dual earnings of both men and women these days, the concept of preparing meals at home has been cut off up-to large extent due to the busy schedule . It has been observed that people prefer to have fast food rather than cultural food as it is easily available and does not require much efforts and cost. These individual are not aware that this has an adverse effect on their health, hence if more tax could be apply by Government, this junk food can be avoided effectively. This, in turn will make the nation and people healthy and wealthy.",
        "Furthermore, we are the teachers or followers for the upcoming generation, as a result, if we ourselves become health conscious, it would help next generation to be the same. People might opt for junk food once in a blue moon for a change, but should not make it as a routine, as it impacts their health badly by causing lot of diseases such as obesity, food poisoning and reduces immunity of an individual.",
        "To conclude, there is a need of raising awareness amongst people about the demerits of junk food and applying more tax on such food items to make our citizens healthy."
