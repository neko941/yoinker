        "In every issue in the society, There are bound to be divergent views. There is a growing trend on youngesters having cell phones which has resulted to arugement amongst people. In my view, I completely agree that juveniles should have access to mobile telephone owinig to the fact that it helps the young child to connect to people when in distress and emegency.",
        "Firstly, an adolescent who owes a cellular phone will have feeling of satisfaction within. as well as their parents too. This is because, when in danger, a saviour is just bottons away and with the high rate of crime around the world thesedays, it is a necessity far young children to owe a handset. For instance, a research carried out by sociology students at the University of Benin,Nigeria in March 2018, revealed that 12 per cent of youngsters who were vitims of rape and murder were children who were helpless and have no access to phone.",
        "Another point to consider, it makes communication easier and it is finanicially wise to owe a phone. This means that instead of using a payphone to pass a very important message to a person; where one has to pay some certain amount money depending on how much time it takes to convey the message, which seems to be more expensive than using mobile telephone. Also it is very convenient for parents especiall to call their youngsters instead of inconvenencing another person just to get through to them.",
        "In conclusion, evidently from the points outlined, it is explicit that youth should have access or owe a mobile phone because it saves time and money, also makes communication easier."
