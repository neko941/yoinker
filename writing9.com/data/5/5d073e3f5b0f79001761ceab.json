        "Some people is of the opinion that parents have an important role to play in the development of children. Whereas others opine that friends and environmental factors such as television have a major role to play in children development. This essay seeks to discuss both views and my opinion will be given.",
        "Charity they say begins at home. In the home children should be closely monitored because development begins at an early stage. For instance, morals can be imbibed in children by telling them the essence of greets at different times,teaching them table manners at a younger stage, values and family traditions are also instilled in these children. Furthermore, parents should be in a position to decide needful activies which can also aid proper development such as, engaging in physical exercise, helping in gardening work in the house, studying etc",
        "Back in they days, so many families have a particular tradition of screening friends who visit their children. This is mostly done by the grandparents because most times their parents are busy with office work. Friends that have the same moral upbringing are accepted by the entire family. This is because interaction with friends have a major role to play in a childs life. Also, environmental factor such as television contributes to a child\u2019s development. For example, a child who is always watching violent programs on television will definitely become violent to people. Watching educating and entertaining programs will affect a childs life positively.",
        "In summary, I am of the opinion that a childs development and upbringing should be the sole responsibility of the parents. Parents must monitor duely friends their children keep and put a restriction to channels which are unhealthy for the children\u2019s development."
