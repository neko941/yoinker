        "It is argued by some people that the power of advertising have a higher influence in sales than the real needed of people. I agree with this, because the neoliberal system, which exists in the majority of countries, can survive if individuals buy goods that are not essential. In my opinion, whether society buy only things of primary needed is likely that the economy would suffer a negative impact. \r\rIn the world commonly is understood as a products of primary needed which allow us survive, such as the food, a few clothes or artefacts that give us segurity. Today, there are a variety of all of them, and if we buy the most economist product probably could live quite well. However, when a person go to the shopping, their purshase is not only influenced by their needed, rather is impacted by publicity which give us an identity. \r\rNowadays, the advertisement is crucial for the economy, therefore companies invest several amount of money in publicity which makes to people believe that need one product. Actually, staditics show higher sales in goods that are not so necessary such as the last editon of smartphones, fast fashion or big televisions. In my opinion, this happen for the power of advertising, which have the message that if you have those things will be more accepted. \r\rIn conclusion, as we live in an epoch where there are a massive consumism is obviously that the higher sales will be for the work of advertisement and not for the fact that a person need something. Every day people want the most popular products, which say us if you have it will be cool."
