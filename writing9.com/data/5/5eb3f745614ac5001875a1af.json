        "Nowadays government is investing money in the arts. Although I agree that spending money in public services is important, it does not mean that spending money in art is a waste of money.",
        "Art has become more popular in developed countries. Most of the developed countries give importance to art they invest lots of money. Art is important to know about the culture through the arts. For example, people are interested in art galleries. Although most of the art galleries charge an entrance fee people still visit them and some of them buy the paintings and all those money will go for public funding in some countries. So I think that investing money in art is not waste of money. Government also invests money in public services.",
        "There are public services like health care, public transportation, education etc. government should invest money in public services as well. As education is very important for future generations and growth of the economy. For example, the poverty rate is high in some countries, so government should provide the services like free education for the poor. In addition to that, I think government should spend on the health care like providing the highest  quality equipments. Which helps in the crisis like COVID- 19.",
        "To conclude, Although providing the funds for public services is most important, providing funds for art is not waste of money both are needed for a country\u2019s development."
