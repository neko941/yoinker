        "Generally, around the world, population is increasing continuously, with some places experiencing exponential increase, in their population. Consequently, this requires that new homes be built, to accommodate the growing population. Unfortunately, only the countryside offers the space, needed for this. However, some people feel that, the protection of the countryside is more important than building new homes, which, from my point of view, is reasonable. Building of new homes, would lead to the destruction of some natural habitats, that are beneficial to man, as well as encourage deforestation, which ultimately, would contribute to global warming. This essay, would discuss these reasons, in detail.",
        "The countryside is mostly a serene environment, made up of trees, different animal species, streams as well as other things, that make up the natural ecosystem. Constructing homes in these areas, would lead to the destruction of the natural ecosystem, which in turn, causes the displacement of these animal species, from their natural habitat and ultimately, death.",
        "Furthermore, siting homes at the countryside, would encourage deforestation, a phenomenon, highly discouraged, all over the world. This is simply because, felling of trees, contributes to global warming, something the world is seriously concerned about.",
        "Ultimately, the countryside loses its serenity, when new homes are built there, as these homes, will attract urbanization, to these areas. The Emene area of Enugu State, Nigeria, a previously calm and serene area, is an example of a countryside, that has lost its serenity, as a result of new homes construction.",
        "In conclusion, man depends largely on the ecosystem for survival and as such, must make every effort, to protect this ecosystem, instead of destroying them, to build homes."
