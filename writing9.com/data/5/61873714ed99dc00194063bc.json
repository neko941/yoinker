        "In today's modern era, nobody can imagine life without the internet. The internet totally changed our lifestyle. All humans are dependent on computers. This makes our life easier. I am partially agreed to the given notion. In my perspective, it has more advantages then disadvantages. In the following, paragraphs we will discuss in detail.",
        "At the first glance, through  social sites everyone feels connected. To explain it, the majority of people have their own social account where they can upload their daily routine tasks such as images or videos. For example, if someone is living abroad, he or she can talk to their parents through video calls on Whatsapp or via other applications. Thus, they feel they are talking with them as face to face. In addition to it, the internet is a great source of knowledge. To illustrate it, students can find study materials by surfing the internet at any time or from any corner of the world. Furthermore, it provides not only information, it is also very useful for entertainment like, playing video games or watching movies or doing shopping.",
        "Although having beneficial factors, it also has some demerits. Firstly, adults and children are using it all day as they addicted to it. Which is not good for their health. Moreover, no doubt they learn many things from the internet but from the long ,use they develop health issues i.e. obesity, weak eyesight and slow brain and so on. Another most important negative point is false information. Sometimes, users put wrong information on internet that may cause  fraud or misleading to others.",
        "In  conclusion, the internet is a wider platform where you can find any information, play games, video calls, online shopping or chat at very low rates. But be careful of false information and parents should limit the time for their children and keep an eye on their search history to avoid any loss."
