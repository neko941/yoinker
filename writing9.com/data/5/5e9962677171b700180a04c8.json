For example, women spend maximum of their money in buying household product; whereas, men prefer to put their earning in their personal grooming. Furthermore, society is also an unit. Few mass get experience things, because they think having costly items improve their society symbol. Moreover, advertisements are also considered as one of the point. What clans watch on television they get attracted and want to try that fruit.",
