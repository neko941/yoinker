        "It is believed by some that the government must be responsible to facilitate the people with education free of cost at all levels. I completely agree with this statement because education is a basic right of human beings and it will enhance the literacy rate of the country.",
        "To begin with, education is becoming an indispensable requirement for the youngsters to compete with the advance market. Now, qualification enlists on the top among the necessities of any individual. Many bright students couldn\u2019t complete their education due to financial constraints or high fee structure imposed by educational institutions. Without a proper degree, many people compelled to live beneath the life of poverty. For instance, in Finland education is declared by the Government as the right of human being and they made it accessible free of cost for their citizens.",
        "Moreover, the literacy rate of many countries is below the average rate where education is expensive and as a result, industrialists end up finding suitable candidates for the position. The literacy rate of the country has been proved an effective remedy to capture the global market. Countries with a high literacy rate have a profound impact on maintaining the growth of the country. Fewer crimes committed by educated people in the countries promoting higher studies.",
        "To cope up with this topic, it has been believed by some that education from basic to advance level must be free. As it will provide the more chance for students to get an education as it is their right while it will also enhance the literacy rate of the country."
