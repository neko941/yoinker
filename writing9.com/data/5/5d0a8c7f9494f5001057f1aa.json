        "Some countries provide single sex education institutions while in other countries both uni sex and combine schools co-exist. However, it depends on parents and students which one they prefer. This essay will illustrate the associated factors of both the above mentioned systems.",
        "As per the customs of some regions they believe in split education based on religious view. Some people advocates that this method of schooling will act as a barrier of mind distraction to opposite gender and allow children to concentrate on studies. I personally opine that not being able to cope and study in synergy the outcome could be the opposite.  This might lead them into wrong personal relationships since they have limited acquaintance with the other gender.",
        "Children studying in duel schools come up with better perspectives. Allowing them the opportunity to interact and compete strengthen their intellectually. It boost their potential to strive in the toughest situation.  Girls, additionally, get the chance to select subjects from a plethora of options. On the contrary,  those studying in girls school study pre-selected subjects. Subjects meant only for females such as cookery, history and arts.",
        "A combined learning system allows exchange of ideas and knowledge in a broader spectrum. Whereas on the other way round this somehow remains confined within a certain boundary.  For instance, males take interest on sports while girls on arts. If the knowledge is shared they get to know both the fields.",
        "Hence the conclusion can not be avoided that, it a better and progressive idea that girls and boys share same schools. This not only proved to be beneficial during school life but also add value in the long run."
