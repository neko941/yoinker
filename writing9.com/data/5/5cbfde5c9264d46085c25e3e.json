        "It is true that music plays an important role in our life especially traditional music which expresses our culture, costumes and values. I would argue that traditional music plays more crucial role than commercial music.",
        "Music is a vital part of our life. It accompanies with most of us throughout our life as it is a way of expressing our feelings as well as emotions. Some people consider music as a way to escape from their pain, to heal their mind, their body and their spirit. In addition, music is a source of entertainment which allows people to reduce stress and gives people relief. As children, people are taught to sing a song as a mean of learning a language or form of entertainment. As a result, some songs become their favorites and be part of their lives, stick with their own memories or event.",
        "In my opinion, traditional music is more valued over the international music as it expresses the tradition, culture or the history of a country. By contrast, international music is considered as a commercial products which are marketed and sold by business people. Traditional music also bring education values which reminds young generations of their origin. For instance, folk music always give us a chance to feel the family bond, mother bond etc.",
        "In conclusion, music plays an important part of human life. While international music are more popular in terms of commercial perspectives, traditional music gives us chance to come back old days with traditional values."
