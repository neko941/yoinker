        "Every country has its traditions and culture that they follow. In recent times, people are interested in exploring the whole world. In such cases, when they visit different countries, they have to follow respective culture and tradition accordingly. In my opinion, visitors should be welcomed by the tourist country despite of their local customs or traditions being followed.",
        "There are few countries that are very sentimental about their traditions and local behaviour like Afghanisthan, India etc. There are also countries that do not feel particular about the behaviour or customs followed by the visitors. When people visit countries that have stricit traditions to follow, the visitors should be well aware of their way of living and custom that is followed in the country that they are planning to visit. By following the tradition or custom of respective country can be benificial to the visitor itself. The local people may get impressed that the visitors are following their customs and may offer help to the visitors and take good care of them . Local people\u2018s support is extremely important to stay in a particular country.",
        "On the other hand, there is also an argument that the tourist countries should be able to accept visitors irrespective of their customs and behaviour. Host countries are visited by plethora of tourists throughout the world. There are numerous traditions followed in different parts of the world. It is not fair to expect that the tourists visiting their country should follow their local customs and behaviour. Tourists can enjoy their visit only when they are free of rules. Tourists may also get terrified to visit the country which is strict in its local customs and behaviour. Eventually, the tourism rate for that country will drop.",
        "Therefore, with all the above considerations , I conclude that the visitors should be welcomed with open hearts,so that they can enjoy their trip and will be interested to revisit the country."
