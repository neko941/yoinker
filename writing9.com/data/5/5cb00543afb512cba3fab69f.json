        "Every person is judged by others in a society based on certain parameters and those parameters change from time to time. While it is true that some of them remain gold standard, others get replaced by modern values. I agree with the point that these days, those metrics are more hedonistic, but would differ on the grounds that they have not entirely replaced historical values.",
        "Since time immemorial, when most of the humanity were hunter gatherers, valor, trustworthiness, and pride used to be the measures of someone's greatness, justifiably. As they were the traits that are required to work in a group and lead others into better situations, they are held with high regard. In addition to these, integrity, sense of solidarity and responsibility were considered as well for appraising an individual. However, with the changes in lifestyle and societal structure, some of these have been replaced with others.",
        "In the recent times, our lifestyle is filled with materialistic needs. Every activity in our life is surrounded by either using those assets or working towards acquiring those, like cars, houses or electronic gadgets. Hence, success and most importantly worth is measured along these lines. The reason for this is, one's position of authority and wealth would help one in possessing physical luxuries and hence those are considered as note worthy. Age old beliefs like principles, kindness are regarded as weakness, which is forcing many to abandon these values. However, not all hope is lost. There is still some place, at times, for these gentleman like traits.",
        "Even in this wealth & power centered world, people often realize worth of the old school values, either by genetical hard wiring or due to an epiphony. A recent example is the emotional outburst for the fallen special forces heroes in a battle, who gave their life protecting innocent citizens. Hardly any of those were above middle class, yet they received the adulations of millions. Not only this helped the real heroes, but also stirred a debate on how to measure an individual's worth.",
        "In conclusion, I believe that with changing times, caliber of gentlemen would be judged by different metrics but the core values remain same."
