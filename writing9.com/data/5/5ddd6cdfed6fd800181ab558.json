        "The study gap between high school and the university is a common practice in some states of the World as this time can be utilized in working or traveling. I believe that there are more advantages than disadvantages. Although lose of interest in studies due to traveling and financial stability due to working are some of the drawbacks of this ritual, benefits like exposure to the world and exploration outweigh the disadvantages.",
        "As far as the side effects of a gap year are concerned, as the teenagers are in the developing years of their lives and this difference in the study may pose a loss of interest in studies. For example, moving away from the homeland gives them the idea of exploring mother nature in detail that is why the engrossment for further education. Meanwhile, if someone secures a job that fulfills his basic financial requirements so this may also retaliate them from further studies. Henceforth, the dangers of gap year include losing attention due to curious nature and financial stability.",
        "Conversely, there are several benefits of traveling and working after finishing high school such as tours may provide substantial information of surroundings which could be helpful in further studies and the hands-on experience is beneficial to understand the practical concepts of the lab. For instance, mechanical engineering demands practical knowledge of machinery components and those students who have worked on mechanical equipment perform better than others. Therefore, It is a need of time to give a break from studies to youngsters to inspect the World through traveling, and minor jobs which provide sufficient aid for their practical studies.",
        "In conclusion, some countries encourage their young ones to participate in different activities before starting their graduate studies. Even though this exercise may lead to a loss of attentiveness towards studies, and money may divert them from their goal of studies, I support that there are advantages like gaining worldwide experience with traveling and hands-on practices through job override the disadvantages."
