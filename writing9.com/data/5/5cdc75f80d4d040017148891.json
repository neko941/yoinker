        "Big companies spend a lot of money to promote their businesses. This helps them to attract more customers but consequently causes problems for small or local businesses. This essay will discuss some of these problems and suggest ways to improve sales of local products.",
        "To begin, a serious problem caused by extensive marketing and promotion of big companies is the gradual disappearance of small businesses. As more and more people buy from large enterprises they abandon the local products. For example, the sales of goods online has reduced the rate at which people go to markets to patronize small traders. Also,it tends to cause unnecessary inflation. As these big marketers attract more customers, the demand for their goods increases and more often than not they increase price. For instance, factory refined and packaged food like rice have become very expansive in some countries because people prefer them to the locally grown ones and there is a high demand for them.",
        "There are several ways people can be cheered to buy local products. Firstly, local entrepreneurs should be assisted with funds.With adequate financial assistance, they are able to expand and market their products better which would boost their sales. Furthermore, local business owners should be trained on how to brand and improve the quality of their goods and services. This would make their goods more appealing to buyers and ensure that their customers return. Also,local traders should be encouraged to offer discounts on their products as this helps to attract more customers.",
        "In conclusion,international companies attract customers by spending a lot on business promotion causing inflation and the demise of local businesses. However, this problem can be solved by funding and training local traders and also encouraging them to offer sales on their products."
