        "There is a widely-held concerns that boarding schools have overwhelming positives, while other arguments can be made against the idea. This essay will discuss the debate, and give a concluding views.",
        "On the one hand, those who support studying in an ordinary school rather than in a boarding school cite the various reasons have caused their view. It would appear advisable that some students consider adopting in this new completely unfamiliar surroundings is very arduous. This because the time spent with family and friend at home is curtailed. Another argument is the absence of the parents' role in their child's life would be lead to undermine the bonds between them and eventually the respectful and other worthy values would be vanished consequently through the family. Example can be shown by states, such as Europe countries, seem to demonstrate that the majority of boarding school's students have a poorly-linked relationships with their families.",
        "By contrast, the supporters of boarding schools point that the ever-present advantages of boarding schools is the excellent academic performance  for students and the new learning skills could be gained if they studied in such schools. This resulted by the close community of learners since they are available considerable amount of time to help their pupils. Another long-term impact of studying in this unique form of education is the self-reliance and consequently self-esteem. This is because that the students themselves are the first responsible about their daily routine. These range from doing homework , exams preparation to tidy up their private rooms and cleaning their clothes which means producing a responsible and disciplinary individual.",
        "Overall. It would appear logical to conclude that the advancement academic performance and the life skills that could not be learned in a traditional school make the boarding schools outweighed the normal schools."
