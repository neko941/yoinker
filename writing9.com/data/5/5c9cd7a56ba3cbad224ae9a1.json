        "It is said that in the future, the average quality of people's well-being will likely decrease in comparison to now. In my opinion, I completely agree that the standard of people's health will deteriorate in the coming years.",
        "Firstly, the emission of harmful gases and toxic waste into the environment has caused a significant increase in environmental pollution. That is to say, due to the increase in factories that emit large quantities of pollutants and the consumption of non-renewable sources of energy, namely- fossil fuels, have contributed to a situation where the air we breathe and water we drink has a higher level of chemicals and pollutants that lower the quality of our health. Studies have linked the upward trend of the emission of harmful gases and liquids into the environment and atmosphere has caused an increase of health problems such as the increased risk of respiratory problems and even the cause of certain types of cancer.",
        "Secondly, problems surrounding health issues that has caused an uproar was not only the increased prices of health care, but also the declining quality of the health care system. Health care being priced like a luxury has turned people away from getting regular check ups due to how expensive they are which gets people into dangerous and unnecessary situations where preventable illnesses and diseases are going unchecked. For example, the health care system in the United States of America has been a popular topic due to the outrageous costs which has lead people to ration their insulin, which is life-threatening, or even simply being in denial of their health issues to try to avoid going to the hospital",
        "In conclusion, due to the increase in pollution and health care prices, and the decrease in health care system, I agree that we will be seeing a dangerous situation where the average person's health will be in a critical stage."
