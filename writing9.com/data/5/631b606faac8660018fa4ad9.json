        "Nowadays different organizations and companies asked their employees to be in a proper uniform during working hours. In this essay, I am going to discuss the types of jobs that require uniforms for employees, as well as the pros of wearing uniforms during duty.",
        "Overall, many employees like doctors, lawyers, police officers, food delivery staff, sales guys, waiters, and musicians wear uniforms. The reason is that uniform is a part of their jobs. For instance, doctors wear white overalls and there is a black uniform for police employees. However, their uni is their symbol and is recognized among other people. Similarly, if a person goes to the police station for a report then the uniform and the badges on the police officer's shirt identified their post, so the person will go straight to the exact officer. Likewise, in hospitals, there are many types of staff and by their uniforms, one can find them easily.",
        "On the other hand, there are many disadvantages as well. Some employees may not like their uniform or uniform's color but they have to wear it beyond their choices. In addition, someone likes to change their outfits on daily basis but when they have to wear the uniform they couldn't do that and as a result, they may be fed up with a uniform. Meanwhile,   normally the stuff and material used for uniforms are not comfortable."
