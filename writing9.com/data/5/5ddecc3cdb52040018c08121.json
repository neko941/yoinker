        "Many people claim that, animals should be treated in the way of humans, whereas others believe that, we should use animals for our basic needs and scientific research. Let us examine both views before reaching a concrete decision.",
        "It is true that, humans have no moral right to do experiments on animals, and they have the similar right of living. However, researchers may find alternative methods of research, which could help to reduce killing and suffering them. For example, a recent study by Queen\u2019s university found that the extinctions of different species animals due to animal testing and killing for different purposes. What is more, humanitarian reason people say that the lives of animals should be respected.",
        "On the other hand, animal testing helps to advance medical and scientific knowledge. Many important medical discoveries involved experimentations on animals. One clear example is, finding the treatments of many diseases. If medical and scientific research have not been developed, humans suffering from illness could not been cured. For this reason, medical examinations and scientific studies are crucial on new drugs. In the USA, for instance, scientists found new elements for the cancer research and they might have to do test on animals.",
        "To conclude, although, some people argue that killing animals for food and research is ethical; I would say that it is completely natural for us to kill them for food. But I strongly agree with the idea that testing for the cosmetics industry should be banned."
