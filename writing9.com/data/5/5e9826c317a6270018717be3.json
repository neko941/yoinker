        "It is indubitable that owadays both adultsand children are addicted to fizzy drinks. This  dramatic  increase  in  the intake  of  sugar-based  drinks  has  caused  adverse effects  on  the  well-being of individuals.  In  this  essay,  I  shall  analyse  some  of  the reasons for high intake of sugary drinks and further provide with viable solutions.",
        "To  begin  with,  it  has  been  notedthat most  teenagersare  more  likely  to become addictedto  fizzy  drinks;  this  is  because  of  the  modern  interactive  advertisements. Companies  invest  huge amountsof  money  to  advertise  their  drinks  but  with misleading or hidden information on the nutritional values of the drinks. For instance, a  recent  survey  showed  that  80%  of  the  children  have  minimal  information  of  the side  effects  of  these  drinks.  As  a  result, such  children  have  weak  immune systemsand they are prone to fall sick more often. One of the ways to tackle this problem is to  introduce  strict  laws  and  impose  heavy  fines  on  such  companies  which  mislead the  people  with  false  advertisements.  In  addition,  such  companies  should  also advertise the harmful effects of excessive intake of their products.",
        "Another  reason  for  this  dramatic  increase  is  due  to  the  usage  of  artificial  additives and  high levelsof sugar  by  food  companies  to  enhance the tasteof  their  drinks. Consequently,  people  are  more  addicted  to  these  drinks  because  of  improved  and sweet  taste.  For  example,  people  with  high levelsof sugar intake  are  overweight and  usually  have  serious  health  problems.  To combat  thisproblem,  schools  and health  centres  should  educate  people  about  the  negative  impacts  of  high  sugar intake.  Moreover,  healthy  drinks  should  be  introduced  with  no  artificial  addition  to decrease the level of overall intake of sugary drinks.",
        "In conclusion, drinks with high levelsof sugar have caused serious consequences tothephysical  and  mental  health  of  people.  Governmentsshould  not  procrastinate with the implementation of new laws and imposing heavyfines on such companies which produce unhealthy drinks."
