        "Keeping animals in zoos has always been a contaverstiol issue from long time. Althouh it is believed by some it is not justify to keep them in zoos , others hold a opinion zoo can play crucial rule to save  endengerd animals.In my opinion, only those animals should be in zoo which need some help due to their sickness and extinction.",
        "On the one hand,people have opinion that zoo is a miserable place to live for animals as a result their closure is a must due to the following reason. Firstly, animal require natural and large land to survive in a sustainable way. Zoos are not able to provide them large spacious area for  running and hunting for food.For instance, in a day a lion needs atleast 5 km area to roam arround, but zoos cannot provide them more than 2km. Hence, keeping animals away from their natural habitat for  personal benefits is a cruelity because they are sentinents being too .",
        "On the other hand,pepole think that zoos role is significant in saving the animal that are on the verge of extiction. To elaborate , Rhinos and Kiwis are the example of animals whose number has incresed significantly after keeping them under the supervision of zoo keepers. it can save animal to become easy prey of hunters.Moreover, proper treatment is given to save animals from dangerous ailment and many programs are there for animal to increase their breeding .so. zoos role is beneficial to protect animals.",
        "In my opinion,aninals cpitative shouldbe there to save and protect them from being endangered rather than  for our personal needs suc as entertainment , medicines and fur. They should not consider as a source of income becayse ther have right to live as a sentinent beings.",
        "In conclusion, despite,different people have different views, i think zoo should try to be protective place for wild life instead of becoming a unnatural and fake habitat."
