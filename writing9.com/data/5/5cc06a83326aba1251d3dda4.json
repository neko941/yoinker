        "Certain individuals believe keeping the house and office space clean and items well-arranged is crucial. I agree with this statement because having a neat house and a sparkling workstation has a wide range of benefits.",
        "The look of the house and the office space tells a lot about an individual. If I were to hire a Personal Assistant for example, I will not bother asking the candidate to tell me about his/her organizational skill level. I would rather ask to visit the potential staff for an informal interview at the person\u2019s house. This is where I will make my deductions and conclusion in determining whether the person is the perfect fit for the job or not.",
        "When items are neatly arranged, cleaning them becomes very easy task. It becomes fast to spot straying insects and pests and treat them appropriately. Hence there will be less outbreak of illnesses and diseases, because most disease outbreaks are caused by rodents (who serve as carriers). Once this is done, we will have a healthy place to live.",
        "Having a sparkling environment is also a way to teach children on the relevance of good hygiene. Children learn mostly from experience and by watching the adults around them. They learn how to arrange there toys from seeing how it is done by the older ones around them.",
        "Finally, having everywhere around us spotless and sparkling shows that we are in total control of everything around us irrespective of the pressure from outside. It gives an impression of a highly professional individual in the office and confident person all round."
