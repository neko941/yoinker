        "It is often said that every member in a society ought to assist a non-profit organization by specifying fix amount of his salary. It seems to me that donating  in fact has many positives related to the individual and the community.",
        "Firstly, contribution consistently in a charity learn people to become one stable unit and contribute in their fellow citizens' welfare. By this the poverty ratio in the state would decline and would accordingly lead to the country's advancement if every worker gave money in order to help people in needs. A second positive factor is experience more pleasure. A research conducted by the National Institutes of Health, participants who chose to donate a portion of $10, they were provided enjoyed activated pleasure centers in the brain. Although the experiment was controlled and scientific, it make clear that donating money simply will lead to a high contented frame of mind. This leads us on to the final, and perhaps the most significant positive to support a charitable institution, which is a money management. This happens when a fix amount of money is specified monthly from the income.  If a scheduled donation was set each month for a particular voluntary institutes, that could motivate the supporter to be more attentive to his finances efforts.",
        "While it may be correct that there are few negatives to donation, the most notably is that some people may cannot consider affording a portion of money fixedly. However, it seems that the unaffordable of money for some workers are outweighed by the positives which attain happiness and justification.",
        "To conclude, the benefits of financial management, the pleasure and becoming affluent country combine together to make charitable supporting a justification contribution which brings many advantages."
