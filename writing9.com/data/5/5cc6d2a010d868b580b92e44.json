        "People have welcomed computers as means of making work easier. At the same time however, computers have also eliminated many jobs by making the human workers obsolete. On the one hand, the job performance of computers is often less than adequate.",
        "A number of jobs have been lost as a result of computer technology.  Human ticket agents , for example, are virtually nonexistent these days. The number of bank tellers have also been greatly reduced due to automated bank machines.  Customer service help lines are almost entirely automated. A few years ago, I worked as an assistant at a library.  Today, that position doesn\u2019t exist because the library has installed computers that do most of the same work I did.  The number of positions lost to computers continues to grow, along with unemployment.",
        "While computers can easily carry out routine tasks, they often fall short when a customer has a unique request  or problem .  An automated ticket agent doesn\u2019t have insight about an entertainment district and can\u2019t offer friendly directions to a tourist.  An automated teller machine can\u2019t provide assistance and reassurance when a customer\u2019s bank card has been stolen. Besides, more often than not, automated telephone operators cannot answer the one question we have and we end up waiting on line to speak to a real person anyway.",
        "In the future, I believe a new business trend will evolve.  As coming eliminate jobs, new positions will have to be invented. More and more people will go into business for themselves and,I hope, put the personal touch back into business.  I believe that the human workforce will demonstrate that it is more valuable than computers"
