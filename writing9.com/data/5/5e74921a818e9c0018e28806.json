        "In the contemporary era, culinary choices of people have been altered surreally because of which fast food has taken over the world. Most of these foods leave a grim effect on the physical condition of consumers. Because of this, I entirely agree with the ideology of taxation of unhealthy food and this essay presents and explains the reasons for doing so.",
        "Firstly, one of the primary reasons why people are fascinated about this is its availability at a relatively lower price. So, people are hugely into it. So, imposing a tax would be a great idea to bring a hike in their prices. As the price increases, a lot of then would hardly become affordable, thereby slashing down people's interest in consuming them. Also, the manufacturing would also go down as taxes would increase their production cost. This is one of the factors that urge the taxation of inedible items.",
        "Another issue supporting taxation is that they cause some deadly hereditary epidemics. As an example, let us consider obesity, which has been a major issue among all age groups which is caused by unhygienic eatables. On this basis, it is obvious that this junk food culture must be brought to a halt. Imposing a tax not only protects the health of the public, but can also be used to take up remedial measures to curb obesity. Thus in order to improvise the health conditions of the public these dangerous products are to be tariffed.",
        "Summarizing the information submitted, making non-healthy products out of reach and enhancement of public health are the two main reasons to impose a tax on junk cuisine. Based on this, I hereby conclude that tariffing fast meal can be entirely appreciated and must be enforced as soon as possible."
