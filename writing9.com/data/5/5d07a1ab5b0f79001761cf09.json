        "Obesity is an increasingly growing issue in this generation. It is argued by some people that universities have to make sport mandatory for all degree courses in order to tackle weight issues among students. I  completely agree on this decision and sport should be considered as a necessary subject.",
        "On the one hand, few people believe that colleges are meant for serious studies and not for playing. They argue that lot of money is spend by parents and government on tertiary education and it should be utilized to be productive. Time is also one factor that they say as important. Rather than wasting time on any sport, they suggest that time should also be invested in studying. For example, a lot of colleges in developing countries don't even have a playground or any sort of sports facilities in the campuses. Their ultimate goal is to have academic excellence and little importance is given on any extra-curricular activities and hence youngsters in those countries are becoming unhealthy and overweight.",
        "On the other hand, another group of people consider sports as a compulsory activity. They believe that students should be healthy and should cultivate the habit of engaging in any sort of sport for a healthy mind and body. Since youngsters are more into junk food these days, participating in a sport and doing exercise for the same helps to reduce the excess fat and keep them fit. Since they make this as a habit, probability of continuing this even after leaving college is high which in turn helps them to maintain health. Many universities in the West has incorporated sports as part of their normal curriculum and ensure everyone takes part in at least one game. This helps to ensure a healthy future generation.",
        "To conclude, being in good health is an important factor. The saying a healthy mind can be only in a healthy body is absolutely correct and I totally agree with the idea of having and making sports a mandate."
