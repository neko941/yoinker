        "The solution of government imposing tax on private car owners in order to make commercial transport better and slove traffic problems is a hotly debated topic. This essay will discuss both the benefits and drawbacks of such measure with examples.",
        "Firstly, one of the benefit include decongestion of the roads. Private vehicle owners will reduce irrelevant outings as they would not want to be taxed unnecessarily. This will therefore reduce traffic congestion. For example, when I visited my uncle in UK, we travelled miles to purchase palm oil in a local store and he was taxed so much on the road and parking lot that he subsequently refused  to buy anything from stores far away with his vehicle.",
        "Another benefit would be improved quality of life as the commercial buses and trains will be repaired and upgraded making more people want to use public transport to perform daily activities. For instance, there was a period when the government repaired trains making families to park their vehicle and travel with train thereby reducing cost and saving up money to better their lives.",
        "Nonetheless, there are draw backs to such a solution. There would be a heavy burden on car drivers. At present, the tax is already high, so adding further tax would mean lesser income at the end of the month. This type of tax would affect the poor and average in the society and would leave the rich comfortably leading to aggitatin and sadness.",
        "In conclusion, such a solution is not entirely wrong, but there are advantages and disadvantages to the policy."
