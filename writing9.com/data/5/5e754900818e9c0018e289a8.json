        "Looking back, before the boom of technology, there weren't possible to talk with someone on another country or search on internet the meaning of climate change, but as technology started to win the confidence of the population, nowadays is a mechanism that makes our life easier about a lot of situations. Even so, this can make us dependant of this device at time that can affect our relations with the people around us. In accordance with this I consider that internet is an important tool at the point that makes us depends and affect our relationship with our close people.Next I will explain you the reason instead and favour of this statement.",
        "First, internet is an important gadget because help our life and make more simple, without this, we can't speak with someone in another country or make investigations about thing that we need to search or we want to know about something.This is a very important point because with the current situation around COVID-19 we supposed to be in our house doing virtual classes, telecommuting thanks to internet and the different platforms that it brings us to helps us in this situation of extreme concern.",
        "On the other hand, like we all knows, internet  absorbs the attention of people, this is more common in young people, as is a tool that allows us to talk with friends, boy/girl friend, I mean, people that are far from us; instead this can affect our relationship with the people who are close to us, this make connecting with far people and disconnect with close people, losing the ability to interact face-to-face in a natural form with close people, this is a really big problem in our century.",
        "To sum up internet is a huge mechanism that facilitates our lives, but, at the same time might affect our capacity to relations face-to-face and connect with someone who is not on the other side of the screen of our telephone. This is why I firmly believe that we have to learn to manage internet for the well being of us and don't let that internet manages us."
