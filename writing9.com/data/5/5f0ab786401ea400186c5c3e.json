        "Coming years will witness poor health rate than in the present. This essay agrees with the statement because of the two major factors: change in eating trends, and an inclination towards a sedentary lifestyle.",
        "As we see today, fast foods are on-trend due to which our regular meals suffer. Burgers, fried chicken, cold drinks, and other junk foods are the reasons which make one has less craving for healthier foods such as salads, cereals etc. These foods are also termed as convenient foods because of quick home deliveries, easy to make like 2 minutes maggie, and spending less time in a kitchen is a trend now. In a recent health report, it is found that 65 per cent of Americans do not like cooking or homemade food; instead, prefer ordering eatables from outside.",
        "Besides eating habits, another significant factor that rules here is an inactive lifestyle. Change in technology and modification in working patterns are shifting lifestyles from playgrounds to television couch,",
        "physical work to desk-bound. Most of the working fields in the upcoming years will have a sitting profile, where everything will be computer-controlled, no physical activities such as exercise and sports, and more time spent on gadgets will eventually bring a laid-back attitude. As per the survey done by the Medical Institute of India, youth is more vulnerable to heart-related issues because of less involvement in sports and physical stuff.",
        "To conclude, less physical activity and propensity towards fast food are lowering the health bar, which is likely to go under the current average level in the upcoming years."
