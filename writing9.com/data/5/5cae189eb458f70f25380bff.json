        "In contemporary society, there are many things which leave significant impacts to children, particularly their behaviors. Due to this fact, some people consider that what the youngsters watch on TV will affect to them. Meanwhile, the others argue that the time they spend on watching TV will influence their behaviors a lot. In my opinion, I concur with the idea that children will be influenced by the content they watch on TV.",
        "On the one hand, spending a big amount of time on television may result in the addiction of watching many hours. Because the young generations are in the process of development, they are curious about new things. Therefore, children find it interesting in watching TV for undiscovered things as well as their curiosity.",
        "However, this leads to the fact that eye diseases may be caused. If children focus on watching several hours, the strength of their eyes will be alleviated. Hence, children are likely to have illnesses such as myopic and hypermetropic. For instance, my younger brother had watched TV through days and nights. As a result, he is at level 5 of myopic at the moment.",
        "On the other hand, the content on the TV will transmiss both benefits and drawbacks. Not only children can be educated by education channels, but also they can be harmed by pornography as well as violable words.Thus, every channels on the television should be controlled by the authorities with a view to ensuring the safety content.",
        "To sum up, both of the ideas will have impacts on the children\u2019s behaviours, but I nuture the opinion that what the youngsters watch will influence themselves."
