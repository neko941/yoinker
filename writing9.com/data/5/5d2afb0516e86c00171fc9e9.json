        "These days, it is a matter of dispute among masses that whether Government should invest more on railways or on roads. Some people believe that Government should spend more money on railways, while there are others who are of the opinion that most of the money should be spent on roads. This essays will discuss that why Government should spend  more on railways.",
        "A significant proportion of people consider that massive investment on raods is the way to go. Supporters of such an idea believe that roads are cheaper to construct and more feasible for the common people. The materials and machinaries used in making roads are cost-effective, thus it saves tax-payer's money. In addition, most of the poor and middle class people use roads as their mean of transportation. For instance, a study in Pakistan reveals that it costs only one-third of the amount of money to construct roads in contrast to railways. For these reasons, State should spend more money on constructing roads.",
        "On the other hand, there are more convincing arguments regarding big investment on railways. Railways is the modern and fastest way of transportation from one place to another. It saves a lot of time for the passengers travelling from one area to another. For instance, it takes three hours by train to travel from Lahore to Karachi, reducing the time taken by six hours. For these reasons, Government should focus and spend more on the railway sector.",
        "In conclusion, this essay argued that why Government should invest more on railways than roads. Both means of transportation should be given focus but railways are the fastest way of transportation and therefore, it should be on Government's priority."
