        "Schools play crucial role in everyone's life.A child roots are basically start from schools.In school, children learn lot of things and foriegn language is one of them. Some individuals think that a foreign laguage is better to start from primary stage but others confront it with that secondary school is a best stage to teach students any foreign language. I will mentioned my views in upcoming paragraphs.",
        "To begin with, this trend has one of great benefit is that offsets  feel stress free from begining because they use to of foreign laguage so they could not feel incidenly pressure on themselfs from secondary school.Secondly,Children can become indipendent that means there is less chances to call parents for talking to someone because they can speak foreign language for instance - English is the foreign language which is also a international language so it has more benefits than demerits on future of students.",
        "On the other side of the mirror,primary stage is a golden period of life because of chlidhood.In this time children should be play sports or learn basic things But if we put burden on them of foreign language which could be effect on child's health.Moreover,coin spin and with every spin a new change come means that with age of children mind also develop in rapidly which makes easy to learn any language.For example, you can ask any teenager about any subject and you get reply fastly than children.",
        "I personally believed that this new development has more benefits than demerits.I can suggest that a foreign language would be optional in primary school but in secondary it teach by same way like present."
