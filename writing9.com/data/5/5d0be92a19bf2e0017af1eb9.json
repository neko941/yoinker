        "This essay is about to giving money as gift to young and teenagers, but many of them are disagreed. Although its tradition in many countries especially when youngsters are achieving some targets, or completing their studies, they expect to receive some gifts and surprises from their elders. Hence its definitely important to enhance their confidence and moral. I am strong advocate of this approach to give money as surprises on different occasions instead of other gifts",
        "When we talk about presents for teenagers, they get to excited and will put more efforts in their targets, in other words, its significantly important to build their interest. In term of gifts, there will be many options such as, offering them a mobile, game stations, but they will be more excited and cherish for the money. Moreover, we could even arrange dinners and parties at home on achievement\u2019s, but with the provided money, they can arrange and use the money in their own way. For example, they might be interested to spend money with their friend\u2019s, during the school or university tours. Also, the money will give them opportunity to enhance their ability to think, how and where to spend.",
        "Furthermore, many elders aren\u2019t in the favor of money for teenagers, they might be thinking it\u2019s not safe for the child\u2019s, to not lose control on them. Because when the teenagers can have money, many in their younger age are immature and careless sometimes, which might lead them to wrong directions.",
        "After the thorough discussion, about the both point of view, in conclusion, they both somehow right with their technical analysis and point of view. So, the decision depends on the situation and the teenager age. However, in my opinion, I would say that, yes it\u2019s better to give them money, for their confidence and to earn their trust, for better growth and healthy environment."
