Some people think that people can choose to build houses in their own styles instead of building them with the same as the old house style in local areas. Do the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?",

        "There is a current trend in many cities that the architectural plans are put under supervision. Some people assume that people should be given freedom to choose how their houses are built rather than follow the conventional styles of the old ones. In my opinion, the benefits associated with this view far surpass the drawbacks.",
        "To commence with, there is little gainsaying the fact that the unstandardized styles of house constructions exerts certain negative impacts. If newly built houses are not under appropriate control, they will disrupt the sense of harmony of the areas. As a result, these modern construction could be detrimental to the preservation of traditional and cultural values. Take Hoi An, which is one of the most famous ancient towns in Vietnam, as an example. Were people in Hoi An to erect houses that are against the past construction aesthetics, it would not become a popular tourist destination and attracted millions of tourists on an annual basis like today.",
        "However, I am convinced that the aforementioned drawbacks truly pale into insignificance when compared to the advantages. Indeed, there are practical reasons behind the current shifts in people\u2019s housing preference from traditional design paradigms. The first aspect worth considering is the cost-effectiveness. It would be much cheaper to build a modern simple house rather than one which has to mirror past architectural standards. In addition, space also plays an important role. As is generally observed, modern housing plans, with their plain features and collapsible parts, would leave more space for working and other activities than the richly ornamented traditional house designs.",
        "In conclusion, although some people say that the design and construction of modern and traditional buildings should be the same, I hold a belief that there will be more merits if owners are allowed to exercise their free will on the design of their houses."
