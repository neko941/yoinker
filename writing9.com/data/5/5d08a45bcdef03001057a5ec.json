        "In the recent times, the majority of the population are living in urban areas. That would be owin to the reason that urban areas are more developed and therefore provide more and better opportunities. Though there are advantages of living in thses places, they actually have to experience various difficulties, including tough living conditions and environmental pollution.",
        "There are a plethora of difficulties that people have to face living in huge cities, the major ones would be finding a place to live and environmental pollution. As there is an innumerable individuals dwelling in these cities, there are not enough flats and houses to accomodate each and every one of them, especially at an affordable rate and therefore, this leads to a considerable number of people opting for living in cramped flats or on streets. This would obviously affect their physical and mental well being, and hence their work and earnings. Apart from the above, everyone living in cities have to deal with environmental pollution. As",
        "most of the population live in metropolitan cities, due to public and private transportation, a lot of perillious gases are evolved, in addition, they have to experience traffic congestion, hence, leading to noise pollution too.",
        "To tackle both the issues above, governments should promote the moving from urban areas to rural ones. If this is followed by people, then it would mean that the population in the cities would decrease, therefore air pollution would be aeviated and an increasing number of folks can experiance better living conditions. However, by migrating to rural areas, they would loose the oppurtunities to lead a better life as those areas are not developed, therfore they can not have access to to a good infrastucture and jobs. This is why government should take measures and introduce development and better infrastuctures to propel and persuade people to move to rural areas.",
        "In conclusion, finding a comfortable place to live and air pollution are two of the major issues of urban life. To combat this problem, government should step in and take certain measures, such as developing the small towns and encouraging people to migrate there."
