        "There is no doubt that helping children to become independent is a great trend going on in different countries of the world nowadays. There is a tough competition between youngsters to prove their identities among peers. Parents are encouraging their children to get employed part time in their leisure time. In this essay, we will discuss pros and cons of this issue.",
        "Firstly, it is advantageous to build more personal and social skills by doing part time jobs. Social and personal skills includes patience, helping others, behaviour, leadership qualities, teamwork, friendly nature and helping parents financially. All these qualities would help one in future. A survey shows that children who started doing part time jobs in their early age are proved to become a well known and established business man/woman in future. For example, Henry Watson was believed to work at caffeteria at the age of 16, and now he is one of the famous business tycoons in Australia. Therefore, it is good initiative taken by parents to push their children for  better future as well as to maintain their independancy.",
        "It is well said that if ''Something is famous for its good, same thing is known for its bad as well''. It means  there are some minus points on this issue. Adulthood is the period of getting influence by their friends or colleagues by which they might ruin their future and waste all money hanging out with them. Sometimes, they become so greedy that they forgot about their academics and keep on earning money.",
        "For example, a news on news nine channel broadcasted that a 15 year old boy, working in mcdonalds started taking drugs in peer pressure and wasted all his earnings on buying drugs. Hence, parents should monitor their children and guide accordingly.",
        "To sum up, everything on this earth has strenghths and weaknesses on its own. One might nourishes his/her beauty and other might destoy his/her personality. Working part time is beneficial to earn pocket money or savings and become independent in all aspects. But, it has negative impacts too if one should consider it like a myth."
