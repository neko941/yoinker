        "At some point, it is no brainer that people can enjoy more happiness at a young age rather than when they become older. The complete oppsite view also has good points to stand, even with growing responsibilites that adults should bare. I think the oppsite view couldn\u2019t be more true.",
        "The best evidence to the youth side\u2019s argument is children\u2019s access to freedom. Thinking outside of box is a motto that most adults have to learn and practice, yet young generations have that by nature. Without restricked responsiblities, and rules one has learned during the adultholds, those teenagers simply can enjoy more in life. For example, a mother looks at the window in her house thinking, \u201cIt\u2019s time to clean the window.\u201d, a 16 years girl would look at it and thinking, \u201cWhat a wonderful day today!\u201d. That\u2019s clear the girl knows how to be happy.",
        "For adults, they have learned how to avoid on the things that had made them unhappy in the past to ever happen again. Therefore, by cutting out the misfortunes, those growups can live in a happier life than they couldn\u2019t have lived otherwise. I\u2019ve seen in TV many times that a child had broken his bones by being audacious when playing sports. However, I don\u2019t see that happened to an adult who had broken his bones by playing sports carlessly, or didn\u2019t wear pads. Thus, I do believe adults can actually enjoy freedom in a better way compare to teenagers.",
        "In conclusion, in comparing the two different age groups, the first group enjoys more happiness by having more freedom, while the opposit group enjoys more by eliminating the misfortunes they have learned. I believe those who master the prcess of elimination can harvest the most thrils and smiles in life."
