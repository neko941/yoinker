Furthermore, to get gold as it possible, silver and bronze also not so bed. There are two main direction to reach that achievements. We will try to look each of them and make conclusion at the end of this passage.",
        "On the one hand, support and make all facilities for the best athletes it\u2019s look more reasonable due to they are need less resources and time. Top sportsmen look for their profession more seriously, and no need motivating factors. Sport it\u2019s their all and reason for life. In this case chances to get good results higher. Nations like the USA, UK and other capitalistic countries chose this way of developing their sport in population. This is way shows good result in common.",
        "On the other hand, it is big question, where former countries take top athletes if not provide such facilities for the wide range of citizens. Because main supplier of sportsmen for the competitions is own population. And in this case building sport infrastructure for each citizen it\u2019s look right way of sport development. Which is in itself motivating factor for sportsmen because more and more will be interesting in sport. But this is take more financial subsidizing to sport from the government, and this is main lack of this way of sport development. However, it\u2019s effect indirect to the government development, due to chances that all nation will be healthier, and will bring more benefits.",
        "In conclusion, we discuss both sides of view. Each position has own benefits and lack. So spend money to top athletes and increase chances for best result or finance wide range of people and select best sportsmen depend of county political view."
