        "Now a days lot of students are preferring to cross the borders and going out for study. This increases their knowledge base and skill level. They also get an introduction of new culture, which in turn increases their employability. But on other hand they might have to face linguistic challenges and incur higher cost.",
        "Students go to other countries to expand their knowledge and skills which might not be available in their home country. They tend to gain knowledge of new culture also. This ultimately increases their flexibility and value in job market and opens new dimensions to their career. For example \u2013 employers now a days  prefer resources from diverse culture background because they are more flexible and open to  accept new ideas. With expanded skill set and flexibility, students make themselves more valuable resources for the job market.",
        "On the contrary, it is not always easy to get yourself adjusted at a new place. Students might have to come across many challenges which might be related to language or spending huge amount to pay fees. For example \u2013 several countries like Japan and Germany, majority of people communicate in their local language, which makes it difficult for overseas students. Cost is  also another factor which makes it more complicated  to many students. In some cases  they have to take study loans for this.",
        "Studying overseas has become one of the most desirable option for lot of students. However, it is associated with lot of challenges related to language and high cost but at the end, It multiplies student\u2019s value in terms of employability and personal growth in manyfold."
