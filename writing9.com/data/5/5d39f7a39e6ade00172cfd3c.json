        "At present situation, employees plays an key role in the development of any organisation. Some prefer to have young, who are energetic and while other go for experience. Either of them have their own advantages and disadvantages, which we will discuss in the later part, based on my experience.",
        "Coming to the young generation. Mainly, companies prefer to have them, because of their energy levels that they are going to show at work. For example, Mr. Ramesh, who is fresher, used to show energy at work, made us to work with more energy. This in turn, result in competion of our faster, than planned time frame. Next, They will come up with new innovative ideas, which is useful for the betterment of the company. For instance, we are following the regular process in one situation, but this guy twist the actual, by a bit made us to reach the target in efficient and faster way. Another, They cost less for an organisation. For a sample, For an payment of one experience resource, we can hire two junior persons. Moreover, They are dedicated and don't have other avigation's. To illustrate, they can spend more time on work, if needed, unlike the others.",
        "Regarding the experience people. Firstly, These are talented and have good knowledge on the owrk. For example, Mr. Rath, who is senior, use to guide us, when we are struck at work, with his knowledge. Secondly, They can tackel the things in better way, eventhough how worst the situation is. For example, When there is case, where we are unable to complete the task in time, this guy convienced our client and bought some time for us.",
        "In conclusion, to my opinion, based on the above examples, combination of both makes the perfect team. One with information and another with pace is perfect mixture to complete the task in efficient and quickly."
