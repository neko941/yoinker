        "Nowadays, we live in a communicated world where there are several mass media for broadcasting information. Actually, it is impossible imagine the life without interact with them. Nevetheless, there are one more important than another, but in my opinion, the most effective are film, radio and television, for the reason that these are the most popular for the audience. However, those three have negative and positive things, which have an influence in people\u2019s behaviour. \r\rThe advantages of these media are the effective, because they have a great scope in the public. While the radio can give a message more inmediatly, the television can reach more people, due to is a suport that many individuals consume. Likewise, the film also has those features, because with Nexflix and TV Cable is easier watch any movie, therefore, for having this entertainement you only need internet. \r\rOtherwise, those media have disadvantages as well, for the cause that the three are used to washing brains. In the world there are not a strong regulation for seeing if the message that media says is a good o bad thing. For instance, in dictatorship countries, especially TV and radio, are used for faking the reality. Also, in the cinema, many films have a bad influenced in people\u2019s lifes, as in the USA where a lot of murders are inspired in violent movies. \r\rIn conclusion, it is important can understand that there are several ways to say a messagge through mass media. However, in my opinion the most effective are radio, tv and film because they can reach a big group of society.  Conversely, we have to be aware that those information technological can be using for the benefit of the powerfull people."
