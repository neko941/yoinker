        "In a few nations, it is legally not permitted to children underneath 16 years of age to exit from school and indulge in full-time employment. I believe this has positive implications on children.",
        "To embark on, children would be focused on nurturing their academic or extracurricular aspects. When a child has only one thing to follow, it makes their life a convenient one. Adolescence is a phase where holistic development takes place, and schools are a perfect place to nourish a young mind. Being engrossed in merely school curriculum allows an individual to emerge as a fully grown person. In Asian countries, every adolescent beneath 16 years of age is not relieved from school and has produced exemplary outcomes in a child\u2019s overall development.",
        "To elucidate further, fully employed adolescents, who are below 16 years are vulnerable to mental pressure. The world is inundated with myriad opportunistic people, who take undue advantage of minors. Such clever populace harass the underaged children by not only immersing them in excess work but by also paying them a meagre amount in lieu of the job. Moreover, child slavery is quite common in developing and underdeveloped countries. This entire inhuman treatment results in mental agony. Therefore, it disrupts the whole life of the innocent souls. The African ministry, for example, DOES NOT PROPAGATE REGULATIONS CONCERNING CHILDRENS\u2019 SAFETY and future prospects. Numerous youngsters could be seen wandering for work or being trapped in the hands of cruel employers. Hence, such incidence plays with the future of children.",
        "To recapitulate, I bolster the law of the nations that safeguards the young generation. Moreover, the entire world should adopt such measures for the betterment of the young populace."
