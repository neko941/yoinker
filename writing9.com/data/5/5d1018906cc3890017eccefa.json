        "Some people perceive that raising the tax on the petrol is an effective way to tackle traffic and pollution issues. Although a rising cost on the petrol can encourage more people to take public transportations, life quality of most of us especially the poor can be adversely effected if this measure is applied. In my opinion, the negative points of this action surpass the positive aspects.",
        "The crucial beneficial factor of imposing more taxes on the gas is that more people will opt various public transportations to commute daily such as buses and subways as it is cheaper and faster than driving their own cars, resulting in less vehicles on the street. Additionally, it is also an efficiently method to cope with air pollutions as it leads to a significant reduction of green-house gases emission. To illustrate, a recent research conducted in Japan has revealed that a growing number of vehicles over the last decade are accountable for the gradually worsening traffic congestions and low air quality in the city. For these reasons, these advantages has a profound impact on our society.",
        "However, every coin has two sides. One main negative consequence of this practice is that people\u2019s life quality especially the poor will be negatively impacted because basic living costs will go up if petrol prices is increased. For example, the price of different items in the supermarket will rise as the transportation company will spend more money on the gas to deliver goods. Additionally, people may face lack of options to commute if transportation infrastructures are not upgraded. As can be seen, this action also generates negative consequences on people\u2019s daily life.",
        "To sum up, people\u2019s opinion seems to differ as to whether or not should authorities imposes more taxes on the gasoline. Taking everything into consideration, I\u2019m inclined to say that the negative drawbacks of this practice are superior."
