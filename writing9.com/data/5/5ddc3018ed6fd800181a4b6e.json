        "Learning a different language other than our native by children is always remain a controversial topic. While some think that they should start learning when they reach at secondary level, I agree with those who believe that the moment they enter in school should start learning a new language.",
        "On the one hand, it is argued that the children should learn a new language while entering at secondary level as they are often enough mature to understand new language. As a result, they are able to recognize the difference between their native language and the foreign one. Moreover, it is said that most teenagers choose a second language wisely. For instance, the child who is at secondary school has a choice to choose among French or Spanish language other than English language so that it could be fruitful for them in a long run. Thus, choosing properly the different language other than native one, not only does it help them for future, but able to distinguished properly.",
        "On the other hand, I believe that children should start learning the new language at the moment they enter in the school because they are profoundly capable to learn as many new languages as they can. As a consequence, they often become multilingual human being in future rather than bilingual. Consider multilingual child as an example, who could solve problem easily and also concentrate on work properly. Furthermore, I would argue that when the child is hearing or learning the new word of other language they do not hesitate while pronouncing or speaking due to no fear in mind how another person would react or mind when they speak.",
        "To sum up, although pupils have the chance to choose properly a foreign language which could be benefited them in future, speaking or pronouncing new language fosters a child to speak without any fear in mind. Therefore, on balance, I believe that children should learn the foreign language at an early age when they enter into the school first time."
