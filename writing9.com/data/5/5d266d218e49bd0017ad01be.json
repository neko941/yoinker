        "It is argued that governments should take steps for the improvement of railway system. While some people think that instead of the development of railway system, public transport should be made better for the public. In my opinion, development of railway system has numerous benefits for the people like time saving and safety, because in the trains people can reach on their destinations in a short time and there are less chances of accidents to occur during the travelling in trains.",
        "On the one hand, money should be spent by the government to improve the conditions of railway system. During the journey in the trains, there is no problem of traffic jam, so people are able to complete their journey earlier in the trains. In addition, every train has its own railway path, so the chances of accidents in railway system are minimum as compare to in public transport on roads. For example, in Japan, majority of the people prefer to travel in fast trains for their safety. I agree that people can save their time by travelling in trains and trains are the safe mode for passengers for travelling.",
        "On the other hand, it is the major responsibility of government to develop public transport system. Due to the facility of public transport, people can go to the every part of country which is not possible in railway system due to the limited routes of trains. Moreover, tickets of public buses are cheaper than trains in many countries. For the instance, in Pakistan, poor people prefer to use public transport to travel from one place to other place because they cannot afford the expensive tickets of trains. However, I think that in public transport, people often reach late to their places due to traffic jam and people are injured by road accidents.",
        "In conclusion, although the public transport system provides the citizens variety of routes and lower cost of tickets but, I think, trains are quicker and safer for the public than public transport."
