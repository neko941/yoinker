        "Despite knowing the importance of environment conservation for a long time, human activities have been damaging the earth we live. It is believed by some, increase the price of petrol and other fuels for vehicles is the best method to tackle environmental problems while some others have an opposite opinion. Nevertheless, in this essay, I totally disagree with the former view, reasons would be explained in the proceeding paragraphs.",
        "It is accredited that vehicles are one of the unavoidable needs of the present day, whether it for transportation of goods or commutation. If the cost of petrol and diesel increase, it will definitely affect the price of all daily commodities. For instance, many middle-class families' budget, they have a fixed income, may be damaged due to this. As such, a hike in the cost of fuel is not the ultimate solution, hence it has a detrimental effect on not only the productivity but also the economy of the countries.",
        "On the flip side, effective measures to be taken to reduce the use of vehicles by creating awareness and promote green protocol. If employees in a company pool their cars, it would reduce both traffic congestion and fuel consumption. Sweden has a perfect carpooling system is the best example of this. Over and above, every individual should take a necessary step to protect the environment since different valuable species are vanishing. Safeguarding can be done by reuse, recycle, and reduce the utilization of natural resources.",
        "To recapitulate, having gone through various aspects, the rise of vehicle fuels has a negative impact on the economy. Environmental problems can be tackled by creating proper awareness and reduce the use of natural resources. It is hoped that future generation will take fruitful action to conserve the ecosystem."
