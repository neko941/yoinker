        "In today's era, it has been observed that youngsters are given more liberty by their parents, unlike past. In my opinion, it is a negative development, as it may lead to children going astray as well as affects their personality development.",
        "One of the main reasons of considering this scenario as negative is because this freedom given to the children by their parents may result in them being engaged in wrongdoings. For example, nowadays, teenagers can be seen committing juvenile crimes and taking drugs. This behaviour of youngsters can be considered as a result of the extra liberty given to them by their guardians by not keeping check and balance on their activities and considering this freedom as their right. If parents keep an eye on their children's activities, whether inside or outside home, they will not be able to commit any sin and hence will not be a shame for their family.",
        "Moreover, this elbow room given to the youngsters can also affect their personality development in a negative way. While teenage life, which is in between age of 13 and 19 years, is the most sensitive phase of a child's life, parents have to be more conscious in the matter of their upbringing. For instance, in the past, it had been observed that guardians had put restrictions on their children, especially in the matters of punctuality and moral values, which cannot be seen nowaddays. This results in children giving no respect to their moral and cultural values and on the other hand, their time management is zero, which not only affects their academic life but also causes detrimental effects on their personality.",
        "In conclusion, I believe that more flexibility given to the youngsters nowadays by their parents than in the past, is a negative development because it can result in children shifting away from the path of righteousness and can impact negatively on their personality development."
