        "It is undeniable true that globe is unimaginable without population.Few individuals think that increase in the world's population is the major problem faced by humanity .Thus,I totally agree with the statement presented.I elucidate my stand in the following paragraphs.",
        "The first and foremost reason for supporting the concept of increased the universal  population is highly educated person because if the human being have educated then it get highly paid job and have no financial problem in their lives.If they live luxiours life then they have no problem regarding birth to the more children because they have financial stable.In addition to that,another cause to be considered and cannot be overlooked is human lives longer lives because they have educated and also know about the medical facilities.They also get nutrients diet to live longer life which is the main reason to rise in society.",
        "Moving further,no one can deny the cause of increasing population.The major adverse impact it has is poverty.With the rise in community, demands of jobs are rise day by day but elder people do not resign their jobs in early ages then number of unemployment increases and it impact on the society .For instance,a survey was conducted in New Delhi,the number of people to fill the registration form for one job is near about thousands.Another cause involved in air -borne diseases.If the number of citizenry is rise than air-borne diseases are occured in the humanity.Moreover,pollution is also the main cause of this continued rise.With the rise in society,the number of automobiles increases then the roads are conjusted and traffic jams occured which helped to increase the population and causes many diseases like heart diseases.",
        "In conclusion,I recapitulate that there are innumerable strong arguments supporting the problems faced by mankind such as poverty ,pollution and air-borne diseases due to the rise of humanity."
