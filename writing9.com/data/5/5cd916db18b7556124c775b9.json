        "When it comes to crimination, we witness a surge in the amount of criminal activities annually. There are a variety of criminal motivations that actually lead to deadly sins, from which some solutions must be executed to turn over the situation.",
        "In the beginning, reasons for people to commit crimes can be classified  into two distinctive categories. Firstly, criminals share the similarity of having difficult lives. They can\u2019t stand being in those miserable backgrounds any longer. As a result, they may rob some money or doing dirty things for others to receive immediate payment that can change their circumstances. The second reason is that  they have mental problems which make them lose their morality. They can hardly tell what is right and what is wrong and just do what they want. In some cases, they are diagnosed as mental patients.",
        "Therefore, in order to reduce the crime rate, actions from authorities must be taken. The very first thing government need to do is to care about the basic living condition of the people. They need to reduce the gap between society classes and subsidize for the poor. Secondly, since the spreading of many mental illnesses, we should help those patients to get treatments such as mental therapies, etc\u2026 in spite of avoiding them. Moreover, we need to do inform about those illness to everyone so that people all aware of the mental health.",
        "In conclusion, when we understand that criminal activities occur because of the criminals\u2019 struggling backgrounds or their mental illnesses, both government and the whole society can interpret from the root to prevent the crimes."
