        "The news media mainly plays two fundamental roles in modern society- providing information and influencing public opinions, and I think, to some extent, its influence is generally positive despite some negativity.",
        "Undisputedly, the news media provides people with vast amounts of information in various forms. We can access it by listening to radio, reading newspapers and magazines, watching television and by surfing the Internet. The ability to access news media is important for individuals and organizations as people make decisions based on the news provided to them. Some of these decisions are mundane: Some check the weather forecast to see whether we should take an umbrella to work. Other news, such as that about the business world, could influence whether we invest our savings in certain companies listed on stock exchange.",
        "The news is often presented to us in certain ways, using specific words in order to control our feelings and thoughts. This might be the main negative influence of the news media. Very often, the news media portrays people in simplistic ways, giving us some facts, but not the whole story. In the America, for instance, some news media tends to support the Republicans whilst others tend towards the Democrats and the portrayal of individuals can reflect this. This is somewhat inevitable, because the editors, journalists and owners of the news media have opinions and biases. I believe that it would be better if people checked news stories from different sources instead of only using one source.",
        "To sum up, I think with two main functions \u2013 providing information and exerting effects on readers, news media plays a pivotal role in modern society, and its impact on society presents positivity, in general."
