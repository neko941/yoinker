        "Food sustainability is one of the basic human rights but achieving this should not impact the environment and economy. Few individuals think utilize food items available in the local habitat is good for the environment and it support the financial stability. I agree with this view and in the following essay, I will explain why I support this point of view.",
        "Transporting food products across the world mainly depend on petroleum or diesel based vehicles which can cause global warming. Transport and food delivery may take up to months to reach its final destination from the production location. During this process, tons of fossil fuels will be burned and it emits carbon monoxide and other microparticles, and it causes one of the main reason for global warming. On the other side, if consumers start to utilize locally available products then the transport requirements get reduced and eventually, it will help to reduce global warming and increase the stability of the environment.",
        "Food products will be cheaper if it produced in the nearby areas due to various factors. Transportation cost will be less for the items grown in neighboring areas compare to goods shipped from long distance. Additionally, food preservation and chemical processing used in majority of the globally shipped goods, otherwise crops may spoil quickly, and this process will inflate the final value of the product. For example, movement of goods from Japan to US will be more costly compared to transporting inside US.",
        "There are numerous advantages for homegrown food items especially for to support the environment as well as it will increase economical stability of consumers and society. Based on the arguments outlined above I strongly support the benefits of locally grown food items are much better than transported items from different geographical regions."
