        "Nowadays, medical side is open for everyone who takes knowledge. All popularity has nearly 20 percent command on medical education. So, some human beings get preference to take advice for a health issue. In my thinking, it is a positive process because today living style is vast . but , sometimes  taking appointment of doctor is a much better option.",
        "To begin with, younger are not interested to visit a expert because they have a busy schedule anyway, they prefer to get information via the internet. For example, in a metro city travelling time is nearly 2-3 hours. Due to these reasons, they choose online consultation and then take medicines.",
        "Secondly, some family they do not have the ability as well as they are afraid to face physician because they shy to discuss their issue face to face. Although, they go with taking advice from home and overcome from health problems. for instance, some women related health affection, ladies do not share their problems frequently in front of a MD. Moreover, they prefer online treatment.",
        "Thirdly, digital conference is available on a different type of sites as well as many application are there. Moreover, medicines are also accessible online via the application. On another hand, it is sometimes positive furthermore its negative. For this purpose, people should take online consultation. on the other hand, for other treatment like scanning, X - ray, MRI etc. they have to meet medical person. If they don\u2019t follow this therapy then they get injured for a lifetime.",
        "To be specific, every physician does not have an online service . equally,  in the covid-19 pandemic situation, some people get online therapy as well as medicines but they have to visit doctor for collecting blood sample as well as sometimes for scanning also. But one problem is that, at the situation of breathing problem they have bed with an oxygen cylinder and because of increasing cases people can not find the bed in their nearest hospital. That is the main drawback of online consultation other doctor don\u2019t know about people history to do immediate therapy.",
        "Lastly, in my conclusion, \u201c every coin has two side\u201d online advice save time and they are needful for an emergency but, face to face consultation is also beneficial for human. they go for both as per the situation."
