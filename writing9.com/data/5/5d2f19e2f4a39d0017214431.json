        "Health is a vague term used by everyone in the present time, by this they only refer to physical fitness , whereas it has a very broad meaning to it . Health in medical terms refers to state of physical , mental , psychological , emotional and socio-economical wellbeing . In my opinion , when people believe to improve  public health , increasing the number of sports facilities will help improve public health i regret to say that they are wrong .",
        "The people who believe that increasing the number of sporting facilities has little contribution to improving health are partially correct . Increasing the number of sporting facilities does not imply the utilisation of these facilities by every individual who visits these places . There is no doubt in my mind that developing interest in sports will have a greater influence on people ,this will also increase the participation rate rather than by just creating new complexes will guarantee improvement in health  .Nevertheless , sports are a great  method to enhance  ones stamina , endurance , focus and teamwork abilities , but it lacks the other aspects  healthy life . This vicious cycle of stress related to work , sedentary lifestyle and unhealthy food habits needs to be broken.",
        "A healthier community is a prosperous community , this can be achieved by bringing about certain lifestyle modifications for instance ; eating healthy , indulging in  hobbies and adding a workout routine .Avoiding foods with additives and preservatives would ensure a healthy digestive system which lowers the risk of diseases . Hobbies are a great way to lower mental stress as it allows the mind to relax and helps prevent mental health problems such as depression . A workout session at home or in the gym or even yoga will improve physical fitness .Moreover , the productivity and efficiency of the community would also improve leading to an  economically stronger society .",
        "To sum up , a healthier community can be created  if a balance can be achieved by adopting lifestyle changes to all aspects of life and just not concentrating solely on physical fitness to be a marker of good health ."
