        "There are contrasting views about the selections of subjects at the university level. Some individuals favour that the students should be free to make a choice about their subject of interest, while other stress to choose advancing subjects like science and technology. In my opinion, one must be allowed to select his subject of interest as a major, however, if necessary science and technology can be added as compulsory minors.",
        "Interest and dedication are the main factors for any profession. The. As it is the (basic need)  intrinsic  of every human being to make a decision about his future, everybody should be granted the power to select that he likesre are several reasons for this approach. Firstly, it is easy to fully concentrate on a subject, when it is your favorite. For example, it is sometimes seen that parents compel a child to become an engineer, whereas he is a good artist. Due to this strategy, child will neither focus on engineering nor on art, therefore he will be thrown toward a dark future. (Therefore, he may end up being dissatisfied with his future) Furthermore, university students are adult and mature enough to take their own decisions, Therefore, they do not need any type of dictation.",
        "It is a fact that future belongs to science and technology and with the advent of modern technology our lives are totally been changed. Furthermore, we required knowledge of science and technology for all types of interaction. For example, computer and the internet, nowadays, are very necessary to have an up to date knowledge and information. Keeping in the view the importance of these future subjects, we cannot totally ignore them.",
        "In conclusion, keeping maturity of university students in the view, we must give them a free hand to decide about their career and subjects."
