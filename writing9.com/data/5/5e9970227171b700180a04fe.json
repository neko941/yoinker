        "In todays era, Things are changing drastically. Everything is computerized, there is no manual work happening in the world. There has been a major upgradation in the working and speaking  processes. In the following paragraphs, I shall be discussing the pros and cons of the above mentioned topic.",
        "The new way working has an advancement in the system is really helping the country to do the work quicker and more accurate. 'Communication' In todays generation this word's  meaning is text  or Skype /Facebook / Instagram or Whatsapp call. They don't know that meeting in person is  a form of talking. They lack the time to hang out with their family and friends due their prior commitments. However, There are multiple advantage of being connected to each other through this mode.  for instance, entire mankind is just running around for their office purpose and to make money. In this entire process they don't get the time to spend and be touch with people they love. Here, Technology plays a major role. Being apart from each other still you can be in touch. Whereas in this artificial mode, the real essence of being in touch is lost. The advancement of the communication has multiple benefits for common people and working people to stay in touch  but it has also a significant effect on the corporation.Multinational firms are busy 24 hrs and it happens many a time that the management is working from another place and generally the hiring team is at a different location. So, The development in the communication helps the human to work remotely from different places. It  saves a lot of time and money in the industry.",
        "To conclude, The new way of staying in touch with each other has definitely had loopholes as it makes us forget our traditional way of working, but it has many benefits and it's very convenient for working and being connected to each other."
