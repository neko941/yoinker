        "The public seem to be in the real dilemma which the labour force are mandatory to spend their career lives under only one employer instead of moving different companies. More employers will help the staff to brush up endeavour and diversity the networking, whereas the same company might promote the staff during their work periods. In order to arrive at last but not the least consensus, I will suggest them as following initially.",
        "First and foremost, according to skepticals, the same organisation gets the workforce to promote compared to the different organisations. Nevertheless, they should waste whole career lives for the board without any self- development by overworking and lessening family time. For instance, my dad who stayed at one university for 30 years is the paradigm,because he overtaught without any salaries and get promoted before he was retired. If he had moved into another university, he would have gained his academic title at least.",
        "On the one hand, moving into different employment will surely bring one of the crucial merit including an enormous amount of repertoire with reft and hard skills, in light of gaining professional knowledge from different groups and mingling experienced experts. To say, after my alma-mateur, i was hired by one of the state-owned organisation as a translator. Abruptly, one of the private entrepreneurs offered me to translate a guideline as a freelancer. Having accepted it, I realized that the same organisation never augmented any hard and soft skill.",
        "On the other hand, the networking could be extended after belonging to more than one organisation. The reason why I argue is that any spheres particularly medical, education and IT require not only counterparts but also amateurs for exchanging expertise and achieving what we need to overcome. To prove myself as an example, after 3different employers, I decided to run my own business. At that time, a variety of networking died help me to manage the documentation at break neck.",
        "By way of conclusion, i would re-affirm that only one employer never turns a new leaf on hard and soft skills which play a part and parcel role in the workforce seeing that shifting into more than same organisation never turns a blind eye into self-development and weak or strong ties."
