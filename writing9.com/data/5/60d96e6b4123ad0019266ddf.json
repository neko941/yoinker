        "Nowadays, there are several school of thoughts about chidren's consideration towards history. While a gorup of people cliams that world history should be learners' concern, I fully hold that students must gain a deeper insight into their local background since it helps them to boost their social roles in societies.",
        "Form my perspective, there are some reasons that children should be taught about regional history. Firstly, such an attitude will assist them to promote a sence of national and regional identity. This is because many stories that are related to a particular area are full of events that act an incentive for young generation to get involved in social matters. For example, in Iran's history there are numerous events, such as Rome occupation, that inspire young people to sign up in their army since such people are motivated to defend their values against any enemies. Therefore. studying a local history in schools can have significant influences on children's mind when they reach adulthood.",
        "Moreover, the aforementioned approach not noly strengthen the sence of patriotism among children, but also may help them to acquire a deeper understanding of their own cultures. It means that regional history has the power to present the events and customs that are alien to students. More presicely, minority of schoolchildren have an exhaustive knowledge about Norouz ceremonies in Iran since many of them deem that such events are just for giving and receiving gifts. But, What these students fail to see is that the main concept of Norouz customs is enriching social values and morals , among which are respect and honesty. Thus, learning historical background will lead children to assimilate into their culture and embrace ethical beliefs more easily.",
        "Despite that, a number of people asserts that understanding global history is an essentail element in schoolchildren learning process since it may assist them to communicate with other societies when they get older. Nevertheless, this group of individuals have failed to consider the role of internal history because students without studying their own haritage are not able to absorb foreigner stories.",
        "In conclusion, although some people are in favour of teaching world's past stories to students, I contend that children in oder to improve their cultural indentity are required to rise their knowledge about their ancestors."
