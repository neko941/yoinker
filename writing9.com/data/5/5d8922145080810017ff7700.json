        "Many countries are importing a variety of food products from other countries. This trend happens due to the significant demand of the local markets in which consumers are more likely to spend money on new commodities, especially the ones that have come foreign countries. Hence, some people might argue that countries should be able to produce food for their own people instead of importing them. In this essay, it will be shown that the argument is inappropriate and importing the right food products is necessary.",
        "Firstly, weather plays a significant role in agriculture. Not many countries have the right weathers to grow certain fruits. For example, sweet mangoes can mostly be found only in tropical countries whereas in cold weather countries, they will be less tasty. Hence, many Western countries prefer to import mangoes from other tropical countries. If imported food has to be reduced, the prices of these products will go up drastically and average income earners will not be able to afford.",
        "Secondly, it can lead to significant pressures on the agriculture industry of a country if it decides to produce food for its own people and to reduce imported food. As a matter of fact, many countries have very limited farming land which cannot supply sufficient amounts of food products for the whole countries. Hence, importing food from other countries can reduce this burden.",
        "Thirdly, importing the right products can not only enrich the diversity of the products on the markets but also create job opportunities for locals. For example, consumers can have a wider range of options when going shopping if there are both local foods and imported ones. At the same time, to cope with the increase in food consumption, there will be more demands for logistics jobs.",
        "In a nut shell, countries should be able to produce foods for their own people and should encourage the right products to be imported so that their people can gain benefits from this."
