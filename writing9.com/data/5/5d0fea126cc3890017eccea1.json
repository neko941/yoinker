        "The vast majority of professionals support the idea that foreign language should be learnt by children not at secondary school, but primary. In my opinion, I consider that early foreign language education completely outweigh any drawbacks which may arise in their life.",
        "Despite the drawbacks below, I believe the knowledge gained by children learning non-native language are extremely useful for their future life. Firstly, children can develop an understanding of language\u2019s basics. This is a crucial skill to achieve as it is more difficult to master when children are getting older which could generate additional complications such as less natural ability to learn grammar and lexical resource of the language. Secondly, children take an opportunity to read and consume brand new content which is most commonly presented in a foreign language. For instance, some children who are interested in premiere series of a cartoon shows which they adore could be able to watch them not in their native language, but foreign. Learning an additional language except the native one is a competitive advantage which may play a significant role in their life.",
        "",
        "Admittedly, there are some issues involved when children start explore a foreign language early. One problem is that it might load them with a huge amount of information to absorb. To illustrate, in the vast majority of countries young students have to get familiar with many disciplines such as math, native language, literature and others, thus they are usually lacking in time for their foreign language\u2019s homework to do properly. Moreover, this situation is quite common, happening in numerous countries. Another negative aspect is that the time children spend educating a language could influence them from spending time with friends and classmates. Having a solid friendship is the key to a worthwhile future so if foreign language interferes with their socialising performance this can be a problem.",
        "In conclusion, the critical knowledge that children can achieve when they learn a foreign language will stand them in good stead when they are adults and clearly outweighs any disadvantages."
