        "Recent research across the globe has shown that at least three fourth of the world population is forced to live below the poverty line.  This essay will explore how unemployment and illiteracy are considered the root causes of this concern and how through proper government policies we can curtail this menace.",
        "There are myriad factors that are often considered the driving force behind poverty. Firstly, the leading cause of this global issue is unemployment. People who do not have appropriate jobs related to their education are unable to earn sufficient money to support their families. This fact can be better explained by the unemployment crisis of Brazil in 2008, which increased the poverty rate by many folds. Thus, unemployment breeds the financial crisis.",
        "Secondly, illiteracy is another main reason of the monetary hardships. As people who do not have any skills or technical education cannot find jobs because most industries need skilled workers. Take the example of Cambodia, whose finance minister said in his interview that joblessness in the country is mainly due to the lack of technical training institutes. Hence, illiteracy can be deemed as a major factor of poverty.",
        "However, there are certain viable (proper, appropriate, plausible, pragmatic) measures that can be taken to curb this problem. The government should establish vocational training institutes to train masses for jobs in industries. In this way, people can earn substantial money to pull their families out of the financial crisis. Moreover, the government should invite foreign investors to start businesses in the country. New companies can generate more jobs and end the issue of unemployment.",
        "To sum-up, even though the causes of this problem are widespread but with effective planning on the part of the government, we can tackle this issue."
