        "On the one hand, to maintain an ecosystem balance, it is essential to preserve the wild animals. Animals are part of the food chain cycle, and therefore consuming one another maintains this ecosystem balance. If there is a chance of disappearance in one of them that is omnivores, carnivores, and herbivores, then others get overpopulated and thus, disturbs the environmental balance. Moreover, building wildlife sanctuaries also aids some income to the Government, which can be utilized in fulfilling the essentials of humans, such as Education and Health Services.",
        "On the other hand, preserving these endangered species requires colossal maintenance. Firstly, a large area of land is needed to construct a wildlife reserve, and maintaining the diet and environmental requirements in accordance with every species, cost in abundance to a Government. In addition, in some scenario, these dangerous animals can come out of the wildlife sanctuaries in human living areas, can cause life threat to them. For example, In South Africa, a few Elephants were managed to escape from the reserves and caused significant damage to personal property. This can be stopped with some measure steps and guidelines.",
