        "In today's era, advertisement is one of the most efffective strategy to attract the customers for any enterprenaur. Some beleives that publicity by means of advertisement encourages customers to buy products that is even not required, while others beleive that advertisement helps us to introduce the new collection which enhance our lives. Based on the below mentioned views, I agree that advertising is just an unnecessary way to create a requirement in an individual's mind.",
        "To embark on, people nowadays have a good access to internet, televisions and other media that displays a plethora of redundant advertisements, however in past decades, public hardly had media available to view such advertisements to get attracted,even though public were able to fulfill their requirements without any compromise. In my perspective, advertisements are not only the option to influence customers about a requirement, it infact, just inculcate the need of any product by emphasising more and more features,which sometimes even missed in actual products. For instance, if one is looking for buying a car, there are lot of relevant options and popups like car cover,seat covers and other accessories by which customer atleast would find it as one of the need alongwith car. Hence advertisements are just a way,that triggers frequently to divert the mind of customers.",
        "Moreover, traditional way of buying products are quite effective way because one can easily look and feel the product physically,but these days,the competition is extremely high,which results in multiple options one can choose. For example, there are enormous number of online websites, besides which there are various offers for complimentary gifts specific to a product, which indeed is not the need of a customer, whereas a customer goes for an offer by considering the need of other product can be there in future, which is just a wastage for that moment of time.",
        "In a nutshell,if people buy things online,they tend to create extra requirements for themselves and buy unnecssary products by getting attracted from various offers which actually is a market strategy to influence buyers."
