        "To begin with, most huge companies set a condition for any employee to be multi-task.The employee must know all knowledge about his position and other positions in other departments, as owners give any extra profits for their employees based on this condition. Also, the employee will have the opportunity to promote according to that.

Therefore he changes his life forever to be at the best level.",
