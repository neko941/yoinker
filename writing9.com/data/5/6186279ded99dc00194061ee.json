        "In some parts of the world are facing famine despite the agriculture fields are rapidly improving in the technology as well as in the method of the cultivation. The coruption of hoarding the grains and the expensive fertilizers are the main reasons behind the shortage of food in the world. The tracebility of the grains cultivated and providing ex-gratia to famers to buy new technology can elicit the problem. This essay will discuss both problem and solution.",
        "To begin with, although very exoensive and a new method is introduced for cultivation of a land, still people are not getting appropirate quantity of food because of the high rate of coruption. Moreover, some society store the grains in a big storage, and not allowing them to reach a mareket because of this, people are not able to buy needed products. Apart from this, the technologies introduced are of extreme high rate, and the farmers could not able to afford as they are running out of cash. To illustrate, in some countries of the world are facing famine because of the inflation the famers could not ble to invest in the expensive teachnology; however, technology is improved but not reachable to them.",
        "Nevertheless, we can come up with all these issues if the government of a nation keeps the records of how much grains are grown, and providing their own storage houses. Furthermore, the authority can visits the farmers and ask them about problems they might be facing. Besides this, the government should also support the community by giving them good fertilizers and the expensive techniques to those who are not able to afford it.",
        "In conclusion, the world is facing famine due to the grains are not reaching at market in right time as well as high budget technology are not affordable by all; however these problems can overcome if the government keeps records as well as provide the requirements to underprivilage farmers."
