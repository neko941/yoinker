        "Media is adopting different ways to make their new stories interesting. Nowdays, a lot of pictures are added with the text to make the story effective.While some individuals are of the view that words are less effective than photos. However, both of them equally plays an important role in making the story effective.",
        "Photos helps to understand the news more easily and comprehensively. Nowadays, print as well as digital media illustrate a story via pictures which are either clicked or videographed by their reporters which in turn makes the whole story easy to comprehend. For instance, the terrosits attack of 9/11 were largely shown on media by dispalying how the plane crashed which made it quite clear to people how everything was done.Thus, photographs which are shown on television and newpapers are more simple to comprehend  as compared to text.",
        "Stories with words and pictures makes learning fun and long lasting  for children.  Sometimes they even remember the story for lifetime, if they watch or read stories with photos. Many ancient stories like Bal Hanuman, Tarzan, Mowgli and others have been made into movies and comic series, which makes them a lot of fun to watch and learn. Hence, it would be right to say that pictures and words when both used together in right manner can create a long lasting effect.",
        "To conclude, pictures are more effective than words as they make the content easy to understand and fun to watch. Moreover, when used with text they could even help the child to learn tales for lifetime."
