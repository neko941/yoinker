        "Nowadays, visiting museums and some other historic sites sounds outdated. Current generations do not value the importance of visiting those places. Thus, pupils should be introduced to some historical places and be encouraged to visit them. To make a concrete action, some people think that children aged below 18 should be freed to enter the sites. In this essay, I shall provide my thoughts on why I agree with this idea.",
        "To begin with, children nowadays are more interested to spend their time on playing video games, streaming movies, and scrolling through social medias. Spending to much time on those activities can lead to some detrimental anti-social behaviours. Hence, we have to encourage children to do a positive activity instead, for example visiting museums and several historical places. Children can learn about the past life and value the beauty of archaic artefacts as well. Making it free for school-aged children to enter those sites is an initial step to gain their interest.",
        "Second, pupils have not had an income. Although museums and some historical places need the revenue for maintaining the sites, in my personal opinion children should not be charged. Those places can still have revenue streams from the adult tourists and visitors. As it is widely known, it is almost impossible for children to go there alone, they must be supervised by adults, either their teacher or their parents.",
        "In conclusion, the declining trend of visiting historical places can be overcome by encouraging people to visit them from the early age. I believe children should not be charged to enter those sites because they have not enter the productive age. I am certain that the revenue gained from adults accompanying children is more than enough for maintaining the historical places."
