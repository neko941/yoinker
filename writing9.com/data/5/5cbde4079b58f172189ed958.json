        "Currently, traffic jam has been becoming commonplace issue across the globe, even in the developed countries and in order to figure out that there are plethora of remedies are available while governments attempt to assort the most effective and convenient ones amid them. Hence, the presence of concept about the legislation tax for possessing personal vehicle separates the inhabitants to two groups and critics of that notion contemplate that as an invasion of the private rights while the adherents would advocate this because of the merits stem from that which is on par with my personal aspect. This essay will divulge both sides\u2019 advantages and draw appropriate conclusion.",
        "Perhaps it should be acknowledged that, if that initiative will be implemented it would engender declining of the usage of private cars and the collapsing of car manufacturers\u2019 sales respectively. Consequently, business sector will be baffled through that which could be deleterious for workforce sector, as well. To illustrate that the perfect example would be that, if one car plant is terminated, its staff has to become jobless which is considered as a negative impact on the government\u2019s economy.",
        "From alternative prospective, the abridgement of the usage private cars, which will have been brought about by that trend, could reduce the environmental contamination, for instance, less cars means less emission of exhausted fumes to the air. Consequently, environmental protection can avail its benefit. Furthermore, extra accumulated tax, which is allocated for usage of rail transportation, could compensate the fiscal gaps of the financial lower layout of population in countries.",
        "In conclusion, apparently, these two achievements can outstrip the drawback easily. Therefore, this legislation ought to be applied."
