        "Museums and monuments showcase rich history and cultural heritage of a country. Tourist throng and travellers are often attracted towards museums and monuments whereas local people tend to act otherwise. In this essay, we will discuss both the reason behind this behaviour as well as the enhancements required to turn the table up side down.",
        "To commence with, local people are well aware of the history and their ancestral cultural heritage, which is the most prominent factor to stop them from visiting museums very often. Furthermore, the museums stays the same for years making it very boring for frequent visitors, and the authority do not take effort in arranging a more inclusive environment to change this notion. Admission ticket charges can be another factor to limit the presence of local people in museums, because people are not very interested in investing money on something they are already aware of. Basis a recent survey, 85% of people believe that the lighting and ambience of a museum is majorly dull which results in a very depressing environment instead of uplifting and encouraging to learn more about history and heritage.",
        "To turn the table upside down, government and authority can step up with minor enhancements such as organizing role-play and cultural plays based on history fortnightly, this can attract local people to learn history in a more dramatic and interactive way. Additionally, arranging lightshows, special programs for kids and quiz programs based on traditional culture and history, would definitely help increase the number of local people to museum.",
        "In a nutshell, undoubtedly, there are numerous reasons for local people to avoid visiting museums, but, through minor improvising efforts such as arranging interactive shows, exhibitions and quizzes the decline slope can be inverted easily."
