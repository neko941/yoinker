        "It is undeniable that the arts have played a crucial role in human society for ages, however, there has been concern among some individuals that government\u2019s revenue are being contributed excessively to this creative field and that it could be effectively allocated elsewhere. While I partly agree with this view, I will argue that investment in the arts is worthy.",
        "There\u2019s no denying that authority must equally distributes money to a vast number of priorities which are immensely essential for the community as a whole, such as education, infrastructure, health care, economy and welfare. They are all key features which have the direct impact on the life\u2019s quality of billions of people worldwide. Developed nations with high standard life, namely, Sweden, Denmark, The UK, The US are investing a multitudinous amount of money on those mentioned sectors annually to secure a comfort life for their citizens.",
        "Despite of the fact that national leaders should prioritize the factors above when considering the distribution of state budget, they should acknowledge the importance of arts to the population and countries as well. They considerably help us to alleviate stress in the busy modern life. For example, after a long tiring day at work, people often opt for movies or artistic performances to unwind themselves. Furthermore, arts is also considered the cultural bridge between the past and the present of one\u2019s country. Youngsters attain comprehension and useful knowledge about their country in an accessible way through recreational artistic forms. Some popular traditional artwork in my country which deserve to be mentioned is \u2018\u2019Dong Ho paintings\u2019\u2019 which depict the daily life of Vietnamese in the past or \u2018\u2019Ca Tru Hue\u2019\u2019- our national cultural heritage recognized by UNESCO.",
        "In conclusion, I agree that state funding should be spent wisely for various purposes, it\u2019s completely worth it to be allocated for the arts."
