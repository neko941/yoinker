        "As the nations economy progresses, countries tries to move forward in all sectors, one of a vital sectors for any economy is it\u2019s transportation service they give to their citizen. Therefore, many argue that it is important to invest money in just fast moving trains. However, some argue that government of a country should spend their wealth on current public transport. In my opinion, country should first work on their existing transport structure.",
        "To begin with, there is no denying fact that laying tracks for fast moving trains is crucial, as majority of people these days spend their maximum time in travelling, owing to work or meeting relatives. And taking flight cannot be an affordable solution for a large part of a society. For example, if we see the country like India which has average speed of a train nearly 100 km per hour, it has become quiet painful for the passengers to travel for one or two days sometimes. Furthermore, if we see this with respect to economy, improved railway facilities will support the nation for the speedy inter-city import and export of a products.",
        "On the other hand, only focusing on fast moving trains can not be a solution of every problem, the questions always arises, what about the transport facilities for the people who stay in the rural areas? Particularly if we see in India, there is no efficient public transport facilities in mountainous region, there is not even proper buses facilities, Furthermore, people in outskirts also faces the problem of proper road infrastructure, as most of the road is full of potholes which results in road accidents.",
        "In conclusion, despite of the fact that there are benefits of improved railway infrastructure for the betterment of nation and reducing the travel time of people. Regardless of these benefits, I believe improving the present public transport is vital for the citizens,  as mostly the developing countries current transport facilities is not acciseble to every corner of the nation. Therefore, attaining that should be the first priority for the countries."
