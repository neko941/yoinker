        "From ancient times, there is proof that people have travelled across the world. However, tourism as a industry boomed only in the 19th century. Since then, people have travelled outside of their native country for various reasons. Although, tourism industry has helped many economies, it has also paused them some threats.",
        "The negative impact, the tourism poses to the culture of a country is inevitable. For example, when Europeans travel to Asian countries, they leave their social and cultural habits which the under- developed or developing Asian cultures willingly absorb without considering the negative impact they do their own culture and habitat. In fact, Sri Lankan cuisine was known for its goodness but when Chinese tourists started visiting Sri Lanka as a tourist destination, Sri Lankan people unknowing started to lose their authentic style of cuisine. Also with the westerners visiting Asian countries, Western restaurants like KFC, Pizza Hut, Dominos have invaded the unique food styles of these countries.",
        "One of the main drawbacks of tourism is the over-commercialization. In order to facilitate the requirements of tourists, countries try to create different offerings. Night clubs are increasing in Asian tourist destinations. The investors believe building night clubs would bring more tourists to a destination. However, it is unfortunate that these investors or the decision makers short see the negatives impacts these clubs would bring to its citizens. There have been several incidents that natives have gone bankrupt or killed themselves as this new concept of night clubs is not something they are used to do.",
        "In conclusion, whilst tourism can help economies to grow, it can also destroy them. Hence it is important that authorities take correct actions to promote tourism in a way that it protects the culture of the country its citizens."
