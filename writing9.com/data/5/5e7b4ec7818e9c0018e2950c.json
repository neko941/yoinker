        "After graduation, students often follow two career paths: proving loyalty towards only one organisation until retirement or having a wealth of experience in working for different organisations. Both paths have their own pros and cons that a person need to take account of before giving a decision to follow which path.",
        "On the one hand, a worker having experience in different workplaces has more difficulty in climbing up the career ladder. In big corporations, long-term and great contribution to the company development are two crucial keys to have job promotion. Although temporary or contract employees may have significant impact on the organisation profit, they are not as familiar to the unique working processes of the corporation and emotionally attached to the manager or other members as permanent employees do, which makes it harder for contract ones to take responsibility for a leader or a long-term project manager of the organisation.",
        "On the other hand, constant change working organisations helps a person to acquire various necessary skills and have a wide circle of friends. Working in different companies gives chance to experience a diversity of working styles and processes, which provides acquisition of a diversity of skills to adapt to different working environment. For instance, Giang \u01a0i, a Vietnamese youtuber, started her career path as a fashionista and then became a marketer for a fashion brand, which provided her necessary skills to promote her personal brand as a freelance content creator, her recent job. Moreover, working in different environment would improve a person\u2019s communication skills and widen his/ her circle of friends because he/ she has to meet many people with distinctive characteristics.",
        "In conclusion, although working for only one organisation in one\u2019s career path can give a person better chances to obtain promotion, I think it is more beneficial to jump at opportunities to experience different workplaces because it improves our communication and other vital skills, which is helpful in the fast growth rate of the worldwide economy and multicultural society nowadays."
