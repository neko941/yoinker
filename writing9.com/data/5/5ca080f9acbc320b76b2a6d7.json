        "In the light of  technological development and modern society, human are becoming more and more practical. As a result, the public remain divided on how to measure a person\u2019s quality. Some people believe that today such thing is likely to be judged by realistic achievements, instead of personalities. While this may be true to some extent, I would argue that there is a more optimal approach.",
        "It is understandable why people advocate appreciating one\u2019s worth based on power and wealth. The key rationale is that in this highly competing world, a person has to be talented and becomes one of the elite few to gain social status and richness. However, this judgement is flawed. Because it may encourage emotionless lifestyles, which has negative bearing on moral aspects of society.",
        "Above-mentioned approach aside, I strongly believe that a person\u2019s personality has to be taken into consideration. As such values have their deep roots in a nation\u2019s culture and have even contributed to it\u2019s history. In addition, these personal qualitites are the foundation of trust and share in human\u2019s daily life. My hometown perfectly examplifies this situation. It is just a transquil small town on the outskirts of Hanoi, where the economics is not so developed. As people are not busy chasing practical value, the neighbors live in harmony together, which is definitely not seen frequently in the city central.",
        "In conclusion, while judging a person based on his measurable achievements is partly valid, I am of the opinion that his personality should also be regarded as key value."
