        "It is true that most of the overpopulation leads to a variety of issues in the world. Personally, I completely agree with this statement.",
        "One worth mentioning problem is the shortage of opportunities for jobs in many major cities, especially in densely populated areas in the city center. A large number of rural migrants flock to the cities to searching for the new job of education opportunities. This current status means that there will be less opportunity for candidates especially freshly-graduated students and who are less experienced. The aggressive competition needs more qualifying rounds would be needed and more and more people will be unemployed.",
        "Apart from the practical concern expressed above, overpopulation is one of the main reasons for climate change. More people means that more and more natural resource is used. Humans exploit these natural resources, cut down trees to get paper, release polluted air from private cars, factories. All of these things make the environment becomes worse and nowadays humans have to pay for disasters that happened around the world which causes a lot of damage in daily life.",
        "Other global issues such as food security, illiteracy of poor healthcare quality are just another problem caused by the uncontrolled growth of the population. Fewer people, food supplies could be enough food and the medical care system will able to treat everybody. Children will have and receive better learning conditions so they could have a better life.",
        "In conclusion, I totally agree with the view that overpopulation causes a lot of triggers such as lack of jobs, low life quality, climate change. Many actions need to be taken to slow down the population growth worldwide."
