        "It is undeniable that we all are living in a competitive world where people succeed in their respective fields. Because of this, parents tend to put too much pressure on their children to succeed. This essay will discuss the causes for this behavior and its outcome.",
        "Some parents believe in the famous quote \u201cSurvival of the fittest\u201d which creates a feel of insecurity in their mind about their child\u2019s future. This is because they fear that their child may lag behind in achieving their dreams compared to other children and they end up cutting down on other activities of their child. For instance, in India , a few parents disconnect the cable for their television during board exams fearing that their child may get distracted. As a result, children may feel they are under pressure and they might not perform well in their exams.\u2028\u2028Furthermore, a number of parents compare their child\u2019s performance with others which will induce more stress to them. Children may also feel inferior in these situations because of which they might feel that they are not being appreciated for their hard work. Therefore, instead of  making comparisons, parents should start appreciating their kids for their efforts which will bring them happiness and they will try to perform well in the future.",
        "Having discussed all the causes, I strongly believe that putting too much pressure on the children is a negative development which will hamper their performance and happiness. It is always recommended that each and every child should be appreciated for their hard work."
