        "Some people claim that police and armed forces should define equal responsibilities for men and women. I completely agree that women should have an equivalent place to men in armed forces and police.",
        "Firstly, police and armed forces require general work which varies from documentation to fight, and woment can accomplish most of these tasks with as much confidence as men. For example, police departments and army need officers, phone operators and computer scientists and  these type of work does not require any special kind of men-work. Also, duties such as investigation or fighting requires skills to be provided by a strict training, and women who receive such kind of education have high success rates alongside the cross gender. Therefore, women can contribute these organizations at the same level with men.",
        "Another point to discuss is the different viewpoints of women and men bring more accurate handling of armed and police forces. Women have a complex and detailed insight of world, while men have a direct logic with a focus on complete image of the situations. These varying opinions enrich the perception on issues in such organizations which are established for social reasons. Incidents including women criminals can be resolved in a prompt manner when policewomen investigates them, because they can quickly get the point of the criminal since they share the same gender. Even if the case does not include women criminals, policewomen can make people to look from another facet of the case, making possible to develop a more realistic action plan rather than a poor planning.",
        "In conclusion, women should have equal roles and responsibilities with men in armed and police forces, because they are equally capable of doing the required duties and having different opinions will improve the efficiency of these organizations."
