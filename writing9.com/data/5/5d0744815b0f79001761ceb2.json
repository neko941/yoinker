        "All most people are really interested in doing business basically because this is a challenging and wealthy career. In order to run a business, remaining the profitability is an important part deciding the company survival. Therefore, some people raise the question that should all company will pay any cost to make profit. Personally, I understand the immense role of profit through I disagree with the idea that business could do anything to gain benefit because of the government law and long term running.",
        "Firstly, there are a lot of reasons the government of each country implement strict laws for business. Indeed, business have to follow the rule if not they will be punish or even be banned. Those laws not only ensure the government budget to support the social activities but also protect the fair square for all business to run. For example, Employee Code of Conduct is an international law, protecting the right of workers which all most company have to observe. In which company have responsibility to pay salary fitting with the work which employee is in charge of. If any company is suspect of violating the rule, the government will interfere.",
        "Second, in order to run company in a long-term process, it is important to take care of customer trust. Companies only consider about profit would creating low quality products which hurt customer benefit. Therefore, the client no longer wants to buy that product any more that would lead company to the edge of bankrupt. For example, in my country, Chinsu is one of the popular fish sauces. However, after the media publishes the unhealthy chemical ingredient of Chinsu products. Besides that, people said that they changed from old ingredient to that poor once with the lower price to increase profit. Hence , people stated to refuse to buy their products. This is the reason why three months latter Chinsu have do filed for bankruptcy.",
        "In short, I agree that profit is one of the important target of business but doing anything to reach that target is not a good idea. Companies need to follow the government\u2019s law to ensure their business run smoothly. Furthermore, to operate business in a long path, besides profitability, company also need to care about the customer benefits."
