        "In contemporary era,technology is mushrooming day by day. Due to the vehicles it easier to go one place to another place.Now many people says that the limit age should be increased  for driving to make driving safe.I partially agree with this statement.",
        "To begin with, Age limit is important for the driving .Firstly if the younger person below the age of eighteen drive the vehiles there is high risk of accident because some young childrean drive vehicles very fast.As the result it occurs the high rate of accident.For example ,In my city the younger boy age of fifteen died because he drive car very fast and strunk into the truck .Secondly , it create the problem for the elder persons also because they face lot of problem due to the youngster who drive very fast.",
        "On other hand, Age limit is not important for the driving because sometime youngster go one place to another place for their work .For example ,if the girl age of seventeen go to market for his important work the she go market on scooty .Moreover some youngster are very intelligent they can easily learn the driving and they are very attractive while driving or sometime they drive better then the elder persons.Furthermore some youngster has huge responsibility of their family also .So they  fulfil their family duteis also.",
        "In conclusion ,I think It depends on persons driving hos they drive because every person has your own hand."
