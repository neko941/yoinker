        "Renewable sources of energy like solar and wind have taken over the main energy sources like coal ,oil and natural gas used in several countries. Solar energy innovation is now being promoted for increased usage in various places across the country. This essay discusses the contentious argument regarding its merits and demerits.",
        "Fossil fuels used in the form of coal oil and natural gas is rampantly used everywhere because of its easy availability and cheaper price. The U.S government has made this source of energy reacheable to common people at a subsidized rate, including the tax which also gets decreased. Whether people are travelling at 3 am or 3 pm, what matters is their gas tanks are filled with fuel. The major drawback with fossil fuels is that it needs ground drilling which is causing water pollution. Not only that, people should not forget about the green house gas emission. In addition to this, with constant usage, there will be scarcity of this resource in the near future.",
        "Considering the modern innovation of the solar technology, the impact is mostly beneficial. The energy source is renewable and with the  improvement in technology , the cost will also decrease as there will be no scarcity of this resource in the days to come. All the more ,it is unaware to cause any sorts of pollution with the solar plant installation on the roof surface which can be easily accessed anytime. The only negative aspect is that it  has still not been universally accepted because the cost is alarming with the photovoltaics technology. Since it is a new innovation, this requires some time  for people to adjust.",
        "To conclude, there are pros and cons both with the renewable source of energy and the fossil fuel. However , looking into the future, solar energy is much  more promising due to its new innovation technology."
