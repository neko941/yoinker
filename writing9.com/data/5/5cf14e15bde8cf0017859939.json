        "Tourism is a popular leisure activity. More and more people are now travelling to other countries for higher studies, business and medical treatment as well as enjoyment. Most individuals assert that tourists should emulate local customs and behaviours when they travel abroad. Others, while, think that host Nation should respect their cultural diversity. I will discuss both the views in this essay and try to draw a conclusion.",
        "On the one hand, some people think that there are tremendous reasons of adopting the customs of host country. One of the indispensable causes is that it escalates the understanding regards their culture. Having more understanding about overseas' tradition makes feel comfortable in their community. So, people who adopt their tradition despite scarcity of knowledge about host country's heritage, they do enjoy their festivals. Furthermore,  tourists who emulate local customs and behaviour, not only develop their life style by learning new languages, but also they do not face any cultural problem in future when they will again visit to same Nation. Thus, that's why they believe that visitors should imitate overseas' tradition. On the other hand, it is often believed that there are abundance of reasons of cultural diversity",
        "To commence with, when the foreign country does impose rules on the visitors forcefully in order to follow local culture exclusively. Nevertheless, sightseers' own cultural should also have respected everywhere. For instance, if the tourists eat vegetarian food, they should not force to eat non- vegetarian food just because host country's people eat that. Therefore, freedom should be provided to visitors in order to adopt the heritage. Moreover, owing to ignoring their own heritage and attracts towards foreign country's tradition. Hence that's why numerous individuals assert that cultural diversity",
        "In conclusion, certainly, the knowledge about culture of other nation's and lifestyle of holiday makers have enhanced. However, sighseers' own customs do not get adequate respect in the foreign. In my opinion, I consider that travellers should copy other nation's customs and behaviour to improve their lifestyle."
