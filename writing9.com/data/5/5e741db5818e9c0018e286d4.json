    "question": "Under British and Australian laws a jury in a criminal case has no access to information about the defendant\u2019s past criminal record. This protects the person who is being accused of the crime. Some lawyers have suggested that this practice should be changed and that a jury should be given all the past facts before they reach their decision about the case. Do you agree or disagree?",

        "In England and Australia, a jury is not allowed to have ay information about the offende\u2019s past. Some lawers suggest that having the past criminal record will help the judge make a judgement more accurately. From my point of view, this issue should be cosidered carefully because this is a big area.",
        "Actually, the lawers who try to reduce the level of the crime. So they find some positive points related to his/her past. For example, if a person has never committed a crime in a past, the court can rely on its to reduce their sentences. . Image being in a murder trial, whether you want to know about the defendant\u2019s past or not? Maybe they do so just for self-defense or they have certain suffering that can not be told. Therefore, comprehensive understanding helps to prevent the misunderstanding and misjudgement.",
        "On the other hand, social prejudices about people\u2019s past are often unconsiously affectted from what happened in the past. If the guilty person does not committed the crime, the negative influence of his/her past might define him/her criminal. In terms of fairness, the defendant would not encounter with unjustified judgement just because of some minor previous mistakes.",
        "In short, to judge a person should not base on a aspect but the whole things. A jury should have sufficient envident and depend on the seversity of the case. The defendant\u2019s past criminal record could be a piece of convincing evidence that makes it easier to solve, sometimes the opposite."
