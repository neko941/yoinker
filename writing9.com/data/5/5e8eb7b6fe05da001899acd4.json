When we talk about this topic, it is worth to remember that the unambiguous opinion won't come. But   I\u2019m going to give at least a few points for your personal thoughts.",
        "First I wanna say  that incredible speed of technological development is the dictates of time, so because of it, we just have no opportunity to ban or prohibit using the gadgets despite their detrimental effects on health, and this are no mentions the dependencies in the game, and social networks. And as I think it\u2019s a really serious global problem.  But on the other hand different new apps and websites give people a lot of information about ways of treatments. Or using the social networks you can tell people about your problems and with common effort there will be a high probability of finding solution to your question.",
        "What about replacement real communication to online chatting? One wise person said\u201d To get closer to the person - you need to talk with him face to face at least once.\u201d And I just have no argue with this words. On the whole, main goal of creating social networks was help people keeping in touch and do it very fast, easy and cheap. Of course, it\u2019s incredible alternative to sending letters like last century. But as a consequence of the inviting this brilliant things, humanity began to prefer use online life everywhere. Obviously communicate with others as a regular account in SN easier, you can tell anything you want, violating the privacy of others and remaining unpunished. Doesn\u2019t it sound temptingly?",
        "Finally, all I want say is that SN conquered the world and what it will lead to we will be able to know only after seeing the result. But please pay attention to your behavior in IT and try to live your life offline."
