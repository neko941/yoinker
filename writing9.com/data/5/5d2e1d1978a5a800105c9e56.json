        "The worrying trend of decreasing birth rate is observed in many countries, in particular the developed ones. It is possible to identify causes driving this phenomenon, which, I believe, would have a negative impact on those societies.",
        "The change in people\u2019s mentality has influenced the choince of the number of children many couples would like to have. Certainly, most western societies are the consumerist ones. What this means is that peaople feel they must have the most recent gagets or other pieces of technology. As a result many choose to concentrate on their careers, so that they could earn more, instead of looking after children. Besides, every child is a noticeable finantial cost to the parents, as the need to provide them with food, clothing and education. Therefore, it is becoming more common that young adults decide to live with all the comforts the world can provide instead of having many children.",
        "Although this situation presents the benefit of wealthy living while being young, it might have detrimental consequences for the future. Firstly, the economic impact; smaller numbers of working age residents will result in lower amount of taxes paid. This, in turn, would mean lower pensions for the retired. Secondly, medical developments contribute to increasing human life span. This in addition to already mentioned decreasing numbers of those working might create a serious problem with healthcare provision. If there are not enough candidates to fill in the vacancies in hospitals and care homes, the elderly will experience low quality of care. Hence, in the long run declining birth rates could have negative impact on the society.",
        "In conclusion, many couples decide to have less than two children so they can enjoy life. In my firm opinion, this phenomenon would be detrimental for the future of many societies."
