        "Museums is a good source of awareness of history and many foreigners want to visit museums when they went for travel in another country. Nowadays, everyone have to pay for visit some museums and I think it gives a bad impact on society because the citizens of a country have a right to know the history at free of cost so there should not be any entrance fee for museums.",
        "To embark, I believe that the disadvantages of the charge for admission in museums outweigh the disadvantages because there can be a detrimental effects by this, for example, people are discouraged to visit museums and not be able to access fruitful knowledge of history, furthermore, poor people can not afford such amounts, therefore, they do not go to the museums because they can not be able to pay an entry fee. From museum perspective, there will be reduction in the number of customers so it can be a high possibility of close the museum. I noticed that young people or students prefer to go for a historical movie instead museum because they think they will have to pay for both of them and noone gives them an information of history freely, that's why they consider watch a movie which is based on historical events as a good source of entertainment and better choice than visit to the museum.",
        "On flip side of the coin, there are also some advantages of charge an entry fee. Firstly and main reason is that museum need money for maintenance, run their business, electricity and water bill etc. Secondly, it requires money to update their exhibits and to improve the place effectively for attract people or visitors by keep the place clean and good looking, moreover, I learnt that those museums which sell tickets are far better than those that do not charge an entrance fee in terms of their place, information and maintenance.",
        "To sum up, entrance chargge should not be applied in the museums because of its merits such as, for attract the student and the locals towards museums and free of charge should be considered."
