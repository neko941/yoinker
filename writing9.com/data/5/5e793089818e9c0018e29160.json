        "Let me explain how it happened. I had the camera with me all the time, as you said, but it happens as such that I was taking a picture, and I got a pushed, which was unintentional by my uncle, and the camcorder fell off my hand, and so the lens got damaged. I know I should\u2019ve been more careful, but it just occurred in a fraction of a second.",
        "After that, I took it right away to the company store, which was nearby. He examined the camcorder thoroughly and suggested that the lens cannot be repaired and had to get it replaced, so I placed an order for that, and it shall arrive in two to three days. Fortunately, all the memory is safe, and none of them got deleted.",
        "I do apologize, and I would let you know as soon as it gets repaired, and I would personally come to give it back to you. I hope you understand.",
