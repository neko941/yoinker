        "It is a common thought that having university diploma is the main key to excellent job. However there is another group of people who have another conception, which advocates being accepted by showing skills and presenting experience. Honestly, I am of the opinion of the second group, since I prefer to estimate employees by looking at their abilities and potential.",
        "Admittedly, it is acknowledged that a student might not have bright perspectives in his future career without studying whole 4 years at an academy where he receives much knowledge, theory and proficient practice. This point could be agreeable, however there got to be an evidence that the student is able to manage the work. The diploma may not always be enough reliable indicator for that. There were many cases where passionate students in pursuit of a high GPA had been cheating in their long journey of learning, which may be full of struggle and pain.",
        "Nowadays, internet is filled by many websites which share ready graduate works. Video-lessons where learners can be taught about cheating tips in platforms such as youtube and tiktok are recruiting the vast number of views. Obviously university teaches  an enormous amount of knowledge, however not all of graduates manage to understand that input. Having a diploma and a high score of GPA can not guarantee employers that he is going to hire a highly qualified postgraduate.",
        "For this reason, having an experience and professional skills may be significantly crucial for being ready to start working and fulfilling tasks. One clear example is an online school of languages where I am currently gaining experience as a young teacher. If I had known about this school earlier, I would have applied there a year ago. Unfortunately, I had misbeliefs in my mind as the first group of people have right now.",
        "In the conclusion I want to say that I do believe that universities release many skillful employees, but I can not accept the concept that it might be the best path to success."
