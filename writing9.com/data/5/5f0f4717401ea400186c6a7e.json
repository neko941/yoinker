        "One of the widely discussed issues nowadays is frequency of providing homework to children. It is undeniable that assimilating knowledge and gaining academic achievement via doing homework constantly has become an essential part of life. However, there is no absolute agreement on whether pedagogical experts should give homework everyday or children should be encouraged to fulfill homework several times a week.",
        "A commonly held belief is that pupils cannot withstand the load which includes mass of variety homework given by teachers. As evidence of this they point to children who suffer from stress or even depression due to(gerund,noun) incomplete home tasks. Furthermore, instead of doing homework, the majority of children can spend the time on leisure or developing themselves in other fields. It could be explained by the fact that they do not have fairly enough time to complete them, therefore they believe that it affects on their admission to higher education institutions, while those who allocate time otherwise want to be more versatile. As a result, it leads to suicides or excellent expression of various skills.",
        "On the other hand, some people claim that children must be got home tasks. For example, they may mention that homeworks can improve ability of self-study and study skills. In addition, contribution is made by doing homeworks to communication betrween pupils which sometimes leads to group works. The explanation lies in the fact that home tasks evolve characteristics as socializing or exploring information deeply. Therefore, children should be more conscious in order to realize it.",
        "In conclusion, taking everything mentioned into account I would argue that pupils have to be obliged to do home tasks for the sake of themselves\u2019 benefits."
