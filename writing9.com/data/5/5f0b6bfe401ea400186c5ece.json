        "There is an ongoing debate about who is responsible for our own happiness. While some believe that it is associated with some circumstances surrounding their life, I agree with those who feel only individuals have control over their happiness.",
        "On the one hand, it is thought that some conditions prevail over the life, which do not allow us feel complete satisfaction. Those who supported that often believe people cannot choose where they born or  their parents. For example, there are many low-income countries in South Africa where fast growing population actually suffer from shortage food supply. Children born in impoverished family could be fed with inadequate nutrition even though their parents might take child abuse. Moreover, some argued that disability as well as ill people would not enable to live fulfilling life because of fragile health.",
        "I, however, believe that happiness relies on us with perceiving a situation clearly. Despite the fact that, people might grow at poor area, they could change their life by immigrating to another affluent country or educate themselves to survive in this condition. In my opinion, if people change their mindset avoid frustrating things can become happy even though they have health issue or not. For example, the great Russian composer Tchaikovsky was born blind however it could not be prevailing him from writing popular composition.",
        "To sum up, while some argued that happiness depends on some factors, I strongly believe that only we are responsible for own satisfaction and it would be obvious when we transform our perception."
