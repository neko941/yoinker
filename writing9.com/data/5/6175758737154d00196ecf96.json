        "Nowadays, it is difficult for many children to stay focus at schools. In this essay, I will examine two main causes of this issue, and propose some possible solutions.",
        "Firstly, one of the main causes which reduce children's concentration is that some parents allow their kids play mobiles phone too much. Obviously, when kids are playing more online games or watching VDO clips, they will pay attention to study lesser. Nevertheless, the possible solution to solve this is limiting the spending of time on using mobile devices. Moreover, parents should encourage their children to do more social activities than playing electronic devices. Consequently, this will help children to be more focus at schools.",
        "Secondly, another main cause of distract children from schools is that there are so many attractive activities. For example, some teenagers found that they would rather going surfing than studying in the classroom. Therefore, they prefer surfing the internet all the time. Nonetheless, the possible solution to fix it is not allow them using any mobile device during the class. While promoting the physical fun activities such as football, basketball, etc. is necessary to draw their attention, and it will improve their ability to focus.",
        "In conclusion, it is undeniable that many children today are hard to concentrate to the classroom. Although this may cause by using too much devices and being easier to access interesting activities, schools and parents can fix this problem by limit the using time of mobile phones as well as not allow then to use it in lecture rooms."
