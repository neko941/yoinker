        "In recent years, the world has been face with the issue of atmospheric detoriation. This challenging problem is mostly caused by deforestation of plant life and the use of fossil fuel as a major source of energy. Solutions such as afforestation and the use of electricity and solar energy can replace the use of fossil fuel so as  to produce a  clean and healthy air. These reasons mentioned above and solutions given will be discussed in the following paragraphs.",
        "",
        "Nowadays, modification of the environment in the form of development has altered the natural ecosystem. The process of plant respiration produces oxygen which is vital to humans. Biological studies shows that plants inhale our used gas which is carbondioxide and exhales oxygen. Therefore, deforestation of trees alters this environmental balance as there are not enough trees to give out oxygen. In addition, the use of fossil fuel as a major source of energy in the world has caused a tremendous decline in the environment. Fossil fuels such as diesel and fuel is used by the automobiles, aviation and other industries. Consequently, these engines pollutes the entire air with its product which is carbondioxide thus replacing the amount in circulation.",
        "Are there solutions to these problems discussed?.  Yes, there are. The government has a role to play in ensuring there is clean and healthy surrounding which is making strict laws to regulate deforestation and encouraging the masses to imbibe the habit of planting tree. A recent survey shows that countries like Seychelles and Bahamas who prohibited unnecessary falling of trees. Resulting to little or no environmental challenges. Furthermore, automobile and aviation companies should manufacture engines that consume less fuel and produces less emition of CO in turn. Recent introduction of solar and cell powered cars is a major step to curbing the problem of pollution in the atmosphere.",
        "",
        "In conclusion, with the political will towards deforestation and the use of battery and solar cars, the issue of environmental depletion will be taken care of."
