        "While some demographics of society opine that museums should act as entertainment hubs, critics argue that these sites should foster educational values among visitors. Although both the conflicting perceptions have their own justification, I strongly agree with the latter viewpoint.",
        "It is fairly easy to comprehend why some individuals are in harmony with the former assertion. This is simply because they believe if there is too much emphasis on acquainting visitors with historic and scientific facts, people will feel boredom and it will probably restrict their revisiting tendency; consequently, the statistics pertaining to visits to these exhibitions centres will drop exponentially. In order to avoid this downfall, art galleries should serve the purpose of entertainment by acting as entertainment outlets which will definitely allure the target audience, especially the youngsters. To illustrate, unique and fascinating games at museums not only help to rejuvenate exhausted minds but also encourage individuals to visit again and again. In short, being able to amuse masses means museums will be able to survive and thrive.",
        "Meanwhile, I along with others firmly criticise this idea and acknowledge that these sites can work wonders in promoting cultural awareness when these are focused at educating individuals. When masses see astonishing collection of artefacts used previously by their ancestors, they would be able to make fine judgements about cultural values which are regarded as soul of every culture; resultanly, they will get deep understanding of their culture. For example, one can get amazing experience of Punjabi culture by visiting Khalsa heritage, museum located at Anandpur Sahib, as curators available over there provide guidance about the exhibited tools and objects. Thus, these exhibition centres could prove extremely advantageous in familiarising people with their cultural roots if these are aimed at educating masses.",
        "Conclusively, despite the fact that museums could provide recreational and entertaining activities, I would argue the main aim of these sites must be to educate people."
