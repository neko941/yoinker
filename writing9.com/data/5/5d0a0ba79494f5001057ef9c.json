        "In recent times,  individuals purchase trendy clothes and hairstyles in a good number of nations around the globe. This can be attributed to technological advancement and the advent of several social media fora. In my opinion, I am of the view that this is a bad occurrence and this essay would discuss the adverse impacts it has had on individuals and societies as a whole.",
        "To begin with, technological discoveries has allowed for a lot of innovative ideas,  such as the discovery of modern dresses and hair and their easy production. In fact,  unlike the dark ages where hair designs could only be made by visiting saloons, technological advancement has allowed hairstyles to be ready-made and available to wear when required. Also,  this discovery is not limited only hairdos but has been adopted even in clothing lines. For example, headgears used to be expertly tied on the would be user but now headgears are being made into autogeles just like hats. Furthermore, the general acceptability of the use of social media has also made trendy clothes and hairstyles popular and acceptable by many person in a good number of countries. For instance, Facebook,  Instagram,  Watspp, Snapchat platforms amongst others make it easy for interested individuals to place order for desired wears anywhere in the world, regardless, of distance with deliveries made to one's doorstep.",
        "Nonetheless, the shortfalls of this development is huge because this has made people to become more materialistic in nature. The cost of purchase of these fashion items are quite expensive and equally costly to deliver. As a result, young people would go to any length to acquire funds for their purchase. In fact, this has led to the rise in several fraudulent activities like identity theft,  internet fraud,  stealing and so on. In addition,  the perceived need to meet up with the standard of living of their peergroup is as a result of peer pressure caused by wanting to be up to date with every fashion trend. Additionally,  peer pressure has led to the breakage of marriages because most ladies would prefer to life as a divorcee and live a costly life financed by wealthy men than remain a reputable married woman and live a moderate life. The social ills caused by the contant rise in broken homes is innumerable.",
        "To conclude, in my view, I  believe that there is a rise in the demand for latest fashion in clothes and hairdo because of technological advancement and the use of social media.  However,  this had had serious repercussions on individuals and the society as a whole."
