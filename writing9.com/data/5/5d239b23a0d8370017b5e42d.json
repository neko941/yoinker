        "Advancements in technology have given several essential things which are extremely beneficial for humans. Computer technology has widely improved, along with certain softwares that can translate any language all around the world. In my opinion,I believe that even if technology has improved and made our life easier, learning foreign languages is not a waste. Afterall,studying other countries\u2019 languages not only empowers people to communicate with foreigners but also opens the global career opportunities.",
        "Firstly, in jobs and academic studies, certain softwares are extremely useful in converting native dialect sentences into foreign languages. However, in the case of the visiting a foreign country, these softwares are not reliable enough to conduct conversations with foreigners. For instance, if someone want wants to visit remote areas where computers do not work efficiently, or doesnt give the proper meanings of certain words, it could be very difficult to communicate and ask for what we need. Therefore, if a person has studied and has a good understanding of the countrie's language that they are visiting, then it would be more comfortable for them to converse with the local people.",
        "Furthermore, if a student wants to travel abroad for higher education, relying on just computer technology does not help , since foreign universities require sound knowledge of English or other native dialects which are helpful in applying for foreign jobs as well. Consequently, if students have proper knowledge of the other countrie's languages, they will definitely find success in their academics as well as in the career.",
        "In conclusion, undoubtedly, learning foreign languages are crucial, although computer technology is also helpful in other fields such as, doing quick calculations and recording large amounts of data."
