        "There has been an ongoing controversy which has led to the question \u201cDo individuals place preference on carrying out school assignments in teams or personally?\u201d As much as people like personal study to avoid biased opinion from others, I believe strongly that , homeworks are easily performed in groups than individually because it produces better results and broadens ones knowledge.",
        "On one hand, human beings like the idea of doing the assignment being given to them by their institution on their own because of the high rise of biase that may erupt. It has been discovered that people who carry out school research individually, tend to build their confidence overtime as no one will put them down publicly while suggestions are brought up during deliberations on the solution.",
        "On the other hand, the power of team work in resolving a research work given by ones institution cannot be overemphasized ,as this will improve ones IQ magnificently. In addition, the ideas being given by other researchers in the group will broaden your knowledge and scope of how things work and further educate you. For instance, a set of 5 students found out that people who work together in researching on a school homework, produce better results which can serve for reference purposes.",
        "In conclusion, people like to do school deligations in a group than by one self for many reasons. However, in my opinion the essence of working in a group is to understand better ways of doing things and producing future articles for upcoming researchers. This will further improve our libraries and assist anyone carrying out such project in the future."
