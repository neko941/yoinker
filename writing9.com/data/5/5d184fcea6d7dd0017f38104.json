        "Most of the day is spent in the work environment performing our various tasks. However, It is said by some populace that maintaining a good relationship in the office is not necessary as our major aim should be on the getting job done. I strongly disagree with this statement as I believe that connection should be made in the work place for future purposes as well as to promote togetherness.",
        "Firstly, I believe one should establish long standing friendships in the office as this can be useful in the future. As the saying goes, \"No man is an island\" thus when in need, we can turn to friends made in the office. Friends made in the place of assignment can be needed to render help during emergencies or when in need. For instance, it was reported in the paper that a dying man who could not afford his surgery, was saved and operated on by his colleague's father who is a renowned surgeon. This could only happene due to the fact that the co-workers maintained cordial affiliations.",
        "Also, having a good relationship in the office is paramount as this help to foster one spirit and togetherness. To achieve a common goal, one needs a firm where everyone see each other as family and all are keen towards helping one another grow and accomplish his tasks.Most companies see this as essential which is why they organize team bonding, picnics and end of year party. To exemplify,In the recent inter company competition, which was widely publicised, the winner- ABC enterprises won due to team spirits and solid relationship amongst the employees . All this and more is the benefit of having good affiliation with your colleagues.",
        "To conclude, while some believe that an office should be just a place to carry out your primary assignment. I disagree with this view and I suggest that our heart should be opened to opportunities and relationships that can be formed in the work environment as this will go a long way in our future."
