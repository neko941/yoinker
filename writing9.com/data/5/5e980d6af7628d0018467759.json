        "It is true that online shopping has gained a great popularity in the recent years. From my perspectives, I believe that this trend is beneficial to the environment and job offers in the short term. Nevertheless, it will probably be more harmful in the long term.",
        "First and foremost, our surroundings will be less polluted because of the popularity of online shopping. As people do home-shopping, the use of private means of transport will reduce when a huge number of goods is carried only by one delivery truck. Accordingly, the amount of toxic fumes will considerably decline which contributes to the fresher air. In the long run, however, greenhouse emissions will possibly get more serious. More delivery vehicles will be required to serve the growing number of individuals who enjoy shopping in the Internet. Therefore, the atmosphere will perhaps get worse and worse since big kinds of transport, particularly vans, emit more exhaust fumes then small ones.",
        "Speaking of the types of jobs, there will be a variety of job opportunities relating to online shopping for people to apply, such as online sellers, web designers, online advertisement designers, web managers and shippers. With the plentiful job sources like that, unemployment will not be an enormous problem anymore. People who need a job will have so many choices for their favorite kinds of work to do, and thus, they can find so much job satisfaction. Nevertheless, it seems that this development is just helpful in the short run. In the future, physical stores and retailers will doubtlessly go bankruptcy if online purchasing gets too common and shoppers just keep staying at home to purchase everything through Internet. This also negative affects some kinds of traditional workers such as job assistants, stewards and receptionists. For example, because too many people are into buying food and having it shipped to home, physical eateries have to be closed. Moreover, restauranteurs, waiters, waitresses and chefs will go jobless.",
        "All things considered, e-shopping is only advantageous to humans and environment in the near future but if we foresee longer, it is going have a number of demerits."
