        "Pollution is a major drawback to keep air -quality good as per ratio in the past years whereas less uses of cars.By the time,the popularity of cars has risen in use which convert into argued matter between two types of individuals.some people believes car free days a good solution to preserve the aura ,on contrary I believe with other ways are most effective and should taken into consideration .",
        "On the one hand, many people think that avoid cars for a day would reduce the air problems when this method follow up on global scale .firstly , the phenomenon encourage the people to use public transport where this would beneficially shift up the revenue for government.secondly,people may adapt the lifestyle without using the cars so they will be less dependent on their vehicles but also they consider by walking or using bicycle alleviate the traffic fumes.",
        "On the other hand, I believe that this is better to apply others ways to prevent atmospheric pollution while regimes expose an environment tax which car drivers and factories in all countries are forced to pay for the damage.Therefore, they would minimise the use of fuel and gases at their work place. Another effective propaganda to do campaigns can be run to provide wealth of information relate to air pollution.so they attract to aware of air quality degradation and play a part in protecting the air.",
        "In conclusion,single day brings some basic impacts on protecting the environment but it seems to me others solution is more effective for air quality which is more significant."
