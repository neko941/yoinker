        "A group of masses argue that University education should be made compulsory for completely free for all individual irrespective of financial well being .Will fully sponsored higher education brings all good? I opened that this will bring more bad to government than good my opinion is justified in following paragraphs .",
        "To begin with it is impractical to expect that government funds higher education for all aspirants of society. Because this will put more financial burden on Nation. This burden is generated by expenditure incurred in remunerations and support educational requirements of all. It will be difficult for any nation to facilitate free higher education from its own funds and does quality of education will suffer at long run. Moreover, if the tertiary education is made completely free then level of competition among masses will decrease completing four in higher University will lack motivation.Hence level of education will degrade.",
        "Instead of free access to universities for all, it will be better to sponsor the education of meritorious students only, is given to weaker sections of the society also. In addition to this, in spite of University education government should pay more attention on vocational training. Because vocational training gives opportunity to develop learners talents. For example, in USA vocational training is given free of cost to natives which help students in finding easy employment and paying their tuition fee for higher education.",
        "In conclusion all Du University education is vital it should not be free for all deserving student should avail free education."
