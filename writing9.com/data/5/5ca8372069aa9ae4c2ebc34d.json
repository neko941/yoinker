        "Starting to learn a foreign language at primary school instead of secondary school is considered by most of the people to be better for children. From my point of view, I think that this perspective is having more prons than cons.",
        "First and foremost, children at a younger age have the greatest ability to concentrate on anything compare to adolescent. Indeed, primary school students will have the higher capable of learning more quickly than secondary school students. To illustrate, the possibility of children at a age of 4 to 6 is able to success from learning how to ride a bicycle is bigger than a teenage at a age of 16 to 18. Due to this reason, the benefits of young generation to start learning a foreign language at primary school rather than secondary school outweighs the disadvantages.",
        "On the other hand, some people support the opinion that it might contains disadvantages if children start to learn a different language at primary school. Perhaps students at primary school still unable to understand most of the knowledge or language taught by teachers very well and this probably will cause primary school students to fell stress. Nevertheless, younger children are more easily influence by adult such as parents and teachers. Younger generation will probably to imitate the actions of adult or even what adult have said. Undoubtedly, if students in primary school who life in the circumstance that the teachers is communicating with each other using foreign language, they will have the greatest ability to achieve well in that foreign language. Therefor, owing to this, primary school students will have the good opportunity to learn a different language at a younger age which can also improve their communicating skills.",
        "In the conclusion, the merits of children begin to learn a foreign language in primary school compare to secondary school is outweighs the drawbacks as it provided a better chance for a younger age children to learn a different language more earlier and allow them to have more understanding on other culture."
