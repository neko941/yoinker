        "Colours hve always played an important role in our lives. Psychologists have done some research recently and it showed that colours have a great impact on people\u2019s feelings. That\u2019s why I believe that workplaces or hospitals should have proper colours and decorations, which can actively boost people\u2019s possibility and influence the mood states of patients and workers.",
        "For me, every hospitals should decorate with suitable colour so that it can give patients a good atmosphere. Nowadays the majority of children are often scared when going to hospital. Applying bright colours such as light blue, green or pink can make them feel better. For example, we not only see appropriate colour decoration in hospitals but also at schools that can reduce the negative feeling for adolescents and increse the number of positive behaviors to make them feel good.",
        "Most workplaces occasionally use a different color to represent their job such as light colour or bold colour. Their choices of colour design often depends on their field work. Using bright colour or bold colour can make the rooms seem larger or brighter. Moreover, these colours can make the officers become more passionate abor their job. Nevertheless, those colours not only affect workers but also customers who come to the companies. Offices are mostly painted with light contrast colours which is believed to create fresh thinking in the midst of overwhelming worl pressure. And for customers, those colours make them intersted when they enter in the offices.",
        "In conclusion, the energy of colours are widely used in decorating particular builidings to bring possibilities to people. I truly believe that we should be aware that colours do play a very important part in our daily lives."
