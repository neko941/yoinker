        "International sports had gained immense attention from past ten years . Majority of people have developed a deep nationalism feeling for their countries specific sports like football , cricket.Sometimes this patriotic nature towards a game can  releasing international tensions between two countries and it is good for the developing countries in my opinion.",
        "Coming to the thought , developing countries like India has gained a huge trend of sports to exemplify India won the world cup in 1983,under captaincy of Kapil dev in international cricket.Whenever, India had won against ,the nation had always enjoyed the pride and nation's love feeling.So as the mindset of civilized people is changing, tension's and rivalries between there two nations have changed and governments had also started developing a good trade bond In Individual's,now have started respecting the game either they win or lose ,a hatred sense donot develop in them.",
        "Moreover, another game called football ,The level of craziness for its world cup cannot be predicted in mere. According  a research by Sports academy of London ,about 1 million of population have a sense of huge national respect towards their country.Because  of education , people are mentally developed And have patriotic feel towards the game as they are very much attached to their favorite players.For instance ,when Ronaldino palyed a massive match against Netherlands,after that too team lost the game,inspite of that, also player shaked hand with opposition team captain and showed respect to the winning team.Such instances leaves a great impact on the people watching them on television .These events not only entertains but also imparts message to the youngsters a feeling of togetherness and love for other countries.",
        "To conclude, whether it is football or cricket world cup these events at a massive level changes the mentality of people and releases a sense of patriotism at a greater level  and i strongly agree to this opinion."
