        "It is often argued by some that a picture is worth more than a thousand words, hence, stories in the media such as television, magazines should be accompanied regularly with them. This essay agrees that pictorial representation are more significant than textual presentation, and will state that the use of images helps the audience to easily assimilate the information, and it will also help uneducated viewers have access to data.",
        "To begin, the main reason why pictorial presentation should be attached to news is because it helps the listeners/viewers easily assimilate the news. Put in another way, it helps them to understand the news and also gives them an idea of what it might contain even before perusing the paper. For instance, a candid image of a team rejoicing on the front page of the newspaper already portrays a message that the reader can easily relate with even without going through the texts attached to the photograph.",
        "Another point to consider, is that the use of these pictural depictions gives the uneducated viewer an avenue to access news information. In other words, illiterates who find it hard to read can follow the news carefully by viewing the pictures attached. The less educated public expressed their Joy in the recent view by the popular human right activists Fela Bobola. They were grateful that the Punch newspaper included more pictorial presentation in the dailies as this has helped become more informed about the happenings in their environment.",
        "In conclusion, In order to involve every member of the society in current information, it is highly necessary that the media houses continue to include photographs in the newspaper,magazines and television."
