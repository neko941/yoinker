        "Experts throughout both the developing and developed world have debated whether art or science has greater impact on our lives. This essay will discuss both sides using examples from the UK government and Oxford University to demonstrate points and prove arguments.",
        "There is ample evidence that the arts have paved the way for ground breaking discoveries, merely by conceptulising them long before the real world scientists figure out how to build them. The central reason behind this is twofold, firstly the only limitation constraint in the field of painting or music is usually ones imagination. Secondly, in disciplines such as art the idea just has to be visualised and perhaps explained, this considerably easier than actually creating or building the idea, nevermind a prototype. For example, recent emperical research by the UK government demonstrated that almost all inventions of the last 100 years were first found in books and artistic reproductions, long before been constructed by scientists or technologists. It must not be forgotten that although the inventions were not actually made by their creators, they most definetely inspired or provided a possible direction for the more industrially minded. Therefore it is conclusively clear that although the impact of artistic creation is not felt immediately by society, they undoubtedly act as possible guide.",
        "Although their is a case for dancers, sculpturists, painters, artists and composers enriching socety, the impact of chemists, bioligists,physicists cannot be overstated. This largely because before any device or discovery has any influence on society it has to be made, tested, proven and even then marketed. For example, an extensive study by Oxford University showed that over 6% ideas dreamt up by artists and the like are actually made in real life. Consistent with this line of thinking is that a considerable amount of important products or discoveries were in fact accidental, microwave technology, penecelin and even viagra. Thus it is possible beyond doubt that the work of scientists has a tremendeous impact on modern day life.",
        "From the arguements and examples given I firmly belive that although the creative fields provide an in valuable contribution to our lives, the role of science is much more practical, it is felt on a daily basis, and therefore its impact is considerably greater. It is predicted that the role of science and technology will increasingly grow in importance."
