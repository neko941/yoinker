        "There is certainly a debate on this either modern tools and gadgets reduce one\u2019s creativity or not. In my opinion, these new products didn\u2019t affect any creativity rather it gives new direction towards some aspects of life which was not possible before.",
        "Firstly, I don\u2019t think new products and gadgets has any detrimental affect on creativity instead it gives new directions. In the past when these things are not available people may find it hard to produce any creative thing due to limited resources but nowadays its very convenient for them to produce new things by using new tools. New gadgets help them to make and come up with things which are not possible in the past. New generations are fully aware of using these new tools for their own benefits and come up with new and better ideas.",
        "Secondly, social media plays a big role in shaping modern world. People get inspiration by watching videos from all around the world with the help of single click from the comfort of their home or office. However, In the past its not easy to know culture of other countries and people may have limited resources and knowledge about that. Their creativity revolves around the same area where they spend their life. Now people mix different cultures together and come up with innovative things. For instance, Elan brand from Pakistan introduce new lawn design by mixing Chinese and Indian culture and colour pallet which got sold like hot cakes.",
        "To conclude, I believe new gadgets and products actually help people to be more creative and produce things which are not possible in the past."
