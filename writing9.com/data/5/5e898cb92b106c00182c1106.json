        "With the concern being expressed over whether most individuals think that speech communion could be more forceful or epistolary intercourse.Although, while this trend shows some minor benefits and possible drawbacks. I would argue that this written communication has a great advantages in term of their study.",
        "On the one hand, I think that oral communication is not remembered for a long time. It is fair to say that information that a person hear now can be easily forgotten then . For example, maximum this conversation might be held approximately for 3 or 4 days. In addition, occasionally students cannot speak some words to a person when the student is introvert and he or she has some complexes. Which in turn, cannot express his or her emotions to a stranger",
        "On the other hand, I suppose that an argument in favour of written communication exert on influence in handwriting.In this way, anybody know other people character, behavior, inner world. For instance,psychologists ask their patient to write about themselves and by this way can find out the patient and also solve the problem. Additionally, important information can be easily reserved and accessed in the future.As a result, in after years new generation will know what we had, what diseases were and how we lived",
        "To conclude, despite some demerits of written communication,i strongly believe that it more beneficial to have written communication"
