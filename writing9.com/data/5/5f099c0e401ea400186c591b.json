        "There are advantages and disadvantages in terms of traveling or working for a year before going to university. A student should consider the positives and negatives of such a decision before deciding whether to do that or not.",
        "Those who decide to work before entering university might be able to earn some money to help offset university costs and expenses. These young people might really enjoy the break from studying and then return much more refreshed and ready to attend university. More importantly, it is possible that the travel or work experiences might help them with their university studies, either by giving them additional life experiences to give them additional perspective and focus on what they want to accomplish at the university and beyond.",
        "There are also negative aspects. If one is not strongly motivated, they may never make the effort to resume school. Or, if one is working, they may grow accustomed to the salary they earn with that job and they may decide to give up further education in favor of their regular paychecks, even if they know that they might deserve a higher salary or have a more rewarding career with a university degree.",
        "It is understandable why some young people are interested to take a break between high school and university. Such a break offers an opportunity for that young person to experience the world, either through work or travel. However, these students should fully consider the possible negatives related to a gap year before they make the decision."
