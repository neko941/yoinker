        "In the current years, the number of institutions looking after elderly people has increased significantly. While there are several important benefits of these places as providing safety and medical environment for the residents, there are drawbacks associated with it like the high cost and the sense of loneliness that people might feel there without their families. In the following lines, this essay will point out the merits and demerits of those institutions.",
        "To begin with the merits of care houses for old people, there is a presence of trained staff for twenty-four hours to offer medical attention for the residents especially for whom suffer from health problems. Most family members are not only busy working hard to take care of their parents but also prefer to entrust them in the hands of caregiver or nursing home. As there has a large of experts who can give them nutritional meals, prevent them from some diseases or ease their pain. Overall it is expected that the amount of these institutions will increase in the future",
        "Above all of these benefits of care homes, it has many negative aspects to consider as many older people suffer from depression out of the sense of isolation after living in care homes away from their families since the family member are working to pay the high cost of these institutions. For example, according to research carried out in the UK, it was discovered that 85% of older folks staying in the nursing home as mental problems caused by loneliness. However, taking care of the aged at home is more effective than a nursing home.",
        "Briefly, putting elderly people in these institutions is an important decision that impacts their quality of life but it might affect their mental and psychological health out of the feeling of abundance from their families."
