        "TV is one of the powerful sources of including everyone irrespective of their gender and age. TV is one such invention that has brought colour to the life of people and it has made it possible to sit back on our couch with a cup of coffee and have all the news about every corner of the world.",
        "In such a scenario where TV has the most influencing power, I think that along with an emphasis on Entertainment through TV shows, social issues should also be given equal importance, so that people become aware of them.",
        "Not only to spread awareness but to let people think about the solution to the problem prevalent in society. There are many issues around us that we don\u2019t know about, So TV is one such source, through which laymen can understand the importance of social issues. And social issues should be in the form of ads but in the form of shows that are without any manipulation.",
        "Even in the era of the internet where you get everything in just one click, TV is still prevalent and it is still the source for millions of people. So to make the most out of this opportunity, it should be used for social good."
