        "It is argued that whether the developed nation should give shelter to refugees and offer them basic needs such as food and housing. This essay completely agrees with this perspective because those nation possess enough resources to support them and the support, these people find could save many lives.",
        "Firstly, the nation which are financially sound also acquire enough resources to support those people who are in need. These countries are economically strong and has sufficient human resources to support people who seek asylum. For instance, Australia has very high Gross domestic product and its per capita income is one of the topmost. Therefore, it is their duty to aid who are needy.",
        "Lastly, the assistance provided by these nations could save many lives. People do not want to leave their countries until and unless it is serious and life threatening. As a result, if they are accepted by other countries then it could save their own as well as the life of their family. For e.g. United State of America welcomed many refugees from Bhutan who abandoned their homeland because their life was in jeopardy due to civil war and now this action by USA enabled these people to start the new life. Hence, it is very crucial for wealthy countries to aid these types of people.",
        "In conclusion, this essay agrees that it is very necessary for the wealthy countries to provide support to the refugees because they reserve resources which is not only sufficient to help these people but also help them start their new life which is otherwise impossible."
