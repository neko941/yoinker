        "It is an arguable topic that skilled and knowledgeable people from poor countries should be given chances to work in rich countries. This essay agrees with this fact. Firstly, it will discuss about relation between knowledge and overall growth in the development of the country. Secondly, it will deal with how opportunities can advance talents of employees living in poor countries",
        "The development of a country depends upon how much skilled its employees are. If a working person is having less skills he may take the nation to a better level. However, for best output, the person should be really talented in his work. Its always the knowledge of people working in the country who take it to heights. For instance, recent researches have shown that America has advanced in technologies because of the fact that they most of scientist are experts.",
        "Poor Countries really hold talented persons but due to lack of opportunities they are not able to express them. Greater Talent requires higher wages which are obviously not available in poor countries. That\u2019s why people in these countries look for opportunities which value their knowledge. For example, recent researches have shown that around one third of highly skilled persons in countries having less economy are not satisfied with their wages. So they are not even performing best as per their skill.",
        "In conclusion, jobs should be allowed by rich countries so skilled persons of poor countries as it is benefit of high economic countries and also talent which is being wasted in poor nations will be efficiently utilised if they are paid higher wages"
