        "It is thought by some people that the increasing traffic could be mitigated by providing free public transport facilities. However, I disagree with this opinion, as this would be a temporary solution  and there are several other methods that could be helpful in order to cope up with this situation.",
        "First of all,  this would not be able to reduce the number of cars on the road, which are the main cause of traffic. Free service will only attract lower economic class people and would make the buses crowded. Therefore, it is hard to assume that the wealthy people would ever choose overly crowded public buses for commuting.",
        "Secondly, complementary public transportation would not be a lasting solution, as there is a  possibility that the government may soon ran out of money as it is difficult to maintain such services for long time for developing countries like India, which has other issues that needs to be cleared. As a result, it will disturbs government's budget as the government has to put a lot of money in funding such schemes. The same money, instead, could be used more wisely, for example, in increasing  and improving public buses, constructing better roads and funding awareness campaigns for encouraging people to use public transport.",
        "To conclude, I strongly believe that complementary public transport would not be a lasting solution to mitigating traffic.  Hence, the government needs to look out for viable and permanent methods to solve this issue."
