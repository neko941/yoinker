        "In recent decades, the debate on who should be responsible for conducting scientific research has never been completely settled. Athough, private companies have more capacity to carry out these researches, the government should be the one to fund and supervize the scientific research.",
        "On the one hand, there are many reasons why private sector should not be given the right to undertake scientific research. First, since the priority of doing business is profit, the quality of the research results conducted by private companies might not be ensure. In fact, if the funding comes from the same organiztion, the results could be biased to ensure there is a favourable outcome to the funding  organization at the expense of real quality. Second, by being given freedom to undertake scientific research, private organizations would invest in illegal researches. As a result, despite the effort of the government to detect illegal products, more and more drugs, gun and the like would be produced, which would harm our society.",
        "On the other hand, governebt shold take step to carry out and supervise scientific research properly. Since the goverment is society oriented, reseaches the benefit society as a whole would be emphasized even if there is no profit generated. For example, researching about the outer space or climate change is the priority of the government instead of private companied as this required huge investment but generate no revenue. Moreover, the quality of researched conducted by the government are ensured. Because of the transparency in the process and the need to invest in a quality research, benefits of the general public are also increased.",
        "In conclusion, scientific research should be conducted and controlled be the government instead of private sector. This would ensure the quality of the result and benefits of the whole society."
