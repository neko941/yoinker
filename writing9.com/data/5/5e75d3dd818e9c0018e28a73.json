        "It is believed by many, youth not well-fit to work on higher state positions, while other people have opposite view on it. Overall, this dispute possible to considering with two sides: innovation an experience.  My view here that new faces should have place in government, however somebody experienced must control them.",
        "At first glance, theoretically, new politicians look on old problems, that has our system throughout years, differently that allowed make fresh ideas for solutions it. Young people have energetics and ambitions that in theory gives more capabilities to changes of painful issues.  Consequently, in theory, young politicians has a positive impact on politics life.",
        "Although, if we look on a practice side, so we have after elections inexperienced men in handling of huge system where everything interlinking. For instance, in Ukraine new politicians are beginning digitalization without testing capacities of computer systems that force to modernize, and to huge spending from budget these companies and tax organs. Inasmuch as they cannot predict consequences all this changes even after upgrading that led to damaging of Local economic in every part with ambiguous result in future. Secondly, that more important politic has parts where new people cannot experiment such as foreign policy where one misstep led to horrible outcome.  Hence, new politicians must have somebody for controlling their activity.",
        "In conclusion my opinion between two sides because government cannot consist only from elderly people also from only new people too. Therefore govern position should has equal place for both of generations for keep political life balanced."
