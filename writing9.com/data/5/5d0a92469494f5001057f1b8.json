        "The water is one of the indispensable natural resource in order to human life. Some people believe that water should be freely accessible for everyone in the world while others argue that it should be controlled by governments to ensure that available to everyone. In this essay both the viewpoints will be discussed in the upcoming paragraphs with relevant examples.",
        "To commence with, fresh water is a basic human necessity, restricting its access be argued as a human rights infringement. For example people who are doing farming needs the huge amount of water and if governments control the utilization of water then farmers would not be able to compensate water bills. Therefore it will have a negative impact on the crop yield.",
        "On the other hand, water consumption without any restriction leads many people to use fresh water in a inefficient way. For instance, some people use fresh water for washing their cars, bikes and waste liters of water in taking shower.  In the consequence of limitless usage of fresh water, there is an alarm on decreasing fresh water resource.",
        "Furthermore, the water system should be regulated by the government to make sure that it is available to their every citizen. To illustrate, fresh water is not a renewable source, excessive usage  of fresh water in swimming pools and misuse water for domestic purposes should be abandoned. So government must implement new rules to limit this. Moreover, better management of fresh water resources is very much essential like more dams, artificial lakes or reservoirs to store water and control its wastage.",
        "In the nutshell, I would like to pen down by saying that a fair usage policy must be applied by the government and subscribed by the people to save both human race and the planet."
