        "In many parts of the world, motorways provide population with technical assistance in order to travel fast as well as they make long distances short. However, they breed some problematic situations in general. And this essay will submit that problems and their solutions.",
        "Nowadays, a considerable number of people prefer a motorway service area, since it creates the opportunity for the drivers to run their cars as quickly as possible, but on the minus side, it generates perilous actions such as accidents, race, increasing the speed limit and pollution.",
        "It might be argued that, the speed plays a pivotal role in the motorway and in this case the driver should pay a particular attention to his/her level of speed, due to the fact that he/she has to assume responsibility for others' life. For instance: One year ago, I with my classmates decided to visit a valley, so called Fergana and it was the first travel for all of us. While we were going there, the driver attempted to raise the speed of the vehicle so as to reach our destination fast, but as a result he bumped into a stone due to his inexperience. After that, a friend of mine was hospitalised immediately.",
        "It is commonly contemplated that, the traffic in the motorway also disturbs the delicate balance of atmosphere, generating poisonous fumes negatively on humans' organism and environment. Therefore, an appropriate solution to this problem would be to produce electronic cars that can be charged through electricity. It is observed that, these days, an excessive number of humans are inclined to organise the race and it can result from allowing them to taste the death. I presume the basis of that dangerous action should be based on the fine or prison.",
        "To conclude, increasing the speed limit in the motorway, will definitely bring us to the catastrophe and a perfect solution to this is to stick to the principles of the road wherever we (they) are, but a possible solution so as to protect the ecology from petrol fumes could be the means of electronic transportation implementing them in our social life."
