        "Nowadays, mobiles are not only used for making calls, but also various other purposes like watching movies. Some like watching them in cinema, while others support the point. Lets discuss in details some of my experience's, regarding the same.",
        "Coming to usage of mobile for movie. Firstly, a lot of time can be saved in travelling and screen time. For example, In order we need to go there, we have to travel for certain span of time and stay for some more time to complete the task. Secondly, Expenditure can be reduced. For instance, we have to purchase ticket for the screen and for parking too, can be reduced when we view it on phone. Lastly, Availibility, we can proceed to view, whenever and where ever we want too. For example, while traving in bus, we can see the movie we want, instead waiting for specific tie.",
        "Regarding the advantages of theater. At first, we will have feel of the actual purpose. For example, emotions will be carried, if we are going to watch in the theater. Next, Specific time allocation, make us to enjoy the actual purpose. For example, following it for specific period, may lead to missing of cretain aspects of entertainment. Then after, No proper broadcasting media, like internet connection, may hamper the quality of the movie. For example, With less bandwidth, we can't have good quality in flow and sound.",
        "In conclusion, to my opinion, based on my experience, I personally suggest to go theater and watch the movie. They are enjoyment and we need to allocate sometime for it, so make it successful."
