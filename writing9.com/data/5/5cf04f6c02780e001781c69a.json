        "While some individuals choose to give help and support personally to the needy,others would rather offer money to local and foreign charitable organizations. Although,giving money in person to those in need ensures accountability,charitable organizations guarantee fair and equitable distribution of funds for needy people.In my opinion,this is the best method of rendering help.",
        "One the one hand,offering help directly ensures that these funds are actually used for the needy. This is because it prevents incidences of corruption and misappropriation of funds by eliminating the \u201cmiddleman\u201d .For instance,in the past three months,two directors of non governmental organizations have been probed by the economic and financial crimes commission because it was while people donate large sums of money towards helping the poor,these men line their pockets with these funds,giving only a minor fraction to the less privileged.",
        "On the other hand,i think that giving monies to charitable organizations is a better way of rendering help because it eliminates bias and ensures fairness in the distribution of resources.For instance,people may decide to give money to only those who share same religious beliefs as they do or to only those from a particular ethnic group.As a result,many donors may end up providing support to the same individual therefore,while one person receives these benefits,other less privileged individuals are neglected.",
        "In conclusion,while peoples opinion may vary on the choice of whether to offer help and support in person or through national and international charitable organizations,I strongly believe that the latter is better as resources can be fairly distributed amongst underprivileged people"
