        "There are split opinions regarding topic in present scenario abound individuals shift to different nation some masses believes that it is optimistic point for kids,where as another group of thinkers support it is tuff for offsprings. In my opinion,the former proposition appears to be more rational. This essay will further elaborate  both positive and pesimistic effects of this trend and thus will lead to a logical conclusion.",
        "There are myriad of reasons which will further explain this argument but the most preponderant one steams from the fact that many people shift different nations there are mammoth benefits for childrens . Firstly,little ones learn new jargon as well as culture ; lifestlyes because they live and meet with new persons . So, kids easily increase their knowledge and learn new skills . Another pivotal aspect of this argument is that if family move another nationality minors are study good schools or colleges because in modern era there are many developed countries and all provide high standard study if juniors study in these schools the life is very good and after complete study multifarious job opportunities . Needless to say, all these merits stand in a good stead.",
        "On the contrary, the latter view suggest that there are some pitfalls that negate these arguments and which can certainly overwhelm the potential influence of this trend but one of the most alarming one is that various families move own country to another principality it is challenging for kids . Bescause the face herculean to adapt new culture and speaking new dialect in different state . Besides this , the littleones face laborious in make new friends because they are  not personally know about natuare . Hence, it is apparent why many are against this trend .",
        "According to the arguments aforementioned above, one can reach to a conclusion that the benefits of living in new nations because they learn new things and childrens after complete study join will be  numerous jobs with good salary package ."
