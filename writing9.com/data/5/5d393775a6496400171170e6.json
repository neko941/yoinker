        "Some people say that letting kids decide on everyday situations (like what to eat, wear or play), would result in self-interested members of society, while others consider that it is crucial for children to have a say about issues that affect them. Although raising a child that way could result in a socialization problem, this essay will suggest that youngsters should make decisions in order to be resolutive in the future.",
        "Not giving kids the opportunity to decide can be attributed to the fact that it could make them be self-centered. This can be explained by the fact that young minds may misunderstood that freedom and believe that what they want is all that matters. For instance, in a behavior research conducted by The University of California was revealed that, around a third of toddlers who decided first what toys to play with, did not let other infants to play with the objects, and this could result in a lack of social skills when they grow up.",
        "On the other hand, giving a minor the chance to make ordinary choices could help to create resolutive individuals. That is to say, it can contribute to the growth of a strong-minded person, which is a valuable skill in work life. For example, The American Journal of Psychology revealed that individuals who made daily-life decisions at an early age, like what to wear for school or what to eat at lunch, are prone to pursue careers where decisive abilities are crucial, such as medicine or architecture.",
        "In conclusion, despite the fact that letting a child make choices could result in a selfish way of thinking, this essay suggests that youngsters should have a say on everyday issues in order to develop decision-making abilities."
