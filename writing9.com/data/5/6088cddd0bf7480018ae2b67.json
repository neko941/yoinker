        "At the present world, people tend to interact through the internet rather than having a face to face interactions. In my opinion, this would bring impact of seclusion, communication deception and being self centered.",
        "The first problem might come from online interactions is that it could make people tend to seclude. People now can talk to anyone and anytime just from inside the room without having to spend some money to pay for the transportation cost or suffering traffic jams on the road just to be able to meet their friends. This advantage makes people more comfortable to enjoy being in the house alone, that might lead them to some mental issues such as depression or feeling stressed.",
        "The second problem would be communication deception that rise in social life. Even though we can video chat with people now, we can only look some part of the body or face of the people we are talking to without being able to watch their body language on the whole. This might benefit the criminals who can pretend to be a good friend, while in the same time they are actually are planning to do some criminal acts and people sometimes can easily misjudge people because the limit of online communication.",
        "The third problem is people would tend to be self centered. Being able to socializing through the internet, may make people feel that they would not have to waste a lot of energy or time for their friends. This sometimes could make them think that they do not have to respect other people as much as when they meet with their friends in-person who must provide some time and efforts, just to go out of the house, get into the transportation means and finally meet them. In fact, some people might think that they could call anyone when ever they want to without ever considering if that people have other urgent things to do in their life. Underestimating people\u2019s life like this would make people only think about themselves.",
        "In conclusion, eventhough it has become more common now in terms of online socializing, it has become the source of some serious problems that might lead into a negative change."
