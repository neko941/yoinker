        "Reading books is the only place where, we keep our ego aside and completely submit our self to the vision of the writer. So some parents argue that kids should not read enternaiment articles, instead reading only educational novels everytime. In my opnion, I agree with the statement because knowledgeable books develop a way to lead a life and also forces young minds to think about purpose of your life.",
        "To embark upon, Reading educational books, helps children from their early age to be strong within and it does give confident to live your own life fullest. Educations articls does gives a clear picture how, to be desipline in life, at the same time it gives immense confidence  to be oneself and speak with their mind. One of the best examples of this kind of book is Author Ian Rand\u2019s Fountainahead, In this last four decades, it was the most famous self helped book, how to  to be strong and confident to face the real world for childrens.",
        "Additionally, at a very young age it is better to know purpose in life. We are in a generation, where the ambition defines a person strength.Some books for sure really facinates childrens to know their best intrest. Word towards to become expertise and make a bright future. For example I read a book called \u201cA monk who sold ferarri\u201d by Robin sharma. This novel helps us to question our self, what we want and for what we are doing so hardwork, if we don\u2019t have any big ambitions.",
        "To conclude, There are books which are very much intresting than entertaiment articles. These facinating books can enhance confident and focus towards their goal for children."
