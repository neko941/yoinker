        "In this contemporary era, there have changed to living lifestyle from day to day. The plethora of agricultural people prefers to move to the city due to work. In this essay, I will discuss intends of what are happening to this phenomenon and how to evaluates this perilous problem.",
        "There are a number of causes creating by this stipe. The first and foremost inimical cause is that the price of the food and vegetable should be increased. In other words, if all community commute to developed and developing the city, so that the production of the food, which is one need of the humans, should decline, and its effects on the country economic growth. In a recent survey from the United Stat, for example, almost 7% of the small town\u2019s people transform to Washington every year for their future work.  It can be solved to improving all the agriculture needs as well as some types of lone should be given by their governing authority.",
        "Another cause is that the developed cites are being crowded. That is to say, if majority folks migrant from the rural area to the big towns, that it should effect on the flora and fauna, hospitality and transportation. For illustration, in Pakistan from 2003, in the Karachi, population-level augmented due to people needed a job, and which was effected on the other factors of the Karachi. To tackle this issue, the government should create some job in a small village, which root this problem",
        "Agglomerating, all the points of elaborated, it can be concluded that this detrimental step impact on agriculture\u2019s food prices and population in the city. My point of view the main responsibilities of solving this perilous problem lies with the government."
