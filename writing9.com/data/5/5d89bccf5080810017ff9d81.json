        "Sports has always entertained and influenced our lives,and it said that sports tier earn more money than other people.some people agree,that it is fair however, other argue that it is not justified. As a matter ,of fact sports celebrities should be given  an average or more than average money,however it will be best to give consideration to other  professions  too.",
        "To begin with , sports has create dreams for children and goals for adult.we are living in high - tech and sophisticated society,which has forced indirectly  our future generations ( children and youth) mostly indoors.As a result they adapt unhealthy life style,which could be dangerous in future.There comes a sports star ,a role model  for them with high fame and fortune ,could be a stimulation for active and hard working life style. For instance, a famous  US psychologist Brendan Shalva mentioned that in a world full of entertainment,and thousand of  choices to waste your time,those youth and adults who struggles to get the top of triangle should be given credit.",
        "If an athlete works hard in his precious time of the year ( youth) ,it will justify,that he earns more money than others.",
        "However,I argue that other professions should be given preference too. Future Doctor,scientists,even sports and movie stars are made in classrooms. Furthermore  professions that benefit mankind do not  receive nearly as much attention or money but remains essential to society. For example,those who put their lives in dangerous to save other lives  and their country,such as Doctors,firefighters, and soldiers .If state, gives preference to these professions as much as sports celebrities, we might get more Doctors ,teachers  soldiers,even more sports celebrities.",
        "To conclude,as result of hard working ,athletes should be given average or little more  than average money,however other professions should also be given exactly the same amount of money as sports stars."
