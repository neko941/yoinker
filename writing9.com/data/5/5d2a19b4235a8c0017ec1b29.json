        "The confusion about the course to study in the tertiary institution still remains one puzzle yet to be unraveled. While some sets of people think that undergraduates should be allowed to study the course of their choice others think they should not. In my opinion, i believe that learners should be allowed to take the path of knowledge they want in school. This essay will discuss both views and give a reasoned conclusion.",
        "On one hand, the best part of university learning is the ability to select one's course of study as this prevents the student from losing interest in school. When a 3rd level education student voluntarily selects a course of their choice not only will they be focused but they will also do the course passionately. During a survey by the academic times of the Northwest University in 2017 it was reported that 20 students out of the 50 students offered admission for the history course dropped out because they were not interested in the course but had been forced to take the course as a result of their parent's influence. Therefore, in order to prevent this occurence it is necessary to encourage learners to practise what they love.",
        "On the other hand, studying useful courses in the university helps to develop one's future career prospect. Doing lucrative courses will increase one's chances of getting green collar jobs after graduation. Although, in my opinion i believe allowing a learner study the course of their choice is highly important as this will prevent them from being inactive members of the school society.",
        "To sum up, although studying lucrative courses will be beneficial to the student in the nearest future but one's happiness supercedes this. It is highly recommended that the government provides a job awareness program for the students prior admission in order for them to familiarize with the different job opporrunites attached to the various courses."
