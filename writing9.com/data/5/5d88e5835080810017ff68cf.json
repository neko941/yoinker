        "Of late, it is become increasingly common to have an elementary family over the extended family. Having a small family would certainly bring more benefits, but there will also be some drawbacks, which are going to examine in the ensuing paragraphs, followed by a logical conclusion.",
        "On positive aspects, parents are greatly benefitted by a small family. That is to say, the expenditure that is imperative for nurturing a kid from cradle to university, such as schoolbooks, uniform and other amenities reduce to a greater degree. Therefore, a family of one or two children experiences less strain economically when compared to those having more than two children. Furthermore, a nuclear family plays a crucial role in preventing the environment. For instance, the global warming owing to human activities ceases if a breadwinner of a family is restricted to one or two kids.",
        "Although the advantages of a conjugal family are predominantly high, yet there are certain disadvantages. First off, a small family makes parents overprotective and excessively attentive. In other word, a parents having sole child becomes over caring who don\u2019t allow playing or exploring. As a result, children becomes solitaire and fragile. Additionally, there is no proper medical attention in a small family. If the only kid becomes sick, there will not be any family member to look after him or her when his/her parents are working.",
        "To recapitulate, a growing number of nuclear family possess various sorts of benefits like better life quality for parents and children whereas the negative effects for the same include downfall of the kid health due to possessive love."
