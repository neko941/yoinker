        "Effectively competing with younger candidates can be quite challenging. This is because, in many countries, population over 50 years old are struggling to find a job, despite their experience. This essay will discuss causes of this phenomena and examine effects of it both for individuals and societies.",
        "In terms of the reasons, the main factor contributing to this trend is that it is more difficult for older people to process information rather than for youngsters. In other words, younger workers need less time to get new skills, so it is easier for them to keep on with the latest trends of the market. Moreover, as a rule, the younger employee is, the more enthusiasm they show in work. The reason of it is that youngsters not like more experienced older employees have not achieved any significant goal in their work life, so they are longing for achievements. Thus, if a company employ and train more enthusiastic and retentive young candidate rather than older and more experienced one, in a long-term perspective they can benefit more.",
        "There are several negative consequences caused by this trend. First of all, if nothing changes, thousands of people being unable to compete with their younger opponents will become unemployed and it will negatively affect not only them but also their families. Moreover, without any revenue they will not be able to take new courses to get new skills and be more competitive and it makes the situation trickier.",
        "To sum up, to get a respectable job is becoming more and more difficult nowadays. If you are older than 50 years old, it is even more challenging. Thus, many older and experienced employees became unemployed and it have several ramifications for society. Government should take measures to stop this trend."
