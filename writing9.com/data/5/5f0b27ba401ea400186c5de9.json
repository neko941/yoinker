        "Following the number of population who prefers to live only in the one or two generations are increasing, the traditional family formats are demolished. To illustrate my point, I think the trend is a natural phenomenon by changing the people's preference and behaviour.",
        "Admittedly, I partly agree that extended families have several benefits, In the first place, from the perspective of budgets, living with grandparents can be the good ways to save living costs. For example, nowadays, the living cost in the urban is alarmingly high, therefore, many married couple choose to work for getting double pay checks, however, there is a probelm that no one can take a child during the daytime. When it comes to live with grandparents, they will take care of their grandchildren and also will help some chores, consequently, the family can save the money for day care centres, and housekeeping Services. Additionally, from the perspective of kids, they can learn valuable wisdoms or traditional etiquette through a grandfather and mother.",
        "Nevertheless, I, as one of the supporter of the view, think that a single-family or family that only live with young kids is preferred these days. First of all, it is true that capital cities have a lot of entertainments, conveniences, and working places.  Young generations a definite like to stay in centre of the society, on the flip side, older generations are willing to stay in a hometown, usually in a rural area. From the view of them, they will get suffering from high-rated buildings and polluted air in the urban. Hence, it is a natural way that older people and their married children live separately. Another reason worth mentioning is that a change of vaules, which means people more prioritise individual's life than family life. More specifically, modern citizens  are empathize the healing which is relaxation time at home, as the result, if a person live with their larger families, then it is hard to relax and having a time to chill alone.",
        "In conclusion, through the social changes, especially empathising personal values, populations prefer to live alone or living with their young kids. Although, there are economical benefits when citizens choose to stay with their parents, modern individuals want to keep their work-life balances and respect needs of each family members. I personally have a positive aspect in this issues, and it is one of the social phenomenon."
