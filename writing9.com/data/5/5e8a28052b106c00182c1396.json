        "In recent years the field of sport is increasing in every part of the globe. Most well-known athletes  are provided with huge amount of money compared with other occupations' workers. Certain individuals insist  that   it can be unjust because they dismiss that all professionals should be equal. However, other group accept the concept that  renowned sport professionals should be honoured and can recieve more money and I agree with them. The following paragraphs  take a look both views.",
        "First and foremost, it is often maintained that sport play a chief role in most nations. That is because it can represent the power of the country. In addition, the athlete professionals is pride of the public due to their best devotion to their job. As far as i am concerned wold-renowned sport professionals can earn more money than other group of workers. Most believe that they shoul be equal in every job wheres other people of the opinion that sport professionals shoul be resected and given more salary  by the governments. In my opinion, the majority of sportsmen are truely woth it. For example when the country's national anthem is played in international stadium all people feel very proud of that nation's strength.",
        "Furthermore, beacause of their hard work they try to get a great deal of salary and certain sport supporters argue that athetes especially successful and famous ones always devote themselves to training and practice. Indeed, after that those can face fatigue and may leads to stressful living. Also, these require uch money to medical care. For those reasons professional athetes can earn much more money than other necessary jobs.",
        "However, some people refute the idea that not all professional are loyal to their work and certain ones even cheat the referees in order to get money. They also noticed that some sportmen bribe the judges. So, for them the government should impose strict measure to make them be honourable and to restrict this kind of corruption.",
        "In conclusion, for certain people this is not a just statement while others of the opinion that successful athlete professionals can earn such a good  salary for their work and personally i acknowledge this view."
