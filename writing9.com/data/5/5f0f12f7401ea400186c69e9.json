        "These days, celebrities are more popular and earn more money as compared to politicians .Some believe that it is a positive development while other marked it as negative development. I will discuss the reasons for this situation and whether it is positive development or not.",
        "First and foremost, the main reason for this situation is lack of youth's interest in politics. Young adults and small children are more interested in movies and webseries. Other than this, celebrities are more famous than politicians as they are involved in films as well as advertisements .With their talent and hardwork they attract more and more people toward themselves. Also, increasing corruption results in bad image of politicpoliticans because of which people do not like them.",
        "Moving further, this situation can be considered as positive because celebrities have power to influence the mind of public. When they are doing good works like Charity,their fans will also follow them .Moreover celebrities entertain the public with their work and they deserve to get money for making people happy.",
        "However, it also has some negative effects. Firstly, because of salary gap between celebrities and  political leaders might discourage leaders from doing work or even motivate them to commit crimes such as corruption .sSecondly, low salary for stressful job of governors may discourage people from becoming politicians.This is undesirable because it would result in lack of development.",
        "In conclusion,I personally believe that it is a negative development because it discourage youth to take interest in politics .Everyone should have equal rights to get paid according to their hardwork."
