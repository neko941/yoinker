        "Although some people say that single sex school are better in the education of both boys and girls, others consider coeducational institutions to be more advantageous for learning. In my opinion, I agree that same sex schools have more benefits than mixed schools because of the social problems it averts for students.",
        "On the one hand, separate gender schooling could prevent most students from encountering some devastating social issues. One way is that sexism could be eliminated among students. In same sex institutions there are no superiority among students, because they view themselves as equals. Another way could be the mitigation of bullying among students. For example, in the United States, statistics of both mixed and single schools shows that the rate of bullying in mixed schools are over twice the number in single sex schools. Thus, this clearly shows the benefits same sex institutions could expose students to.",
        "However, the integration of different gender students, which fosters good relationship in society, is made possible. First, students in coeducational schools develop confidence through the interactions between themselves. Another point to consider is that students learn how to esterblish close relationships amongst themselves. These knowledge learnt, could be  needful in future careers. For instance, the ever demanding occupation of today require good relationships between colleagues to achieve company goals. Hence, mixed schools could be of some benefits.",
        "To conclude, mixed schooling may have merits, however, I believe that single schooling is more beneficial for students to learn adequately. So, the  implementation of such schooling systems over the globe could solve many social issues in the future."
