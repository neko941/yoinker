        "In the modern busy life, there are a large number of immigrants who have been willing to have a comfortable life in other nations. Many advocate that people should conform to the local customs and traditions when they settle in a new country. From my respective, I strongly agree with this idea because of some problems and benefits that people can face with them.",
        "There are two important reasons why newcomers should blend into the local culture in the host country. Firstly, the refusal to adapt to host environment would create a cultural barrier for immigrants. This leads to social isolation, which has negative influences on people\u2019s lives. Secondly, it is logical that limited knowledge of local customs may result in some illegal actions in the host country and make native people unpleased. For instance, in Singapore, one of the cleanest countries in Asia, local residents consider anyone dirty and ill-mannered",
        "if they litter the street or spit gum in the public.",
        "Newcomers can gain some benefits if they adopt the customs and traditions ofa new country. One benefit is that if immigrants behave in accordance with the local norms, they will be accepted easily by local inhabitants, and as a result, they can gain respects and affections as well as some help from the local. For example, when the enterprises want to expand their production in a new country, they must be aware of business practices there, which provides them with useful information to maximise profits. Another benefit is that newcomers might gain the richness of knowledge by virtue ofthe local customs and traditions, which enables them to actively participate in the activities ofthe community. In many festivals, people are able to participate freely and feel harmonious like their own country.",
        "In conclusion, I would argue that people who dwell in a new country should follow the customs and traditions which local people observe."
