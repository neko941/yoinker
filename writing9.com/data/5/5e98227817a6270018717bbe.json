        "It is considered by many people that participating in sports which are played in teams such as football is more advantageous for players than who play by themselves. Other people prefer to take part in individual sports like swimming or running. While I understand that playing individual sports makes substantial contribution in boosting up the independence, in my perspective, team sports are a smarter choice because not only do they advance paticipants\u2019 discipline but also create more motivation.",
        "To begin with, individual sports are really helpful to make players more independent because they have no one to rely on. Their success entirely depends on their own efforts, just the athletes himself carrys him though the competition. For instance, my little brother has played tennis for 2 years, and he makes everyone surpised by showing his independence from such an young age of seven. He loves tennis so much that he goes to the tennis court himself and he always try his best to be stronger day by day. My parents believe that he becomes more and more self-reliant thanks to playing tennis.",
        "However, it is undeniable that playing sports in team improve the discipline and create more training motivation for players. Although people tend to relax and be easy on themselves when practicing on their own, as a team member, he/she is usually more responsible to not affect the other teammates. Take myself as an example, I am taking part in both basketball and running. I always attend basketball practice on time regardless of bad weather, but I easily reschedule my running session when it rains. My story clearly illustrates that team sports are better than individual one in term of their incentive and discipline to players.",
        "In conclusion, there is no doubt that both individual and team sports are good for paticipants but I prefer team sports than individual sports because of the outstanding benefits they provide such as discipline and motivation."
