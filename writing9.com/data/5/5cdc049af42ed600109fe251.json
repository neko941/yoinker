        "Nowadays, many parents buy their children and a sizable number of toys, however many toys to play with can have both positive and negative impact  in a child behavior and affect the relationship with parents.",
        "Today, parents can choose from a variety of toys to buy to their children.  Firstly, toys can be beneficial due to their ability to teach through playing essential things to the children.  Secondly, toys can keep children busy while parents do other things. For example, parents who work from home want to be silent in order to work efficiently, so toys can be lifesavers.  Finally, if a child has many toys then it will be harder to get bored.",
        "On the contract, having many toys can also bring many disadvantages.  Many children become spoiled by having many toys and they keep asking for more. For example, a research has shown that 58% of children who have many toys are likely to not want to share them.  In addition, children can easily become addicted to playing with toys and it will be challenging for parents to introduce them to new ways of having fun.Relations with parents will be affected and children will prefer toys instead of spending time with them.",
        "In conclusion, buying a lot of toys to a child can have both advantages and disadvantages.  Even through, children benefit from playing with toys they can also become addicted and that will have as a result problems with the relationship with their parents."
