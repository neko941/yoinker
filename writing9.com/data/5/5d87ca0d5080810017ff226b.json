        "People have different views on whether the government should spend money to save languages or not. While, the investment on the language is a waste of money but I believe that the government should do contribution in order to save the language from vanishing.",
        "However, in my opinion, the government should contribute money towards the preservation of the language.  firstly, language is the important part of the culture value, belief and customs which means disappearance of language can cause loss to the culture. Secondly, new generation would not able to find their ancestors mother tongue if the language suddenly disappeared. Moreover, The Government could increase the awareness among the people through organizing the seminars and sending brochures to the people\u2019s houses in order to protect the language, as a result, these actions on the part of the government can increase the awareness among the people.",
        "On the other hand, spending money on the language could be wastage of money to some extent but language preservation is important. One of the main reason to save money is that there are other social issues in the community which require the attention from the federal. These main social issues are such as the development of infrastructure, improvement of facilities in the health centre, and advancement required in the education system. For example: old people are required enough pensions funds and low- cost retirement housing. Consequentely, government should focus on the budget need as well as they should stop the language from the extinction.",
        "In conclusion, I support the idea of the language preservation and assuming that the government will also spend some portion of the money towards social cause."
