        "Artists are very important in the society. They not only play crucial role in arts, but also development of the entertainment. They can act like mirrors of the cultures, they can showcase culture to world in a beautiful way. Some governments spend a lots of money on artists to support them. Some people argue it is a waste of money and that could have been spent better elsewhere. They don't support artists. I strongly oppose their argument.",
        "Artists are different types, there are painters, singers, actors, writers etc... All of them are helpful to the society in different ways. In fact, they are the reason for vast knowledge we are having know. Writers and painters can showcase the present social conditions to the next genarations by thier work. This is the one of the best way that knowledge is shared to the future generations. Artists like actors can also provide entertainment. They can act in different roles, provides a lot of entertainment. They are the artists who always have celebrity status. Because of their great work of acting they can gain universal recognistion.",
        "Spending money on artist's welfare is very useful. They need support not only from government, but also from society. Scientists are always get a lot of support from everywhere, artists are as equal as scientists in the world. They promote our culture and our time. One artist can inspire millions of people and they can change their lives. Art never dies, we appericiate the paintings of Piccaso even after a century. So there is nothing wrong in encouraging and supporting artists.",
        "To conclude, without art there is no meaning to the human life. Governments spend a lots of money on different things, spending on artists is really good thing."
