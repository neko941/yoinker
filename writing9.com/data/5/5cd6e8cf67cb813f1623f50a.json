        "It is said that human instinct develops after giving birth to a child and ever mother - father instinctually feels what to do for the baby. But, there are some things that ought to be known before.",
        "A child is not a simple toy. A child 15 a big responsibility, love and care. A mother should know if she is ready or not to have a child, and a couple should prepare before having children.",
        "We can see many cases with families behaving badly - in real life, on TV, reading newspapers, when children are very bad, when parents abuse their only children, screaming and shouting, smacking them. Who is guilty then? The parent or the child? This cases can end really badly if the persons in charge here - parents and not the children - don't learn how to behave themselves, how to handle their children, how and when to give them support.",
