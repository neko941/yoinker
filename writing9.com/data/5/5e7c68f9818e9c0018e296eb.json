        "Nowadays  traffic is one of the most impotent  problems around the world.so government has been  taking  various steps to control this  problem a decade. Government  takes a step to control  traffic problems  through  taxation . But it has certain limitations too. This essay will examine the pros and cons of government  taxation against  car owners and provide  a logical conclusion.",
        "One of the first benefits is government  should impose heave taxes to private car owners and collect all the funds and spend money to improve  public  transportation. Nowadays public transportation is not good. Second  benefits  is if government impose more  taxes , most of the private car owners don't drive car or they reduce  the working hours.this is correct time to protect  environment  , particularly we reduce air polluction for example  the private  car owners  stopped  their service  automatically public transportation  must develop multidimensionally and get more revenue  from public.",
        "Nevertheless  , there  are  some  limitations  too,government impose the taxes  to car owners  that time car owners  are  affecting  their life economically and they face a lot of problems in their  life. Most of the  owners  don't  know other  jobs. They are always depending this job only. For instance  if they give up  and go any other job, they don't  work professionally. This type of activity  creates problems  between employees and employers.",
        "In my conclusion,  this is not a way to develop  public transportation. Government  officials should find out alternative solutions to improve public transportation facilities more over government  must ta6 various steps to control  private car owners.  Though the government  impose tax to private car owners heavily this is not correct  solutions."
