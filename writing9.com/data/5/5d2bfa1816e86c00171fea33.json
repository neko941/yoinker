        "An  increasing number of individuals are obese.It is considered by some that   inflating the price of junk foods will effectively deal with this issue .I totally agree that increment in the cost of foods with high fat content will not only  dissuade people from eating it,but also compel owners of  restaurants to diversify and adjust their menu.",
        "Increasing the price of junk meals will discourage people from consuming it as a staple source of food. Junk foods  are  relatively cheaper than organic foods, so people  include these foods high in sugar and fat contents as part of their daily meals. For instance, in rural areas where it is expensive  to buy junks meals, people rely solely on  nutritious meals that are more affordable which enable them  maintain healthy weight.",
        "Another reason to consider is that raising cost prices of these junk foods will lead to low patronage of restaurants where people buy such foods.This unprecedented high cost of buying   these foods will reduce the number of people who will patronize them.As a result,restaurants owners will diversify and start preparing nutritious meals for people that would help them maintain healthy body mass index.For example,In  Germany,75 percent of eateries that preparef fast foods changed their menu to mainly organic foods because they experienced  reduction in the number of customers.",
        "In conclusion, increasing the cost price of junk meals  is a viable option to combat obesity by  dissuading  people from buying which will timely lead to low  patronage of restaurants that produce it."
