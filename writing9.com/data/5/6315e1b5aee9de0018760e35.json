        "If we examine the opinion given above, the technology can help the police, there are advantages and disadvantages. Let us refer to advantages, the fugitives can be located with a checking ID card in airports, bus stations, train stations. Every street has cameras now thus you can catch the thieves immediately. Moreover with the fingerprint the murders come to ligths easyly. furthermore The government can access secret and important information. However, people lost their privacy. Unfortunately, people are more afraid of the police and government. Not to mention, the trust people have in each other decreased.",
        "I strongly agree that The offense rate is reducing these days according to past thanks technology which can avoid and figure out offenses. For example, in my country the rate of thieves is reduce %55  thanks to alarm systems and indoor camera systems. The people who can not resist the thieves are very satisfied with this situation. As mentioned above, doing checking ID carts in every airport and stations for the fugitives, when I was waiting for my bus in the station, the police caught a man who was waiting in line after me. This incident scared me a little at first but I was relieved when I saw the strength of the police. \u0130n paris and in the 1980s, every week had been finding a body in the dump. Thankfully, through the technology of fingerprint and dna detections police can put jail the murderer the number of bodies reduced.",
        "\u0130n conclusion, despite there are some disadvantages, technology benefits when solving crimes and the number of crimes are decreased."
