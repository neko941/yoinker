        "There has been always arguments whether children have become more selfish ,if they made their own decision in their daily issues, while others believe that this idea would make them more careful about the probable effects which every choice would have.",
        "To begin with, giving the freedom of choice to children has some positive points.children who are more free to make their decisions about day-to-day matters ,such as, the freedom of choice in clothing,entertainments,or eating habits,will give them the chance to enjoy their life at the right moment of their age,though this ability would make them to learn from their choices ,even if it was a wrong one.With this aspect they would build up their personality in early ages and they could have taken the  lesson from the selected choices ,which generally affected in a particular way on them.As a result,they would become per-mature in early-age that could help them to avoid making mistakes in future.",
        "Those who are opponents on this view, claim that the given opportunity to children at early age,when they are not mature enough ,to distinguish between positive and negative aspects of their choices, are likely to turn them to a  self-centered child in future,which means that they would become selfish and probably would not care about others.As they accssessed to any things that they chose,they might would like to axcpect to recieve anything that they desire.Thus, this behavior would defenaitly harm them and others in society.",
        "To summarize,in my opinion children should have this opportunity to make their decisions on very basic matters which lead them"
