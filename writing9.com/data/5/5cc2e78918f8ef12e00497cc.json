        "It is argued regarding assignments, where one half believe that daily assignments actually enhance their academics as well as life, whereas, the other half is totally against it. This essay discusses both the views before reaching the final verdict.",
        "firstly, let us Consider the merits of daily homework .regular assignments will improve their knowledge because at least to complete it they open their books and recall their lectures this will, in turn, enhance their memory which eventually shows a positive impact on their academics. To illustrate, research has proved that students who are engaging themselves in their daily assignments are able to score higher marks than the people who are least concerned about their assignments.",
        "On the other hand, few people believe that this concept of homework which is given on daily basis will not be helpful for a student to achieve in their academic since they are pressurized to complete their work .therefore as a result, there are chances  where students start to hate school as well as the studies which, automatically affects their education. to cite an example a recent survey on schools has revealed that 80% of toppers are from education institutes where they follow a concept of periodic assignments which is given only once in a week.",
        "To conclude, regular brushing of lessons in the form of assignment is the ideal method to enhance their dedication towards studies and in addition, it helps to excel in their life as well as academics. These after-school works are undoubtedly helpful for pupils, even though children hate it."
