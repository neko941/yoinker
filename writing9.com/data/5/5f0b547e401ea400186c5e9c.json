        "In this contemporary world, it is undoubtedly true that everyone wishes to do something good for the society to improve the living standards for all. Some people concur that unpaid social service is to be made mandatory aspect of high school programs. However, I partially agree with this statement as I believe that it should be one's own desire to work for the neighborhood.",
        "One of the most conspicuous aspects of working compulsorily for the neighborhood welfare is that it helps people realise their prime duty towards the betterment of society. By doing this, not only can one be a good citizen, but one can also inspire others to be the same. Besides, it inculcates the value of volunteerism among many. Testified from the fact, a myriad of schools have started working on the \"Swacch Bharat Abhiyaan\", a scheme launched by the Prime Minister in India, to make our surroundings neat and clean. Needless to say, all these merits stand students in good stead when it comes to doing something incredible for their nation.",
        "On the other hand, by working compulsorily for community services, students can lack time to provide for studies. With this, they sometimes end up scoring low grades in academics. Only when students follow mandatory unpaid services, will they loosen up interest in studies. According to statistics, youngsters who are into multiple tasks such as studies, NGO's, charities, become unable to give their focus and concentration towards academics. Undoubtedly, these aspects can make students' studies suffer.",
        "From the views outlined above, it can be concluded that although working voluntarily for one's community make one a responsible citizen, but at the same time making it a mandatory part of higher studies will definitely affect studies and grades, as it should be one's self desire to work for the community rather than a compulsion."
