        "We live in a society where there is a variety of jobs with different conditions. Some jobs have fixed working hours and fixed single place whereas there are some jobs which are irregular in terms of working hours and require long frequent travels. Both type of jobs have their advantages and inconveniences which I will elaborate in the next paragraphs.",
        "There are a multitude of benefits when someone has a fixed job at a fixed place, exemplify by people have stability which is very good when they have kids, they can have a proper social life but also they can practice a healthy lifestyle as well. Inadvertently, some people enjoy having an irregular time and mobile jobs as they are always on the move, they meet people and they do not get bored. However, this typical job have many drawbacks such as unstable family life, risk in terms of travelling, for example a driver of large trucks may need to drive for several days and may face many inconveniences on the road such as bad weather mainly when it snows.",
        "By obligation and laws enforced in some countries, some people do not have the choice for their career path, so they need to work to support their family. Working at a single place can also have downsides such as back and neck pains due to sitting long hours in front of either a monitor or a sewing machine. Even for people working long hours and travelling can cause health issues, for instance a air hostess often suffer from leg pain as she needs to walk and stand during long hours.",
        "In my opinion, the two typical jobs which have been discussed have their advantages and pitfalls. Some people have the choice to choose their dream jobs and others may be forced to do a job. Personally I prefer a stable job at a single place which allows someone to spend more time  with hisfamily."
