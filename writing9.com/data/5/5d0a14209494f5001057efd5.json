        "In recent times, children are under tremendous pressures in several activities; in schools, from social groups and even commercial setting. This essay will elucidate the reasons for these pressures and also proffers ways of minimizing the stress faced by the children.",
        "In today\u2019s society, youngster\u2019s experience unnecessary pressure from both their teachers and parents regarding their academic performance. The teacher ranks the student according to a position; this positioning can even list a child that score 95% to the last post because there exist lots of brilliant chap in the child class. In such a situation, the child will feel so bad because she came to the last position among other classmates. As for the parent, they like to comparing their children performance with other siblings or child in the neighbourhood. These attitudes of a parent make the children feel timid to mingle with other playgroups during social activities since their parent lack confidence in their ability. Also, the environment in which most child lives can also pressurize them. In other words, modernization in the system can hurt the mind of today\u2019s children. In such a situation, whereby they cannot compete with their peers in modern material possession. Such as the latest IPad, computer games to mention few.",
        "It is an undeniable fact that young folks experience unnecessary pressure, which can be reduced in some many ways. Firstly, the tutor can review the ranking system to a more acceptable one that will recognize the ability to each child. It then means that they can stop the positioning method and emulating the percentage form of marking rather than positioning. Besides, the parent, on the other hand, should deceit from the act of comparing their children capacity with their siblings. They can use the rewarding system, acknowledging them when they excel in some areas.",
        "To conclude, Social, academic and commercial stress encountered by children can be reduced to minimal if teachers use a better result system, and also parent shows the children some sense of belonging by encouraging them to do better when they did not perform excellently. All these will go a long way in building the confidence level of young folks."
