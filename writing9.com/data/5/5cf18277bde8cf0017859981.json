        "There are three popular modes of transportation in the world namely, roadways, waterways and airways and these modes have reached its highest level. The number of passengers who travel by roads are greater as compared to other modes and I think government should spent money more on roads rather than railways because roads are included in daily use category.",
        "To embark, I believe that government should concentrate on roads more because roads was constructed first and used by human then the invention of railways was occur far after than roadways. Railways ids also very essential for everything such as trade, industrialization and for cover long distance but there is no need of rails without roads, for example, trade between the countries which is fruitful for the economy of the nation and it is successful by railways when plethora of stocks of different items transfer from one place to another but every person will accessable to these items only then, when each item will come on our nearby shops through roads, furthermore, roads give us door to door service, for instance if someone covers a long distance by rail so rail will not bring him to home, he will have to take vehicle which deliver him to his home and rails are not recommended for shorter distance.",
        "On the flip side of coin, Rails are safe for both citizens and traders. The number of road accidents are far higher than railways casualities, moreover, rails cause comparetively less environmental damage while roads are the main reason for the pollution in many countries. In addition to, railways can carry hundred of passengers and tonnes of goods whereas, roads can carry only a few. Last but not the least, it can reduce traffic congestion and saves a valuable time of people.",
        "To sum up, government use money on rail or roads according to their convenience and government should spend equal money on both of them."
