        "Youths tend to move out of their home as they grow up. While a section of parents encourage this act of leaving home early, others share a different opinion. This essay will throw light on both the perspectives, however in my opinion they should continue to stay with family since family teaches important values of life.",
        "Many parents believe that as an individual grows up, he or she should move out of the home. They are of the opinion that staying aloof from the family teaches the budding generation about the hurdles of life. When a person starts living alone, he is forced to take care of himself, thereby learning many life saving jobs. For instance, a person while alone, learns the act of cooking, washing clothes and managing finances. These new skills make a budding youth more self-dependent.",
        "While the young generation enjoys the sense of freedom and independency staying away from house, he tends to miss out on the opportunity of sharing his life with his family. This option is supported by a section of the parents, who believe that families should stay together and that families can teach valuable lessons of life too. For example, youths can better cultivate the art of sharing and caring for others. Those who decide to stay back in their own home tend to be more humane than their counterparts. This consolidates the perception that men tends to develop better while living among his closed ones.",
        "To summarize, although a proportion of parents encourage the young men to move out of the home as they grow older, I support a different perception since I believe that living with closed ones helps a growing person not only to learn important values of life but also to become more expressive and caring towards other people."
