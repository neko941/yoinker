        "In recent times, a lot of people are deprived of sleep in many countries due to their work schedule and their overindulgence in watching television and surfing the internet. This trend has deleterious consequences on an individual and the society.",
        "Some people sleep less today due to the nature of their job. in order word, some of these people do shift work while others often work overtime. As an example, doctors, nurses and police officers do run eight to twelve hours shift duties because of the essential services they render. As a result, the normal circadial rhythm of their body is disrupted resulting in sleep deprivation. More so, today, a lot of people spend more time watching television and staying online to interact with their friends on the social media, thus, they are often carried away by these activities late in the night, resulting in less sleeping time.",
        "A common effect of poor sleep on an individual is stress. This often results in health problems such as anxiety disorders, depression and cardiovascular complications. Furthermore, the productivity of an individual with sleep deprivation often reduce, thus, causing lost of job and livelihood. This would not have occurred if such people have adequate sleep. In addition, the society is faced with the burden of increased spending on health of individuals with poor sleeping habits. As a result, taxes on the productive work force in such society is increased.",
        "To conclude, More people now sleep less due to their nature of their occupation and their indiscretion when online and while watching televison. in order to reduce the undesirable effects of sleep deprivation, more time-off should be offered to workers on shift duties and people should be encourage to be more physically active."
