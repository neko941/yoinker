        "We live in a fast paced society \u00a0and people\u00a0do not\u00a0want to slow down even when they are sick. In the \u00a0quest to meet deadlines and accomplish important tasks,employees often go to work \u00a0when they are sick not caring about their health or that of others around them. I believe this act is wrong and employees should not be allowed to come to work when they are sick as such sickness can be highly contagious and the employee\u00a0will not\u00a0function efficiently.",
        "Firstly, a sick person\u00a0should not come to work because their sickness might be highly contagious. For instance, if \u00a0a person that has flu comes to the office, he/she can infect someone else as this is highly contagious. It is advisable for a sick person to stay at home, use his drugs and get better so as not to infect others with his diseases. Also, If the person comes to the office, his condition might worsen and in the quest of accomplishing his task he will create more harm to himself than good as his brain will be disturbed.",
        "Furthermore, sick people shouldn\u2019t come to work as the sickness might\u00a0stay longer.\u00a0Most times, people fall ill due to stress and lack of rest. So,if a sick person who should be resting comes to work, he might worsen his situation and his sickness might stay longer. It is advisable that a sick person should be well rested so he can recover quickly and once he is back on his feet, he will be able to function perfectly, all tasks will be accomplished and deadlines met.",
        "Some people might say that the sick person ought to come to work in order to perform all the task expected of him. However, it should be noted that such person \u00a0won\u2019t function effectively as he isn\u2019t in his right frame of mind and his brain is muddled. For instance, work that he would ordinarily finish in 30 mins will take him maybe 1 hour to complete. Thus in the long run, he finishes the work but at a slow pace thereby making him inefficient.",
        "In conclusion, people shouldn\u2019t go to work when they are sick and alternatives can help perform the required task. Companies should have sick leave as part of their benefits so staff can \u00a0take leave when they are indispensable. Companies should ensure that staff that come to office when they are sick due to their sense of commitment should be asked to go back home as \u201cHealth is Wealth\u201d."
