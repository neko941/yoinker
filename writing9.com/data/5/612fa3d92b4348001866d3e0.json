        "In the modern world, students can choose what they want to learn in colleges or in universities. Nevertheless, the number of science studying students is on the decline with the introduction of computer related sbujects. Although it is a prima facie attarctive trend, it has more negetive impacts to society.",
        "As a nation, innovation is a must to move forward. When more students learn science, there will be more scientists and their innovations which will help to produce new machines and equipment. As a result, within the country, production rate will skyrocket and eventually contribute to the economy. If students do not study science, there will be a deficiency in the scientific job market which cannot be replaced with the people who have mastered computer science.",
        "Furthermore, as there is a growing trend of children\u2019s favour of computer related cources, a large number of people will move to the job market and eventullay there will be a plethora of employees such as software engineers, system administrators. Since the computer related job market is still growing, many of computer graduates will be unemployed or under-paid. For example, in Sri Lanka, average salary of a junior system develpoer is way below than a fresh science graduate\u2019s salary. Therefore from the job perspective, more students should select science subjects in order to protect their future.",
        "In conclusion, even though there is a positive trand of students\u2019s movement towards computer related subjects, they should think to learn science since it is more advantageous to the country as well as themselves. Parents and teachers should take responsibility to select the correct path that is obviously science."
