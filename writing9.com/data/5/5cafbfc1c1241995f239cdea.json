        "Science and engineering have always been the type of courses which are dominated by males. However, there has been a slight grow in the female population opting for such courses as well.",
        "There could be several reason behind the dominance of males in such courses. For instance, in states like Haryana and Bihar there has always been a mediocre thinking about girls going for such courses. This is the reason why the females population is extremely less in engineering in comparison to males. However, girls have dominated boys in courses related to medicines. Again of the same thinking that girls can only be good at medicines. Even most of the families don't spend that much amount of money on their girl's education which they spend on their boy's education.",
        "This could balanced by taking proper initiatives by the government and social workers. For example- India's Prime Minister has taken up such initiatives, which educates the people of rural areas about the importance of girl child and how they are equally important as boys. The colleges and universities can offer special quotas for girl in such streams. For example-female quota in IIM colleges. Some discount on the tuition fees can be given to girl who have been consistently performing well.",
        "To recapitulate, awareness should be spread about the gender equality amongst the people living small villages and rural areas of the country. In my opinion, the colleges and universities can play a vital role in increasing the population of female students."
