        "It is argued whether pupils should pay for their education, or the government should subsidise the tution fee and make it totally free. Personally, I believe, government needs to subsidise heavily into the education sector, so that everyone can have access to the body of knowledge.",
        "Firstly, we live in a knowledge based economy, where proper knowledge and skillset sets the backbone of a modern society. Access to information and knowledge is one of the basic needs to be fulfilled, further, without peoper skills and knowledge no one can survive in future. hence, in order to secure the livelyhood of its people the government should have porper scheme and fund for primary to university level education. For instance, in many countries such as Bangladesh most of the people can not afford the required education they need, therefore, the government should take the responsibility and cater this basic need for the people.",
        "Secondly, to build a better country, having knowledgable and skillfull people is the key factor to boost economic growth and prosperity. Therefore, the government should look at this investment into education sector as investing into human capital development. If the citizen have the access to tuition fee less education, they will eventually turn out to be future economist, scientist, lawyer etc. that a country needs for it's development. Furthermore, with a free education system, more people will be interested to enhance their capabilities which is almost impossible when everyone has to pay for their education. Overall, the more free the education is, the more capable human capital a country will get.",
        "In conclusion, my view is every citizen deserves to be enlightened with knowledge, and the government needs to provide the platform by making education free for the people that will eventually turn them into future assets."
