        "Lately, it has been believed by certain people that Olympics has lost it's charm in the 21st century. This essay disagrees with this statement as Olympics is still as relevant as it was earlier. This essay will first highlight how Olympics is still the most looked after event for sportsmen throughout the world and then discuss how Olympics has provided alternate career options to many retired sportsmen.",
        "Olympics has always been considered as the greatest sporting carnival of all time. It is the dream of most sportsmen to win at least one Olympic medal in their lives. The recognition an Olympic medal brings to the sportsmen is unmatchable. An archer can be ranked the highest in world rankings but he would still desire an Olympic medal. Many sportsmen who have already won an Olympic medal, consider it to be the best highlight of their sporting careers. For instance in an interview given to BBC, Babita Phogat, a wrestler from India highlighted how winning an Olympic medal actually brought her the satisfaction she desired to acheive since her childhood.",
        "Olympics has also provided an alternate career to many retired sportsmen. In a survey conducted in the USA, it was deduced that nearly 50-60% of the retired sportsmen had some kind of Sports acadamies where they train many potential Olympic medal winners. These retired athletes and sportsmen stay in touch with these sports, shaping the careers of many future winners. They also do not need to depend on any other source of income after they retire as these acadamies actually provide them a sustainable source of income. Many retired sportsmen also make a career as commentators for live games while many become sports specialists for different media channels providing their valuable insights.",
        "To put in a nutshell, Olympics still as important as it was earlier. It is still the goal of budding sportsmen to win an Olympic medal and the fame provided by winning an Olympic medal paves an alternate career path to sportsmen once they decide to retire."
