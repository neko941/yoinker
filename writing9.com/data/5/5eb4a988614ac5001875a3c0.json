        "Presently,the use of alternative medicine is gradually taking root in the health care system. Nevertheless, these methods have been thought of to be inefficient and harmful. I completely disagree with this school of thought  as alternative forms of medicine have shown to be essential. In my opinion,alternative and conventional methods of treatment should be used together.",
        "One of the reasons people are often dismissive of the use of alternative medicine is because there is little or no research evidence to backup its efficacy.  According to a research done by Okon E. Okon in 2016 on 'The efficacy  of alternative medicine', it was reported that alternative drugs lacked research research backing to support its efficiency. Therefore, it's not readily prescribed by physicians . Another reason could be that alternative forms of treatment are often self prescribed by consumers. Due to the recent rise in self medication, people now prescribe drugs with little or no knowledge of drug interactions, in essence, complementary medicine like herbs sometimes interact with conventional drugs causing more harm than the good it was intended for.",
        "Notwithstanding, there are benefits to the use of alternative medicine, one of which is the fact that it is free of side effects. Complementary and alternative medicine that  are made from herbs are completely free from adverse effects due to the non- toxic nature of plants as they are naturally occurring unlike the conventional method of treatment. For example, a conventional drug like Diclofenac prescribed for pain causes nausea and vomiting as side effects but in the case of alternative forms of treatment, this is different.",
        "Furthermore, alternative forms of medicine tends to treat the root cause of the disease condition than merely treating symptoms.  For example, the chiropractors treat the root cause of any neuromuscular condition which is in contrast to popular practice of managing symptoms in conventional medicine. In essence, alternative medicine is both effective and harmless.",
        "To sum up, alternative medicine when compared to that of the conventional  is effective and less dangerous and should be used more often by clinicians. I strongly suggest that alternative medicine be used  along side conventional medicine as this would improve the quality of life of patients."
