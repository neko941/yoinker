        "A  isgroup of people is harmful to the environment. In this ,essay I will discuss how the goverment identify these problems and what can general people do. Firstly i will give some real-life examples of environmental problem solutions and secondly the prime role of people.",
        "Humans are extremely harmful to nature. A big number of people involved with this. They cut down trees in a large number as a result wild animals are no longer live in the forest. Even people catch dangerous and friendly   animals for food. At this moment, everywhere in the world focus on the economy rather than nature. They make industry in reserve forest area and farmland. So we can say, most of the time businessman or big company holders are a key factor for destroying the environment. Although some wood furniture company also cut down a tree from the forest.Another reason for damaging the environment is to kill wild animal. So that climate change rapidly. In terms of these problem solutions firstly, the government can give advertisements on television or newspaper, also they can add some topic about nature at primary school level. it will be beneficial for the next generation. Moreover, they should give punishment for build industry or big housing building on the forest area.",
        "On the other hand, general people can be a great prospective for solve this problem. like they can plant trees beside their home or make rooftop gardens in an urban areas. ,Also they can discourage other people to buy plastic because it's extremely harmful to nature especially for the soil. similarly, common people can start campaign on social media to save forset, animals and sea. By ,this a lot of people could be motivated for doing something",
        "In conclusion. there are lots of ways to dismiss nature through people. So government should take steps for this and common people also self do something for nature."
