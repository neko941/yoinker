        "It is argued that, state authorities should levy high taxes on fast food companies due to, many people are facing health related problems due to excessive consumption of fast food.I agree with this idea because money is the only factor can influence any situation.After implementing huge excise on this food centers. As a result, there would be increased menu prices which will have to bear by the customers and some other small fast food corners will get wind up.",
        "To embark upon, by imposing high taxation on junk food. By default consumers have to incurred the extra cost of food. As results there would be decrease in the comsumption of this food. One of the best examples can be, In India few years ago many people were suffering from smoking related health problems. Then government decided to increases the excise on cigerattes companies. As then the cost of cigrattees were increased by the corporatons. As a result, there has been reduction in the amount of smoking realated diseases.",
        "In addition, these tax funds can be used to educated people about the health diet. By advertising  on television, newspapers and campaign. Government should keep to setup health care centers for healthy food intake for giving direction to lead a healthy life. For example ,In 2011, government  of Japan has introduced \u201ceduccational health center\u201d in every town to sharing importance of having organic food and  procedures of how to avoid junk food.",
        "In conclusion, enforcing to pay huge taxes on these food corners and campaigning about prefering fresh food is worth to stop this junk food culture."
