        "I am writing to inquire about the upcoming Javacon seminar that will be taking place in New York City  next month. I have received an invitation through the mail, and I am thinking of signing up. Due to my company, Pisk Inc., possibly subsidizing my participation, I would like to know more about the details beforehand as I need this information for my proposal.",
        "First, I would like to inquire about the schedule and speakers of the seminar, and if it is already decided, would you also include the topics each speaker plans to present? Moreover, I would like to ask about the registration fee and its inclusions, and if there is a difference in fees if it is sponsored by a company or any discount I can possibly avail.",
        "Lastly, I would like to know the arrangement of the accommodation. Would it be provided by Javacon? If so, would you mind sharing the details of the place and location? Otherwise, could you give some recommendations on where the participants should stay?",
        "I am looking forward to hearing from you.",
        "Thank you in advance.",
        "Yours sincerely,",
