        "Dear Simon,",
        "I am Utsav, one of the tenants who lives on the 5th floor of the A-Star Building in Gurugram. I am writing this letter to express some of my concerns regarding the behaviour of my flatmate, Sam, who recently moved here.",
        "To begin with, Sam often plays loud music at late night in spite of a lot of warnings and complaints. Furthermore, the neighbours, Mr Mehta and his family, made a complaint yesterday to the local police station in regard to his condescending attitude towards them, having requested him to turn down the music, especially at late night.",
        "In the wake of this problem, I would like you to cancel his agreement as early as you can since it is rather difficult to share an apartment with him or shift him elsewhere if you may. I am certain that you would look into my suggestions at your earliest convenience.",
        "Yours faithfully,",
