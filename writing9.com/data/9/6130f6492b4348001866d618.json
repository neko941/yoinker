        "Using  mobile phones as a technological device has become increasingly in  recent years . Some people believe that this tendency  can reduce  real-human interactions. In my opinion, I completely agree with this view and  think that the excessive use of mobile phones may be one of the most reasons for a decrease in real relations.",
        "Firstly, people tend to connect with their friends and families via mobile calls up . In other words , the ease and convenience of communication between the population in any place where there are  and at all times encourage the population to use this device rather than in-person communication. For example, instead of driving the car or taking public transportations  in order to meet friends in a coffee or restaurant, individuals can make with them calls video via apps on smartphones comfortably and effortlessly. That is why persons tend to prefer more online socializing .",
        "Secondly , the smartphone  provides humans  with the possibility to practice many cheaper  and individual leisures.To put it simply, these technological devices help people to entertain  cheaply and individually such as video games and movies . For instance , adults prefer to watch movies in their home vis this gadget comfortably and cheaply rather than going to the cinema with friends . As a result, society will become more dependent on individual and virtual activities and therefore face to face meetings will be decreased .",
        "In conclusion, I strongly believe that  the new technological gadgets may lead lack of real-humans interactions because it offers  the ease and convenience of communication and provides many of virtual individual leisures ."
