        "How are you? It's been so long since we've contacted each other. Anyway, I'm writing to inform you that after working abroad for many years, I want you to know that I finally bought my dream house two days ago. The house has 3 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms and a garage, even though I don't have a car. Anyway, jokes aside, although the kitchen is small the master's bedroom is what I like the most. It has a veranda where I can see most of the houses nearby.",
        "Speaking of my neighbourhood, most of them are elderly people and children, which is fine by me, since I don't like noise very much. We also have security guards roaming around the place, which give me a breather and a Zumba activity every Monday to Friday morning.",
        "If you have spare time, you can come and visit the place, I'm excited to show you what my house looked like. It might not be the same house that I keep telling you about since we were kids but it's good for me.",
