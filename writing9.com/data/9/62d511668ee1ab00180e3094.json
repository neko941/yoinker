        "Thank you so much for the lovely photos as they have reminded me of the wonderful moments we had spent together. You pampered me so thoroughly that I feel completely rejuvenated and refreshed after the holidays. It was so kind of you to stay me put at your place in Melbourne.",
        "Sorry, it has taken me too long to write back and thank you. The thing is, without boring you with details, I've been put under a huge amount of pressure at work to finish a certain task in an unreasonable timeframe, immediately after I joined my office back in Abu Dhabi. If it were not for the resulting stress clouding my brain, I would've written to you sooner.",
        "Anyways, my birthday is coming up on the 22nd of August and I want you guys to join me for the party. Also, as this is going to be your first trip to UAE, you guys must stay with me. Moreover, my family would be delighted to meet you both. I really hope you can make it.",
