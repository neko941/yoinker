        "It is often believed that an active pastime is more effective in terms of children's development rather than reading all the time. I vehemently accord with the given fact that a constructive leisure period is significantly helpful for offspring's skill development.",
        "To begin with, there are myriad reasons behind my agreement . The most prominent one is that spending active pastime would be helpful for the improvement of children's social and communication skills . To elucidate further, this would not only improve the leadership ability but also teach them how to co-operate with others when they play in a group. For instance, an article by ILO in 2015 published that kids are more likely to be extroverts in future if they play in a group since childhood. Therefore, it is clear that  active pastime has a great impact on children's growth.",
        "Are there any other reasons behind this? Certainly, there are. Offspring can do different activities such as gardening, photography, art and craft , which might play an important role in order to make them organized as well as punctual. To decipher this. If a child does gardening , it would teach him how to organize everything in terms of making a perfect garden, which might enhance his organization skill. for example, an article published by the Times - revealed that pupils who are good at co-curricular activities are more likely to shine in life. Hence, it is inevitable that an effective leisure period can be more helpful in a kid's betterment.",
        "To conclude, in spite of having the fact that reading is important for children's improvement, a pastime with effective activities plays the most essential part in order to create a better citizen of the society. Nevertheless. parents should arrange proper equipment and games so that their offspring can effectively utilize their pastimes."
