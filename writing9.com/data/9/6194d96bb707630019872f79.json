        "I wanted to raise this as a concern with you, as I haven't received my chequebook, even after two weeks. To add on, I had an awful experience while I tried to enquire regarding this through customer support. To be precise, I should have received the item I ordered, by now.",
        "Also, when I tried to enquire regarding the same with your customer support officials, to know how much longer will I have to wait to receive the same, I was given a lethargic reply, making me feel unproductive about the call.",
        "I have never been treated this bad and thus I thought to raise it as a concern, with the respective officials. I was looking forward to making my transactions in the forthcoming days, but all that I experienced was a disappointment. The least I wish to know from your end is, how much longer will it take for you to deliver the cheque book, based on which I can bank on or look for other alternatives. I request you to keep me posted on this issue.",
