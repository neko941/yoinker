        "To begin with, I share my room with another student and he seems to be awake all night listening to very loud music. Further, he often has visitors to the room, which is quite disturbing. Moreover, I am not able to have a good sleep and am unable to concentrate on my studies. Thus, this situation is adversely affecting my grades at college.",
        "Hence, I request you to kindly change my roommate to someone who is much more considerate, or even I am more than happy to live alone. In addition, I am still fine with shifting to a smaller room, if I'm on my own, as I think that way it would be more peaceful.",
