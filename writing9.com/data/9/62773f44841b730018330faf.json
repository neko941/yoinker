        "Dear Mr Collins,",
        "I am writing to complain about some issues with the community pool.Overall, I have been deeply pleased with the swimming  pool choice. It is convenient for my job, and I love that it is located in a quiet area. However, I have recently been dissatisfied with the condition of the swimming pool.",
        "The first thing I would like to draw your attention to is that the pool has been in such an irritating condition, which means it has currently been filthy and littered with trash  and dead bugs.I consider this to be a serious health hazard.",
        "To make matters worse, some people have also violated the rules of the pool to maintain its cleanliness as expected.For instance, last week,I noticed a guy that spat in the water which I found utterly disgusting.I would like to have a safe and clean pool to enjoy.",
        "I am kindly asking that you address these matters promptly.",
        "Yours sincerely,"
