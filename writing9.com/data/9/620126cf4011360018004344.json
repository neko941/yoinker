I am your ardent fan, I came to your concert last week with my friends. While you were singing lines from your first album, I could see tears rolling down my cheeks after hearing them.",

In my hometown, I am singing in a local band and practising a new method to reach a high pitch during my performances is not yielding better results. If you could share your opinions on how to lose the stage fear and sustain for a longer period of time before the crowd.",
