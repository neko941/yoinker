        "Dear Mr and Mrs James,",
        "Greetings, I am Saman from Sri Lanka. I am writing this letter with regards to the vacancy advertisement which I read in Australian Sunday Morning on 24th June 2022. I would like to apply for the position that you have mentioned,  \"Look after a six-year-old child Kevin\". Though I am currently working in Sri Lanka as a preschool teacher, I will be in Australia  next month for an Educational Tour. So, it would be nice if I can stay with you  while looking after your baby.",
        "I am experienced in early childhood education for almost ten years now. Moreover, during my leisure time, I am working in a day-care centre looking after six kids like yours.  So, I hope I am an ideal candidate for the requirement.",
        "During my free time, I  plan to visit the Canberra Museum to collect some information about aboriginals. That is for a lecture, which I am going to deliver after I come back from Australia.",
        "Well let me stop here, I am eagerly waiting for your reply to this letter. If you need more information, please feel free to contact me. Thank you in advance.",
        "Yours sincerely,",
        "Saman."
