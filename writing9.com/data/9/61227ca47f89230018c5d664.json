        "There is an opinion that sports hold equal importance in the lives of grown-up individuals and kids.I support the given view furthermore, I even believe that games are  more needed for the minors than elders.The aim of this essay is to articulate my perception.",
        "I agree with the given statement, it is because of the fact that a healthy lifestyle is  important not only for  toddlers but also for  grown-up individuals.That means games are important for the little ones for their bodily development ,whereas, for  the adults,  they are required for keeping their body fit and energetic.For example, cycling improves the leg muscle strength for infants and for adults, it decreases their extra calories.Thus it is helping both.Therefore, I feel that sports are to be taken by  kids and elders.",
        "Additionally, I opine that playing is are more crucial for the pupils due to the fact that their physical, as well as mental growth, depends on their bodily moments.In other words, the more active they are the more growth we can see in them.For instance, it is easily seen that kids who do not spend their time in any kind of game are seen to be less active than the infants who play a lot. In the case of  the adults, they can even go to a gym and do exercise to be fit.However, games are the only choice for  toddlers to grow and be healthy.",
        "To conclude, it is true that games are important for both children and adults and I completely agree with it. Moreover, I feel that engaging in gaming activities is more necessary for  children than  grown-ups."
