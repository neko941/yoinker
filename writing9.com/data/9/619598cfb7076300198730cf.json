        "I am writing regardless of the volunteer positions announced in the local newspaper. It would be of my greatest interest to apply for one of these positions. I believe that doing volunteer work is a wonderful opportunity to help the community and for personal growth. In addition, I am a history graduate at college. That is why the position would be perfect for me.",
        "Besides my interest in history, I am an extremely punctual person, you would not have to worry about that. One more thing to add is that I have a great relationship with children, due to this, I would be more than happy to organize the kids' visits to the museum, especially if they are on a field trip.",
        "I am available to start the work as soon as possible and I must say that because of my regular job, my disponibility to work at the museum is during the mornings, so a part-time position would suit me well.",
        "I am looking forward to hearing from you. Thank you for considering my application.",
