        "Arguably, it is relevant to Boys and Girls to distinguish the gap between good and bad things  at an earlier stage of their lives and instil castigation as the way out to teach them.  Personally, I strongly disagree with the view since a better education method is not necessarily  to punish.  Although in  extreme cases  this measure is the unique outlet. This essay will shed light on both sides of the view and provide evidence to prove the arguments.",
        "On the one hand, better education  for youngsters does not mean punishment at all.  In other words, educational connoisseurs  do not recognise  any sort of  castigation as the  mean for  teenagers' teaching. However,  dialogue is the most relevant  and it  has shown to be  effective in these cases.  the  experience made by the University of Cambridge on psycho-development of children pointed out that four-fifths of  Boys and Girls who  were  punched  after  wrongdoing tended to be disorientated, while those who provided a long conversation were more  fascinated and  well-succeeded in  school matters. As  a result,   the starter group hardly inserted themself into society, while  the second  team  helped communities in different activities. Furthermore, castigation is seen as the overriding reason for street children.",
        "On the other hand,   rebels Boys and Girls deserve stricter punishment. Because of  worse deeds done by them, in some cases penalization is necessary. For example,  in Brasil shantytown are plentiful of  youngsters who  provoke and  insult deliberately, these  teenagers should not only be  disciplined,that said, they should be imprisoned to receive rehabilitation in detention centres. Hence, they  cooperate with communities and effortlessly  help them.",
        "To sum up,  notwithstanding that  any sort of  youngsters'criminilization prove to be effective, it  should solely take into consideration  serious offences, otherwise,  dialogue must be the first attempt to correct them so that they straightforwardly distinguish what is right and wrong.  Therefore,  I still strongly disagree with the view."
