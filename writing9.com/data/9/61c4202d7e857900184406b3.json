        "Dear Sir,",
        "I am Annie Willson , one of the regular customers of your electronic shop located at Parkinson Square. This letter is in regards to a recent purchase of a docking station.",
        "The product worked absolutely fine for the first week. However, the USB ports are not responding when a new device is being connected to it. This issue is a blocker for my office work while working from home. Indeed, it is of utmost importance to connect multiple display screens like monitors and laptops. Furthermore, there were additional connecting cables provided and none of them seems to be appropriate due to inconsistent port designs and length. As a matter of fact, prolonged usage of devices is causing overheating.",
        "Therefore, I request you to replace the instrument as it is still under warranty period. Kindly let me know if any further details are required like bill receipt and model details. Looking forward to your prompt response.",
