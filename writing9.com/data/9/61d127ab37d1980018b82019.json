        "Dear Sir,",
        "I writing to you to inform the problems associated with the recent repair works that had taken place in my apartment. Please allow me to explain.",
        "As you know the repair was initiated to fix the broken sliding doors in the kitchen. Unfortunately, I am still facing trouble while closing the slide doors. I believe it was not fixed perfectly with screws because it could hear some cracking noise while pushing the doors. In addition, the lock which was fitted on the door had fallen down the day before yesterday.",
        "I would like to suggest that we could replace the slide doors with normal double doors because I have been using standard double doors for over 9 years in my old building and that is working perfectly fine. Moreover, I will purchase a new lock to replace the broken one as it is highly imperative for me.",
        "If possible, I would request you to find a good carpenter who could fit in both the items at any time when I am at home in the evenings. If you would like to further discuss, please call me on my mobile.",
