        "I hope this email finds you well. It has been a while we have not seen each other. In response to your job search, there is a cement company near our city, not too far from my house, which is looking for a mechanical engineer, not necessarily a solid mechanic.",
        "I attached an advert to this letter, as you can see, there are some descriptions of the job responsibilities. There are some drawbacks to this occupation. For instance, it is clearly mentioned that you will not be promoted after years of experience. Having said that, there is a wide range of benefits, such as pension as well as paternity, even though some night works are mandatory.",
        "As I remember about your personality traits, this job is suitable for you since you used to stay awake until dawn to see the sunrise. I hope you have not changed your habit since then because it can truly help you to fit the job requirement.",
        "In the advert it is recommended to apply for this job through their website; however, I guess you can accelerate the processing time if I send your resume from here. For this reason, please send your documents to my mail address.",
        "I am really looking forward to seeing you in my city one day.",
