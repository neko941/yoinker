        "It is debatable whether the nations in the tropical zone, which have hot and humid climates or in the temperature zone, which have cold and dry climates are  preferable for people. In this essay, the advantages and disadvantages of each climate will be presented to support each view before my perspective toward the statement is reached.",
        "On the one hand, hot weather nations, which are located in the tropical zone are  wonderful places for a vacation for many tourists who enjoy beaches as well as iced beverages and dessert. For example, due to the hot climate, Thailand, a tropical country, has the most beautiful beaches in the world  and is a must-go destination for tourists across the world. Over a years, a million  visitors from Europe and America come to enjoy the hot season in harmony with iced drinks such as iced coffee, tea, and icecreams. Furthermore, the dry weather in winter areas can cause dry skin leading to cracked or even bleeding skin. Therefore, people living in cold temperatures need to wear lotions and oil to prevent their skin from low temperatures.",
        "On the one hand, people prefer  low-temperature countries because they enjoy snow and cold weather. They can enjoy  outdoor activities without being afraid of  dehydration. For instance, people in Europe nations prefer to drink hot coffee out of the shade as they need to warm themselves with sunlight, which cannot do this activity in Thailand as you will be burned by the sun. Moreover, the cold temperature is suitable for  tourists who like adventure activities including camping and long motorcycle trip. As winter is more comfortable for camping than summer, many people are encouraged to go camping in winter.",
        "In conclusion, each particular zone has its own benefits and drawbacks. It depends on personal preference and the original countries of the person to make a decision which ones are better. In my opinion , I was born in Thailand, which is a very hot country. Hence, I prefer to live in cold countries as it is a new experience and more exciting for me."
