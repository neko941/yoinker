        "Dear Mr Jones,",
        "I am Paul, who recently rented your block number 306-B in Bruno wills residency. I am writing this letter to let you know about the issues me and my family are encountering because of one of the neighbours residing at 307-B.",
        "Let me explain the situation thoroughly. Being tired because of moving, we were sleeping peacefully, when suddenly we woke up to insanely loud screaming followed by loud music. I came to know that Mr Jay, a resident of 307 is a drunkard man and he beats his wife which is not only a bad influence for my kids but also for society as a whole. Moreover, because of chronic heart condition, doctors have advised complete rest to my mother, however, she can't as due to the screams, either she wakes up alarmed or unable to sleep at all. Owing to the fact that we are neighbours, I requested him multiple times to stop this behaviour but he never entertains my request.",
        "Would you kindly step in and solve this issue?, as I\u2019ve notified the apartment association about this, but I\u2019m waiting in vain for an action. Please pitch in and resolve it. Else, I have to move to another flat.",
        "Thanks for your consideration.",
        "Yours sincerely,",
        "Paul."
