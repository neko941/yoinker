        "Competition is regarded as the best feature an individual  should possess in society.I believe that it is a beneficiary development because it makes people work hard and influence them to achieve their aims.This essay will explain in detail the reasons for my stance as well as examples in the subsequent paragraphs.",
        "To begin with ,the most compelling reason for agreeing with this view is hard work.If there is a lot of competition in a nation ,it helps individuals to work very hard.For instance,a lot of companies are doing advertisements on the media to ensure that their product reaches their customers.Moreover,it helps businesses to bring out their best strategies in order for customers to purchase their services because there are a lot of companies around working towards achieving the same goal .Hence , this leads to everyone working effectively to attain their aim.",
        "Secondly,another reason for concording with this view is it impacts humans to attain their goals.Someone who wants to win an award learns hard so that they can come out as a winner .For example,those involved in the National Science and Math Quiz make sure they learn well to be first in the competition.Besides  ,someone who wants to pass their final examination has to study hard in order to pass.To illustrate,because I wanted to be a doctor I made sure to study enough to pass my  final exams .Am now a doctor because of the hard work I put into studying .Although competitions make people cheat ,it helps individuals to accomplish their aim.",
        "In conclusion,the essay argued that competitiveness is a positive development and they are an impact on society.Working hard and attainment  of purpose are  the two reasons I opine with this opinion."
