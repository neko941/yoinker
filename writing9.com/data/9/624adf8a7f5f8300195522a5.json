        "Quite contrary to the conventional custom that absorbs the majority of pupils to schools for pursuing their studying,some guardians prefer their children to follow their pedagogical plans at home.However,in my point of view, the benefits of attending classrooms surpass in various aspects.Nevertheless,both sides are uttered here.",
        "One of the most highlighted positive footprints of going to school has to do with individuals' social abilities, which would increase drastically if they are in touch with both other students  and teachers as well.As a vivid case,not only plays a critical role in their psychological health but they would not encounter problems interacting with other people in their subsequent lives.Furthermore,owing to the knowledgeable trainers that exist at educational centres,neither their talents nor their energy would be squandered.For instance,the authorities of schools will detect the probable shortcomings that pupils may suffer from,as they have adequate experience in this realm.",
        "On the other hand, juveniles' concentration is a worth mentioning factor in their prosperity in education.To enlighten,not only would not they be interrupted by their classmates but also the risk of getting involved with adverse activities would decrease sharply.To illustrate,they won't be absorbed in smoking with their friend if they are not in touch with them.Moreover,it is necessary for restricting the spread of viruses in emergency situations.For example,in the last three years,the domination of covid19 has forced all the countries to lock down their schools and provide required infrastructures for folks to attend their classes from their homes.",
        "To conclude,while some affirmative aspects can be considered regarding studying at home,such as prohibiting either the spread of diseases or being misled by palls,to me,its dire consequences outweigh.As a result,the youngster may do not get mature enough if do not communicate with others."
