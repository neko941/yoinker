        "As mentioned aforehand, I faced a bad service yesterday when doing my monthly shopping in the Kuningan branch. It was caused by the cashier's rude attitude in servicing customers. I found out that the amount I paid was different from the number on the bill. Then, I came back to the store and informed the dispute to her, but I got an inappropriate response from her. Subsequently, she scolded me and said that I was a liar and had no intention to follow up on my complaint. At that moment, I was quite shocked and blank so I got back to my car and went home. Nevertheless, I tried to find out the manager in charge and here I am writing this to you.",
        "I am writing this, not to get my fund back because it is not about the money though, but to express my disappointment so you can manage to make sure such service will not happen again. Moreover, I suggest you  re-train your staff in order to be more friendly and solutive to customers.",
