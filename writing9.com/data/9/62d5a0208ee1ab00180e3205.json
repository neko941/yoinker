        "I am a student in the management degree program at Ottawa University and at the moment, I live in the university hostel building. I live in a shared basis room at the hostel, however, I am having trouble studying for my final exams because of my roommate`s behaviour.",

Secondly, he always wants to keep the music playing in the background which won't give me any space to concentrate on my studies. Finally, although we live under one roof, he always borrows my things without even taking my permission.",
        "Since I have my final exams by next week, I would like to have a room on my own. I am aware that the prices of the single rooms are quite high compared to sharing basis but I am happy to pay extra and to move as soon as I could.",
