        "Respected Sir,",
        "I am writing to express my extreme disappointment with a recent purchase of a camera from your outlet in Dubai, on the 20th of April 2020. Some of the parts are missing from the box that I  later realised on reaching Singapore.",
        "On 22nd December, I purchased the A3580 model which was supposed to be with the tripod stand from the airport's duty-free Canon outlet. As I was about to board a flight, they gave me  sealed packaging and assured me of every part within the package. Along with the camera, I also purchased an extended international warranty for the product.",
        "Nevertheless, when I arrived at my Singapore residence, on opening the parcel I noticed that the tripod items are missing from the box. I  then called your international customer care who advised me to contact the local team.",
        "Therefore, I would request you to please deliver the missing items as per my enclosed bill with this letter at the earliest. If the delivery can not be provided within two days, I would like to get a full refund along with the cost of the additional warranty I had purchased. Looking forward to hearing a prompt response from you.",
