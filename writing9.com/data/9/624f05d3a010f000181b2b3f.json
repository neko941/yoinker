        "People have different options regarding educational systems. While many nations are argued that some educational classifications encourage scholarships to certain courses at the age of 15,whereas, others considered that nations should study  a huge collection of  subjects until they leave school. This essay will examine the reasons for this action and the forthcoming paragraphs will discuss both benefits and drawbacks  of systems.",
        "On the one hand,the basic advantage of studying in  a certain direction is that children can concentrate their minds in exact ways.In other words, if humans studied according to their interests, so they can reach some kind of goal.Additionally,if scholarships studied the exact course, then they can chance to  spend  more time thinking right direction. For example, I  studied foreign language school which adapted linguistic subjects,especially  the English language that's why nowadays I have more language skills than those who studied in the general institute.",
        "Turning off the other hands of  argument, the main advantage of studying in general universities is that the population can catch lots of information.Because youngsters studied lots of courses like art, science, technology and so on. In contrast, societies that studied in  traditional institutions had more intelligence than those that studied in special departments. For instance, Uzbekistan's educational system built that the community must be studied in a general academy until they graduate school after that they can change to choose their future career  to accord their interest.",
        "In conclusion, I support both types of combinations. I think  those systems have their usage place and time."
