        "In the realm of  children improvement,some people believe that guardians have the main effect on them,whereas the opponents have alleged that Tv and their friends are more powerful to influence them.However,in my point of view,they both are indispensable in forming the personality of the learners.mentioned sides are uttered here.",
        "One of the most highlighted discrepancies between parents and others has to do with their positions in the mind of their offspring,while they are usually looked up to as the heroes of their next generation,Therefore,they are pursued by toddlers as roleodes.For instance,based on the surveys that have taken place in this area,the majority of juveniles are similar to their parents in various sectors,such as either their character or even the same capabilities to encountering the issues.Furthermore,the bold roles of the elderly emerge in the situations that the young requires to be conducted via consultation or more harsh reactions.As a vivid case,the older not only are aware of the threats for the juveniles owing to the experiences that they used to have but also they have a better prospect of the conditions that appear while they are monitoring the activity of their adolescents,which can be exploited to control them in hazardous circumstances.In other words,they can assist their heir to opt for appropriate programs or even friends.",
        "On the other hand,owing to the close understanding that individuals have if they are in the same age,it is clear that babies are attracted to people in their age,hence they will learn a lot of things from them by mimicking their function,which has been released by the experts.For example,in the conditions that there are divergent toys,most of the unadult folks are absorbed in the ones that their patrons are using  and even if they change their mind regarding the utilisation of objects again the followers would strive to get the new one.Moreover,the broadcasted cartoons from Tv have the potential to penetrate their audiences as an offspring of the professional mindsets that have been exploited to build that.Namely,using scion to play opted roles in movies or even looking at the globe from the prospect that their followers can perceive,which stimulate the youngster to trust in and accept the issues that have been transmitted to them.",
        "To recapitulate,although some individuals have claimed that friends and Tv have a stronger impression on  children due to the appealing energy that they have,the rest mentioned their guardians as the main manager,who can control the activity of their offspring.Anyway,to me they both have their share in the life of the young,so,a mixture of them should be considered to guide the juvenile toward the appropriate goals."
