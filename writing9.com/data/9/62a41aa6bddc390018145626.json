        "Dear Jenny,",
        "I am glad to hear from you again. Hope your family and you are doing well. I am happy to know that you are going to go on a camping holiday for the first time this summer. Have you chosen the place yet? If not, I will suggest to chose Phu Quoc Island, which is located in Vietnam.",
        "Phu Quoc is my favourite place to have a trip with my family and friends. Since it is nearby the beach, the weather is cool during the daytime and a little cold at night; therefore, you can organize more outdoor activities and BBQs for the dinner. You will completely enjoy the trip and have a lot of fun.",
        "However, the camping area is a little far from the hospital and pharmacy store, you should save a few popular medicines that are just in case you need them urgent. Furthermore, it is also far  from away convenient stores and restaurants that take around 30 minutes to drive a car, so food and drinks should be prepared in advance.",
        "I am trying to complete all my work projects as soon as possible and asking for a short vacation leave. Otherwise, I am excited to have a trip with you this summer, I will send you an email to let you know soon. I can not wait to see you and that place again.",
        "Best Regards,",
