        "Many participants liked the hotel and its cleanliness. However, they didn't like the food ,especially the seafood that was served for both meals in which seafood was not really fresh and a few dishes were too oily. And there was no vegetable dish too even though I requested to include one. Also, the cake was too sweet and the coffee was like water.",
        "Since the meeting was all day long and they only had a short meal break of about an hour and the distance to the nearest food court was about 30 minutes away. So  it is impossible for them to go and eat outside.",
        "Due to the aforementioned inconvenience, many participants were unhappy and they have requested not to use your hotel next time. Thus,  I would like to suggest the manager take this as a good lesson and try to improve the food in future.",
        "Yours Faithfully,",
