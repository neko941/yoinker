        "I am writing this letter to bring your attention to one of the problems I have faced with your Uber driver  who cancelled my ride due to the payment method I selected. This caused  huge trouble for me as I was about to miss my exam.",
        "Actually, I was having an exam in Abbotsford and so I decided to book an Uber. But what happened surprised me. I confirmed my ride but the uber driver did not move from his location for 30 minutes. Then I called him and he asked me to cancel the ride as he did not accept the online payment method.Reluctantly, I had to cancel that trip as I was left with no option. Moreover, I had charges deducted and I had to book another cab in a hurry which caused anxiety and pressure.",
        "I would appreciate it if you analyse the situation and come up with a solution. The behaviour of the driver was unacceptable at that point and I want you to take action against him. Further, the troubles with online payments need to be solved. In addition, I want my charges back which were deducted for cancelling that trip.",
        "I would be thankful to you.",
