        "Nowadays, it has been suggested that providing an equal amount of income to all the employees can lead to a homogeneous atmosphere and higher social cohesion. Yet, there remains a contentious debate as to whether can this phenomenon be a beneficial step or a destructive scenario. I partially disagree with this topic and will support my idea with more details and practical examples.",
        "Firstly, this process can result in a significant drop in motivation among the team. In addition, this is an indisputable fact that different levels of income can make a competitive situation for all the operatives to try harder and reach higher efficiency for a better economic condition; however, providing the same financial incentive for all workers can harm this influential procedure. For instance, operators will have lower enthusiasm to work harder as there is no additional perk or promotion;  it has an insurmountable impact on the overall outcome and revenue of the company. Consequently, having an equal monetary condition for staff can omit the importance of competition; also, the organization will suffer from the possible consequences, particularly lack of initiative and motivation.",
        "On the other hand, neither discrimination nor bias will appear in the working environment. Regarding the fact that all the initiatives will be treated equally, there would be a safe and balanced condition for everyone to accentuate their tasks and project without being anxious about  possible income fluctuations. One particularly salient example is the case when all the personnel are working on different parts of a project and try to share their ideas and aid each other without the afraid of being betrayed for better financial promotions. Thus, a more reliable situation will be established for the team  to focus on their responsibilities and contribute more to the total efficiency of the company.",
        "As a way of conclusion, I once again reaffirm that building this situation for employees can lead to higher trustworthiness as well as better reliability among the workers, but no competition means no effort for higher efficiency which can strongly affect the organization. In other words, it is highly recommended to have cognitive processes for the operators to keep the harmony rather than paying the same incomes."
