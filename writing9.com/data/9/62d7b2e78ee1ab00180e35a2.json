        "It was a grey Lenovo laptop having model number ABC12345 and was in a black backpack which has my office logo \"TCS\" embroidered on it. The bag also contains my office ID card that can help you to verify my belongings.",
        "I remember, after using it I had placed it over the side tray of my seat 13A. Suddenly, the train did an emergency stop just on the outskirts of Mumbai which created panic among the passengers. It was around 4:15 PM and as I have to get off immediately, I must have forgotten it there in a rush.",
        "I will appreciate it if you can help me in relocating it and possibly keep it in a safe place as it was an office property and contains crucial information about my company's data. If you find the laptop with the above details, please contact me on +99 991199119.",
