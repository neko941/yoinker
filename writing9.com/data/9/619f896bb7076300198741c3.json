        "I am writing to apologize for my absence from the charity event our company held on Sunday to fundraise money for orphan children. In fact, my sister had already previously scheduled her marriage to the same night as the event as I could not miss this special occasion for our family.",
        "The wedding was planned to start at 6pm, one hour before the company's event. However, despite the fact I am the bride's sister, I was also invited to be one of her bridesmaids. Therefore, I could not even arrive later at the marriage.",
        "Nonetheless, I would like to reach my co-worker's efforts by giving a solo contribution to raise money to help those orphans children. Thus, I have been wondering if I could sell some treats in our enterprise to raise more cash for them, at least for a week. Would you authorize it?",
        "I look forward to contributing to this amazing initiative from our workplace. I would very much appreciate your help.",
