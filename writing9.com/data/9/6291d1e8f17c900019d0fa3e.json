It was in red colour, on the backside of the phone, there will be a green colour tag which shows my name and number as well. Moreover,  this phone was very close to my heart as this was gifted by my parents.",
        "On Sunday, in the morning at 9AM,  I was going to surrey city to meet one of my friends and I am sure that I had my  phone with me while boarding the train at Burnaby station, in fact, I had a quick a call from my father at Burnaby parking slot. Due to the holiday season, there was a huge rush on the train and I am sure that I left my phone in my seat 28.",
        "Furthermore,  I can bring all relevant documents such as Invoice copy and bank statement as  proof and I would request you to please check the train inside cameras. in addition, It will be good, if we can coordinate with the network provider as they can trace out the phone single  very quickly.",
        "I look forward to hearing an update from you on my request.",
