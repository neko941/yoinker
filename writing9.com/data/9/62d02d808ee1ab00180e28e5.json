        "These days, it is apparent that commercial advertisement is able to increase the sale of promoted products and services. While this seems to benefit  the companies, some people argue that spending a substantial budget on advertising is not worth implementing. In this essay, both points of view will be elaborated before my perspective to support the former views is reached.",
        "On the one hand, advertisements dramatically proliferate the cost of production. In order to promote the products, the companies need to spend an enormous amount of budget on hiring influencers and film production, purchasing broadcasting time on various media such as TV, social media, radio, and so on. For example, the luxury women's bags branded Celine purchased 10 million US dollars to hire Lisa, a member of a Korean girl group named Blackpink, to be a brand ambassador. Moreover, due to the augmentation in the cost of production, the price of selling in markets also rises too. As the result, it will be more difficult for many customers to afford the goods or services.",
        "On the other hand, advertisement significantly raises the awareness of people toward the brand. When people realize the value of the brand, they are satisfied to buy products. For instance, although Celine spent 10 million US dollars for hiring Lisa, the handbag that Lisa posted the picture with on her Instagram, was sold out within an hour after her posting, which make a lot of profit and cost 100 million US dollars to the company. Furthermore, it is a promising method to communicate with the customers to let them know more about the brand and know the property of the goods. Without advertisement, no one will notice that the brand is existing.",
        "In summary, In spite of the drastic increase in the price of the goods and the cost of production owing to advertising, I believe that it is worth it for the company to invest money in this aspect as it can raise brand attention, and increase sales."
