        "It is arguable that the overwhelming majority of nations favour the children apprenticeship rather than mature individuals who are believed that the ruling powers should squander public funds on them. Personally, I strongly disagree with the view since the national future relies on youngsters. Albeit,  adults play their role in  regional development. This essay will shed light on both sides of the view and provide anecdotal evidence to prove the arguments.",
        "On the one hand, the advancement  of a nation depends on  how the future generation is trained. In other words,  this investment in them is a must since they are the future doctors,  engineers,  and teachers. For instance,  the recent  research carried out by the University Zambeze  pointed out that the most successful nations throughout the world are those which frittered  a significant  amount of   money on  Boys and Girls. As a result,  vital regional sectors  are equipped with  specialized personnel, which helps communities.  Furthermore,  the best way  to  guarantee the nation's advancement  is undoubtedly through education on children.",
        "On the other hand,  adults are also part of  the republic's development.  The role  is to transmit the experience  to the younger generation in different  spheres of knowledge such as education, pharmaceutical, industry, and security. Moreover,  it is their duty to secure a peaceful transition from one generation to another. For example,  in African countries, despite  the  majority  of local adults being illiterate, they are vitally transmitting their past livings to young ones. Consequently,  Boys and Girls  are prepared in an earlier stage to take charge tomorrow.",
        "In conclusion,  notwithstanding the pivotal role  mature people play in  society, it is meaningless  to spend  a huge amount of money on them. However, equal action  on children is justified because  they are guarantors of the country's amelioration. Therefore, I still strongly disagree with  the statement."
