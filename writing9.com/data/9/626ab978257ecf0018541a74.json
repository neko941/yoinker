        "Dear Lourenco,",
        "I am writing to express my disappointment in relation to the refundable deposit we came to an agreement prior to my renting contract assignment in your apartment complex 2 years back.",
        "As aligned, we were told that any existing problem found in the apartment would be paid by an additional value when assigning the contract. Nevertheless, as you could see last week during your inspection, no issues were found in the surroundings, which gives the right to turn to you and ask for this spare payment made in the very beginning. I have emailed the receptionist about this, but she said this refund is up to you.",
        "Therefore, I thereby would appreciate it if you could deposit the money  I paid 2 years ago to access the residence. If legal action is necessary to solve this, I  will be contacting my private lawyer to take part as well, perhaps it might be a plan B in case our alignment does not work.",
        "Yours sincerely,",
