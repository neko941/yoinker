        "It is widely held that visitors should be charged for admission to museums. However, this policy is both a curse and a blessing. In my opinion, the benefits of charging visitors to the museums outweigh the drawbacks.",
        "To begin with, one evident disadvantage of charging people for museum admissions is that they will be inaccessible for certain people. This is because individuals who have low incomes will be deterred from visiting museums due to the charges. With the growth in economic downturns, their priority tends to be given to fundamental needs rather than paying to appreciate the arts. Another point to consider is that it will discourage the public from visiting museums, especially for someone who is not interested in the first place. Consequently, museums will lose their popularity and will become unnecessary places since few people are keen to visit them.",
        "On the other hand, it is undeniable that charging individuals for visiting museums is essential for the maintenance of museums. This is due to the fact that the government is unlikely to be concerned about providing sufficient funds for maintaining museums, so it is the responsibility of caretakers to maintain the building in order to attract more visitors, raising their popularity. In addition, museum entry fees are vital in countries that rely on tourism as a main source of income. For example, a country whose museums are significant tourist attractions such as France will gain an enormous amount of money from museum admission fees, contributing to the development of the country. This proves that museum admission fees are beneficial for not only museums but also nations.",
        "In conclusion, although there are negative aspects of charging museums' visitors as it will deter access of some individuals and lessen their popularity, I am inclined to believe that the advantages overshadow the disadvantages in terms of generating income in countries and supporting the maintenance of  museums."
