        "Dear Sir or Madam,",
        "I am writing this letter to express my concern to improve shopping facilities in my area. I am a resident of  Acme Heights 2 and I have been living here for the last 10 years. These days all the residents of our society face a big problem.",
        "Firstly, I am glad that we have a small shopping complex nearby from where almost all the basic things can be purchased. All types of amenities are available in this area except the pharmacy which is very much needed. To purchase any type of medicine we have to travel a long way and sometimes in an emergency we feel so inconvenient to go far away from home. We have older people living with us who needs medication on daily basis.",
        "So I would like to request you to open a small pharmacy around our society from where we can have at least our day-to-day medicine. This way, everyone will feel safe and secure.",
