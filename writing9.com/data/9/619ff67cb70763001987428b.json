        "People are always calling into question the effectiveness of various activities on the overall health level. Although some people argue that reaching this goal can be possible just by expanding sports infrastructures, others, including me believe there are more effective ways. Both these views will be elaborated on followed by my own take on the matter.",
        "On the one hand, boosting sports amenities is more likely to stimulate people to be healthier. When accessing  proper sports infrastructures with ease, individuals are bound to work out regularly during the day. Consequently, people can entirely enhance their immune system that results from avoiding inactivity. For instance, equal distribution of gyms in the whole city might encourage the elderly to do more exercise and prevent some chronic diseases like back pain. Furthermore, this is highly likely to bring about overcoming other hurdles in the way of doing sports. These barriers which derive the public to lead a sedentary life and as a result decrease their health, are such as lack of sports facilities during the day.",
        "On the other hand, there might be other measurements to adjust the public health level. Firstly, educating individuals to have a balanced diet and avoid any unhealthy foods. To be more exact, eating fast food that is full of sugar, fat and salt not only can lead to obesity  but also heart attack, stroke and diabetes. Moreover, avoiding destructive habits like smoking, using drugs and drinking too much alcohol. People will not have a proper health level, though quiet these bad habits.",
        "In conclusion, even though improving sports \u2018 infrastructures could be a compelling reason, I strongly that there should other factors to measure human\u2019s health like paying more attention to intake or avoiding negative habits."
