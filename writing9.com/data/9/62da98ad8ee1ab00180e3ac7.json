        "I know all of us are so busy with our assignments and we surely need a break, so I thought it would be nice to celebrate his birthday here at the school. In fact, he has been feeling very low for the past few days. Since he is really close to me, he told me that he is missing his family, and it is for the first time that he'll be away from home on this special day. So, I thought it would be nice to throw a surprise party for him.",
        "His birthday is next Friday, and we don't have any submissions on that day. As we'll be free after 5 p.m., I have kept that start time to be 6 in the evening. The cake-cutting ceremony will not take place until 8 p.m., so make sure you inform your folks in advance that you'll be a little late.",
        "Besides, since everyone is bringing some kind of snack or beverage, I hope you could bring some wafers yourself. Apart from that, your mother makes this delicious semolina pudding and everyone loves it, especially Harish, so I hope it wouldn't be much to ask you to get that too, only if your mother agrees.",
