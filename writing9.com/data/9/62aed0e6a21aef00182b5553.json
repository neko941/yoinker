        "An immensely controversial phenomenon in the contemporary epoch today relates to whether physical sports in a group or personal games are advantageous. In this essay, I am going to examine the stated question from both points of view and then interpret why I reckon that team sports are vital for learning and boosting a person's confidence in the forthcoming paragraphs.",
        "To begin with, there are a number of arguments in favour of my stance. The most preponderant is that beyond doubt team sports lead plenty of advantages. for instance, the entire members of the teams have numerous traits and talents and each performs their best to thrive in their nation. In addition to this, there are numerous other benefits in various fields. Thanks to the wide range of advantages it offers, not only does one benefit more when it comes to being effective, but they can enhance productivity and quality of their lives, with much ease, efficacy, and convenience. Needless to say, all these merits stand out in good stead, as far as augmenting the chances of prosperity and excellence is concerned.",
        "On the other hand, Another pivotal factor in the aforementioned proposition is that it is only likely to help one thrive and excel in varied areas. Besides, when only one follows such a system, can they broaden their horizons, hence learning these attributes as dedication and perseverance. as a result, it is apparent why myriad is in the patronage of individual games. To cite an example, the win credit goes to a single person who outperformed in the tournament and conquer their country and become a prominent person.",
        "To sum up, according to the forenamed quarrels, I would like to restate my perspective that the fruitful vantages of squad plays are indeed too terrific to neglect the isolated plays in the current era and it is a source of enjoyment."
