        "I am writing this letter to inform you about my missing certificate which I received a few days back right after the course completion. I have placed it in the highly secured area but unfortunately, I could not see it in the same place and  I guess somebody might have taken it away from my room.",
        "As you know, I travelled all the way from the USA for this course and I cannot go back with empty hands to my company. However, everyone is thinking that I have received a phenomenal certificate and moreover my manager would not approve my travel expenses without that certificate as this is crucial to my employer as well. Furthermore, That certificate would help me to showcase my additional strength despite my Immaculate experience in the competitive industry.",
        "Hence, I would request you please  send an email confirmation to my employer with a tentative date of issuing a new certificate, if possible please include me in that mail communication so that I can explain the same to my boss. It would be great if you could do this right away without any further delay and I am also sending my manager's email Id for your reference.",
