        "My name is Angel Smith. I am one of the tenants at your property on Beatles Street, and I am writing in connection with the recent inconvenience regarding the absence of hot water along with a heating system.",
        "A few days ago, to be precise on Monday 19th, one of my flatmates was taking a shower when unexpectedly the hot water ceased running. Honestly, we did not alert you immediately due to the fact that we thought this inconvenience would take two weeks in order to be fixed. Undoubtedly, it has affected our daily routines and frame of mind in a negative way since we lacked a basic facility.",
        "Therefore, I request you to handle this extremely annoying problem personally inasmuch as the plumber who was sent by your company failed to rectify it. Accordingly, if the issue is not solved within a reasonable time, not to exceed 3 days, I will be forced to make a complaint to your supervisor or withhold payment of the rent until the situation is resolved.",
        "I hope you will take it into account in order to fix  the problem as soon as possible.",
