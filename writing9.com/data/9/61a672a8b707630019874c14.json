        "Experts throughout the world have debated how to protect species from extinction. Over and above this, the substantial importance of being environmentally friendly has sparked in recent years. Additionally, humans must have a responsible attitude to preserve the world.",
        "At the outset, there are numerous ways to protect wildlife, but the most successful is sustainable exploration. This comprises extracting a certain limit of raw materials from the forest, allowing it not to disrupt the natural food chain.  When there is a disbalance, the overpopulation of some animals can certainly overwhelm the existence of others. For example, after a vast number of rabbits were hunted in the 15th century, the population of lions decreased, and consequently, less food for mankind. For this reason, people can not take from the forest as much as they want.",
        "Nevertheless, some drawbacks about the impact on human life remain, and some people believe there are no consequences to humanity due to nature damage. However, looking at carbon footprint as a dysregulation among human production and plants consumption, climate change happens, so floods and droughts around the globe kill societies. For instance, some researches show that unless civilians start a net-zero carbon dioxide policy, there will be even human beings living on Earth in the next ten years. In this way, to preserve other species and themselves, the population must stop depending on fossil fuel as soon as possible by replacing it with renewable energy.",
        "To conclude, wildlife preservation is not just a solitary action, but it is a question of whether human beings will survive. As a result, humankind must explore without disrupting the chain,  also decrease the usage of coal and oil."
