My current job, as an IT Business Analyst in Healthcare, has been fulfiling, for I can contribute to the community with my knowledge in healthcare IT systems. However, at the same time, I was under extreme stress, as I have to be on standby every day and night.",

        "If you know of any available positions for me, please let me know. I will consider and let you know if I'd like to give it a try. Looking forward to hearing from you.",
