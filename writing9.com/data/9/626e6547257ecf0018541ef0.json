        "Dear Mr Smith,",
        "I am writing regarding the notice you recently published in the magazine concerning your child\u2019s caretaker. I am avid about having this opportunity as I am eager to spend time with children, and my major is relevant to them. In addition, as I am a new dweller here, I have sought a career that gives me a place of residence.",
        "I had worked as a child caretaker in a kindergarten before I moved to Australia. Not only am I experienced in this field, but I am academically qualified as I majored in child psychology at the university. Moreover, I have read many books and attended many congresses about treating and playing games suitable for children\u2019s age that help them master their cognitive and social skills that are necessary for those who are going to attend school in the near future. Thus, I surmise I would be able to nurture and establish a close connection with your child provided I was engaged.",
        "Concerning my spare time, I wonder if I could ask you about the attractions to visit in your town and go sightseeing as I am a new citizen here and I am interested in exploring new places.",
        "I look forward to your reply. If only I would be employed for this career.",
        "Kind regards,",
