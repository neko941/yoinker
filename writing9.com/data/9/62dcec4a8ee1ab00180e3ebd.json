        "Dear John,",
        "How are you? How is life treating you? I know you have asked me about my recent purchase of an LG Air conditioner for my home. Sorry I haven't been able to write to you last week as I was overwhelmed with exams. Let me tell you about it in this letter.",
        "As you know the weather where I live is very hot and the summers are unbearable. I had no other option but to buy an AC to survive this climate. So I ordered two LG Split ACs for two bedrooms from the Amazon website. It was a great deal as huge discounts were offered across all electronic gadgets and purchasing two ACs got me an extra 5 per cent discount. The product comes with 15 years of warranty, with free servicing every 6 months for three years. I think this was a significant investment.",
        "There are many other reasonable alternatives as well in the market if you are planning to buy one. If you are going with only one purchase you can check competitors' brands like Lloyd and Samsung. Furthermore, Amazon is offering an exchange offer for Samsung gadgets which will further reduce your cost.",
        "I hope the above details will help you in making your purchasing decision. Do let me know what you think.",
        "Warm regards,",
