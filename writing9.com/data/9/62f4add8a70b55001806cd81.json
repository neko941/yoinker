        "Respected Sir,",
        "I am writing this letter to seek more details on the development projects planned for Maiden Society. I came to know from local media that the construction of a shopping centre by a private builder is scheduled to start this December.",
        "I read an article in the local leading newspaper about it. The editor  compared the previous malls built by the ABC company and the detrimental impacts they are causing to the environment.",
        "I was shocked to read  the details. According to the article, the association did not even bother to work towards basic eco-friendly techniques. Perhaps, the current green area of Central Park is allowed to the builder which in itself made me furious about the project.",
        "I would appreciate obtaining any additional information concerning this project, especially the city's government position in relation to its involved costs, besides the situation of local parks in the city. In addition, I might also be aware of what's the plan we might expect so that household residents not  be affected by continual noise when this place is finished.I look forward to hearing from you.",
