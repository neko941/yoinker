        "Dear Sir,",
        "I'm writing this letter to express my suggestion regarding the improvement of the organization. In the past few years, skip-level meeting where the team member can discuss the problems they face in their role with the vertical head has not been organized, due to which challenges faced by the employees are not known to the management. I would strongly recommend having this skip-level meeting with the higher officials at least twice or thrice a year.",
        "The key benefit is that transparency between the company and its employees would be established. Once the organization takes measures to address the employee's concerns, the productivity of the workers improves to a great extent. Furthermore, employees would feel contended that their problems are being heard by their senior officials, as well as they, feel motivated to work in such an employee-friendly environment. As a result, a positive attitude is being formed that greatly facilitates the employees to work efficiently and effectively. Subsequently, the company will grow gradually in terms of profits and scope expansion.",
        "Also, I am aware that the manager discussion would happen once a month, where the managers are allowed to express their ideas to their higher officials in terms of development. I request you to take up this suggestion with the vertical head as well as the Vice president of the Information Technology division of our organization during the upcoming meets.",
        "I hope this is a beneficial and implementable suggestion.",
        "Yours faithfully,",
