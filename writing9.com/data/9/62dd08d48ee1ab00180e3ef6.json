        "I hope you and your family are in good spirits. I couldn't write to you any sooner because I was up against a deadline at work. Speaking of which, I received your letter recently that you had written to enquire about the course I did at the University of Delhi in the year 2018.",
        "First of all, it is a course in the area of accounting and economics and it's a popular choice amongst students, who are planning to go for an MBA in the future. What's more, it's a one-year course filled with tons of assignments and two (2) semesters in total. Before completing the course, you will be asked to undergo an internship program with an accounting firm for a period of 2 months.",
        "In my opinion, this course is a must because it teaches you a lot about how businesses operate in the real world by dent of internships and case studies. Also, you will get to meet many great minds while studying at the campus.",
        "You may apply for this course by visiting the campus in New Delhi or online. Do call me on my cellular device in case of questions.",
        "I wish for your bright future ahead.",
        "Cheers,",
