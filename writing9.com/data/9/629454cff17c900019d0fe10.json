        "A highly controversial issue today relates to whether citizens should pay taxes to the government on their income or not. There is no denying the fact that states spend all aggregate taxes collected from the folk on the well-being of the nation.I firmly disagree and notwithstanding the given notion. This essay will further elaborate on my visions in the forthcoming paragraphs.",
        "To begin With, There are a number of arguments in favour of my stance. The most preponderant is that undoubtedly in order to become a good national we have obligation to pay taxes to law and administration are accountable for efficient utilization of that funding on the people by building new education and infrastructure to make it a prosperous destination and boost the economy. for instance, A recently published study indicated that the Canadian population are top of the list in terms of the voluntary payment of taxation and that capital is consumed in various fields of life and core necessities.  in addition to this, there are numerous other benefits in various fields. Thanks to the wide range of advantages it offers, not only does one benefit more when it comes to being effective, but they can enhance productivity and quality of their lives, with much ease, efficacy, and convenience. Needless to say, all these merits stand out in good stead, as far as augmenting the chances of prosperity and excellence is concerned.",
        "On the other hand, Another pivotal factor in the aforementioned proposition is that it is only likely to help one thrive and excel in varied areas. Besides, when only one follows such a system, can they broaden their horizons, hence learning these attributes as dedication and perseverance. as a result, it is apparent why many are in favour of paying charges to the administration because we have a legal obligation to become good citizens and contributes to the economy as well as become a prestigious destination for the entire nation.",
        "Finally, to recapitulate the aforementioned arguments, I would like to restate my position that the benefits of paying tariffs on their salary or income are not only bona fide to the payee but also elevate the economy of that country."
