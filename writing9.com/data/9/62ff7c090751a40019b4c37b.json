        "I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to tell you I have recently moved to a different house and invite you to my party.",
        "In fact, my previous house was far from my work and  I had to dedicate two hours a day to commuting. In addition, it was small for us, especially since my child was born. Also, there were not many shops in our neighbourhood and sometimes I had to go to the city centre.",
        "Therefore, I rented a house near my workplace and it just takes 15 minutes on foot to go there. Furthermore, it is far bigger than my last one. Indeed, it has a spacious living room and a well-equipped kitchen. It has two rooms, one of them is the bedroom and another one is my child's room. There is a garden in front of the building and I spend an hour each evening  gardening.",
