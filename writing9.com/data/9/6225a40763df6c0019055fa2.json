        "Last month, Mr Johnson moved into the apartment, right next door to me.  He usually plays music late at night, often after midnight.  The music is very loud and I can easily hear the sound in my bedroom.  It makes it hard for me to fall asleep and get enough time to rest.  I have to get up at 6:00 A.M. in order to get to work on time.  Since I haven't been able to get enough sleep, it's becoming a serious problem for me.",
        "I'm wondering that since Mr Johnson is new to the apartment, he is not very aware of the rules about noise at night.  I would really appreciate it if you could speak to him and remind him to keep the noise down as much as possible at night.",
        "I thank you in advance.",
        "Yours sincerely,",
