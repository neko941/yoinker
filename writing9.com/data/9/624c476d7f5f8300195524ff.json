        "I'm so glad that you have finally decided to learn to drive. I cannot wait to see you on the roads. I have written down a few important pointers that you need to follow to have a safe drive experience.",
        "First of all, apply for a driver's license. It might sound like a difficult exam to crack but it's really not. I can help you get one, easily. The license can help you with getting  insurance so that if there are any unfortunate incidents then we claim some money.",
        "I'd suggest you join The Flinstones driving school. I learnt my driving from them and they are really good. They will also help you with getting  insurance and have really good facilities. You can refer to my name to get a 5% discount.",
        "Lastly, I know it sounds scary, and I appreciate you for making the effort to learn to drive. But you have to be confident, wear a \"Learners board\" until you are confident and it will alert people that you are still learning. Keep practising and you will get better at it. You can always call me if you need anything. I can't wait to see you drive.",
