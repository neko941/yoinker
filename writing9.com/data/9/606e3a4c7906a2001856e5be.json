        "The Industrialisation of megapolis has led to an increase in the percentage of persons migrating from rural to urban areas  in search of greener pastures. It has therefore led to serious problems such as overpopulation,  but there are a number of solutions  available  to tackle it. This essay  will discuss the causes of rural-urban migration  and profer solutions to it.",
        "One negative  effect of rural exodus is the overpopulation of the urban areas. As more people  leave the villages to the municipalities, the proportion of people  in the city increases and consequently  population  explosion occurs. Lagos State ,for example, has become  the  most populous  State  in Nigeria  due to the high influx of people  into the State, resulting in several environmental  problems including air, land and noise pollution from industrial and human activities, thus affecting health negatively. Furthermore,  there  is an increase in the rate of crime, as most urban dwellers  are unemployed, a lot of them resort to illegal activities like as stealing and  cybercrime.",
        "However, there are ways of tackling  the situation.  Firstly, the government can make life better for those in the rural areas through  provision  of basic amenities like hospitals, schools, potable water and electricity, and also by making sure these are available  for all,  as it will help curtail the number  of persons trying to leave  their present locations in search for a better one. Secondly,  jobs should  be created for all citizens, because, when everyone  is engaged, it will drastically  reduce criminal acts in the metropolis. Similarly, individuals can learn a skill for themselves, so they can earn a living without  support  from the government.",
        "In conclusion,  although problems of overpopulation  and increase in crime rate are common in the city due to rural depopulation, the  government  can tackle  these issues by creating a better environment  for its citizens  to thrive."
