        "I am writing in connection with our college cafeteria. Firstly, let me thank the workers of the cafeteria for their hard work and excellent service. The recent redecoration has made a positive impact on the external appearance of the cafeteria, and I certainly appreciate it.",
        "However, I have noticed that some equipment has not been changed. To be more precise, last Monday I bought broccoli soup during lunchtime, which was a bit cold, but I could not hit it up inasmuch as a microwave was out of order. Many students and I are concerned about this issue because most prepared meals, which are for a sale, are made early in the morning, and they are kept with only a lid. Undoubtedly, by the afternoon the food is not warm enough to eat.",
        "I would really appreciate it if you could replace the old broken microwave with a new one, or if it is possible, provide the cafeteria with two more microwaves in order to speed up the queue. That would be helpful to all students who eat in the college cafeteria.",
        "Thank you for your consideration.",
