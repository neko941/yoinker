        "At the present time via the development of technology, people easier to have technology devices at a cheap price for some models. However, kids nowadays do not have beautiful childhood like us before, they just spend the whole day playing online games and getting served by their mother and father without any help even getting out of their room is a difficult thing. Honestly, I completely think this is a negative development for children at a new age wasting their childhood just for playing on smartphones.",
        "Firstly, using mobile devices for a long time and a long period is to make children become lazier and lazier. They just lie on the bed and watch some nonsense videos on the Internet. Furthermore, everything they do will depend on smartphones. For example, if kids cook something without their parent's help, they will not know what to do and they just need to open their phones to search for how to cook but do not know how to avoid accidents and consequences of not following the correct steps.",
        "Secondly, children will become less sociable if they use too much time and do not go out and make friends, kids can easily be cheated by scammers through digital platforms on the Internet. Moreover, wasting too much time playing games will make their eyes painful and harmful if used for a long time. For instance, kids may click on some deep web where stolen information from other people, terrible video clips and disgusting things appear. They may be lost their minds and become crazy if they watch those terrible videos and images. Hence, everything will out of control if they try to do that, especially their parents will be disappointed.",
        "In conclusion, children should not spend mobile phones too much a day, they should go out meet some new friends and have a happy childhood."
