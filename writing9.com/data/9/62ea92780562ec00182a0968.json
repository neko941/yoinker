        "Dear Sir,",
        "I am a patron of your multiplex. I'm writing this letter to complain about my unsatisfactory experience with a movie that I came to watch at your cinema last night.",
        "I  bought tickets for the late-night show at 10.05 pm of the film Heartless. The advertisements and the trailers before the movie started off fine, however, 25 minutes into the movie, there were glitches in sound. It became irritating as these interruptions became more frequent. Although this did not continue after the intermission, the picture on the screen wasn't very clear. I can say this as I regularly watch movies at this cinema hall, and the picture quality was nothing like the previous times.",
        "If there was a problem with the print, I would advise you to take this issue up with the distributors of the film. Also, it would be better if you did a test run of the print before playing it for the shows for the public to save your cinema the embarrassment. I sincerely hope this kind of  complication does not arise in the future.",
        "Yours truly,",
