        "I am writing to request a short period of leave next month. As you may be aware my wife and I have recently had twins and thus we have been a bit stressed out because of the increased number of new duties to carry on.",
        "I only ask for a week off because I believe that will be sufficient for me and my family to get some rest. If possible, I would like to take this time off from the 29th of July to the 5th of August. I hope you know I will utilise this much-needed time off to get some rest physically and mentally.",
        "I understand my position requires valuable skills and not every other employee can cover my shift, however, I have already spoken to my senior colleagues and they will take turns to make sure all my duties are taken care of. I will also ensure that I come back refreshed and ready to get up-to-date with all new information that I might miss out on during this period.",
