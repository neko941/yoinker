When you fall asleep, a disgusting insect can bite you so you wake up suddenly. you should take a spare blanket because it is cold in the evening.",
        "I love to accompany you but I have to go to another program for my business. My manager assigned me a new hard task so I should travel to Australia and inspect my teams on the side.  if you have any questions, you know you can ask me without hesitation.",
