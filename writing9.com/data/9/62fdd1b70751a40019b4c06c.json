        "Undoubtedly, I am going to miss your supportive talks and good judgements during critical pandemic times despite of covid rules. Hence, I would like to express my sincere gratitude from the bottom of my heart for all the help you have done and I request you to please accept my token of thanks with a small gift which cannot be replaced by your guidance.",
        "However, I would like to introduce one of my friends who came to Vancouver a few days back and still he is in search of a beautiful house in a well-established community like ours. I would really appreciate it if you could consider his profile for your house as this will be in a vacancy position since the first week of August. He is ready to pay five months in advance, if required you are free to run a background check regardless of the rent amount.",
