During the organization of the meeting, I was at the hospital as I slipped on stairs at that moment and got a fracture in my right leg. Because of that medical injury, I did not join the above-said formal gathering.",

In addition to it, I will take help from my colleagues in order to understand the whole procedure of implementation of this training programme. I am apologizing to you from the bottom of my heart for missing the pre-decided meeting.",
