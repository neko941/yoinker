        "As I\u2019m from India and don\u2019t have much knowledge about Toronto City, so it would be great if you give me a bit of insight about some places where I can stay and enjoy my holiday.",
        "I remember that it has been around 2 years when you moved to Canada, so you must have explored several famous areas. Therefore, I want you to recommend to me some exquisite sites to visit.",
