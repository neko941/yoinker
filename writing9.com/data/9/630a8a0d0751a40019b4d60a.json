        "The number of people who are eager to get an education abroad either at colleges or universities is increasing day by day. it is obvious that  they are cautious with their few disadvantages and I completely agree with this statement for some reasons which I am going to explain in the further stage.",
        "On the one hand ,studying in any foreign  country helps you to learn a particular language deeply due to you are surrounded by the natural environment. For example ,some people travel abroad for a while ,when they come back it seems significantly promotion in their accents.  in addition to ,this they also making different friends makes your goals more effectively. Therefore ,they get both  fellows and knowledge.",
        "On  the other hand, getting a degree in a foreign country allows you to find  a more relevant job ,for the reason you have already investigated the zone and its opportunities.  For instance. my sibling is in the same situation and he finds his favourite work on  Google company.  Thus, while he is working  there,  he was pleased with all the innovative ways and is involved in working a number of. new projects.",
        "Finally, it is undeniable every motion has drawbacks  ,however, studying abroad  is getting more popular and gives a number of students  a chance to get an education abroad as well as  provides them with their dream job . In my opinion, it is impossible to compel somebody to stay anywhere,so we  have to give them an opportunity to realise their goals and broaden their horizons."
