        "Dear Teacher,",
        "I am excited to write this letter to express my interest in the trip to Canada along with my kid. I have a strong desire to visit the best place in Vancouver in Canada as we are going to see some historical and mesmerizing constructions. On the other hand, we have  breathtaking scenery throughout the city.",
        "As you know, I have profound experience in the tours and travel industry and I can take this as an opportunity to explore and explain a few new things to our kids. In addition, I will take care of their health and safety despite our busy schedule. Last but not least, I can help them to translate  French as I am good at speaking.",
        "However, I would like to know a few details regarding the trip such as how much we need to pay ? who will look after the food preparations in Canada? Who will be the contact person during the emergency? I would really appreciate it if you would share any other details which I am missing here.",
        "I look forward to hearing a response with the required information before we reach  the airport.",
        "Yours Faithfully,",
