        "I am writing to you regarding an issue I am having with an electric drill which has your company brand on it. Let me explain more about the issue.",
        "Around a year ago I bought the drill from Home Depot and they issued a two-year guarantee for it. Recently, the drill stopped working because of  broken gear, and it caused an interruption in my orders. I am mostly working at home from my garage to repair the bikes, so the lack of such equipment made me  use  manual time which takes a lot of energy and time. As a result, it affected my orders a lot and caused so much delay and dissatisfaction among my clients.",
        "Consequently, I contacted you to provide me with a solution to fix the drill or replace the equipment with a new one if the guarantee it covers. I look forward to hearing from you.",
        "Thanks and regards,",
