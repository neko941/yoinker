        "A highly controversial issue in the contemporary world today relates to whether the present technology is adequate to store photos and videos or not. In this essay, I am going to examine the stated question from both points of view and then explain why I believe that we are dwelling in the age of modernization and prevailing methods of recording suffice the demands in the forthcoming paragraphs.",

The most preponderant is that undoubtedly storing the data in the online media empowers a person to instant access anytime and anywhere. for instance, Numerous storage apps are available presently folk prefers to sign up for heavy storage such as Dropbox and Google Drive to store their memories and personal data and they can access it whenever they want. In addition to this, there are numerous other benefits in various fields. Thanks to the wide range of advantages it offers, not only does one benefit more when it comes to being effective, but they can enhance productivity and quality of their lives, with much ease, efficacy, and convenience. Needless to say, all these merits stand out in good stead, as far as augmenting the chances of prosperity and excellence is concerned.",
        "On the other hand, Another pivotal factor in the aforementioned proposition is that it is only likely to help one thrive and excel in varied areas. Besides, when only one follows a traditional system, can they broaden their horizons, hence learning these attributes as dedication and perseverance. as a result, it is apparent why many are in favour of\u00a0the ancient method of recording their personal data. to cite an example, Despite the fruitful benefits of technology the risk of losing records is topnotch, therefore, printing photographs and albums is a secure way to lock down the memories.",
        "to sum up, according to the aforementioned arguments, I would like to restate my position that the benefits of online storage for media and videos are indeed too great to ignore the burden of printing photos in the current age there is no need to practice the traditional ways."
