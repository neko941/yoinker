        "At the present time, the Internet has a huge influence on online shopping. It has become more popular. This essay will argue that the benefits of buying things on the Internet are more than the drawbacks, as it is more convenient and people have many chances to compare products.",
        "One commonly cited disadvantage of shopping in this way is that customers can easily be deceived. This is because platforms which they use on the Internet might be unreal platforms. They are unable to verify merchants and products. For example, some customers do not receive the products or some receive a damaged one after they order them. This situation is common in Thailand. Due to the fact that many people increasingly turn to shop online without  thorough consideration. Therefore, it is an easy way to deceive the customers.",
        "Despite this, there are a number of significant benefits of online shopping. First of all, it is much more convenient for customers. They tend not to have to travel a long distance or wait in a long queue to pay their bills. They can select goods via smart devices such as smartphones or computers. Also, they can pay money by using mobile banking. Furthermore, customers can compare products' quality while they are choosing items as a result they can browse many websites at the same time. For instance, they can search for more information about specifications and prices by reading reviews from others. This can lead to receiving an item meeting customers' needs.",
        "In conclusion, although there are disadvantages to shopping online, it is clear that buying things on the Internet can make it more convenient and easy to compare the products. On balance, I would argue that shopping in this way is beneficial to customers."
