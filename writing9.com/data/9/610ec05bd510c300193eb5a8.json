        "Dear Sir ,",
        "I recently did a basic level cookery course on international cuisines with your cookery school. It  was recommended by my friend and I must admit , I absolutely loved the entire experience. The detail with which each ingredient was explained in the class and its benefits was remarkable.",
        "Also , the overall approach followed by the mentor was commendable . I appreciate how attention was paid to the strengths and weaknesses of each member and how the mentor tried explaining anything that any one of us would not follow . What made this class unique were the insights provided over the health benefits of each spice used and lessons helping us to incorporate them into our day to day cooking.",
        "It's been 15 days since the classes got over and believe me I look forward to cooking my meal every day. Gradually I am getting better at it. Thanks to the efforts put in by the mentors . I am really looking forward to a class on mastering  Asian cuisines as I feel your school will help me understand the intricacies associated with Asian dishes and their varied spices .",
        "Hope to join back soon for a new course.",
        "Regards ,",
