        "In response to your general invitation for writing an epistle in order to argue on a key environmental issue, I would like to take your attention to the rising concerns of global warming. It refers to the rise in the earth's temperature due to the cutting of trees and the burning of fossil fuels.",
        "For Instance, as per the recent survey by Times Network, it is seen that the climate of the earth has taken a shift making it warmer by 5 degrees celsius. This has led to the melting of more ice resulting in rising sea levels and hence, more floods with massive destruction to mankind.",
        "As a remedial action, I would like to urge the government of all the countries that it is high time now and all should come together to make policies for replacing the use of non-renewable resources of energy and shift to renewable resources. Further, make it mandatory to plant as many trees as possible to keep the climate cool.",
        "I would like to thank you for this opportunity.",
        "Yours faithfully",
