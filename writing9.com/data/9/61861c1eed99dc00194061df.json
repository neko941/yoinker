        "Discrimination of gender equalities are an ongoing process since the beginning of life. Regarding this ,issue government can play a vital role to keep balance. In my point of view, there are should keep some high paid salaries for qualified women. Following , an essay I will describe some of my knowledge and the arguments with the above topics.",
        "In spite of biological ,facts women are never behind men. Women have more qualities than men to keep a balance  between work and family life. For ,instance motherhood is the most precious thing which female-only can feel. According to current surveys, it is proven that females can do any kind of job including the most highly qualified job besides man even after becoming mothers. Take as an example profession like a doctor, both gender has abilities to be the best doctor. Moreover, female patients feel more comfortable with women to discuss their issues. Therefore, governments should reserve certain vacancies for women.",
        "On the other hand, another reason to support my arguments is that  the government should not underestimate the quality basis of gender. The country's population consist of together both men and women. If both genders are unable to contribute to the nation well being then the country itself will lose the value of its own. For instance, nowadays females also can work in NASA. Eailer no one even thinks of that female could able to that. There are more no of increasing the participation of different kinds of job both gender. I think its a matter of consideration",
        "To sum up, to right uses and developments for nations government should take measure for keeping the proper amount of reservation for women."
