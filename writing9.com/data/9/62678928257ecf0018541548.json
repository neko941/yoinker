        "Dear Sir ,",
        "This is Mee Mee who is currently working as a Senior Sales Support in the Sales department. Indeed , I am writing this letter to reveal my enthusiasm regarding the new position opening in the Engineering department.",
        "To begin with , this new vacancy literally appeals to me . Being an Engineering graduate , I was very eager to work in that department since I joined your company. However , HR requested me to join first in a Sales position because of my 5 years employment history. Moreover , he agreed with me to make an internal transfer whenever there is opened a place.",
        "Accordingly , I have come up with some questions about that matter. I am wondering about the salary offer and fringe benefits. Then , may I need to take internationally recognized diplomas such as CCNA and CCNP ?",
        "Finally , I would like to get a bit of advice from you . Honestly , I am really in the tug of war in my mind. Therefore , being a very experienced and talented employer , could you please give me a hand on whether I should change my direction or not.",
        "Looking forward to your kind suggestion.",
        "Yours faithfully,",
        "Mee Mee"
