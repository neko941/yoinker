        "It is believed that the  environmental protectors are alarmed  concerning  the overwhelming  increased  environmental pollution on streams, ponds and the oceans.  I believe that environmental  contamination brings adverse effects on  aquatic wildlife and human social lives. This  essay will shed light on the motives and their consequences providing evidence to prove the arguments.",
        "There are manifold  causes for  water contagion throughout the world. First  and foremost, the scarcity of environmental  regulations. In other words,  the world has  stricter laws to punish the factors and individuals who dispose of their waste in these natural  environments. Yet the shortfall in controlling them makes these ecosystems vulnerable. Let us take, African nations as an example,  the recent research from  Unizambeze University pointed out that 70% of factors deposited  their  disposal materials in the near pond without any pre-treatment . As a result, the local naval ecosystem died, causing  any alarming environmental pollution.",
        "Secondly, the sea poisoning vanished the local species. Because of grimed water coastal wildlife is under threat, it irradicated the majority of them such as  birds, dolphins, whales, seals. For instance, the   scientific  investigation  carried out by Oxford University  last year,  showcased that  the  seas and rivers epidemic  vanished roughly 5000  aquatic specimens. Hence,  human beings social lives are affected. Moreover, the  men overdependence on fish and lamb will affect the human lifestyle in the near future.",
        "In conclusion,  the rising in deep-sea ecosystem corruption is caused by human activities, especially the garbage from energy power plants,   machinery factories, and other sources. It has undoubtedly adverse side effects on the local ecosystems and men life. Therefore urgent people's action is needed so that  the remained species could survive and  men  life enhanced."
