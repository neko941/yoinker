        "If you need anything at my place, please feel free to ring me on my mobile or on Whatsapp. Moreover, I'm leaving the contact details of Shangrila hotel, which I'll be staying using, on a sticky note which I've left on the kitchen door.",
        "More importantly, I wanted to share the details of Cavy's routine. She needs to be fed twice daily so each morning and evening put a handful of pedigree in her dish. You will find these in the kitchen pantry. Also, please check throughout the day to make sure she has fresh water.",
        "I would like you to water my plants, too. Although the indoor plants only need to be watered weekly,  the outdoor ones need water every other day. For security, clear my mailbox every day and keep the lawn lights on during the night.",
        "See you after my return.",
