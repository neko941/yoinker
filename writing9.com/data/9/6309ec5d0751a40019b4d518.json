        "I like to tell you that you can stay with me during your vacation, as my family is not with me right now for the next few months. So, if you would like, you can stay with me. However, if you need your personal space then I would suggest you stay in Chandigarh industrial area, which is the best place to live. The best hotels in Chandigarh are located there.",
        "I think you should spend your first few days in Chandigarh and its nearby hill station, by doing this you'll realize that you have visited the whole of North India. After that, you can go to the South like Goa or Kerala, the best places to visit during this season.",
        "Currently, the weather in India is pleasant so you do not worry to get warm clothes. You can easily get that from here itself. In my opinion, you only have to get your basic things with you.",
