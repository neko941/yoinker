        "In the modern world, one of the most significant stages in a child\u2019s growth is indisputably the development conscience, which is associated with the ability to discriminate right and wrong manners. This skill might be enhanced with experiences and having good role models and I believe that punishment has a negative effect on this term. Therefore, I have to disagree almost entirely with the given statement.",
        "In  early childhood, children cannot understand the comprehensively primary reason for being punished and when facing punishment, they might likely tend to display a negative attitude such as anger or  anxiety. Moreover, the vast majority of children insist to pursue the same behaviour after the punishment. Thus this method provides a short-term solution that does not have any benefits of the child\u2019s growth. In the recent researches show that \u0131ntens\u0131ve punishments applied in early age can lead to personality disorders in the future.",
        "The feasible approach to assist children in order to discriminate right and wrong is built a patient and loving communication. By this,I mean that both parents and teachers should explain to children the impacts of harmful actions with  eye contact and a tender touch. Child music and stories can be used to teach children the difference between right and wrong at school and at home. Furthermore, children should be rewarded on their good behaviour that is also a greater way to raise awareness of evaluating right and wrong.",
        "In conclusion, both teachers and parents can use a variety of methods to discipline children and physical punishments or restrictions does not effectively contribute to the children\u2019s nature and future."
