        "I am the tenant who is currently living in your apartment-211 with my family, for rent. I am writing this letter in connection with the discomfort we are facing due to the state of the furniture available in this apartment.",
        "Majorly, I would like to bring two problems with your notice. First, the bed in the master bedroom is completely damaged and the springs inside it are broken and displayed outside, hurting my lower back. Secondly, the cupboards in the kid's bedroom are quite delicate and in a very bad condition, I feel there is a high risk of it falling apart soon.",
        "I request you to change the bed and the cupboard door, as soon as possible to avoid any further difficulties. It would be really appreciated if you could assign a carpenter, remove the door at earliest to avoid it falling on my family members. We will be available at home, the whole day, on the weekends.",
        "I look forward to hearing from you on the update on the repairs.",
        "Yours faithfully,",
