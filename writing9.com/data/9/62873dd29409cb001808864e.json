        "I am Paul Strang, and I am lucky enough to have been introduced to you just a few days ago. Not sure, if you will remember me, but I had an opportunity to talk with you about two weeks ago when we both were travelling by air from Boston to Dallas.",
        "I was sitting next to you, and after we got introduced, we had some interesting conversations. You were kind enough to suggest to me that I should contact you for a possible job position at one of your restaurants. So, here I am, sir, as I would like to apply for a managerial position at your restaurant.",
        "I think that I would be a very suitable candidate for the managerial position in one of your restaurants because I have already worked as an Assistant Human Resource and Payroll Manager for a large and busy residential hotel in my hometown. I have learned a great deal about customers\u2019 needs in the service industry. Besides, I also have a post-graduate diploma in human resource management.",
        "So, based on my credentials and experience, I think, I should be able to render excellent service to your company. I would very much like to work for your company. I am hoping that you would give me an opportunity to prove my worth.",
        "Yours sincerely,",
