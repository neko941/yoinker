        "In the contemporary epoch, there is irrefutable quarrel among folk about kids' nurseries managed by immediate fathers conversely to the quondam. In this essay, I am going to canvass the stated question and elucidate on copious motives and then interpret why I reckon that it is a positive initiative in the modern age that empowers women in numerous sectors in the forthcoming paragraphs.",

Besides, when only one follows such a system, can they broaden their horizons, hence learning these attributes as dedication and perseverance.  As a result, it is apparent why myriad petitions that in a positive direction. to cite an example, According to a global ,report the trend is topnotch and both parents divided their time and take care of their children in order to  compete with the external environment.",
        "In the nutshell, according to the forenamed wrangles, I would like to restate my perspective that the fruitful vantages of taking care of the fathers are indeed too terrific to neglect the isolation and mental illness in the technological era. Hereby, it is a positive tendency."
