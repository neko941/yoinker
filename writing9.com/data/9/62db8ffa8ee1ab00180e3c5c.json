        "As you are still on vacation, I don't know if you knew, but our team, the Jaguars, finally won the MBA championship.",
        "So yesterday, they were on their sixth game of the best-of-four match against the Knights. Since both teams have already won three games, it was a make-or-break game for both of them, so whoever wins will be the league's champions this season.",
        "Actually, it started well for the opponent, and I was feeling on edge, wondering if the Jaguars would still be able to catch up. After the halftime break, eventually, they did! Jackson scored a three-point shot, and since then, luck was on their side, and the ball kept going in the basket. It gave me hope, and I really teared up when they won!",
        "It was such a fun and thrilling match, so I was thinking, maybe we should watch the reply together. I know it will be fun! I hope to hear from you when you get back.",
