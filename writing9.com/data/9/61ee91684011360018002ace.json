Firstly, the screen was full of black spots and suddenly shut itself down and I could not turn it on. Secondly, the keyboard. I do not understand what is wrong with it but when I attempted to press any bottoms, like many times, nothing happens. I attempted to shut down and turn on the computer, but it was still not working.",
