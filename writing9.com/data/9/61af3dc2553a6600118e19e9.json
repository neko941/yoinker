        "I would like to say that you put up a wonderful performance yesterday, that was the first time in a while that I have literarily danced my heart out in a concert. I normally would have sat all through, but I couldn't hold myself any longer than to let myself loose.",
        "To be honest, I am an aspiring singer, and I would love to improve on my singing skills, but I have not been able to do anything about it because of my studies. I have made up my mind that I would put in more effort immediately after my exams, which I just finished yesterday. Therefore, I think this is the moment.",
        "In a way, I think you should be able to help me in attaining some vocal musical range that I have been struggling with. I mostly fail to hit a high note while singing, and it feels disappointing to me. Also, I would like to learn some instrumental basics, most especially for the piano. Once I can achieve these two objectives, then I know I am good for now.",
        "I will be waiting to hear from you concerning the above proposal, and anytime from next will be perfect to start, if you are available. Thank you so much.",
