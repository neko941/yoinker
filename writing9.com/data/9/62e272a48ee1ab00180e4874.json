        "Dear Sir,",
        "I am writing this to share my disagreement with an article regarding the similarity of the town centres of our country, published in your national newspaper on 22nd May 2022.",
        "It is correctly mentioned in your article that all town centres across the country are managed by a central authority. Moreover, the common facilities like parking  and entertainment zones are all alike which has made most centres look exactly the same.",
        "However, I must point out that the city centre in my city, Haidi, is very much unique from others as its area is reclaimed from the old fort of the city. Its architecture dates back to the 15th century. In addition, its location in the hills makes it a pleasant place to spend time with friends and family.",
        "As I established from your column, you were unaware of my town and thus, I want to invite you and your team to once visit my town. I will be more than happy to guide you through the town so that you can get more insight and witness the facts.",
        "Thanks for your consideration,",
        "Yours faithfully,",
