On that day, we were just wonderfully amazed by dish after dish was served and by each dish's taste and delicacy. Not only that but, the dessert also came with a very wonderful combination too. We were enjoying the meal and even till now, my friends cannot stop telling me about your food. The service was the best and fast as well, and the waiter knew when and how to serve an order.",
