        "Firstly, I am writing this letter to let you know that I cannot attend the meeting this Friday.",
        "Secondly, I will explain to you the reason why I cannot meet you. As I have an important meeting at the same time it is very difficult to skip the meeting and come to school. However, meeting you is also necessary as my child's progress is very bad in studies especially, in mathematics and social studies. He is scoring very less marks in the last two semesters.",
        "Thirdly, I assure you that I will spend some time helping him with his studies and homework hereafter. Hopefully, let us see if he improves in his next tests.",
        "Finally, I can meet you some other time at your convenience. I need to discuss some other issues regarding my child's behaviour and attitude in school because nowadays his behaviour at home is frustrating.",
        "Yours sincerely,",
