        "I am writing to express my interest in applying as an assistant tour guide for the museum. I recently saw your advertisement in the newspaper that you are looking for part-time volunteers in assisting groups of students who are attending the museum for their annual school field trip.",
        "I have visited the museum countless times, and I am interested because I have always been fascinated with the collection of fossils and artefacts inside the exhibition. Additionally, I also did a dissertation about them. Therefore, I strongly believe in my knowledge and my passion for palaeontology. I am able to help the students to be able to understand the history of life on earth based on fossils.",
        "Currently, I am a student attending Middlesex University,  and my timetable is flexible enough for me to do part-time work. I am available Friday afternoon, and during the weekends, if that is applicable to you.",
        "I look forward to hearing from you.",
