        "A certain group of individuals believe that  modern gadgets such as mobile phones,laptops and computers have drastically improved the lives of humans whereas others opine that social interactions have decreased dramatically.I personally agree with the former opinion as the latest innovations in technology  and internet connectivity has created a life without borders.",
        "To begin with, In today\u2019s modern world use of smartphones and widespread internet connectivity are the most debatable and controversial topics and every individual has their own views.There is a deluge of arguments in favour of my stance. The most predominant one is young adolescents believe that life without the internet and smart gadgets won\u2019t be possible for them , as all the tasks ranging from  banking to education  are done on this modern equipment.For instance, a survey conducted by the Indian Institute of Technology,Ranchi ,revealed that the biggest advantage of mobiles is improved communication with family and friends staying abroad.In terms of education ,it has broadened our horizons for knowledge and information available online.",
        "Secondly, in recent times addiction to various social platforms is seen among young individuals.Further, it has lead to reduced social interactions in the family .For example , a study done by Oxford University demonstrated that the incidence of mental disorders has surged due to excessive dependence on these social platforms.Basically , both the  parents and teachers should pay attention towards children  below 18 years of age regarding usage of phones.",
        "In a nutshell, in my ,opinion though the advantages of modern technology are enormous on the contrary its disadvantages can\u2019t be potentially ignored .Additionally ,stringent laws should be implemented in the various institutions and educational varsities to prevent its addiction among the younger generation."
