        "I hope that you are aware that I got a full-time job opportunity as a software engineer. However, being a fresher I had to work late nights to complete my assigned work. It's really time-consuming to learn the process of the company and the technology. Moreover, I am being assigned pieces of training which need to be completed within the ETA. Overall, I find it tough in managing my job and the part-time course.",
        "Also, my part-time classes are more important which will help to reach my career goals. I could see online that this course can opt for at weekends. Hence, I request to schedule my part-time classes to be held only on the weekends. which would make me  focus on the program and get the maximum benefit.",
