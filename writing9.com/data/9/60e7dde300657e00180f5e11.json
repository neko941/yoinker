        "Let me elaborate on the situation. I had been harassed by your team for clearing the debt amount against the card without checking the correct details of the customer. The officers had been calling me day in and day out for the past week. Moreover, they reached my office to recover the pending amount. When I raised this complaint on the customer care of the card, they had given the reason, being two customers have a similar name in their database, they made this mistake.",
        "For this reason. I would request your team to investigate this matter as it badly hit my reputation in front of my company and for this, I would like to have an apology letter from your department. I want you to take stern action against your division. Enclosed are the phone recordings.",
        "I look forward to hearing from you at the earliest. My coordinate is (768) 7654433, and my email id is [email\u00a0protected]",
