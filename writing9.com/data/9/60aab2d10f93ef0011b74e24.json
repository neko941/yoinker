        "Dear John,",

        "Fortunately, I have already found two vacancies in the local corporation within one of them probably appropriate for you. Although you will commence as a temporary executive employee who is responsible for product placement, I am sure you will receive a promotion in not too distant future.",
        "I imagine besides your brilliant academic background and having a business-art major at an international institute, your bilingual ability, getting on French and Persian, can raise your chance to be qualified. So, please submit your documents through a link attached to this letter, meanwhile, send me a copy of your diploma because they would check all documents as long as they set an interview.",
        "I hope to see you soon.",
