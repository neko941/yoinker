You are such a good host. But, I must apologize to you now because the dress, you gave me, has been damaged accidentally.",

Unfortunately, when I was taking  the shower, my dog ate a small part of that dress and I know it was a very costly one from the band W. I apologise for the inconvenience caused.",
        "Luckily, I have checked online that the same dress is still available at a nearby store. I paid online for that and will bring the same attire tomorrow.",
