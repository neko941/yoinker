        "As you know, I have completed my graduation in Information Technology and now I am looking for a suitable job for me. I wanted to learn it  because it is expected that many French IT companies will set up their corporate offices in India in the coming two years and It is obvious that they would prefer people having knowledge of the French language.",
        "Therefore, I have certain ways in my mind to learn it, one is I am thinking of joining a coaching institute and the other is to do self-study. What do you think is better? Can you suggest to me a good online learning platform like a website or a youtube channel? Your suggestions are much needed right now.",
        "In fact, I was thinking of meeting with you for this discussion. Also, it's been a long to see, let's catch up this Sunday at 5 pm at Cofee Cafe Day. Let me know if you are available at that time.",
