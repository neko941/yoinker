        "Dear Sir,",
        "I came across an article in today's newspaper edition and I am writing to address an issue on a particular topic. It is acceptable that there is indeed an increasing number of town centres most especially Aba and Onitsha.I also agree that some places in Anambra state lack town leaders ,but this particular statement about centres being similar in Nigeria as a whole is false.",
        "Firstly,in Enugu , each town centre was beautifully designed to the taste of the indigenes and they come with larger spaces to accommodate roughly 5,000 individuals. In addition, the centres in this part of the country are built with enough chairs and tables particular for high profile executives.",
        "However,if you ever visit Enugu, I will be glad to take you on a guided tour for proper viewing of the centre . Do well to reach me with [email\u00a0protected] for more detailed enquiries. Thank you for your time.",
        "Yours faithfully,",
