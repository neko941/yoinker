        "It is often said that teaching an instrument should be increased in educational centres and all children should learn it. From my point of view ,I strongly agree with this idea. I also believe that this decision should be performed as soon as possible.",
        "Firstly , one of the main reasons for this argument is the power of playing instruments in human brains. For example ,playing a kind of musical instrument could reinforce some activities that need to exert the energy of our brains such as learning difficult subjects (science or maths). This could create a suitable space to learn these courses constructively and the brain commences working hard. This is a conspicuous and persuasive reason to accept this positive operation. Therefore ,this makes it clear why playing these gadgets should be encouraged and increased in school.",
        "Secondly ,another reason is ,playing instruments is a type of art. There is no denying that art can be useful in children lifestyles and change something. For instance ,playing the guitar and the piano could change human's beliefs because art can transform traditional thoughts into modern beliefs. This could help a child to merge into living in today modern world. Additionally ,this operation would open doors to think and solve problems effortlessly because of becoming down_to_earth. As a result ,it becomes apparent there are multiple reasons behind each claim via societies that we can not ignore.",
        "All things considered ,I completely agree with this idea that academics habitually reflect on. It is predicted that to increase playing instruments children will become smarter and human brains will be more powerful."
