        "I am Utsav, my family and I have rented an apartment recently through you. I am writing to express some of my concerns regarding the state of furniture in our apartment.",
        "To begin with, most of the chairs of the dining set are in ruins and it is quite dangerous to sit on these chairs while reading or watching television. As a matter of fact, I almost fell to the ground the other day while watching television, and It would have been a serious medical trauma if I had fallen off the chair. In addition to that, the couch in the living room could use some repairs since it lacks proper cushioning.",
        "Considering all the above, I would like you to repair all the damaged chairs of the dining set by fixing our appointment with a certified carpenter, operating in our area, at your earliest convenience. Besides, the total cost of repairs shall be borne by you as per our agreement.",
        "I look forward to hearing from you soon.",
