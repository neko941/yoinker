        "I am writing in connection with an all-day meeting that I recently arranged for my company at your hotel. We conducted a feedback survey about their experience, we found that participants loved the hotel. However, they all were dissatisfied with the food quality which was served at lunch.",
        "All attendees had a great experience. They admired the courteous behaviour of your staff. Additionally, they were pleased by the cleanliness of the hotel, especially of restrooms.",
        "On the contrary, they all were disappointed by the quality of the food which was served at lunch. It was a  lot spicy which caused respiratory problems in many employees. Moreover, the menu was not having many varieties, especially for vegetarians.",
        "I would like to suggest making some modifications to the lunch menu to add a few more dishes for vegetarians. Besides, it would be better if the spiciness of food could be kept lower.",
        "Thanks in advance for your support.",
