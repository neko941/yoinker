        "How are things? I have enjoyed reading that you are going to camp out this summer. Such terrific news! I am sure that you are gonna have a great time. You are going to make a bonfire under the stars and tell stories to new friends. If I were you, I'd buy a notebook for writing their addresses for keeping in touch with them. These kinds of friends are the ones that you'll always remember.",
        "Anyway, I hope you don't find mosquitos up there. You should buy a good repellent for those little insects. And take my advice: bring a good rucksack. The bad side of camping is that nights are a bit cold even during summer when you are sleeping in the woods. I'm looking forward to listen about your adventures in the jungle and maybe about your next girlfriend. Ha!",
        "Well, time to go. You know that I would love to go with you, but unluckily I have to hit the books this summer. My best wishes and lots of love. And excuse me for being so slow getting back at you, but nowadays I have a lot of work.",
