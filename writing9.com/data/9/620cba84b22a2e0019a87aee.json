        "Dear Sir or Madam,",
        "I am writing this letter to bring to your notice that, the latest edition of your travel magazine included an article about Cambridge, but this contained incorrect information. The writer described the University of Cambridge as being the oldest in the world whereas the fact is that the oldest university in the English speaking world is in Oxford. The University of Cambridge was founded in 1209, but Oxford was known to have existed in 1096.",
        "A magazine such as yours has an international reputation and is extremely influential with travel companies and individuals alike. It is essential that any information published should be accurate and reliable and I was genuinely surprised that the facts had not been checked prior to publication.",
        "I feel that the least the magazine can do is to publish a correction and an apology in  next month's magazine. I would also urge you to ensure that all factual information is thoroughly checked before publication.",
        "Yours faithfully,",
