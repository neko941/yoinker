        "It is believed by some that learners should be taught to raise their concerns and criticize while learning in order to upgrade the educational system. However,others find it an undesirable and negative move, as it may cause disrespect of teachers and indiscipline in the classroom. Even though  asking doubts without hesitation can sometimes prove troublesome, I completely loud its overall advantages and favour it.",
        "On the one hand, the freedom of clearing the questions of scholars sometimes creates undue disturbance and distraction in the study room. This is because, lobbies of non-serious students are more likely to put unimportant queries for the sake of creating humour, as they are aware that their educators are bound to respond. Above all, chances are greater that they can put wrong allegations on their educators for not satisfying their doubts if they have had any record of punishment. One such case surfaced in Calcutta when,according to FIR,a teacher committed suicide as he was harassed and disrespected by his learners for not being capable of using a smart class screen effectively.",
        "On the other hand, I feel that questioning is the basic right of education. Undoubtedly, when anyone learns something, he is more likely to be sceptical about certain facts which can only be eradicated by asking more and more.Thus, suffice to say, being vocal during class time builds confidence which further leads to success. Secondly, interrogation helps strengthen the bond between pupils and tutors. Since students' involvement motivates the lecturer to go beyond their limitations, it proves that the speaker is being heard and understood. So, in a way, in order to build a healthy relationship, learners ought to be liberal in asking questions while studying.",
        "In conclusion, despite having some chances of arguments and negativity in the classroom, scholars should be free to reveal their problems in front of their tutors due to the fact that it gives them the opportunity to learn profoundly and boosts their self-esteem."
