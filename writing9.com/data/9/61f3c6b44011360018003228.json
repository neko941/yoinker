        "Nowadays , many individuals believe that governments are constructing public entertainment places like sports stadiums and theatres rather than building hospitals and schools . In my opinion , I partly agree with this view and I will explain more details in the following paragraphs .",
        "On the one hand , building some theatres or stadiums could bring some positive benefits to that particular community.For example , many jobs opportunities can be available during and after the construction and people can join more sports-related activities or entertainment concerts when their leisure time .In addition , governments  can  be hosted to celebrate national or international level competitions based on those infrastructures.However , if governments are trying to build those kinds of buildings more than the requirements , they will not be able to contribute their budget to other sectors like health care or education .Consequently , people will not obtain proper health and education systems .",
        "On the other hand , there is no doubt that people  should obtain sophisticated medical facilities and education systems  . For instance , one survey from social science organization shows that people who lived in rural areas require good hospitals and schools in their regions rather than huge football grounds or opera houses . Moreover , some authorities are implementing unnecessary buildings like sports complexes or huge theatres to attract their citizens' attention and some political reasons. As a result , those infrastructures are not useful for their people and maintenance costs are  higher than they expected .",
        "Taking everything into consideration , governments should balance their construction for their people  . They have to think about profits and drawbacks before doing any projects like building schools or sports grounds . Otherwise , all the consequences will be suffered by their next generations."
