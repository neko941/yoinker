        "Thankfully, most of the branches were blown off at the other side of the house, but one of them crashed through the front door and damaged the front side window a little bit. Due to this, the whole glass of that window was shattered, and I got hurt as well.",
        "I called the emergency service straight away, and incredibly, they were there in just one hour. As I called them on time, they patched  everything up on time, and they asked me to call the insurance company, which I did. As you are the owner of this house, so they want to speak with you directly about your loss compensation.",
        "Hope that this doesn\u2019t interfere with your rest. And I finally assured you that there is all under control from my end.",
