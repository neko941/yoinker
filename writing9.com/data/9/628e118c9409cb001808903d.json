        "In many cases, the authorities are sure that developing the economy plays a major role in the country, nevertheless, there are individuals who oppose this opinion saying that there is a great number of factors which are significant in the same way. In this essay, I will discuss both these points of view and give my own opinion on the matter. Firstly, I will discuss why economic progress makes the country and its citizens powerful by the example of America and secondly, I will explore why science is probably a key to the future.",
        "On the one hand, it can be heard from many media sources that the government's focus is economic progress and the majority of recourses are highly concentrated in this field. Moreover, the authority is sure that while they are investing the budget into the economic sectors this will become a tool to influence other countries. For example, the best way to define if I am right or not is to check the current situation in the USA and perhaps the most upgraded part of Earth economically. On top of that, this helps them affect other small countries by the way of spreading dollars all around the world and American franchises which are located almost everywhere.",
        "On the other hand, there are spheres which need to be taken care of, such as science. It is very good exemplified by private companies which try to create a way to colonize other planets or define how to produce food for the growing population. For instance, the problem of overpopulation or air pollution takes place in every removed part of the world. Consequently, if the authorities do nothing to fight it, this will be able to cause serious catastrophes for all human beings and the economic factor will not be important.",
        "In conclusion, from the arguments I have written above I can say that, undoubtedly, money and finances are really necessary, but, it would be much better if we pay more attention to other types of progress."
