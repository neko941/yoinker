        "As you can see on my attached CV I completed a degree in Spanish at Valencia University, where I was trained to work as an instructor for boys and girls of young age. Additionally, I have taken a course on child psychology, that I think could be very helpful for educating young people. Furthermore, in my previous experience as a full-time janitor in a primary school, I was responsible for mentoring and nursing students.",
        "On the other hand, people often describe me as a reliable, hard-working and resourceful worker. Therefore, I believe I can be a good mentor for your sons.",
        "I am available for an interview at your earliest convenience. Please, do not hesitate in contacting me for further details.",
