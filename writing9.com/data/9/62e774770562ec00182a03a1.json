        "Firstly, my thesis is based on the discovery and science of the railway where English people played a huge role in its development.Moreover, I would love to look into the detail of the making of the engines and their theory to run on fuels. Furthermore, I know the depth knowledge is only available there in the library, thus it would be worth spending some time over there to collect data.",
        "Lastly, I would require computers and charts where all data are stored. Finally, the help of your history teacher for gathering information.",
        "I hope to hear soon from you for the confirmation of my tour to  the library.",
