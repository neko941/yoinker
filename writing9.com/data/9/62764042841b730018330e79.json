We hurriedly admitted her to the hospital where the doctor advised her to keep her under treatment for four more days otherwise she may lose her ability to walk ever. Looking at the severity of the moment, I cancelled all my future plans including ours, to stay here with mom.",
        "I hope you would understand my situation and forgive me for spoiling our trip, although unwittingly. I request you to meet me next Thursday, if possible for you as I would be absolutely free then. Now if that doesn't suit  you, feel free to suggest any new date and time.",
        "Once again, I am feeling sorry for the last-minute delay in our plan and seek your apology. Write to me about what you think of the get-together in the future.",
