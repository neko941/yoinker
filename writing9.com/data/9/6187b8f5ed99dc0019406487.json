        "I am writing this letter with reference to the furniture in your property at William street. My family and I have been living in your property at B12 William street for four years and we are happy and would like to appreciate all your help during our stay. However, we have noticed that the quality of the furniture has worsened with time. Specifically, the sofa, armchair and the bookshelf which needs to be either repaired or replaced.",
        "Based on the terms of the lease, this constitutes normal wear and tear and it is the responsibility of the landlord to take care of it financially. I would be grateful if you could get the furniture repaired or changed. Alternatively, I can purchase the items and get the amount reimbursed in the form of a deduction from the next month\u2019s rental payment. Please let me know your decision at your earliest convenience.",
        "Looking forward to hearing from you.",
