        "I am a bit concerned for the safety of the children ,especially during the journey as no one might be able to properly look after them. I can come early in the morning and provide some assistance to the teachers before we leave and make sure everybody is accounted for and on the bus.",
        "I would like to ask some further questions regarding the trip, Do you have an itinerary you can send me so I know what we are going to see whilst there? This would be useful as I can prepare myself with some background reading. I would also like to know if there is anything that parents should bring during the trip and when are we expected to arrive back in the UK.",
