        "Dear Sir,",
        "I am writing this letter to give my appreciation to your restaurant and the staff for their hospitability. Recently, on the 23rd of this month, we visited your restaurant late-night to fulfil our cravings for the exotic gourmet food that you serve.",
        "Indeed, because the reviews of your restaurant are excellent, we were excited to taste the flavours of the dishes, but the primary reason for our visit was my cousin\u2019s 18th birthday since we had heard that you organize birthday parties quite well. Furthermore, for surprising her, we decided to try out your fairytale theme with the barbeque as well as continental offer.",
        "Undoubtedly, the decorum was professionally organized very well and the catering arrangements made were top-notch. Moreover, it was the friendly nature of the staff that made the event more joyful. In addition to this, there were many food options available for barbeque and the idea of making it on the table in front of us was rather unique.",
        "Please convey my thanks to your staff and owner.",
        "Yours faithfully,",
