        "The authority has partial responsibility for any individual's health because they have to provide enough medical care structure to cope with the increasing number of people. However, I believe that everyone has to take care of his or her well-being by regular exercise along with a healthy dietary scheme.",
        "To begin with, the government has to enhance the quality of the treatment structure. This is because of the increase in the population in every place, which requires the public sectors to multiply the number of hospitals. For instance, in Egypt, every year the population increases by around 2 million people; therefore, the ministry has to construct more clinics. Nevertheless, it is the responsibility of each one to take  precautions to maintain his or her physic by going to the health centre every few months to do a full check-up.",
        "On the other hand, people should adopt a healthy lifestyle to ameliorate their strength. This is because a balanced diet system could enhance their metabolism. For example, everyone should take enough portions of meat, vegetables and protein in order to enhance their capacity of burning calories. Furthermore, nothing is better than exercising regularly; to cite an example, if anyone spends 30 minutes jogging every day, this will improve the body mass. As a result, it is evident that these procedures will prevent any health-related issues such as cardiovascular diseases.",
        "To conclude, bearing in mind the above information and deliberating all facts, it can be deduced that although the administration has to provide an adequate number of nursing homes, it is the responsibility of individuals to go to the  infirmary for a regular check-up as well as adopt a healthy diet scheme and  Include physical activities in their lifestyles."
