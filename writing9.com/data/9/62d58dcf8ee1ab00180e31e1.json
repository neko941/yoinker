        "Dear Sir,",
        "I am writing to inform you that I am planning to do a presentation on cryptocurrency Investment. I recently had an opportunity to attend a conference in Singapore about the issues of investing in cryptocurrency.",
        "Many staffs from our organisation have invested heavily in cryptocurrencies due to the negative economic situation in our country. However, many of them do not know the issues or the risk of buying cryptocurrencies. Therefore, I believe it would be wiser to do a presentation to our staff and create awareness among them. Also, our country has fewer foreign currencies and we are finding it difficult to import fuel or essential items. One of the main reasons for this issue is due to transactions occurring in the cryptocurrency market, where dollars are bought online in an unregulated market. Hence, the dollars will not reach the government of our country. This kind of education should be given to our staff.",
        "I would like to invite all staff from our company including executive managers. And I have planned to do it  this Friday at the main training.  I would be grateful if you could approve for the same.",
        "I look forward to hearing from you soon.",
        "Yours faithfully,",
