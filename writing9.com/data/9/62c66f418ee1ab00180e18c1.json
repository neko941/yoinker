        "actually, I have an important exam in the north of the city at my university and so I decided to take an Uber. I waited for it in my location for 30 minutes but unfortunately, he did not come.  I called  him and he said, due to my online payment he cancelled that request. I had to cancel that trip. Moreover, I had to take another taxi and I was under pressure because of his actions .",
        "I would appreciate it if you consider the situation and try to solve the problem of payment online. on the other hand, I expect the driver to give explanations for his bad behaviour. in addition, all of the charges that were deducted from my account were returned. and since that, this happened had a huge impact on my exam, I  emphasized I do not accept any excuse.",
        "Thank you for taking the time and your consideration of my letter.I looking forward to hearing from you as soon.",
