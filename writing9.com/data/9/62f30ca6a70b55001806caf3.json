        "I am writing to you regarding our company's meeting which was held in your hotel, last week. I would like to thank you for your high-quality service, however, we have received some complaints from our employees according to the lunch. Let me explain more about it.",
        "Initially, I would like to denote the quality of your catering service, and how your staff was well-trained. Although there were minor delays in serving tea at the beginning, everything got fixed as I requested by your staff manager. On the other hand, the quality of the meal was less than our expectation. Most of our invitees believe that the rice was served cold, and the taste was too spicey which makes the lunch almost inedible.",
        "As a result, I want to bring your attention to this issue and would suggest you ask your chef to use fewer spices while your serving room might need some facilities to keep the meals warm for a longer period.",
        "Sincerely yours,",
