        "Art was considered an integral part of communities and valued for centuries. However, with the change of time values change, the art does not attract the human\u2019s eye anymore. Instead, people started to consider science, technology and business sectors to be more influential . In my opinion science and technology comforted  human life and business gave financial stability. In order to revive art\u2019s popularity craft festivals must be celebrated. In this essay, the causes of the decline in art\u2019s popularity and way to gain people attention will be discussed.",
        "To begin with, the breakthrough in healthcare services and advance to ease communication and commute are the primary causes of diving people\u2019s interest in the craft. Firstly, nowadays people are being treated for the diseases which were considered deadly for mankind which increased its value over others. For example, humans are easily treated for cancer which was earlier considered to be dangerous. Secondly,  cellphones made it easier to communicate as compared to past and cars have made the commute easy which improved the quality of life making them valuable.  For instance, because of cellphones, the call can be made within seconds in any part of the world , earlier letters used to take weeks to reach. Thus,  ease of communication and commute and better healthcare made craft undervalued.",
        "On the other hand, the only way to draw people\u2019s attention is to host cultural festivals and including celebrities to promote the craft. First of all, By people visiting the festivals, a sense of cultural pride can be revived which may help to catch mass\u2019s eye. Moreover, craft eve\u2019s may help to connect the population with their rich past. As an example, festivals hosted by Italy have kept their love for art intact. Second of all, people are influenced by  celebrities and follow them, they can be asked to promote art. As an instance, a famous actor in India  is promoting historical paintings because of which painting artist have gained a lot of recognition. Hence, the cultural festival will help art to get its deserved value.",
        "In summary,  Better medical services and life comforting assets have made the popularity of craft to go down which may be countered by conducting festivals."
