        "This might seem off but the main reason behind this party is I have successfully cleared my master's degree with first-class distinction. It's a kind of celebration party. I've invited our schoolmates and I hope we'll have a whale of a time together.",
        "To reach  the location, you need to book an auto from the bus station and my address is Vrindavan park, plot no: 9. It will take around 30 minutes to drive from the station. You can ask the auto driver to drop you at the shop which is in front of my house.",
        "You don't have to worry about any stay as I've booked a nearby hotel.  Moreover, a spacious room will give you more comfort and morning breakfast is included.",
        "I am excited and hope to see you soon.",
