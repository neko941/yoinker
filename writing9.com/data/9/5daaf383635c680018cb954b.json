        "Learning processes can vary substantially in terms of methods. While a few learners prefer group studies, others highlight the paramount importance of studying by themselves. From my perspective, learning alone enhances the level of study productivity in comparison to groups.",
        "The first major benefit from learning out of the classroom is respect for individuality. Distinct from studying in groups, independent learning allows pupils to respect their path and difficulties as well as it permits to adopt alternative techniques. For instance, according to extensive research conducted by the University of Bristol, pupils who have private tutors have fifty percent more chance to understand class content than academics from traditional educational institutions with fixed curriculums. Therefore, the superiority is demonstrated by the personalization of methods that adapts to the uniqueness of each person, which boosts learning statistics.",
        "Secondly, students can easily lose focus in a communal class environment. The distraction is a consequence of informal conversations that are common in classes, since not everyone has a genuine interest in academic subjects. Consequently, instead of educating, teachers are forced to spend considerable time asking pupils to be silent. To illustrate the time waste, British teachers spend on average one-third of class time trying to get full attention from scholars. By contrast, if such effort were expended in learning, efficiency would be higher as it happens when studying without classmates.",
        "To conclude, this essay argued that studying alone better prioritizes people's individuality in the same that it might improve concentration. Thus, I oppose to the notion that it would be more advantageous to learn accompanied by colleagues."
