        "Thank you for your kind invitation to this coming holiday. I do appreciate your time to think about me and I hope you are doing great these days. I am afraid I cannot make it this time as I just joined a new local company a month ago and my google calendar are even full of \u2018things to do list.",
        "Once I resigned from the previous international multi-culture firm, it just happened that I had to join the new firm without any break after. Alongside the promotion to a senior role, the pay went up to what I had expected since last year. By the way, there is a job vacancy in this company and I believe it fits your expectations if you are keen to apply.",
        "Anyway in the next couple of months, there will be long holidays in my country and I can take leave if I need to as I might be slightly less busy. That\u2019s why I can come over to your country if you still have time to spare with me. However, I absolutely understand that your schedule is somehow tight as well. Then, do let me know once  your date availability is confirmed and I will book the flight right away. I hope we can meet sooner as I have been missing you so much.",
        "Take care and stay safe.",
