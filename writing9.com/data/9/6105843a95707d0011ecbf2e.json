        "Dear Sir/ Madam,",
        "I am writing this letter to inform you that in your latest edition of the travel magazine there is a critical mistake about the information on my home city, Kolkata. Although the rest of the article about various monuments are interesting, the mistake committed is vital.  It says that the \u201cIndian Museum\u201d\u2019 that is located in the heart of the city is not the largest one in the country.",
        "Let me explain to you in more detail.  The \u201cIndian Museum\u201d is the pride for the city dwellers; thus, their eyes shine in glory whenever they discuss  this historic building. It has an enormous collection of immensely rare commodities that have a tremendous historical reference. Moreover, students across the globe visit here to complete their research work.  Henceforth, it is not fair to play with the sentiment of \u2018\u2019The Bengali\u2019\u2019 community.",
        "Can I please suggest you print an apology message in your next edition?  Besides that, it will be great if you re-write the article again so that everyone gets the appropriate fact. I look forward to hearing from you.",
        "Thank you for your consideration.",
        "Yours faithfully,",
