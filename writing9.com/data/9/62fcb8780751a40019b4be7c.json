        "Recently, your children make lots of noise and it bothers me. Indeed, these days I am working at home and need a quiet place to concentrate on my tasks. Moreover, they play football at midnight, therefore I can not sleep until they finish their play.",
        "In my opinion, there are some solutions that should be considered by you to solve this issue. Firstly, you should dedicate specific time to their plays. For instance, you should not allow them to play during the midnights and early mornings. Secondly, you should bring them to the park every day where they play soccer there. Furthermore, there are two parks in our neighbourhood and each one has a proper football field.",
