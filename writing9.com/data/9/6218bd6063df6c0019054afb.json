        "In this technical world, people are getting a good amount of income for the job they are doing in a system. If a person works for the senior position due to his experience they are paid more while others get less salary. I totally agree with this point and explain the reasons for this in the below essay.",
        "To begin with, Folks having senior management positions in any organization have more experience and better capability of dealing with the problems as compared to an employee at the lower post . Secondly, they have to work hard to manage the people which are reporting to them. For instance, A senior manager in a company takes care of two or more teams. Hence, he will be paid more because of his talent and increased responsibility.",
        "In contrast to the above point, Employees of an office at a lower seat are paid less because they have less experience and have to complete their job at the end of the day. For example, A new college hire in any system need not worry about the business to run it. He just needs to focus on learning the things to do in an efficient way. Another reason is that it's not a good practice to pay more for a less experienced employee at the lower position which is the biggest reason they are having low salaries.",
        "In nutshell, Any good organization is paying more to a senior post because of their workload and knowledge . In my ,opinion this is a positive thing that an employee should get less salary as a comparison to his manager having more knowledge."
