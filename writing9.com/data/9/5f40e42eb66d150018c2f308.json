        "Countries were becoming more and more similar by the same products which bought anywhere in the world. In my opinion, this progress comprises both position and negation.",
        "People are able to buy similar products anywhere promotes the exchange of commodities across countries, therefore, the economies of nations grow rapidly. Because domestic goods have chance to export to the world as well as other goods sold in the domestic market. For example, Vietnam\u2019s GDP has increased three times compared to the period during Vienam\u2019s economic embargo. Furthermore, the other positive advancement is that residents contracted with good commodities more convenient because of they can be sold everywhere instead of the country it was made in. On the other hand, America\u2019s goods have sold in many China\u2019s showrooms and show us China is the largest consumer market that all countries target",
        "Besides, it is the existence of negative expansion and one of these negation is everyone tending to prefer foreign products. The main reason is that they believe that foreign goods are better than domestic ones, which lead to the domestic products are less developed. As a result, this economic country is dependent. Vietnam is a heavily nation dependent on China so any China\u2019s decision will seriously affect the Vietnam\u2019s economy. In addition, if countries sell the same products, it will be lose its traditional characteristic goods. Because they are regularly unpopular. For instance, a number of streets in Hanoi\u2019s Old Quarter have lost their traditional products as well as culture.",
        "In conclusion, any evolution activity has good and bad sides."
