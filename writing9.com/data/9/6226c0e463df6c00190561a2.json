        "Hi, how are you? I hope this letter finds you well.  I am excited to hear that you are planning to go on camping this summer for the first time and am glad you reached out to me for advice.",
        "I'm sure your trip will be an amazing experience as I am aware of your love for nature and this sounds to be a perfect opportunity to get closer to it. Besides, spending your time by the lake during the day and having a campfire at night will be a great help for your stress reliever and clear your mind.",
        "However, there is something you should keep in your mind during your trip.  You will not have access to  decent internet service as you will be in nature.  There will be some chance that you can use the internet, but they aren't necessarily good with speed and quality.  Additionally, there will be countless numbers of mosquitos and bugs.  I strongly suggest you bring insect repellent.",
        "I wish I could join you camping, but I'm afraid I have local volunteer work this summer. I hope you will enjoy your time there and have a lot of fun.",
        "I hope to hear from you soon.",
        "Best wishes,",
