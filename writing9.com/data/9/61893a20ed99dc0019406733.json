        "I am writing to draw your attention to my jacket that was left behind by me in the cinema hall. Last weekend on 31st October I had booked a movie in hall number 12 for an evening show. Unfortunately, I had forgotten my jacket in the chair.",
        "I would describe the jacket so that it might be easier for you to identify the same. The jacket is made of leather and is black in colour. It has a hoodie attached to it. The inner layer of the jacket is red in colour.",
        "For further identification, I can provide my seating details. My seat number was D12 that is on the left side of the screen. It was a fourth seat from the right side exit door. I have attached my ticket in the mail for your reference.",
        "I would appreciate it if you could safeguard it in your office locker as it contains my passport . However, I have booked  another movie this weekend, hence I can collect the jacket from the office. Please note my contact number: 9952952892. Thank you.",
        "Yours faithfully,",
