        "Last Monday I ordered a cover for my HTC phone from your eCommerce website. I was excited when it arrived but very disappointed to find that the product was not as promised and totally unusable. I am hoping you will replace it.",
        "In relation to the specifics of the order, I purchased this leather cover through your website called Electric Gadgets on November 08th using my PayPal account. The order number is 2584205 and I am attaching a copy of my receipt with this letter.",
        "The issue with the canvas is that it is not a genuine leather product and I am unable to store my phone inside it securely. The picture of the item on your website clearly shows the screen supports the HTC Desire 12+ model and is an original leather product. So I\u2019m sure this is a manufacturing flaw.",
        "As a solution, and because I really like the design and look of the lid, I am hoping that you will agree to replace it with a new and genuine one for free. Otherwise, I would like a full refund and I will be contacting PayPal complaints if I do not hear back from you in regards to this within a week.",
        "Thank you for giving the matter your attention and I hope to hear your reply soon.",
