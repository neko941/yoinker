        "As I have been informed that the garbage will be collected by trashman every Monday. However, I noticed since last month. There is no one coming and picking up the trashes. So that, it causes major problems, in other words, there are too many rubbishes in the waste area and it smells every part of our neighbour. Furthermore, some of our neighbours witnessed some rats and cockroaches are all around. This makes us feel disgusting and in danger because  these kinds of rats are carriers of various pathogens. In addition, it makes the landscape look unappealing.",
        "I would like very much you to manage by having a discussion with your waste collector on how serious the problem is. I am looking forward to this problem being solved quickly.",
