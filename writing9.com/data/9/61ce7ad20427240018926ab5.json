        "I have to admit that the shopping facilities which was offered in almost every town centre are similar. However, the centre that was located in the western mall had a significant difference from others in terms of entertainment facilities and parking spaces which are considered a great challenge in many shopping complexes.",
        "It has been a place for community gatherings where people experience more fun and frolic involvement in many fun-filled activities. Moreover, it has well-established parking spaces so people don't require to stand in long queues when compared to other malls.",
        "I would be grateful if possible in your future editions of The Edge article could only publish positive news about establishments without raising a claim on own opinions. If possible I could arrange a guided tour to explore the place in order to explain to you the benefits. If you would like to further discuss, please contact me on my mobile or by email.",
