        "A number of people advocate that one\u2019s positivity in the eyes of some could risk appearing as negativity in the eyes of others. From my perspective, I voice approval of the aforementioned, believing that no individuals could please everyone, since our beings are open to subjectivity.",
        "In the first place, it is undeniable that humans\u2019 personality traits and behaviours are evaluated through the criteria and judgement of others. In other words, whether or not we are positive is differently interpreted in dissimilar viewpoints, while being good-natured in one\u2019s eyes may become wicked in others\u2019. For instance, celebrities\u2019 doing charity work is generally regarded as morally righteous; however, dissidents refute it as hypocritical and only serves to polish their images. Hence, there are always two-faced implications for all actions humans take.",
        "What is more, whatever we do, there invariably exists someone who naturally dislikes us. That is, even if we change ourselves to fulfil their standards, these efforts will prove worthless should their loath stem from jealousy or distrust. Though, it is worth bearing in mind that as long as we do not harm anyone, under no circumstances is our positive attitude towards others hindered by haters\u2019 remarks and criticism. For example, while there appear many artistic productions that are harshly condemned by critics, several audiences still find it valuable, at least for themselves. This means people are not born to satisfy everyone, but should only please the ones who bring out the best in them.",
        "All things considered, although humans\u2019 essence is subjected to others\u2019 viewpoints, our core values go far beyond those sheer assumptions. Therefore, I am supportive of the statement, claiming that our being positive towards some may risk appearing negative in others, which does not matter as long as we do not regret our doings."
