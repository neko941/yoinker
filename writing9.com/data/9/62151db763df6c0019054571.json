        "Dear Sir/Madam,",
        "I am writing this letter with regard to my commentary on the recent successful completion of the culinary art at your institution.  It was a blessing to be a part of such a sophisticated environment with highly professional chefs.",
        "I have nailed the art of cutting tomatoes with a sharp knife in a zig-zag pattern, which has made me a master in it.   Furthermore, I keep reminiscing the skill of using the high-standard and complicated types of equipment, which require a lot of concentration to operate.  Moreover, the best thing I really enjoyed is preparing the fish salad, which is an asset in my work.",
        "I would like to share with you some of my catering stories.  Firstly, in the very first week, I prepared a Russian salad with toppings of coriander on it.  My family appreciated it, especially my mom really liked it as soon as she has taken a morsel of it.  Secondly,  I also tried making Hyderabadi Biryani and has done an excellent job in it too.  Thirdly, on daily basis preparing salads with different shapes, which I have learnt in the class has made me adept in it.",
        "If I may, it is highly recommended to start with classes teaching a variety of Indian desserts.  I will be delighted to enrol in it as soon as it is commenced.",
        "I am looking forward to hearing from you.",
        "Thanks and Regards",
