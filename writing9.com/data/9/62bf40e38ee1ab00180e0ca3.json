        "Dear Sir or Madam,",
        "Hope this letter finds you well.  My name is Clarence and I am writing this letter to complain about the construction of an airport near my neighbourhood.",
        "I got to know the construction plan from our local council as we were holding an annual meeting last Friday. If my memory serves me correctly, the airport construction will take about 5-6 months to complete. The airport will occupy around 5000 square kilometres and have 3 main buildings, air-bridges.",
        "As you may be aware , a majority of residents are not satisfied with such a plan because we are extremely worried about the living environment in our neighbourhood. We remain sceptical and doubtful of your commitment to making our community a tranquil place for people and animals.  We expect there will be an increasing number of people travelling through our residential blocks on their way to the airport.",
        "We suggest the local government should put a pause on this project before reaching a consensus with local residents. It is necessary to conduct a comprehensive review of this plan before it moves to the implementation phase. Other than that, a series of protective measures should be brought forward to preserve our natural landscape.",
        "All in all, we want to local government to think twice before continuing with the project.",
        "Yours sincerely.",
