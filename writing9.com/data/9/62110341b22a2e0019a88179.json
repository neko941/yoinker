He got A+ in English. He is also advanced in math so much that he can multiply 2 numbers fast without using calculators.",
        "Regarding his scope of interest, he is physically active and he likes sports. Recently, he learned how to swim. Add to that, he loves playing soccer. That is why I think he will be successful at your school. I hope you will consider replying to me favourably if you have time.",
