        "In recent years, the population have been growing dramatically and leading towards  over utilisation of natural resources, resulting in the depletion of those to a greater extent. I believe that we can collectively take measures together with the authorities to control the depletion by spreading awareness introducing certain rules. This essay will list the problem associated with overpopulation and provide further details on measures to control the situation.",
        "To commence with, one of the major problems that are caused due to the rapid population growth is the increases in the environmental concerns, such as pollution, and deforestation leading to the loss of the habitat of the animals and threatening their existence. Due to the increased number of individuals, there is a rise in the demand for land, consequently, leading to the cutting down of forests and occupying the space meant for them. In addition, we might not be able to maintain a proper healthcare system if the population rate grows in the same trend. Lack of medical care, for instance, might affect the quality of our lives.",
        "However, there are a few measures that can help us maintain our ecosystem and prevent  overutilisation like spreading awareness and imposing certain laws. Firstly, initiating awareness campaigns to educate the negative impacts, especially in rural areas. They are not aware of the severity of the situation, so this might help them realise the grave danger that we are anticipating if not controlled. Similarly, the government should come up with policies to control the increasing number of individuals, for example, by giving free births control kits.",
        "In conclusion, it is evident that there are severe impacts of the population growth like loss of biodiversity, over utilisation of resources and scarcity in terms of medical help, whereas these can be controlled and mitigated by taking measures like educating the public about its dire impacts along with the introduction of strict rules by the authorities."
