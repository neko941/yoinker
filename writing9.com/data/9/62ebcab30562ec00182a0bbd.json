        "I am writing to complain about the misbehaviour of your cab driver who was assigned for my last week's trip from Delhi to Ghaziabad. Although I  raised this issue with the company on the very next day, till now I have not received any response from them.",
        "I am a regular customer of your cab services but this time, I am extremely displeased with the address of my issue. It does not feel safe to me booking any further rides in future.",
        "Not only did the driver arrive late at the pick-up point but also on asked about the reason, he replied in an angry manner and started driving rashly to scare me off. I warned him to raise a formal complaint but to my surprise, he remained ignorant and kept on arguing throughout the ride. I called your customer care instantly but nobody picked up the call then. Thus, I had to record and send the message to an automatic message receiver bot of your company.",
        "I would like you to take action against the driver promptly as it could put travellers at risk. Moreover, as a suggestion please create a proper forum for the clients to raise their issues and to provide updates on their statuses. This way customers will have more faith in your services.",
        "Thanks for your consideration,",
