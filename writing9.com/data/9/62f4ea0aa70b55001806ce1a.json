        "In the olden days, newspapers and television were the only sources of information for people. With the immense development in technology, these mediums of information are swept away by the internet. Though most people have shifted from the traditional way to online for getting daily updates, I personally think that this is not a positive development and shall explain the reasons in the following paragraphs.",
        "Firstly, those who prefer online sources to fetch news states their reasons as ease and convenience. The digital era has enabled access to unlimited information to individuals which they can read anywhere and at any time. For instance, many news apps provide updates  every hour making it easy to access the news. Secondly, online communication is dominating because of its capability to reach the masses in a very short time. People instantly upload videos and content from any part of the world which can be ingressed by anyone.",
        "However, on the other hand, not all the content shared via the internet is authentic. Oftentimes, fraud videos and facts are posted online which can have a tremendous effect on  society. For example, US elections were tampered with as someone from the opposing political party had shared the wrong votes count on  social media. On the same hand, newspaper and television channels are legally bound to all the content that they share making it 100 per cent genuine and trustworthy. Also, a person gets to see critical discussions in parliament, which is useful in gaining knowledge about the stands on various political and burning issues.",
        "In the nutshell, even though online news has gained popularity due to quick and easy-to-access content, they are no match to the traditional and authentic information from newspaper and TV channels."
