        "Arguably, it is commented that entities  trading in a specific region should not only be focused on profiting. However,  they should  care for the local communities. Personally, I strongly agree with the view since  enterprises  have responsibilities to  develop neighbourhoods. Although this development is highly criticised by  managers. This essay will shed light on both sides of the view and  provide anecdotal evidence to prove the arguments.",
        "On the one hand,  businesses are accountable for  the local  district  advancement. In other words,  once they  are exploring  raw materials, lands or other sorts of goods or services inward  communities they should  bear  their expenses. For instance, a Mozambique's company, Mozal is  devoted to aluminium exploitation in the Beluluane area, once it is  making money through the raw material of this  small area, the enterprise builds schools, roadways, and  employs the local  youth. As a result,  both  are the  greater winners, the local folk and  the company. It is the overriding reason for high develop small  lands  in Spain.",
        "On the other hand,  shareholders regard  social responsibility  as  financial resources consuming.  Because of the escalated  quantity of resources  utilized in  social activities,  the owners of these  institutions  criticise the development.  60% of   business institutions  are found it a hardship  to help  societies where they operate to exemplify. It is pointed out by the new research carried out by the University  of Southampton.  Hence,  there are  soared conflicts between  the  businesses owners and communities.  Moreover, It is the  prime  purpose for the shortfall in an agreement between woodcutters and the African crowd.",
        "To sum up, notwithstanding the lack of support from the shareholders of businesses,  these explorers  should  collaborate  and help  the local livings owing to the fact that they  lately  depend on the local resources.  Therefore, I still strongly agree with the statement. I would go as far as to say, the local regime instils stricter measures to protect throng interests."
