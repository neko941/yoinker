As you are almost an elder brother for me, I would like you to come to the celebration. Frankly speaking, it won\u2019t be as fun as it could be if you are not able to come.",

Then, my husband will prepare pickled meat and salad with cucumbers and tomatoes on me. As well as salad, I will bake your favourite apple pie. For the beverage, we are going to purchase different kinds of beer and craft one among them.",
