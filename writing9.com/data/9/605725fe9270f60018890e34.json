        "A highly controversial issue today relates to what is the best way to a successful career. While some people argue that it is better to get a diploma, others believe the best option is to go straight to the job market after school. In this essay, I am going to examine this question from both points of view and then explain why I believe getting a job after school is better.",
        "There are people who argue that getting a diploma is more appropriate to become successful. This is because they believe that the academy will teach the theory and knowledge necessary to achieve success. For example, to an engineer, a course will teach all the maths needed to perform this job. In addition, they believe that at the university people will build the necessary network to achieve the best spots and, therefore, it would be essential to have a studying plan in an institution to succeed.",
        "On the other hand, there are those who argue that getting a job straight after  school is the path to success. They have this opinion because they consider work experience as a key factor in a successful career. To illustrate, many CEOs of famous companies, such as Sergey Brin and Jeff Bezos, did not visit a college or a university. Besides, they argue that going straight to the job market is the fastest route to success because they believe people who enrol in a course is losing precious time that could be better spent directly performing the job.",
        "In conclusion, I believe both sides have their merits. However, on balance, I feel that the best option to achieve better results is to work right after  school. This is because I believe the university is not able to teach the necessary skills to succeed, while in the job market, people will learn exactly what is required to get the job done and thrive."
