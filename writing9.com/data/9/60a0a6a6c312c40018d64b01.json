        "Nowadays, advertisement is omnipresent. There are some people who think that these commercials make viewers  buy things, the opponents consider this is no longer happens. I,  totally agree with the former\u2019s view because the advert has a strong influence on buying culture.",
        "On one hand,  it has been noted  that commercial pester their target  customers to purchase items, which are not at  all required. In other words, these are capable  to create artificial wants and  make them believe that it is a part of their status. For example, by using  celebrities\u2019 endorsement, a large mass of consumers are attracted by their products, which is hugely successful  until now. Similarly, these adverts really assist consumers to know the latest trends and fashions, therefore, many youngsters fall into this .",
        "However, on the other hand, since the advent of modern technology, endorsement has lost its power, according to some. This is because  customers  hugely depend on online websites to compare the quality and prices of products than watching any commercials. Moreover, even though a lot of adverts  are  broadcasted, viewers are extremely lower than in previous years. For instance, currently, hoarding, billboards, and cutouts are  rarely used to sell service and products as it is not so popular.",
        "In conclusion, people have a different  opinion on the effectiveness of any kinds  of  advertisement. Although some advocates view that it pesters them to buy things, others disagree with the statement. Nevertheless, I firmly consider the influence of commercials on people\u2019s  purchasing  behaviour is so evident and cannot be ignored."
