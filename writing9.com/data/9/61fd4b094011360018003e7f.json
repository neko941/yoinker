        "I am writing this missive to let you know that I am facing several issues with my laptop which I had recently purchased on 21st February 2022 from your shop for Rs 18,000 and its model number is MBZ and the product is under warranty.The laptop automatically turned off while I am working and this happens a lot in a day.Furthermore,it gets heated very quickly.",
        "Let me explain my scenario,sometimes I am giving the presentation in  front of the high authorities and when it shuts down,it displays my negative appearance in front of the staff.Moreover,I find it difficult to maintain the same momentum again when I am pursuing the activities which I was not able to complete because the device switched off without giving any warning.",
        "From my point of view,you should address these problems on a prior basis and as I have fewer hours to leave my home and deliver it to the company service centre.It's a humble request to send the organisation delivery person to collect the device from my home and deliver it to the house as soon as possible.Although,I am arranged a laptop for a few days.",
        "I hope to hear from you soon.",
        "Yours faithfully,",
