        "Their big day falls into the period that I will be visiting you, which means that I will have to postpone my visit to you, unfortunately. As I\u2019ll have to help out in the planning for my brother\u2019s big day, I will be able to go to England only at a later date. I am so, really sorry to disappoint you. I know that you have made lots of exciting plans for us during my visit to the UK and  you have been looking forward to it as much as I do.",
        "I am thinking of visiting you at the end of March instead. How does it sound? Let\u2019s plan together for our itinerary to suit the new period. I\u2019ll wait for your reply before confirming the new dates with the airline. Looking forward to hearing from you.",
