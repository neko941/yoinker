        "Based on statistical data illustrating that the deficient literation is highly related to the high unlawful acts.  A significant number of individuals  regard that the pathway to cut down  these acts is  investing in the apprenticeship of  convicts in jails so that are inserted in the work environment upon out. Personally, I agree with the view since it rehabilitates them. Albeit, other overhauls have shown that a plethora of them remains  psychological unaltered. This essay will shed light on both sides of the view  and provide evidence to prove the arguments.",
        "On the one hand,  outlaws' education glosses over them to fall into  recidivism. In other words,  the training process  makes them up to  real-life  and prevent the practice of new crimes. For instance,  the new research carried out by the University of Oxford pointed out that  four-fifth of defendants  skilled in civic education were straightforwardly  employed after  penal jail . As a result, communities were safe and the local ruling power shrank the national budget allocated to prisons. Moreover, the measure  is fashionable throughout the privileged nations.",
        "On the other hand, prisons' psychological behaviour is found it hardship to be influenced.  Because of the high sense of madness and dizziness, authorities find  strong withstand when addressing them.  For example,  there are discouraging  data  from a myriad of investigation entities  showing that solely a quarter of  imprisoned worldwide do not fall into recidivism when well-educated. Hence,  investing public funds  into the criminals  is a financial resource squandering that the folk has to pay.",
        "In conclusion, notwithstanding a sort of reluctance from the bandits, this is the most upbeat and effective following  to insert them into  the world society.Therefore, I still agree with the statement. In addition, I recommend the planetary world regime implement the measure  for safety,  peace and economic growth on the earth."
