        "I am Ravi from Apple company. Today I attended a meeting at the hotel which was held on the second floor in the ballroom. After reaching home while checking the files and I noticed that one of the most important files was missing and I am sure that that must be in your canteen as we had  coffee during the evening at 5pm and until that I had that file with me and later I did not see in my hand.",
        "Firstly, I am very much worried about the file due to the confidentiality and importance of the file as it is having company sales and revenue information along with future project budget plans  as well. Secondly, If it goes out of the hands and then  our company need to face inevitable challenges from our customers and competitors too.",
        "I will be there at your place during the early morning hours and I would request to you please keep that safe and secure and do not hand it over to anyone until I reach your place. if have any doubt or questions about the verification please reach out to the company's head office and you can find the address on our social media as well.",
