        "I am reaching out to you regarding your advertisement in the adventure magazine, issued on Mach 4th,2022. I am always interested in walking tours which are organized in the mountains.",
        "I am aware that mountain experience is extremely amazing since I used to hike before I started to work. It has been more than five years since I gave up climbing but I would like to participate in your walking tour. My doctor recommended  that I need to walk more frequently and get  fresh air. Therefore, your program is what I was looking for, and I would appreciate it if you could send me a travel itinerary so I can take a vacation from work. Additionally, I am on a tight budget and I would be thankful if you could give me a reasonable price.",
        "Finally, since I have not been in a good shape for long years, I have a real concern that I could not handle the difficulty of mountains. Please let me know that mountain is suitable for beginners.",
        "I look forward to hearing from you.",
