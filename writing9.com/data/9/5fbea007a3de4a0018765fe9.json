        "Human activities in the transformation of the world have led to the deforestation, some of the ecologists believe that national parks should be constructed to prevent the extinction of some species. This essay will examine positive aspects of it in the first half and the later section, the negative side will be discussed.",
        "On the one hand, various wildlife species are at the risk of disappearing from the planet and wildlife sanctuaries will help to protect them. To further explain, we can keep some of the surviving animals or birds in the conservation parks and let them bread, therefore, we can restore their population by this method. For example, few Hangul dear of Himalayas region were kept in the wildlife park and after a few years, there was a prolific rise in their population. Hence, we can maintain the balance in the ecosystem by creating wildlife parks.",
        "On the other hand, there are some devastating effects related to the establishments of national wildlife parks as it alters the natural habitat of the species. To elaborate, the animals and birds kept in these parks are kept in a different environment than that of their dwelling place, because of this, they can die. For instance, few of the white tigers were kept in Dachigam wildlife sanctuary but they were unable to adopt the change and most of them died. In addition to this, there could be a possibility of hormone imbalance in a living organism by the chance of natural habitat.",
        "In conclusion, the development of wildlife reservoirs can help prevent the complete extinction of some endangered flora and fauna but along with that, this shift can have negative consequences on some of the species."
