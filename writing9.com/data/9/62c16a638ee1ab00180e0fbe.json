        "I have recently noticed your advert in a daily newspaper about a short-term tennis course. Being a passionate learner of sports, I really want to get enrolled in it. As the course is for intermediate players  I think it would be beneficial for me.",
        "However, there are some issues that I want to discuss before  enrollment. Firstly, it is from 4:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. according to your advert,nevertless, it is not possible for me to join the class before 5:30 p.m. because I have a full time job. Is there any option to it adjust the timings? Besides, I probably have to travel to Sydney,Australia during a course for almost 3 months. As a result, I would not be able to complete the course. Considering this, will I get a refund in such a case? What is the refund policy? Finally, I request you to email the required document checklist.",
