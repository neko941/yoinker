        "I am writing this letter to you to express my regret as I will no longer be able to accept the position of \"Assistant Project Manager\". Recently, I  lost my brother in a road accident while he was on his way to the office. Though he fought for  survival in the hospital,  finally the major hit the brain could not sustain for longer and he breathed last 2 days ago.",
        "I sincerely apologize for not being able to continue the summer assignment and to convey you at such  short notice. It would affect your schedule and be hassled as you will be the one who would do all the procedures to find the suitable candidate and that too for the second time in just a short time span. However, it is essential for me to be with my family during this tough time. My stay at home will also have a few more responsibilities like closing off his bank accounts, claiming his insurance policies etc.",
        "With this, I would like to assure you that I shall be applying for the summer assignment next year again. I am sure I will rue in the future for letting this opportunity go away.",
        "Hope you understand the situation I am currently in!",
