Our company's product is struggling to compete in the Atlanta area, so Anna called me yesterday and arranged for this trip to increase our product's sales in  that area.I will finish my meetings at 3:00 P.M, so I would have  plenty of time to explore the city, and I think it is going to be fun if you joined me.",
