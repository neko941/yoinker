        "Dear Sir,",
        "My names are Luis Brendon and I am an international first year-student at Briston University, majoring in Mechanical Engineering. I am writing to inform I may need a week off to resolve a few problems concerning my college enrollment.",
        "I have been taking the program for 1 year now, and I may send some documents proving my current financial situation. This semester my course has been part-time owing to my working hours in the afternoon. As you know, the Engineering campus is situated in North area of the Campus and the Financial Department I need to turn to is almost a 6-day trip, so I thereby have some traffic problems, besides my classes I should attend.",
        "Therefore, I would appreciate it if I could have a 7-day period from the campus to deliver my documents to be revised. Moreover, I would like to get an academic certification from the university to also show there. I will be looking forward to hearing from you soon.",
        "Yours sincerely,",
