        "As you know, I moved to Canada last year. I've changed a few places before finally settling in Halifax, Nova Scotia, where I feel really happy and accomplished today. Evergreen forests and chilly oceans enable me to fully enjoy life, which was not possible in the warmer climate.",
        "Apart from other things, this location change helped me to boost my career. You probably remember how much I struggled with the repetitive tasks at Google. I am excited to tell you, that instead of daily coding, now at Amazon I am also involved in quality assurance. In spite of requiring a lot more effort, that field is making me a better professional on daily basis, because the complexity of tasks is so extraordinary.",
        "You cannot imagine how beautiful the environment is in Halifax. With great pleasure, I am inviting you to come and spend a week together this September, when the weather is the most comfortable. I will be looking forward to your response.",
