        "Dear Madam,",
        "I received your letter, and I am delighted to give my unbiased feedback on the cookery course which I attended two months ago. I would like to tell you about the part I enjoyed the most during the course  the technique of marinating chicken and other meat products. There was much subtle information we were given by the tutor which has been proven significant to cooking delicious food.",
        "I have been cooking all daily meals in my house as soon as I completed this course. I also tried  some restaurants  for a part-time job and they really appreciate my cooking skill,  they want to make a contract with me, but I have not thought about it because I am happy to cook for my family.",
        "I would like to suggest you introduce new cooking courses from different cuisines such as Mexican, Chines, Thai, etc. You probably know that these days Chinese foods are very popular amongst many so, I believe that you should involve Chinese cookery class in your upcoming curriculum.",
        "I am so glad that you ask for my feedback about the classes. I am so content with the course.",
        "Yours sincerely,",
