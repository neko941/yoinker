        "To continue my new job, it was a must for me to change my location as the cost of communication was really high, and the housing was really expensive in your area. In addition, my new job is not providing me with  a lucrative salary at the moment.",
        "About my new accommodation,  it has two large bedrooms with bed and shower enclosed, a study room, a big kitchen decorated with washing machine, cooker, micro oven, which is brand new. Besides this, there is a sports centre and swimming pool in my neighbourhood.",
        "About your visit, although I\u2019m missing your company; therefore, it\u2019ll be wonderful if you decide to join me in the upcoming bank holiday. My new flat is located on Lord Street, which is the central part of Harlow town; consequently, there are no issues related to communication and various types of foods that you can enjoy.",
