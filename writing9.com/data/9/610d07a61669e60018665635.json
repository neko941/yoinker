        "A set of individuals opine that the present technological advancements are oversizing the difference in the standard of living of the wealthy and the underprivileged,whereas, others argue that the reverse  is the case.The aim of this essay is to outline these two views and give my opinion.",
        "Some individuals are inclined towards the former view because modern technological gadgets are very costly and can only be purchased by the rich.In other words, only the well earned can bear the cost of those items.For instance, an Apple iPhone with all the high-end mechanics and technology cannot be bought by a common man.Thus it is clear that only the rich can enjoy the comforts of the modern scientific revolution. Besides this, even in the medical field ,not all are able to afford the new medical treatments.As a result, only high-income groups are seen to take those medications.",
        "Despite the above facts, I am in the favour of the latter view due to the following reasons.Firstly, we should understand that it is only because of  technological development that even an underprivileged person can use a smartphone.For example, the Jio phone which was launched in India had made a daily wage worker taste the  joy of high-speed internet.Secondly, the introduction of technical languages like C and JAVA has increased the foreign  travel chances  of a middle-class individual if he has was able to have a grip on those.Consequently, helping these people  expand their horizons.Therefore, I feel that all these situations increased the developmental doorways for a common man.",
        "To conclude, there are two different views about  modern scientific inventions in the population.This essay has reviewed both  views and elaborated on my opinion."
