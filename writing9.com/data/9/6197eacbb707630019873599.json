        "The reason for which I am writing this letter is that our office does not have any cafeteria for staff. where they can enjoy their snacks and drinks. most of the staff members go outside for meal and it takes 10 to 15 minutes and that time is wasting our work time too. Sometimes the weather is not friendly so you understand the whole situation here.",
        "Therefore, I would like to request you to set up a cafeteria in the empty room. The room is located in a  corner near to office and I noticed we did not use that room for a while. so in this ,way our staff did not go outside.",
