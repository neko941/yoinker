        "Dear Mam or Sir,",
        "I'm Charles Huston, living in downtown Chicago near a beautiful park . I received  bad news yesterday that council members are planning to sell the park to  rich land investors to convert the park into a shopping mall. People in my community are greatly disappointed with the council's decision.",
        "Firstly, a park served as a shelter for animals, they will be displaced if there are not enough trees for them to live on and fruit to provide them with food. Secondly, this park protects people from flooding and gave them humans fresh air to breathe. Lastly, the park served  as a recreational area for the people to enjoy a gift from nature. We cannot rebuild the ecosystem if we will destroy it.",
        "We already wrote to  UNESCO to put the park under their supervision, and the land title belongs to the government. We already informed the mayor's office to prevent the destruction and sale of the park. I,m are glad to put this letter in your article to resolve this issue in a peaceful manner",
        "Faithfully Yours,",
