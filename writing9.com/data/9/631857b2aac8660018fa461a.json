        "Dear Sir,",
        "I am writing this letter to brief you about the bad experience  I had at your inn , the receptionist's intervention  and possible ways to avert the occurrence of such issues in the future.",
        "Firstly, I  was a guest in your prestigious resort along the university road Lagos  between 27th to 30th April 2022 and  lodged for three days at suite 401 penthouse wing. Then , I decided to use the restroom after I settled in for the room but suddenly the toilet set gave in and I had a slight cut on my leg. Furthermore, I managed to crawl to reach for the telephone to alert the staff but passed out after the dial . It was later at the hospital that I got to know that the receptionist traced the call to my room and performed  CPR on me before the medical team came up with the ambulance. She was so brave and did everything possible to respond to the emergency. However,  If not for her timely approach I believed the situation could have led to my death, therefore I am requesting that she should be rewarded for her heroic efforts.",
        "Hence,  the authority should revaluation the integrity of the facilities in the hotel to forestall future occurrences,also staff  should be further trained in the management of domestic accidents and medical support. lastly, I hope these recommendations will be treated with utmost importance.",
        "Yours Faithfully,"
