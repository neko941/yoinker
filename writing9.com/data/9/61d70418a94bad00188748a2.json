        "We visited your restaurant to celebrate  the auspicious occasion of my wife's birthday. I and my kids had planned this surprise a few days before. While  the ambience was breathtaking, the food quality was terrible. We're not expecting this type of arrangement from a highly starred hotel.",
        "Firstly, the ordered cake was frozen which seemed like it was very old. Secondly, the cuisine we ordered came very late due to dreadful service and our meal was cold and salty. Even, the waiter was rude and he was not at all responsive.",
        "I would like to suggest changing all your staff, from cooking to serving. Moreover, please ensure that desserts are served, soft and fresh.",
        "I hope you'll do the needful and improve your ratings.",
