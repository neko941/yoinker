Therefore, with the widespread use of the network, people have more spare time to choose the location that they want to perform instead of travelling. The purpose of this article is to justify whether the benefits outweigh the disadvantages.",

Moreover, adolescences are expected to be lazy on duties and develop a crummy mindset habit. As a result, there is no one who is fit for trustworthy for a job in future and the effect will bring down one's country reputation. To sum up, this incident can happen if society allows a citizen to depend excessively on the accessibility to the internet gradually.",
        "To conclude, from the contents above, there are countless  positive and negative points of manipulating the internet. Nonetheless, from my perspective point of view, I vigorously opine to the idea of the disadvantages are outweighing the advantages in term of internet consuming."
