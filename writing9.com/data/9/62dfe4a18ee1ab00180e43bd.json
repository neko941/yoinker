        "Dear Mrs Barett,",
        "I am writing in response to your advertisement in a local newspaper seeking somebody to help you with your household work upcoming summer.",
        "I could do anything from washing dishes to doing and folding laundry. I can even do grocery shopping, in addition to preparing occasional afternoon snacks. I have learnt to do all these chores right at my house as I have to fill in for the duties of my mother, who has to travel for professional reasons.",
        "I have a long holiday next summer and I am planning to take painting classes. It would be a great opportunity for me if I could earn some extra cash to fund the classes while helping you at your home. Moreover, I am an international student and working with you can help me to improve my English speaking skills.",
        "However, I will not be available on weekends as I will be going to attend my classes. Also, I would be taking a lunch break of an hour daily between 1 PM to 2 PM. I hope my timings fit you.",
        "Hoping for a positive response,",
