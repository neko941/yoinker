        "Recently, I read an article in your newspaper about our town, and it claims that its centre is similar to any other town in our country. Although the statement is partially correct, I disagree with specific parts of the text. Let me explain more.",
        "Town centres are potentially the busiest part of each city, and this is a valid statement about Shiraz as well. In other cities, we see older buildings being demolished for various reasons such as the construction of shopping malls and modern buildings, even though Shiraz's governors are still trying to keep the old atmosphere of the centre by keeping the ancient buildings with beautiful Iranian design. Also, they are trying to open more roads to cyclists and pedestrians than any other city in the country, so, to keep the air clean for visitors and tourists.",
        "Moreover, there are other reasons which make Shiraz  a distinct destination from others, and I can explain to you in person if you plan to visit. In addition,  I can offer you and your writer a free tour around the city and specifically the centre to explain the differences.",
