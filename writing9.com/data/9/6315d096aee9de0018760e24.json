        "Firstly, you know this year the weather is too hot in Yangon, and as my parents are too old to take the hot weather so I decided to go to Kalaw so that they can be comfortable living there. And you know what, they love to stay there now despite the fact that they are sometimes missing their home in Yangon.",
        "Secondly, the place where we live is on the mountainside and we have a big garden. It is located near the monastery and weekly wet market too. In the morning, there are many street hawkers who come and sell fresh milk, fresh meat and fresh vegetables. Their homemade breakfast snacks are very delicious too. Not only that you can never forget their local cuisines and delicacies.",
        "Since you can have 12-day annual leaves every year, why not you come and see me in Kalaw? I can only say that you can get a lifetime experience and food that you never have  before.",
        "Please ensure to come and give me a call.",
