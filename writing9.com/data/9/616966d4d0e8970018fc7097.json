        "Hope you are fine; I want to inform you that I recently moved to a new locality in Wapda Town. As the town is gated with a security facility I am quite relaxed to move here.",
        "As you know, I am very conscious about dwelling security because my family lives alone during my outstation stay. So, I was in search of a house which should be situated in a gated society with security guards. Finally, I got home with such facilities.",
        "House is bigger than the old one, there is a separate parking slot for guests. Market, hospital and school are within  walking distance. My wife and kids like it too much as they can reach school earlier by foot without traffic hazards.",
        "I hereby invite you and your family  this coming Sunday to have lunch and visit my new house. I shall be very glad, if you can bring your parents to dinner because your mother is an interior designer, maybe she can suggest some tips for decoration to my wife.",
