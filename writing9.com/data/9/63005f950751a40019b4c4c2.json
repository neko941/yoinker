I would like to express my concern with my current accommodation arrangements. This is because my roommate's schedule is the opposite of mine.",
        "To start with, she works during evening shifts, which means, she gets back home late in the night being unintentionally very noisy. This constantly awakes me and I have become annoyed as I cannot be productive the following day. In addition, this makes it hard to keep up with my early morning studies as I must have lights on and open curtains, while she needs to sleep. This is very disruptive for both of us.",
        "Because of this, after these 3 months, I have decided that if I live by myself, it will be beneficial for my studies. I am happy to afford an ensuite single room. Although I prefer the rooms located at the end of the building, I do not mind being located at the entrance. Is it possible to change to a single ensuite room?",
