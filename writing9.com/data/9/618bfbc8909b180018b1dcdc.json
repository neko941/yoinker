        "These days, there are multiple choices of industrial meals and drink  such as fast food , cola and cookies which contain a high percentage of sugar . The consumption of these  products may lead to several health issues . Some people argue that government should make the prices of these products higher in order to demotivate consumers to eat carbohydrates. In my opinion , I completely disagree with this view and believe that there are other effective approaches to solve this problem .",
        "On the one hand , the rapid lifestyle push individuals to consume all kinds of fast feed , which  have high levels of carbohydrates . As a result , the excessive consumption of these products can lead to diverse health problems . For example , sugar has been already proven that remain the root cause of obesity and high blood pressure . Thus, if the bill of sweety feed becomes higher , consumers will be discouraged to consume this  feed, and then that is will be good for their well-being . With time , some persons still purchase these meals despite their expensive bills.",
        "On the other hand , high consumption of sweety food is only a small part of the problem. The main issue is that some people have unhealthy attitudes toward feed . An example of this is there are some individuals who still cook with a high quantity of glucose at their homes. Even if  fast food or drink which have a high level of glucose could become more expensive but they can eat it  at home, they would, most likely, still have the same probability to get some well-being troubles .",
        "In conclusion , despite that making the prices of feed and drink that contain a high quantity of carbohydrates can demotivate people to consume it in some cases  , this method remains not effective enough to solve the problem  because they can cook with sugar at their home and they still have the chances to get some diseases ."
