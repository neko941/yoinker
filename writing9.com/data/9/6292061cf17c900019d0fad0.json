        "I am writing this letter for my positive and negative feedback on the previous day in your hotel for our company's all-day meeting.",
        "We really liked the location of your hotel, it's nearby a park and not far away from our office, we went  there by bus and enjoyed the view along the way. Inside the hotel, the environment and facilities were perfect, and the rooftop pool was our favourite. Most importantly, the meeting room was very spacious and sound-proofing, and the sound quality of the equipment was great, everybody could hear others clearly during the meeting.",
        "Unfortunately, there are some complaints regarding the food for lunch. It was supposed to be serving warm meals, but many people said their food was cold. Moreover, the vegetables and fruits were not fresh,and  a few colleagues of mine had stomachs after lunch which affected their performance during the afternoon meeting.",
        "I suggest the hotel management can look into this seriously, there should be stricter supervision in the kitchen, hiring better cookers if necessary. If the problem is caused by food suppliers, you can contact our company to switch suppliers as we are specialized in supply chain management.",
        "Yours Sincerely,",
        "Junpeng."
