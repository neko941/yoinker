        "Dear Principal,",
        "I am excited to write this letter as I would like to attend a business management 6 months course at ABC college in London.",
        "Firstly, I did my full-time graduation course in commerce and taxation with distinction marks from a reputed university in Hyderabad. Soon after my bachelor's, I got an opportunity to work with a mind-blowing company in the pharma industry where I obtained multi-skilled in planning and executing the task. In addition, I have also attended a few seminar classes on the best management topics throughout the course. Last but not the least, gaining profound experience in business management consulting is the value added to my profile.",
        "As you know  ABC college is the best institution among the top 10 world-class colleges. This is known for  advanced topics and well-exhibited centre for all categories in  leadership presentations. On the other hand, this is very close in proximity to the city bus stand and other transit points and I am sure that this would be the best option which I selected now.",
