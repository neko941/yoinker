        "Dual-income families have become a norm in today's society. While children are expected to benefit from their parent's extra funding, there are more compelling reasons why they would as well feel the lack of care resulting from their parent's absence. In my view, I believe that every child should be given an equal proportion of monetary support and parental love.",
        "On the one hand, more budget to spend on the future generation would mean that they will receive a better education from the beginning. As an example, in more affluent households, toddlers can be sent to international preschools, in which they can have early exposure to English and a more sophisticated educational system. The premium facilities of these schools make it cost much more than the normal \u001dcounterpart, however, are proved to be advantageous to the development of academic quality and English proficiency. As a result, it is often advised to earn more money to give children a preparation of prime quality for their future.",
        "On the other hand, doing more work to earn income also means that the time spent with children is kept to a minimum. This would lead to the lack of direct support and concern from parents, which is not ideal for the healthy growth of a child. For example, fathers who are expatriate workers, although can bring a lot of earnings to their home, can hardly be available for important family events, which would likely give the younger members an inferior complex when \bcomparing themselves with other families. The intimacy from family is fundamental in building confidence in a child, \u001dthus, the presence of parents in their son or daughter's childhood is of great spiritual importance to them.",
        "In conclusion, in order for young people to flourish holistically, \u001dthey should be able to obtain both material and mental support from their parents. Therefore, fathers and mothers have to balance work time and quality time with their kids to ensure this."
