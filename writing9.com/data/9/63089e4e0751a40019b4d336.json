        "In the contemporary epoch, there is irrefutable debate among folks regarding the ready-made food trend culture across the globe. In this discourse, I am going to canvass the stated theme and elucidate copious motives and then interpret why I reckon that it is an affirmative or cynical initiative in the forthcoming paragraphs.",
        "To begin with, the first notion, there is a bountiful judicious use of available resources to us. The most preponderant is that manifestly, we can save a lot of time with the help of processed stuff and stored items in the market instead of cooking on daily basis. for instance, in a recent report, it emerged that European countries imposed a strategy to maximize the utilization of instant eatable nutrients by cultivating their nations and this trend has diffused across the globe. In addition to this, there are numerous other upsides in a plethora of domains and societies. Needless to say, all these merits stand out in good stead, as far as augmenting prosperity and excellence is concerned.",
        "On the other hand, another pivotal factor is that it is only likely that companies use additives to preserve the refreshments for a long time and add different colour flavours to attract  customers. Furthermore, these chemicals deteriorate people's health conditions. Besides, mainly it affects children's metabolism and mental and physical state. to cite an example, according to research findings, around 80% of the edible factories received notice from the government to stop using preservatives. However, the positive points are undeniable compared to the flaws.",
        "In a nutshell, according to the forenamed wrangles, I would like to restate my vista that the fruitful vantages of immediate meals are indeed too terrific to neglect the torment in the technological era. Hereby, it is an affirmative tendency."
