        "Dear Mr Hofstadter,",
        "I am writing this letter to bring to your attention a matter that concerns the well being of the students and the reputation of our respected institution. As you know our college students are increasing day by day, there are not enough sports and recreational facilities for us. This seems very inconvenient as we need to feel relaxed after long periods of study.",
        "I would like to suggest that you direct the relevant people to improve the situation by building at least 2 additional gym buildings, including a tennis court and a basketball section. In addition to this, I would also recommend that you sanction an extra leisure centre including a library and a swimming pool.",
        "As a student leader, I would like to request a meeting on the same issue. In the meantime, please assure the students that our demands will be met.",
        "I thank you in anticipation and look forward to a positive response.",
        "Kind Regards.",
