        "Dear Armin,",
        "I hope you are doing well. Thank you so much for all the support you have given me while applying to the university. I will land in London on the 8th of October ,and I would appreciate it if you advise me on my concerns about finding a part-time job while studying.",
        "My schedule for the first semester is quite hectic. I had to take more classes due to the change in my field of study. There are, however, some vacancies in the mornings and I do not need those hours to study cause studying at night is more suitable for me.",
        "As I told you earlier, I am eagerly looking forward to getting a part-time job in my leisure time. It would help me enormously in monetary matters leading to a stress-free education.",
        "Since you have particularly experienced this situation, and you succeeded in getting a job with flexible shifts and a noticeable salary, I was wondering if it is convenient for you to put me forward for your company vacancies. It would also be pleasant for me to have a chance to work with my brilliant friend.",
        "That would be a kindness beyond my imagination ,and I thank god for having an amazing friend like you. I really appreciate your help. Convey my regards to your parents.",
