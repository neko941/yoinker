        "The point is that the project that I am accounting for started slowing down and there is a huge possibility that we will not be able to roll out our part of the software before the deadline. I have already pulled out all the stops  but seems like it is not enough. The bottom line is my team is suffering from a lack of experience, so I will need to put in some extra time and cancel all of my personal activities.",
        "I am really sorry if you need to adjust your plans because of all of this. However, I hope that I will deal with all of the occurred problems by the end of the next month. If it works for you, let's shift our meeting to the beginning of August.",
