        "There is no doubt that these days many countries promote tourism. While it is sometimes thought that this development has  positives to the economy  of the place, others believe that  this can bring numerous demerits as well. In my opinion, I firmly consider this has more benefits  than negatives.",
        "On the one hand, supporters of the world tourism argue that, by attracting, a huge number of foreigners  would flourish the local financial status. In other words, these visitors often purchase traditional artefacts and stay in hotels, which would provide plenty of job opportunities for the youth. Eventually, this money exchange could improve the status of the entire nation. For example, In Thailand, they have a fast-growing economy due to this industry.  Therefore, it is clear that holidaymakers would change the DP of a country in a positive manner.",
        "On the other hand, opponents of the above- mentioned argument feel that  since foreigners visit the place, the natives may try to follow  the western culture, slowly the uniqueness the  land its traditions could be tarnished. Similarly, most of the historical buildings and art galleries did not build to accommodate a large volume of  visitors. Due to this,  the area can be polluted and may experience wear and tear. For instance, The Taj Mahal, one of the world wonders, is  highly polluted by irresponsible viewers and the loss is huge.",
        "In conclusion, people have  a different opinion regarding whether allowing the growth of the tourism industry is good or bad. In my view, even though there are some problems that can be emerged, the benefits are countless. If this business is adopted by  other poverty-stricken nations, could make a huge leap in their financial status."
