Surprisingly, the good news is that one of my ex-colleagues in a brokerage has a vacancy in her team. the position is trading in an island\u2019s trade centre in Iran additionally it involves some extra tasks like branch\u2019s financial issues, like paying branch\u2019s taxes or having some meeting with companies too.",
        "I thought it would be a great opportunity for you because you wanted to work in the financial market of Iran as well as living a quiet place so it would be a great alternative for you to make a progress in your position. Above all them, you have the international trading certificate which the company emphasized to add to their requirements.",
