        "I am writing this letter regarding the airdrome that you are aiming to build in my region in the upcoming months. Moreover, the citizens of my town demanded from me to deliver their votes and to represent them in front of our city council which its performance have been notable since it was elected.",
        "As a matter of fact, I was watching the news on television where the government represented their plans to the congress which approved the construction works to be released on the 1st of June 2022. Furthermore, there is a variety of social media platforms such as YouTube and Facebook where the public is debating this particular topic.",
        "In fact, building a modern airport in our countryside will have unpleasant consequences on the local scenery which is considered the prime attraction for the tourists. In addition to that, since our region represents a natural habitat for plenty of species, it is highly recommended to avoid projects that will create both noise and air pollution.",
        "Therefore, I would suggest that our local authority takes a wise decision to execute this airstrip in another area with more potentials and benefits to our economy. Additionally, I will send you my proposition for the most convenient location in a detailed document including studies, statistics and drawings for this future facility.",
        "Your prompt action is highly required.",
        "Faithfully yours,",
