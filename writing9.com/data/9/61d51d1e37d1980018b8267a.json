        "Dear Dave ,",
        "I just received your letter yesterday and I am glad to hear that you are asking me for some suggestions about whether you should attend a college or grab a job . For my suggestion , I think you should join the job first instead of extending your education at this time .",
        "As I know ,even though you can pay  college fees , you can't survive your daily expenses and you will not enjoy  that . Most colleges courses are at least 3 years and it will be overloaded for you and your family .",
        "Grabbing a job is more suitable for you this time because you can get not only the working experience but also some amount of money which you can save or use for your future education .",
        "Obviously, you can't  get a well-paid job but you can find some good reputation companies .I would recommend you to work in some IT companies as a junior system engineer because this will give you both great experiences and future opportunities.",
        "I hope you will decide based on my suggestions .I'm looking forward to hearing from you .",
        "Best wishes,",
