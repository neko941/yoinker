        "Nowadays, there has commonly been a huge amount of debate regarding this matter, a certain segment of society assumes that the governments are wasting their money to organize sporting tournaments while a number of individuals think contrary. I fully agree that the general folk\u2019s needs are more vital than sporting events. This essay will elucidate my views considering this trend as an adverse advancement for the community.",
        "Firstly, to train an elite athlete, authorities hire world-class fitness trainers as well as coaches, moreover, they build various expensive playgrounds and luxury building for the players. To cite an instance, a survey was conducted was by the Discovery channel states that the U.S.A spent 50 million dollars in the last Olympic games to provide special training for their players. In addition to that, another 10 million also spent to reward the players who won medals. This wealth could be used for feeding poor persons or building shelters for the homeless crowd, and there are a plethora of individuals in the nation who are unable to feed their tummy.",
        "Secondly, sometimes these sporting events can cause tension between the two countries due to the fact that everyone desires that their country\u2019s team should be the winner of the game. To illustrate that, when there is a cricket match India vs Pakistan then the situation between these two nations gets immensely risky. Furthermore, residents of these nations start posting bad content on social media which clearly make the situation worse. Same story we can see when the FIFA football cup starts.",
        "To conclude, in my perspective, spend a country\u2019s assets on few sportspersons is not a wise thing because our priority should be to reduce the poverty but this trend swift the rate of penury in undeveloped nations."
