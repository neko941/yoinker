        "Some individuals claim that the amount of money squandered in advancing  space technology is  unjustified and they go further to say  that, it could be invested in more advantageous applications.  Personally, I strongly agree with the view since there are world regions  starving.  Albeit, these spatial researchers have their  boons. This essay will shed light on both sides of the view and provide  anecdotal evidence to prove the arguments.",
        "On the one hand,  the interplanetary technological investigation  is public funds consuming that could be utilised  in sectors like  medical,  safety, and education. For instance, recently, NASA has frittered  roughly to a quarter of the US PIB  on the perseverance mission to the planet Mar,  the equal amount  that could be used to construct 5000 medical centres throughout the world, enhancement of others, and farming all African regions.  As a result, the world folk continues  a deep famine  as the death toll  widens. Furthermore, nowadays, there is a soaring complaint about the issue.",
        "On the other hand, spatial apparatus development escalates the chance to figure out the human beings' new lifestyle. Because of the increased  devastation of the planet earth due to global warming, urgent actions are necessary to be taken  so that the human beings' specimen  could  discover the new crowd's home.  The recent research carried out by the University of Southampton pointed out that in Jupiter, there are more promising  conditions to people's normal life for example. Hence,  with the continued attempts  and more investment,  human beings could move to better conditions on one of  these planets. Moreover, it would save the earth's livings from extinction.",
        "In conclusion, notwithstanding some benefits this sort of investigation results in, the overwhelming majority of individuals on the earth are in need. Therefore, I still strongly agree with the statement. In addition, I recommend that world-ruling power resolves the internal issues rather than spending  financial resources on frivolous activities."
