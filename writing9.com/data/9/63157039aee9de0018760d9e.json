        "I am writing this email to express my dissatisfaction with the printer that I purchased in your store last week. The receipt number is #2354678 and the cost is $350.00. However, It was not working properly as I expected. After printing documents a few times, It was stopped working and showed an error on the computer's screen. I have tried to check all connections and ink colours, there were no issues at all. I was so confused and not sure what exactly the reason was.",
        "Next Thursday, I have to submit my report to my general manager and a new project for the meeting. Therefore, I need to print all documents before that day. If I do not get things done on the meeting date, it will be a big issue for me and the company in general.",
        "I hope you can understand the situation and swift resolution by sending me a new printer within 3 days.",
        "I look forward to hearing you soon. Thank you!",
