        "It has been just a long time since we've been able to catch up and meet each other. I hope you and your family members are doing well. I got your message regarding the Google IT Support course, but I was too busy to give a quick response.",
        "Let me describe the course for you. Firstly, the course has five different sections, which are an introduction to computers, the bits and bytes of a binary system, computer networking, cyber security, and the Windows operating system. Secondly, about 70% of the course could be attended online, however, you must attend at least 20% on campus. So make sure that you can meet the attendance requirements before making a decision. Finally, you have to fill out an online application and the cost is around 250 dollars and you have to pay it by card.",
        "I really recommend starting this course at the University of Georgia as it has a database of employers and they can help you secure a decent job not only in the locality but also internationally. Remember I got my first job right after finishing my exams.",
        "It would be lovely to hear from you if you have time to write.",
        "Best wishes,",
