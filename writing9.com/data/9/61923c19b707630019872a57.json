        "Hope you are doing fine.I'm so happy to know that you're coming to Hyderabad to stay with me.Unfortunately,Bangalore express is scheduled to arrive at the Nampally station at 10 in the morning and you know that I have to sign-in  the office by then,otherwise you can very well imagine my superior's reaction.",
        "What I will do is,I will pass the keys to the flat to Anitha,my neighbour.You can collect it from her and go into the flat immediately.Before going  to the office,I will arrange  breakfast and lunch from a nearby restaurant.Later, have a rest in the guest bedroom.",
        "Once you get down at the railway station,book a cab to my location.Don't take a local auto as they charge more than the normal fare.Besides,they are not a safe option to travel these days.If you're confused,call me,I will book an Uber service for you.On the way to my place,you will see the Charminar,the iconic landmark of Hyderabad,which was always on your list of must-see.",
        "It's been a long time since we met and I want to have as much fun as possible with you.After  office hours,I will take you  shopping in the city centre mall,followed by dinner at the Taj.If possible,let's catch a movie too.Hopefully,this plan shouldn't tire you out much.",
