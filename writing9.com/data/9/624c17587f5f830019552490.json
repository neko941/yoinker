        "My name is Justine Zanini. I usually frequent the mall at Metz Centre because of the abundance of wonderful restaurants and the large variety of shops. There are, however, a number of deficiencies which I think ought to be improved.",
        "To begin, I have recently noticed that the parking bays around the shopping have been replaced by new restaurants. Considering that the majority of people drive to this mall as well as myself, this causes me stress as I have to waste a great deal of time just parking! Furthermore, the food court area is really compact and cannot serve many customers because of the restaurants that had been added in the past few weeks.",
        "I suggest adding an underground carpark would be a great idea. It would increase the food court space and would attract plenty of customers during lunchtime. I understand that these problems will not be fixed overnight, but if our local newspaper allocates some extra budget, I think most of the issues I mentioned would be resolved.",
        "Thank you in advance for giving attention to my ideas.",
