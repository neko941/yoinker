        "The well-being of citizens has always sparked heated debates . Recently, numerous deputies stated that a persons' health should be under the responsibility of their own, provoking a violent backlash in society. Personally, I firmly believe that it is the onus of governments to take care of their people, due to all the taxes they pay to finance the health system.",
        "First and foremost, it is crystal clear that there is a myriad of examples of why states should pay for the care of their citizens. Firstly, employees and workers pay taxes that contribute to building new hospitals, finance medical schools and scholarships for trainee doctors. Secondly, civilians and lambda persons are surely and undoubtedly the best resource of a given country, much more than any fossils or gold mine.Furthermore, In the current epoch we are living in, numerous countries have already crossed the path to an inclusive and free national health care system. The UKs' NHS is a perfect example.",
        "In addition to that, although the expenses may be exorbitant, the worth of every single soul is much steeper. Senators argue that the costs and too much to handle, however, countries have the urge to endow people with three fundamental rights such as security, education and well-being. Moreover, it is the onus of those deputies to find the right solutions, for ,instance new laws should be enforced and implemented to force insurances to cover hospital bills.",
        "To sum up, undoubtedly new innovative solutions got to be found in order to enhance the quality of life. Consequently, every part of the society should work hand in hand with one aim, to make the life of citizens better."
