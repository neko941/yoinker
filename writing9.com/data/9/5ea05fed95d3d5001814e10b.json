        "Nowadays, the majority of mass communication influences all generations of people, especially news that is in negative view.

They usually collect the data by evaluate which news is watched or read by the large number of people. Consequently, they choose to publish the topic that people are interested. Another factor is sponsored. They need money to propel their business, thereby some content may be reported to promote their sponsors.",

The probable cause is unpleasant news often demonstrates the pictures or clips which is exciting and feel like you are watching movies. For example, the criminal news and terrorism. On the other hand, good news seems to be boring. However, it is necessary to encourage mass communication to influence people with pleasant content because it loads of benefits for every generation, such as good news of education, award nomination, health care and so on.",
