        "Dear Sandra,",
        "I hope this letter gets to you well. It has been more than 3 weeks since I moved out of Hong Kong and settled in at Melbourn. I am currently enjoying every aspect of the new environment and the whole experience had been lovely.",
        "My neighbourhood is located new the central business district. It is very accessible and only takes 15 minutes for me to get to work. There are a great number of recreation and sports facilities which you know I can\u2019t live without. I usually visit the local gym 4 times a week and have met some new friends along the way.",
        "I still need a bit of adjusting at my job. The culture and atmosphere are totally different when compared to Hong Kong. Moreover, my company here do promote work-life balance and encouraged its employees to live healthily. On my first day, all the staff was asked to do 15 minutes of stretching before we started work, which surprisingly was very new to me.",
        "I do wish for you to come and visit here. It is a lovely place with lots of things to do. I know it can be extremely cold in Toronto which makes it perfect to come over during December which is summer here.",
        "I hope to hear from you soon.",
