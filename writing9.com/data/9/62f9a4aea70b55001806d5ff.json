        "I am writing to you to give you some feedback regarding the short cookery course in making Italian food which I enrolled in the last summer. I would like to explain more about my opinion.",
        "I had an exciting experience with your course which helped me to broaden my skills in bakery and pastry. Although the course was done in a short period, I learnt a handful number of recipes for various Italian types of bread. This practical experience allowed me to start as a part-time chief in a Mediterranean restaurant and I could apply my learnings  to my career. Hence, I am very satisfied with doing that course due to its promising results and effects on my job.",
        "In addition, I would like to ask you a favour to offer workshops on Asian food courses. It will be a great chance since there are a few resources available in the city. Our restaurant is planning to introduce a new Asian menu, and your program will increase my promotion chance.",
        "Sincerely yours,",
