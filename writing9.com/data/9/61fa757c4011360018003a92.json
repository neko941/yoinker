        "It is often said that in this day and age plagiarism in academic fields is becoming a significant problem in most areas around the world. There are multiple causes for this issue . There is much that can be done to solve the problem constructively.",
        "Firstly ,one of the main causes is a noticeable reduction in some important academic  essays' validity. For example ,scientists in the past habitually used to imitate their discoveries with each other. There is no denying that ,that essays today do not have any reliability and the population in the world can not believe these kinds of discoveries. This is a common cause related to this that could create many side_effects and generate a dire situation for the population in today modern world. Therefore ,this makes it clear there are multiple issues related to plagiarism that people can not ignore.",
        "Secondly ,there are some methods that humans can exert to tackle this prominent problem.  For instance , One possible approach is protecting crucial texts in the governments' libraries and restricting access. It means that the community are not allowed to use academic  texts for individuals. Another feasible approach is overseeing a noticeable rule to exploit crucial books and discoveries by contemporary scientists such as they can not borrow these and keep them at home. This means scientists merely can study texts in the library. These solutions could solve the trouble effortlessly. As a result ,it becomes apparent apart from some bad causes the people can tackle the trouble by just thinking about ways that they can use.",
        "To summarise ,this is true that this trouble has many causes and this will not be solved quickly ,however, there is not a reason to avoid taking action. It is predicted that to co_operate all the population on the globe humans won't face these types of difficulties in the near future."
