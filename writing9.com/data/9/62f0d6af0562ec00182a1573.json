        "Nowadays, higher education is critical for both males and females. Some people would argue that tertiary education should accept equal numbers of students in every subject. Although this makes sense, as far as I am concerned, I strongly disagree with this statement as universities should ensure the enrolment of undergraduates based on their ability.",
        "First of all, undergraduates should be encouraged according to their abilities. If undergraduates start a course that they are not captivated, it will result in failure. This is not beneficial for either the college, as well as, to the candidate. For example, research suggests that females are 40% more willing to study arts compared o males. Thus, it is paramount for universities that students choose the right courses for them.",
        "Furthermore, universities tend to inaccurately choose the candidates just to be able to fill all the positions up. For instance, the University of Rio de Janeiro proposed the equality of genre acceptance in 2004. This means that during this year, they granted an equal quantity of men and women accepted in the subjects. As a result, the percentage of people who withdraw from the courses was 60%, which was significantly higher than the same period in the previous year.  Therefore, it is not beneficial to enrol students in the wrong courses.",
        "To summarize, from the statements presented below, it is inconceivable to believe that higher education should be based on equality of genre number enrolled in subjects. Despite the fact that genre equality is of supreme importance, in my opinion, society needs to ensure that women and men are free to select the subjects by their talent and capability."
