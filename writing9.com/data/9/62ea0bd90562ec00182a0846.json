        "First, I bought this camera 6 months ago with a two-year guarantee from the central branch which is located in a Hyper chain store. Some of the photos that I have taken recently have not been so clear and the contrast of them has been decreasing over the last two weeks. Moreover, this problem contribute to the rejection of my submitted reports to the magazine and none of my photographs has been published recently.",
        "Lastly, seeing that this camera is a vital part of my job consequently, I contacted you to provide me with a solution to fix the camera or replace it with a new one if the guarantee it covers. I look forward to hearing from you.",
