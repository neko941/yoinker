As you might have heard from the latest news, the volcanic eruption started approximately 50 kilometres from the country\u2019s capital city, Reykjavik, where I am now.",
        "I am safe, hardly do lava flows pose an immediate threat to people, but unfortunately, all regular flights for the next week were cancelled. Nevertheless, the government is working on organizing evacuation flights. So I hope to come home on the nearest provided plane, which is pre-planned for September 13.",
        "I am sorry for the inconvenience and will keep you updated.",
        "Yours faithfully,",
