        "I am Ravi from South city and stay close to Royal airport since 1950. I am writing this letter to express  concern and bring it to your notice against the development plan which got approved by local governments.",
        "As you know, the Royal airport is located in the central of the town covered by multiple residential flats, community parks and a few kid's play areas as well. Due to this development,  all of these facilities are going to demolish in this city which is not a good sign for our local families. In addition, every year, during summer we are going to have the biggest green festival and we may need to forget about this very soon if the proposed development plan will not get stop immediately.",
        "As this is going to impact  multiple other local developments such as kids' education and their play areas, plantation, and tourist places as well. Hence, I strongly decided not to support this airport development at any cost. It would be really good  if you can look into this matter and publish an article in a local newspaper which is the best way to increase  public awareness of this issue and may reach to next level of  government officials.",
        "I look forward to hearing your support on this issue.",
        "Yours faithfully,",
        "Lakshmi."
