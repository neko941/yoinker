        "I have been living in this apartment building for six years now, and I have always been a responsible tenant. I am especially careful to be respectful of my neighbours in this building. I would like to bring your attention to a problem I am having with one of my neighbours.",
        "Last month, Mrs Somers moved into apartment 2A, right next door to me. She enjoys listening to music late at night, often after midnight. The music is very loud and I can easily hear it in my bedroom. It makes it very difficult for me to fall asleep. I have to get up at 6:00 A.M. in order to get to work on time, so this is a serious problem for me.",
        "Since Mrs Somers is new to the building, perhaps she isn't aware of the building rules about noise at night. I wonder if you would speak to her and remind her of this. Also, maybe you could post a notice in the lobby about the noise rule for all the tenants to see.",
        "Thank you for your help.",
        "Sincerely,",
