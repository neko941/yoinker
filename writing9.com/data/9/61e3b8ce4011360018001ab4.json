        "Thanks a lot for sending me the photos. They reminded me of the great memories that we\u2019d together in Malaysia. You have a great country and I enjoyed every single moment of the journey, especially the one time when we went to  Langkawi Island. I\u2019m out of words to say how I\u2019m thrilled and thankful for everything.",
        "Sorry guys that I couldn\u2019t write to you earlier. When I got back to work, after two weeks away, I had so many things left to do, and my boss forced me to do them as soon as possible. I, also, had to prepare myself for the final exam, which took me a lot of time.",
        "Anyways, now it\u2019s your turn to come and visit my country. I bet you\u2019ve never been to a Latin American country. If you come next 5th of June, we\u2019ll have a whale of a time because of the \u201cJune Carnival\u201d. You know that Brazil has the best carnivals in the world. And, don\u2019t worry about the place to stay because my apartment has enough rooms for all of us.",
