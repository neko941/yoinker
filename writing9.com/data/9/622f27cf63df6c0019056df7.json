Therefore, if the trucks didn't come daily and were absent to collect, the rubbish became like a mountain and its sticky smell reach till our housing area. These are not only affecting to people's health but also seriously spoil our city image.",
        "I hope you will take the necessary action on this issue as soon as possible. Moreover, your waste collection management team should find out the root cause of this problem and prevent next time not to happen this kind of situation again.",
