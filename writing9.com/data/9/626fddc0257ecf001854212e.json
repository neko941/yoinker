        "There is no denying the fact that presently folks eat up non-seasonal meals owing to their availability through shopping malls and other large departmental stores. In the past, people prefer to eat locally grown vegetables and fruits that contain plenty of nutrition. I firmly believe, that owing to that trend benefits of consuming non-seasonal imported foods health concerns raises as well as environmental destruction.",
        "To begin with, today age we are dwelling in the age of global E-commerce, and owing to the fastest transportation systems countries have become closer to each other the shopping mall trend has risen recently and folks access plenty of imported and nonseasonal products there. therefore, undoubtedly great benefits for the community owing to the availability and people can enjoy it anytime although they also lead a number of concerns such raw foods are an in-stored form and carries risk factors as a result, the physical well-being of the nations depreciated and getting fat as well as the obesity. to illustrate, A recent survey indicated that people in past were more healthy and fit as compared to the present because they ate locally grown and seasonal food that contains vital minerals and vitamins that are crucial for the well-being of people. for example, coconuts are summer fruits in Thailand and contain numerous Vitamin C & D for energy but can be seen any part of the season in shopping malls",
        "on the other hand, consuming non-seasonal fruits and vegetables has a minor benefit to our health. This is because different ingredients contain different nutrition, and if local residents are able to have several cuisines cooked with other regions' ingredients, they are more likely to absorb various vitamins, which is beneficial to their physical well-being. For instance, coconuts which cannot be harvested in most of the Chinese northern cities in winter involve a massive percentage of vitamin C and D. Transporting fruits has become popular between China and Thailand, which provides the locals living in northern cities an opportunity to eat dishes with coconuts, thus making them absorb more vitamin C, enhancing their immune system",
        "finally, to sum up, according to the arguments aforementioned above undoubtedly the perks of eating non-season and packed foods contains ingredients which are hazardous leading health issues hence the advantages of consuming that cuisines turn into harmful for mankind."
