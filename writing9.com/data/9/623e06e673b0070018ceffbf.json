Firstly, I wish to see the Taj Mahal which is one of the seven wonders  of the world. Further, historic places like Amritsar, Fatehgarh Sahib and Hajoor Sahib will be suitable for travelling. In addition, it will be a good idea to recall all our childhood memories and therefore, I would go to all those locations where we had fun in our childhood.",
