        "Dear Mr James,",
        "I am writing to let you know that the internet service provided by the hotel which our annual general meeting was held was unsatisfactory. The event took place on 01 January 2021 at the Grand Hotel Colombo. Although the overall hospitality was remarkable, the meeting did not go smoothly, due to the network issues.",
        "Let me explain the situation in more detail, the was meeting was scheduled with our local staff members and several other officials from our head office in London, who were to connect via video call. However, due to the constant interruption on the internet, they were not able to take part in the discussion. Even though we informed the management about the difficulties faced, they were unable to provide a solution.",
        "I would kindly request you to make sure to check the quality of the service rendered by the hotel before confirming the venue. Further, write to the hotel about the inconvenience faced so that it will be rectified in the future.",
        "Thank you for your consideration.",
        "Yours sincerely,",
