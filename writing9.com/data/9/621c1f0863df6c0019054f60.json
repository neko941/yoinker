        "I have been a loyal customer for six years, and I have always been thankful for your decent service over the years. However, unfortunately, I had a bad experience in my recent stayed in your accommodation. Henceforth, I am writing this letter to express my dissatisfaction.",
        "I accommodated at your hotel in the last week of September, and everything was great till the extreme weather changes. Although we expected the cool weather, it was scorching, and the air conditioner didn't work well. Hence, I gave  notice to the information desk to check the cooling system, but I haven't heard back from them. Therefore, we spent a fortune buying a new air conditioner for our room.",
        "I would appreciate it if you could check your conditioner to avoid future problems. As you are aware, due to global warming, heat waves will increase in the future, and it is inevitable to protect people from heat without a cooling system. Finally, it would be very kind of you to give a full refund for the time that we spent in your place. Should you require further information, do not hesitate to contact me.",
        "I look forward to hearing from you.",
        "Yours faithfully,",
