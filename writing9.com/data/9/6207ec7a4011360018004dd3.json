        "I called the front desk, and hotel manager Mr Grey picked up the phone. He assured me that situation is under control, and the handyman is on his way to fix the heating system. Additionally, I was informed that I would receive a spa gift certificate for my troubles caused by the noisy vent.",
        "I haven't received any gift certificates to this day. I expect Mr Grey's promise to be fulfilled, and request spa gift vouchers to be sent to my email: ognjenrankovic9292(at)Gmail(com).",
        "If not, I will contact the General manager of the hotel through the contact form on the website and complain about what happened here.",
