She has also told me that she would desperately love to watch the new movie, but she couldn\u2019t purchase a ticket due to the high demand. I have contacted her, and she is excited to watch the movie with you instead of me.",
        "I am pretty sure Amy is a wonderful mate to watch this film with you as she has watched this series at least twice. Moreover, when you will have any confusion due to the storyline being related to the previous films\u2019 plots, she can explain those to you without any effort.",
