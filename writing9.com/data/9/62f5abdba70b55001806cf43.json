        "I hope this letter finds you and your husband well. I am writing this letter to reach out for help from you regarding finding a part-time job in Melbourne.",
        "The big news for me is that I have been accepted by RMIT university, and my academic classes are due to start on the 1st of September. I will study for a master\u2019s degree in professional accounting, which is a two-year program, including 16 courses.",
        "While studying for my master\u2019s degree, I would like to do a part-time job. First of all, I think having work can release my financial pressure as I am able to earn some money to support my livelihood. In addition, working in an organization not only can enrich my work experience but also enhances my social skills.",
        "I know you have been working in the financial sector in Melbourne for 3 years, so I guess you would be extremely familiar with the current situation of the local job market. I would be awfully grateful if you could refer me to your current accounting firm. However, if there is no vacancy in your firm, introducing several financial companies that you know to me is wonderful.",
        "Drop me a line to let me know your ideas about my work opportunities. I am looking forward to hearing from you.",
