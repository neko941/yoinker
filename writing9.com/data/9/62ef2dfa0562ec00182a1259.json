        "These days, applying for a credit card is very straightforward. In fact, most people use their cards for most of their spending, especially online purchases. There are several risk factors to consider when getting finance; however, I believe the advantages outweigh any possible risks. This essay outlines how the advantages of having a credit card outweigh the disadvantages.",
        "Firstly, there are some things people must be wary of when using a card to borrow money. While it is tempting  to spend large amounts on frivolous items, one must remember that the money must be paid back on time, or the interest rates will cost a fortune. For example, one might spend several thousand dollars on a new phone or computer, but interest rates can add hundreds more to the bill over time. Whatsmore, some finance companies charge unscrupulous fees and interest rates, which trap unsuspecting victims into debt traps. This can even lead to bankruptcy. Another thing to consider is the potential for theft, scams and fraud. For this reason, one's card and details must be kept safe and secure at all times!",
        "While such perils must be considered, there are also many benefits to having a credit card. For instance, one can easily make online purchases from sellers worldwide, and when you are shopping in the real world, you can simply tap and go. Additionally, you can use your card to pay for emergency expenses and pay them off in future. Whatsmore, most major lending companies have insurance to protect you from scammers and fraud. So while there are many risks, these benefits certainly make life much easier.",
        "In conclusion, though the risks are rather dire, they can be mitigated with some budgeting skills and financial education. Undeniably, the advantages we gain from having access to credit facilities outweigh the disadvantages, so with a little foresight and education, we can all enjoy the convenience minus the risk."
