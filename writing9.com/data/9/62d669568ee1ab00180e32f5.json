        "Though you already know everything about my place, still if you need anything, please don't hesitate to reach out to me through my Whatsapp. Moreover, I'll be leaving the details of the hotel, I'll be staying using, on my study desk drawer.",
        "More importantly, I wanted to share the instructions for taking care of Cavy. He goes out for a walk twice a day in the morning and evening. I had bought an extra pedigree for him, which you can find in the pantry. You need not worry about his timings for food, just make sure his food plate is always filled. Apart from it, he is really friendly and I hope you'll not be facing any difficulties with him.",
        "Another thing, my household will be coming around 10 AM every day, as she doesn't have keys, I request you to be there before her. She'll finish her tasks in an hour. Also, please instruct her to water the plants daily.",
        "Thank you again for your support.",
