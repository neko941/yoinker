        "It has been a while since I last wrote to you, how have you been? I hope you are well. Life has been a roller coaster, therefore, I could neither find the time nor the energy to do so.",
        "A lot has changed, which if I am being honest is part of the reason for this letter; I was offered a job at X Company- as the head of the design team. Amazing! Right?!",
        "You must be wondering why I have not accepted the offer yet. Well, it is simply because I am nervous. Acceptance means moving to Y City- yes the one you live in - although it would be great having you nearby, I am still wary about the entire situation. Moreover, I have never been to the city, a not sure what to expect. I am certain it is far more crowded than what I am used to, and way bigger as well. My doubts are rooted in the fear of the unknown.",
        "I need your guidance; How did you settle in? Was it hard getting adjusted to life there? Are you comfortable in the area? Is it safe? How are the rentals? So many questions are clouding my head.",
        "I am aware I have bombarded you with questions, but please bear with me; you are the only person that would have answers to my worries.",
        "Sincerely",
