        "I have been studying for an English language test for about three months now, and I noticed that my spoken English and listening skills are not good enough to sit for the exam. I have tried attending a weekend class but they barely improved. I believe that living in an English speaking country for a period would be a great help to enhance my English listening as well as speaking skills. I would think that six months is a good duration for it.",
        "For my usual duties in this office, I could work for additional hours to finish them, and I would not clock overtime for them. This is because I do not want to burden my colleagues because of my personal request. Since our work is email-based and we can access our intranet from all our offices around the globe, I believe that working from another country will not be an issue.",
        "I would greatly appreciate it if you could put up my request to the management and make necessary arrangements for me ,please. Looking forward to receiving your reply.",
        "Yours sincerely,",
