        "I am writing to draw your attention to my jacket that was left behind by me in your movie theatre. Last weekend on 31st October I had booked two tickets in hall number 5 for an evening show. Unfortunately, I had forgotten my coat in the chair.",
        "I would describe my upper so that it would be easy for you to identify. My upper coat is made of leather and is black in colour. It has hoddy attached to it and has fur which is white in colour on the inner side of the blazer.",
        "Furthermore, I can provide my seat details. My seat number was D17 and it was on the left side of the screen and was the fourth seat on Drow. I have attached my tickets to your email for your reference.",
        "I would appreciate it if you could find my tunic as it contains not only cash but also my credit cards which are very essential for me. However, I have booked tickets for the Friday show, hence I can collect my lost jacket. If you have any query please contact me on 7888529592. Thank you",
