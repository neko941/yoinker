        "It's been so long since I've heard from you, I hope you are doing well. Anyway, I am writing in response to your question about where to live during your course.",
        "Let me start by outlining the place I stayed, which was a three-bedroom apartment, only 2 blocks from the University's main entrance. Although it had a garage, there was no balcony. The bedrooms were quite spacious, as well as the living room.",
        "Prior to finding this apartment, I looked at many websites, such as Airbnb and accommodation.ca, without any success. Due to this, I would strongly recommend the student board, at the University's main hall, where students who are looking for roommates or studios available for rent around the campus are posted on a daily basis.",
        "Finally, be careful when choosing to be a roommate, as the other people living there might not be as tide as you or do not care enough about being in the university as you. In addition, if you rent a studio for yourself, check about which utilities are included and if there is any furniture available.",
        "Please let me know if you need any more help.",
        "Best regards,",
