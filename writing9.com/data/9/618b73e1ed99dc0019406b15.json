        "Dear Sir or Madam,",
        "I am Swathi Reddy, currently working as a software engineer in India. I have learned about your seminar on Ethical Hacking, scheduled to be held in Sydney, Australia in December 2021, through an advertisement in a newspaper. I am planning to attend this workshop and need some further details.",
        "The seminar schedule was not mentioned in the advert. Hence, I would like to know the duration and schedule of the workshop. I would be glad if you can also give me a brief of the program: which aspects of Ethical Hacking will be covered as part of the workshop and if there will be any hands-on or will it be just a theoretical session. Please inform me how much it would cost to book my seat. Lastly, as I will be travelling from India, I would like to know about the accommodation arrangement. Is there any living place provided by you? If not, could you please let me know of the hotels nearby along with the probable cost per night including meals?",
        "Thank you in advance for your reply. I am looking forward to attending the seminar.",
