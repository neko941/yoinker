        "As I discussed with you earlier , I have been moved to the new flat which was located nearby my university. Moving to a new location is not an easy job but I have done it without losing anything except some of my shoes.",
        "There were several reasons why I moved from my previous house to this new home . My old apartment was far from the university which I studied and limited options for transportation  as well . Although the environment was peaceful and silent , I could not order easily for my breakfast and dinner .",
        "As I told you before , my new flat was close to the university and there were several shops for my meals.Moreover , a new MRT line has been started the last couple of weeks ago and now transportation was also convenient.",
        "So, please come to my new room if you have  time in the next summer holidays . I hope you could not miss the chance .",
        "Yours sincerely ,",
