        "In the contemporary epoch, many folks have chosen careers that sustained their livelihood. In view of this, there is an irrefutable debate that people who choose to indulge in an early work path tend to be more successful than people who switch jobs. This essay would exhaustively discuss these points in the paragraphs below while I conclude with my opinion.",
        "To begin with, one major reason why I agree is that folks who get a job pronto attain employment experience. Furthermore, many individuals who engage in careers on time tend to get hands-on experience because they are exposed to the working environments early. For example, In 2009, Joe Brian a Human Resource Professional at the Central Bank of Nigeria stated that experience is a masterpiece for any career person. Undoubtedly, individuals who get employed on time have better professional paths than others.",
        "On the other hand, people who switch offices often have flexible opportunities. Going forward,  individuals who switch professions now and then are exposed to experiences around diverse sectors because they tend to learn from different places and probably earn more. For instance, we can say that a Banker who resigns to work for an Oil and Gas Firm has higher prospects for better pay and might hit the jackpot in no time. There is a popular saying \"jack of all trade and master of none, but oftentimes better than a master of one.\" Invariably, switching  jobs has lots of advantages for career satisfaction.",
        "In the nutshell, there are different perspectives on working paths to attaining success. A person who starts working early can attain satisfaction within his cause of service. However, folk who enjoy switching professions have advantages because they are explorers and they can attain great heights at any point in their lives. I would say attaining a satisfying career is not a one-way street."
