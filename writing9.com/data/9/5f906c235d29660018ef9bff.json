        "Dear Sir or Madam,",
        "I am writing to you to file a claim against my insurance scheme, as I have lost my expensive watch on a recent trip to Australia. It is a golden coloured watch from a prestigious brand called Michael Cores. This has a gold strap with diamonds fixed on the dial, and the dial is in a circle shape with 21cm as in dimensions. This is precious for me as it is a gift from my husband.",
        "I am able to recall that I was wearing it when I boarded a train from Sydney to Melbourne. However, when I reached  my destination, suddenly, I noticed that I lost it somewhere on the train. I phoned the railway department to help me to get my watch back; unfortunately, I could not.",
        "As this piece of jewellery was expensive, I have already taken an insurance rule before travelling. I would be grateful if you can look into the item description mentioned in the policy and try to settle down the claim. According to the insurance policy I have taken, I am entitled to a refund in case of any loss.",
        "I would appreciate it and will be looking forward to your response.",
        "Yours faithfully,",
