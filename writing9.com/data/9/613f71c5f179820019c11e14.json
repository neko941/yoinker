        "Some people think that becoming a successful businessman does not need knowledge from a college, as they can learn by doing in order to build necessary skills. From my point of view, I disagree with the idea. In the following paragraphs, I will explain why I think studying at schools is vital for everyone.",
        "Firstly, one should improve oneself both academic and soft skills, so learning from universities will enhance students to be knowledgeable and qualified employees. For example, CEOs have to confront several problems and issues requiring both analytics and communication skills. Therefore, CEOs who graduated from universities might have better techniques to apply in solving critical issues. Although, some might say that soft skills are difficult to teach. Hence, such abilities can improve without taking any class from intuitions.",
        "Secondly, one of the vital qualities to success is having a great connection. Additionally, participating in any programs at colleges will help students meet new people. For instance, \"Grab platform\", the most powerful mobile application in Southeast Asia, was built by a group of students from Harvard University. Co-founders met in an MBA class, and they came up with the idea of creating an innovative platform. Thus, it can be seen that networking among successful people is powerful.",
        "In conclusion, it might be true that some qualities and competencies could develop outside classrooms. Nonetheless, I firmly believe that attending classrooms or joining an academic program at institutions is the critical success factor for great leaders since they could strengthen their abilities and expand their circle of friends."
