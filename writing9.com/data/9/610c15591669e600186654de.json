        "I am writing  to inform you that  I am so happy  about the hospitality you have extended to our party which happened  last Friday at 8.00 pm.",
        "Firstly, your service  staff is so generous, their attitude towards the customers is outstanding. In addition to that, they are highly professional in their employment. On the contrary, the dinner was splendidly well. I predominantly liked the main course that included a few Indian dishes; the food was  not super spicy too.",
        "Additionally, the indoor games and disco party were marvellous. The enormous effort that your chorus team has taken to have a successful program is highly commendable. My friends and I spent most of our time at the video games that you guys had provided.",
        "Although the current facilities are so incredible in their own areas, I would suggest having a dance bar too. If you can make it happen, that could incur attracting even more customers to your place. Moreover, I prefer to have a mocktail bar too. Nonetheless, thanks a lot for arranging a spectacular party.",
        "I am looking forward to hearing from you.",
        "Yours faithfully,",
