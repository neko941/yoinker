        "Dear Ana,",
        "I\u2019ve been doing well. I was really happy to hear about your camping holiday this summer for the first time and am glad that you reached out to me for advice.",
        "I\u2019ve thought about how amazing this trip would be for you. As I\u2019m aware of your love for nature and this sounds to be a perfect opportunity to be closer to it. Besides, it would be more fun because of the adventurous games played during camping along with the campfire and music in the evening. It is the best way to feel stress-free before starting a new course.",
        "I wanted to point out a few cons as well. You can\u2019t access your internet due to reception issues in  remote areas. if you need the internet, you have to travel towards a town and access it. Although camping sounds great, sleeping in a tent can be quite uncomfortable and we will feel sleep-deprived during the day.",
        "I\u2019ve given it some thought and decided to tag along for this trip. I\u2019d be able to finish my project and be free to join  you. What do you think about this? Let me know.",
        "Can't wait to have fun times with you.",
