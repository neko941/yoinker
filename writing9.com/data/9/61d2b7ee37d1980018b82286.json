        "Dear Mr Hall,",
        "I recently saw your performance at Toronto big concert. I was really amazed by your singing methods and guitar playing. So I decided to write this letter to express my feelings about the concert along with asking about your advice on improving my own level of performing.",
        "I was so content and emotional at the same time during your part that I could not contain my excitement. What amazes me the most was that you have a very powerful voice and the moment you started singing I got goosebumps.",
        "Well, I have been playing the guitar for more or less six years. I have a long life passion for music and I want to go on a stage. I have started learning by the videos on YouTube and now I am actually teaching kids. Recently I started writing my own song and I am practising ever since. I reckon I will be able to record it in no distant future.",
        "well, as I mentioned I am a musician myself, but unfortunately, I do not have much experience in performing live and singing in public. I was wondering if you could give me some advice on increasing my self-confidence and some tips on how to learn more if that is not much of a trouble.",
        "This is all I would like to share with you. Thank you for taking the time to read this letter.",
        "Yours faithfully,"
