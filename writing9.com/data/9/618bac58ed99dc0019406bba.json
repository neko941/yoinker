My name is Farhana Jabeen and my Insurance Member Id is 02191890. My family and I travelled to the Maldives on the 22nd of October for vacation and lost a handbag containing gold jewellery, such as a necklace and a pair of earrings on the 29th of October.",

However, I did realize that my bag was missing and I believe that either it might have been genuinely lost or stolen. Therefore, I notified the regional authorities and filed an official complaint. Unfortunately, we were not able to retrieve the items.",
