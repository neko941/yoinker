        "Dear Sir,",
        "I am writing this letter after seeing a notice which was posted outside your library, in which you have asked for some opinions about improving services and facilities. I would like to give you honest feedback and some recommendations to improve.",
        "I like the ambience of the library. Light sky blue colour paint on the walls creates calm vibes in the whole area. Books of the latest edition are always available and well organized on the shelves.  I visit your library four times a week and find authentic material for my doctorate research.",
        "However, some areas are lacking and need to be fixed. I generally observe a few wooden chairs of the library are not comfortable for sitting long. Moreover ,During day time, Library has enough natural light, therefore, readers do not feel any problem in reading books but, this scenario is not similar at nighttime.Many tube lights blink unnecessary and provide low light which makes me avoid coming in the evening time.",
        "I would like to give some proposal here if you swap wooden furniture with cushion ones will make readers sit more comfortably. Also, improve lighting system by changing olds with latest LED tubes that will save electricity bills too.",
        "I hope you will consider my views and do the necessary actions.",
        "Yours Sincerely,",
