Next Friday, is going to be my birthday, so I and my friends were planning to celebrate it in my new apartment at 10 P.M,  but we are worried that the noise may disturb you and your family members. We will play music and sing some songs. We do not want to disturb your peace. That's why I decided to share my thoughts with you.",
