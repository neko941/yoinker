        "Dear Sir or Madam,",
        "I am Cole Chen, living at 5 Podmore PL, Hillsdale. This letter is about the garbage collection issue in my local area.  To begin with, you know that Hillsdale is a big citizen gathering place, and lots of food, bottles, and cupboard litter will be produced every day. But the cleaners don't come and pick up rubbish every week, thus, all the food containers in the backyard are filled up with worms. which is very disgusting and we can't bear the foul smell in the air.",
        "In addition, the faulty pick-up system has affected our living surroundings. As worms climb around the bins, we can not open the lid to throw rubbish in the bin. Moreover, the disgusting smell in the air has made us stop breathing. How terrible they are! I couldn't even open my windows at home every day.",
        "To sum up, it's too bad for our council cleaning system. Here is what the service department can do for us. Firstly, please clean up the bins on time in our community every week, so we can use empty bins. Secondly, we need a spectator to check this area every day to make sure no terrible synonymous come out.",
        "I am looking forward to your letter.",
        "Regards,",
