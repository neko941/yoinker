        "Dear Albert,",
        "I\u2019m delighted that you are coming to Singapore next month. I think it would be great if you could stay with me and my family, who send you their best wishes. Otherwise, if you prefer, I can easily book you a cheap but comfortable hotel near the beach so that you can be more independent.",
        "There are lots of things to do in my city. If I were you, I\u2019d spend some days on the beach relaxing before one or two days sightseeing in the city. There are several interesting museums and temples which I\u2019m sure you will enjoy. One place you really should visit is an excellent theme park called Sentosa, where you\u2019ll want to spend the whole day. Also, you ought to go to our excellent night safari, which is about an hour away by bus.",
        "You don\u2019t need to bring a lot of clothes because the weather is normally warm and sunny, and of course, rainy. However, in the evening it\u2019s a bit cooler, so you may need a jersey and a jacket.",
        "Please let me know exactly when you're coming so that I can meet you at the airport. It\u2019ll be great to see you again so we can get up-to-date with all our news!",
