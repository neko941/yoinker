        "Dear Mrs Bradbury,",
        "I am writing to you to tell you that I have decided to apply for a job with another company \u2013 ABC Electronics. This decision follows the announcement by management last month that the Research and Development Department here at XYZ Electronics would be scaled down and most staff moved to other departments. I have really enjoyed working here.",
        "I have learnt a lot about research and development strategies and management. My colleagues and bosses have been wonderful to work with and I have truly learnt what great teamwork can achieve. As Mr Johnson pointed out at the meeting where the announcement was made, it is only to be expected that some employees would seek other opportunities at different companies.",
        "It has been a pleasure to work with you and I hope that you will be able to provide me with a letter of reference. If you could let me have the letter by the end of this week, that would be lovely, as I have an interview scheduled with ABC Electronics at the weekend.",
        "Looking forward to hearing from you as soon as possible.",
        "Yours sincerely,",
