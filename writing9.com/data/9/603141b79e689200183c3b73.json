        "Although the toy has been described as safe and suitable for any age between six to ten, I was genuinely shocked  to open the package and find the machine had extremely sharp edges on which a child could easily cut herself. In addition, when we attempted to fly it, it proved almost impossible to control and crashed into our neighbour's greenhouse. Obviously, it would have been utterly inappropriate to give this toy to a youngster as we had planned.",
        "The product you sent us bears no resemblance to the one advertised, and we would expect to receive a full refund; therefore, we look forward to hearing from you at the earliest possible opportunity and to the swift and satisfactory resolution of this matter.",
