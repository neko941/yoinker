        "Nowadays,In some customs,most kids are told that if they want to accomplish everything in their life,they have to attempt enough.In my opinion,this wording has both benefits and drawbacks.The following cases and examples will help support my point of view.",
        "On the one hand,there are numerous advantages to telling this to children.Firstly,it can definitely motivate and activate them to try to do something the best by themselves which is required extreme ambition in order to succeed.Moreover,it implies that only they can indicate goals and achieve them.Nothing is easy to receive without endeavouring.If they endure,work or study hard and always practice,they will surely accomplish in the future.Thus,they are proud of themselves that they are able to do it.Taking Thailand as an example,most families always inform them to study hard so as to enter university.More specially,some children want to be a physician,so they have to read academic books throughout the day without relaxing because they strongly trust that if they read a lot,they will become successful.",
        "On the other hand,kids may feel that they are pressured and expected by their parents.For this reason,some children face various obstacles including stress and anxiousness which are caused by  family and society.In addition,it provides adverse impacts on children such as having problems with physical and mental health.The majority of kids misunderstand ambition and they focus on quantity more than quality and this can lead to unsuccessful goals.Therefore,teaching children to become achieved ,this message may cause some negative outcomes for them and they may lack confidence.",
        "In conclusion,encouraging kids to be successful in anything by telling them to try hard may provide both pros and cons which are based on the way adults teach them and children's attitudes.The cases and examples above have supported my point of view to the best."
