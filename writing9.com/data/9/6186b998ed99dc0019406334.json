        "I am writing this letter to request further information regarding a rental flat in Barcelona. My family and I are going to relocate to Spain due to my recent promotion at work. I am expected to start working on the 19th of May. Therefore, we should move there ten days in advance as we need a few days to get used to the new place.",
        "We prefer to reside near the beach or a coastline area since my husband is asthmatic, yet it should not be too remote from the downtown. Despite I work mostly online my husband and I are fond of films and at weekends we usually go to a cinema. Having a swimming pool nearby will be an added advantage for us.",
        "As for the flat, we would like to have a two-bedroom flat with a spacious kitchen as my hobby is cooking, one bathroom and a balcony facing  the sea. It should preferably be in a three-storey apartment building.",
        "I would appreciate a reply at your earliest convenience.",
        "Yours faithfully,",
