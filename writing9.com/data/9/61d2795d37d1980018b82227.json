        "I am writing to complain about the problem that I experienced with the swimming pool recently. This is JD, I regularly visit the recreation centre to use the pool and other facilities.",
        "The bathroom shower was not functioning properly, since my last visit on the 3rd of July 2022. In addition, it had no manual settings on the shower to release the hot water which was perfectly working before the recent repair. It is highly imperative for me to take bath in order to remove the chlorine content on my body after using the pool.",
        "I had already informed the staff member to fix the shower because it is causing a great inconvenience to people. He agreed that he would replace it with new accessories, however, it is still the same.",
        "I would like to suggest arranging a plumber to fit the  new shower as early as possible. This would prevent us from experiencing inconveniences such as this. If you would like to further discuss, please call me on my mobile. I look forward to resolving this issue without any conflict.",
