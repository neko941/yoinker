        "Let me give you the details about the party. Even though her birthday is on Sunday. It is a good idea if we will celebrate it on Saturday night from 8:00 pm onwards. The place for a meeting before we visit her dorm is in a coffee shop, then all of us will head to her flat. It will be exciting for her.",
        "Well, Although I've already ordered a cake, we should buy a gift for her for which every one of us will contribute. So bring some cash with you If possible please get the candles and matchbox, as these are not coming with cake",
