        "In less developed countries, the lack of educational provision for people in rural areas is a serious problem. While some commentators argue that the problem can be tackled by building more schools and employing more teachers, I believe that installing more computers and widening Internet connection should be the top priority.",
        "On the one hand, there are some reasons why providing more computers and a wider Internet connection can contribute to tackling the problem. Firstly, the Internet is an unlimited source of information. Thus, children can have access to distance learning courses which give them the same opportunities to study as pupils in city schools. Secondly, children can acquire IT skills by using the Internet. For example, they can learn how to use Microsoft Word or search for online information. Such skills enable them to have better employment prospects.",
        "On the other hand, I agree with those who contend that it is better to build more schools and employ more teachers. The first benefit is that teachers play a vital role in the early stages of teaching basic numeracy and literacy skills. Without them, these devices are little more than playthings. Moreover, teachers interact directly with pupils and enlighten them on the value of learning. Another benefit is that the more schools there are, the more likely the universal education is. Therefore, this can raise the level of education in remote rural areas.",
        "In conclusion, while providing computers and internet access for remote areas is beneficial to some extent, It seems to me that it is better to construct more schools and hire more teachers."
