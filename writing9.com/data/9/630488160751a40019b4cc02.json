        "Due to the higher demands of fossil fuels, a certain segment of individuals argues that we must explore the untouched destinations of the earth in search of energy sources. Though there is a number of supporters of this affirmation, I stand against this and the following paragraphs of this essay will analyze two factors which contribute to my opinion.",
        "To begin with, exploring virgin territories may outcome to double the environmental pollution. As a result of the complex mechanisms that we use to extract oil from the fossils, we have already created a number of problems in nature. For example, a recent documentary programme which was telecasted on the Discovery Channel  revealed about an American oil pump resulting in to increase in the temperature in the sea waters, and now it has an effect melting down the glaciers at the North pole. Hence, if we use the existing technologies  to explore  untouched destinations, that will definitely outcome in polluting  nature.",
        "Secondly, these invasions will destroy the unidentified creatures who live in these areas. For instance, there was a report in the international media, about a hydropower plant, in  Mexico that resulted in the destruction of a number of indigenous creatures who lived around that area. If it can happen in  Mexico, there is no doubt that it will not happen in the alien soils. Therefore, we must not consider exploring these grounds for sake of our future generations.",
        "To conclude, I reiterate that we must not destroy unexplored areas in searching for fuel as it will result to double the environmental pollution and  the extinction of unknown animals. Instead of doing these, we must put our efforts to find more alternative eco-friendly energy sources to protect our mother nature."
