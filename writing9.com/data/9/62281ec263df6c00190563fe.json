        "My name is Naomi Umami. I am a student living in the college dormitory room number 255.  I am writing this letter to bring your attention to the problem I am currently having with my roommate.",
        "To begin with, I share my room with another student and she keeps countless numbers of insects and lizards in the room.  She keeps them in cages most of the time, but some of the lizards occasionally free themselves out of the cages.  I can not tolerate waking up in the morning finding a lizard sitting next to my pillow. On top of that, the noises and the bad smell distracts me from studying.  Because of this problem, I am having sleep disorders and this will hugely impact my grade.",
        "I would really appreciate it if you could arrange me in another room.  I would prefer to share the room with someone who has no pets and is more considerate to others.",
        "Thank you for your consideration.  I look forward to hearing from you soon.",
        "Yours sincerely,",
