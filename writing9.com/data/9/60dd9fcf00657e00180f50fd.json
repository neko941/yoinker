        "Different people have different views on choosing their companions .In this context,a set of people believe that it is beneficial to have friends whose ideas match with theirs,whereas,others opine that having friends who do not agree with them a few times is better.I am more inclined towards the latter view.This essay would discuss both views and elaborate on my opinion.",
        "On one hand, the wide said reason for the belief to have companions of the same mindset is that they can interact easily and share similar interests.As a result , their friendship will last long and thus the bond becomes unbreakable.For example, it is easy for the same type of individuals to get along long many things.This is because they will have no point of discussion on any topics.",
        "On the other hand,  a set of individuals feel that having buddies who differ with them if they are wrong in some matters is better.They opine that these types of folks are their real well-wishers and stand by them in any kind of situation.Additionally, they can never feel insecure in these companionships.For instance, we depend on folks when we have to take a critical decision,so, we need folks who can analyse the right and wrongs and help us.So, instead of simply following us ,they should guide us well.All these reasons make me believe this opinion is worthy.",
        "To conclude, although both the views have their own explanations,I see more valuable points in the latter view  .Hence, I accept that having individuals who differ with us at some times is beneficial."
