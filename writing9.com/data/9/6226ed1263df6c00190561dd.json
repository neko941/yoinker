        "Dear Mr and Mrs Smith,",
        "I am writing this letter to express my interest in the position of language tutor, which was advertised in \"Kyoto Times\" on 2 March 2022.  I believe my qualifications, personal character and work experience makes me a perfect candidate for this job.",
        "I am currently studying at Kyoto University in Japan, majoring in undergraduate linguistics and will be graduating in 2024.  I have been working as a language tutor for foreign students who are studying in Kyoto for over 2 years.  Therefore, I am fully aware of how people learn the Japanese language and what are the difficulties.  On top of that, I am planning to study in Australia for a year, starting April 2022 to May 2023.",
        "While my classes will be held on weekdays, I will be available on weekends.  I can also teach them how to play the piano and some basic knowledge of programming, as these are some of my hobbies.",
        "I am available for an interview at your earliest convenience online. I look forward to hearing from you.",
        "Yours sincerely,",
