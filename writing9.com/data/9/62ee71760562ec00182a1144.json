        "I hope you are well and I would like to inform you all about a weekly magazine that I read  last week in Australia. It was an advertisement for a vacancy to look after a six-year-old child and I am interested to apply for this job.",
        "To be more precise, there are many reasons why I would like to choose this job. Firstly, I don\u2019t need to worry about my accommodation fees as I am allowed to stay with them for six months. Moreover, I have a passion for caring for children and even I could look after  my younger sisters when I was in child. Taking care of children is not difficult for me because I was used to being babysat since I was in childhood and I know how to treat a child and be patient.",
        "Therefore, as above mentioned, I am of the view that this role suits me to live and work in Australia. Besides, I can get two days off  every weekend and learn both sewings which is one of my passion and French on my holidays to increase my skills while I am  here.",
