        "I am writing to ask you for some information that will help me make a decision. I have recently been offered a job in Seattle. I am very much interested in the job, but, as you know, I have never even visited Seattle. I am not sure whether I would like to live there. Since you have lived there for a while, I thought you could answer some questions for me.",
        "One thing I am worried about is the weather. I have heard that it rains in Seattle all the time. Is this true? It sounds very depressing. I have also heard that Seattle is a growing city, and I am afraid it would feel very crowded to me. I have never lived in a big city before. Another thing I wonder about is leisure activities. I like going out dancing a lot. Are there good places to go dancing in Seattle? What about music? I would not want to live in a place where I could not go to concerts frequently.",
        "Another important issue is housing. I have heard that Seattle is very expensive. Is it hard to find a nice apartment at a reasonable rent? What neighbourhoods would you recommend?",
        "I appreciate your taking the time to answer my questions, and I look forward to hearing from you. If I decide to accept the job in Seattle, then I hope we will be able to get together frequently.",
