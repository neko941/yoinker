        "In the contemporary era, the individual's privacy is being opened up because the newspapers have published every minor detail.Thus, it is often argued that the authority should outlaw the publication of futile information, whereas there still remain some disagreement in this view. From my perspective, the journal should focus on the indispensable news instead of disturbing another person's personal space.This essay will highlight both opinions and also elaborate the need of controlling the irrelevant news.",
        "On the one hand, these days,  the news reporters are only concerned about the profit margins because of that they publish the information regarding the private growth of the public rather than the authentic news. Hence, the legislator ought to control the redundant information by enacting strict rules and regulations. Similarly, the journalist will be emboldened to publish the current issue. To illustrate, if the newspaper upload the news regarding the rape, murder,  terrorist attacks, the general public will be aware. As a result, the crime rate would be eliminated from the globe.",
        "On the other hand, though the magazines play a significant role in individuals everyday life, it is often published the activities  of individuals' private life, especially, the activity  of the eminent personalities.This is because the teenagers consider them as a role model.
