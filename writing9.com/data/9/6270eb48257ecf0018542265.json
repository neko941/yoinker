What makes the matter worse is that  they do not go back and sleep in this small room altogether. My place is not spick and span anymore and filled up with their food waste.",
        "Normally , I am not the kind of person who pesters my problems . However , I can not tolerate this situation anymore as my exam is nearer and I am trying to pass it with flying colours. Due to their noise , I could not get a decent sleep almost every night , so , it literally affects my concentration level.",
        "It would be very nice if you arrange  a single room for the rest of my stay . I am completely comfortable whether the area is big or not.My point is that I do not want to get any distractions.",
