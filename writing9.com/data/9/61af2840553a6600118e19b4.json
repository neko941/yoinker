        "In this day and age, due to the proliferation of technology, the approach most people communicate with each other has been innovative, which seems to be an increasingly common trend in many parts of the world. From my perspective, the merits would eclipse the downsides.",
        "Admittedly, this trend should be plausible because it could inflict a number of detrimental impacts. Initially, the dominant drawback would be that the advancements in technology may contribute to isolating people and discouraging real interactions, which could act as the catalyst for poor virtual relationships. For instance, nowadays, many youngsters making friends online is dramatically increasing and this could pave the way for the fact that they can be taken advantage of to do bad behaviours. However, technology may be indispensable for us to contact each other regardless of long distances. To demonstrate, several apps, namely Skype, discord let alone zoom, are able to provide us with the virtual class that help us save lots of time.",
        "On the other hand, technology has been having a large influence on our relationships. First and foremost, the overriding merit is that we can make new friends and write blogs about our life by means of several social networks, including Facebook or Instagram. It is because we can release tension after a strenuous day. Furthermore, another compelling factor would be that social network is able to  maintain our distant relationships effectively. In fact, we can communicate with each other on the move or browse their old acquaintances on a digital platform.",
        "The conclusion to be drawn is that although the favourable aspects of this phenomenon are of paramount significance, as important as it may seem, its unfavourable aspects should not be overlooked and underestimated."
