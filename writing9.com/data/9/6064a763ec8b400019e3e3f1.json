        "Many people think that you have to speak another language if you live in an abroad nation and it has many sociological and practical issues . I totally agree with this notion because foreigners have different languages , lifestyles  , cultures and working patterns . This essay explains what are the social and practical problems which are faced by them , followed by a reasoned conclusion.",
        "Living in another country has some social challenges . Firstly , they feel isolated from foreign people because they have a different lifestyle than us . So Initial 6 month to one year they  face more problems during settling in other states . For instance , many Indian people migrated to Canada , Australia and America , so they have to be fluent in the English language as well as they have to adapt their culture by joining their communities , take part in social activities and so on . In the initial ,days they do not understand their importance and they confuse about it . Furthermore , they might  change eating habits that are less spicy , although nutritious  .",
        "Moreover , it has some practical problems like many  changes in their lifestyles . In other words , foreigners are more punctual , strict at colleges or workplace , also must obey rules and regulations of their country.  To illustrate this , they have to do more struggle to  adjust in foreign life such as use public transport because private vehicles are expensive , do part-time job as a side income , do all work on time , always talk with respects , do not make a loud noise , etc . All of these issues make their difficult life .",
        "To conclude , I strongly agree with this fact that living in a foreign country brings many challenges in one lifelike speak in abroad words , face many  social and practical issues."
