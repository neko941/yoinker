        "I really wish that all of you are in good spirits. I received your letter yesterday post my x-ray examination and I am still delighted to this day at the get-well-soon greeting card you sent along with some of my favourite sweets and chocolates.",
        "For starters, I am recovering quite well and my doctor, Ms Anna, suggested that I may be relieved within a few days since my reports came out to be positive. Speaking of which, I mostly spend my time in the ward assigned to me where I have a personal television to watch some of the cartoons I enjoy. What's more, just yesterday, my mother brought me a pile of comic books to savour and kill time as it gets really boring here.",
        "To talk about food, I think I just don't like what the hospital cooks for its patience normally. Mostly, my dad gets me something to eat from either the cafeteria or nearby restaurants. Anyway, as I mentioned earlier in this letter, I am to be discharged by the mid of next week if everything goes as planned.",
        "I will keep all of you posted surely. I hope you see you soon.",
