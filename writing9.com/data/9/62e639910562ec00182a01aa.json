        "You, my dear friend, will have the time of your life, as you are a loner since always. For an explorer and nature admirer like you, camping will be a novel and hell of an experience. The place you have selected to put your camp on  is quite a scenery and loaded with birds and small wild animals of a diverse number of species. I appreciate your taste girl!",
        "I have heard that despite  all the good camping site qualities, this place is devoid of any nearby hospitals, which might become a need  in case of any emergency. Moreover, there is no gas station or grocery store in sight as of my information. So, you will face some difficulties regarding these petty things, if not organized and prepared well. Think of all the situations pre hand.",
        "And of ,course you should not be forgetting this bestie of yours to come with you and enjoy  as well. I might come in handy in preparing meals and doing barbeque. So, don\u2019t forget to write me back about the trip.",
