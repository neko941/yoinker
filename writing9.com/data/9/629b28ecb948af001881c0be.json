        "I am writing to you regarding your performance at a recent concert in Jodhpur townhall on 20th of May. First and foremost, I would like to mention I absolutely loved your performance and feel it was the best performance at the concert, what I liked most about your singing is how effortlessly you switched between high and low notes. In addition to that, your voice is one of the sweetest and most soothing ones that I have ever heard.",
        "Being a music enthusiast since childhood, I have been taking singing classes after school for the last few years and recently I have also developed my interest in playing the guitar. I am planning on pursuing an education in music after high school.",
        "It would be very helpful to me if you could recommend the colleges that I should consider applying to after high school to grow into a better singer. I look forward to hearing your suggestions.",
        "Yours sincerely",
