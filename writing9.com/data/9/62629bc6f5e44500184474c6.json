        "Firstly, hope this letter finds you well. I am Simhachalam Gouroju, one of your college's 3rd-year graduate students and currently pursuing a diploma course in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science.",
        "I am writing this letter to inform you that I could not complete the project on or before the given timeline, due to unavoidable circumstances as my maternal grandfather passed away a couple of weeks ago, due to a heart attack. Even though he was healthy, all of a sudden it happened. Because of his unexpected demise, my mother got hospitalized as she could not take it. I do not have anyone to take care of her at the hospital. Therefore, I had to stay with her until she becomes normal.",
        "As a result of all these, I could not focus on the project much and ended up missing the timeline. I have completed 85% of it already, and if you could please give me a week time more, I will complete it 100% and submit it to you for review.",
        "I hope you will understand my situation. I will be looking forward to hearing from you.",
