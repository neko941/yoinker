        "It is predicted that in the near future people will stop using printed books and newspapers and just use the internet instead. At the present time, we can see that there is a significant growth in the number of people using the internet to read. In my opinion, in the future, we read everything we need on the internet. In this essay, the reasons for this statement will be discussed.",
        "To begin with, the usage of paper-based products such as books and newspapers damages the environment. For instance, logging trees is a necessary step in the production of papers in order to use them in books and newspapers. In this case, with the higher demand for paper-based commodities, logging more trees will be necessary. Moreover, paper is a combustible material that can be dangerous to the environment . Therefore, higher demand for paper-based products can harm the climate.",
        "Finally, digital services have lower prices than physical ones because they are easy and cheap to produce and also marketing them will be very convenient. To illustrate this, the vast majority of people use computers for different purposes and by purchasing digital books and newspapers, they will not have to wait to receive them and they do not need to go out of their house. In addition, marketing books are costly and businesses might need to add them to the final price. Thus, digital books  are more convenient for people.",
        "To conclude, It is believed that in the future society will tend to read everything online. In my view, this notion is accurate. Given the current circumstances, it is recommended to involve governments to fight the spread of misinformation."
