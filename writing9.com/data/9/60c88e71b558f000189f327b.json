        "Hope things are fine at your end. I am really excited to share this news with you. I have shifted to a new apartment in Etobicoke. It has been 3 days since I moved from downtown, Toronto and I am thrilled to let you know about my new place.",
        "So it actually is on the 23rd floor of Valhalla inn apartments. It is a 2 BHK apartment, fully furnished and with all amenities. I love the modular kitchen, it is easy to clean every time the kitchen gets dirty. The supermarket is only a 2-minute walk from my place and there is a park for kids next to my building. I was surprised to see a library on the corner of my street, as you know I am a book lover. I must mention the Italian restaurants in my neighbourhood.I just can't wait to take you there for I heard they have 60+ varieties of pizza.",
        "You must now be knowing how excited I am to reside in this place. I am hoping to see you around sometime, probably over the weekend. You can spend a night with me and we can have a gala.",
        "Looking forward to seeing you soon.",
        "Kind regards,",
