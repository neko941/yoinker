        "Dear Shital,",
        "I am Sandy, living at 962 West East Apartments in unit number 110 for the past two years with my family. We signed the lease for two years in August 2020 with Mr Rob who was the manager at your company at that time.",
        "Actually, the lease contract between us and your organisation is about to expire in the coming two months, so I want to request you to extend the contract for another year as this location is very convenient for us, my workplace is within a walking distance. Moreover, all the shopping centres are also within walking distance which makes me live in the same house.",
        "In addition to this, I and my husband are working 6 days a week, so it will become very hectic for us to find and move into another suitable apartment. But, I want to change the main door lock before signing a new lease as sometimes the key stocks in the lock. And if possible please clean the vents as well because sometimes we feel suffocated at night because of improper ventilation of air.",
        "I hope you will consider my request and write back to me soon. Kindly let me know if you need any documents from me.",
        "I am looking forward to hearing from you.",
        "Yours faithfully,",
        "Sandy."
