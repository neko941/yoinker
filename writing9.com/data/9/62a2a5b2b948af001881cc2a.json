I\u2019ll start my journey on 22nd June 2022 from Trivandrum to Switzerland on an Air India flight a tour conducted by the company as a thankful for my work commitment.",
        "I had kept my keys for the front grill door on the car porch beside the overhanging slab to enter inside. After,that you will find a fish tank on your left side where you\u2019ll find the keys for my main door by which you can enter the home. However, the door keys for inside rooms are kept in a prayer room which you\u2019ll spot on your straight-ahead corridor after entering through the main area.",
        "I would like you to help me in doing two things while am leaving on my travel period. Firstly, please feed up the fish on daily basis every evening for them to stay alive. Secondly, you\u2019ll find a plethora of plants kept outside beside the car parking which need to be watered every morning. I\u2019d be really grateful if you could do the above mentioned on time till we meet after my vacation.",
