        "Dear Sir or Madam,",
        "I am writing this letter to draw your attention to the article that was released in your travel magazine this week about Hyderabad which is incorrect. The article stated that this town does not have restaurants that offer international food and the main focus is local food. However, it is completely untrue as this town is considered as one of the best in terms of providing a variety of cuisines.",
        "It is crucial for a travel magazine to verify the data before making it public as this gives false information to the entire world and impacts tourism. While it might appear like a small issue considering the size of the piece but it has to be addressed and rectified as this magazine is read by people all over the world.",
        "I would really appreciate it if you could release an updated piece mentioning the correct details and apologizing to the public for providing false knowledge. I really hope that you will be able to resolve this situation at the earliest to everyone\u2019 satisfaction.",
