        "Dear Sir  ,",
        "I recently attended the Blue Heavens rock concert in Gurgaon where you were performing. I had always heard so much about your performance from people around that wanted to see it myself live. I must admit , loved every bit of your staging. Though it was my first time to see you perform but have become a huge fan since then.",
        "Since the show, I have been listening to all your covers on repeat and watching all your previous acts. I totally adore how you mix Indian music forms with  rock music , it's the best fusion I have ever heard. I myself am a singer with a small band in Chandigarh called Garaj and often play fusion on my guitar. We perform at a club every Friday and during the weekly jam at the clubhouse.Your work really inspires me and want to learn so much from you.",
        "Would like to meet you personally someday but I am sure with your packed schedule of tours around the world it's a far fetched dream.However ,I have a request  if we could connect over a video call and you could guide me over some fusion techniques and how I could refine my act around it .",
        "Hoping to get some insights from you on blending and hearing back soon .",
        "Regards ,",
