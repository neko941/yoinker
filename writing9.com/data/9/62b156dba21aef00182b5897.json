        "living things are creatures that have the right to live peacefully in their habitats. since God creates the environment that they fit in so it is unfair to treat them without mercy. I strongly disagree with people who mistreat living things in general and ignore their life. In this essay, I will discuss some reasons that support my point of view.",
        "First of all, animals have a very huge impact on our lives and on the surrounded environments. For instance, cows and sheep provide humankind with daily supplies of food as diary products. And this supports peoples' health and growth. Besides, taking these products from these kinds of animals will not harm their sustainabIlity. In the contrast, this will enhance their productivity. As a human, we can use animals to the extent that will not harm them.",
        "Furthermore, it is widely known that animal species create a balance in natural conditions. For example, wildlife although it threatens humankind sometimes it is essential to keep planet Earth healthy and suitable for the public. Even tiny creatures like insects or misqetuo build very strong circumstances regarding the natural atmosphere. So, protecting these creatures will help in saving our shelter.",
        "To conclude, if we think of the benefits of animals and the influence that they cause in our life we will think many times before making any wrong decision regarding animals' sustainability. Yes, we as humans have the authority over other creatures but there is no excuse to treat them badly. We can use them for our benefit but not to the extent of harming the environment."
