        "Dear Sir or Madam,",
        "I'm writing this letter because I have seen a vacancy announcement on the internet. I have a passion for working with this kind of job about art, culture or tradition. So I would like to perform for this museum and I'm hoping you give me the opportunity to the industry at the museum.",
        "With an educational background in Thai Nguyen University with a huge history of Great President Ho Chi Minh, I believe that I can fit any position that the director wants to hire. I have been fascinated by history or traditional culture. Regarding my skills, I have good computer skills and I also know how to draw or design. I can talk 3 languages fluently such as English, Chinese and Japanese. Using my college experience, I can certainly do anything to make the museum always attractive to visitors. For instance, I can help the museum decorate some special things or I'm able to organize events. So if you choose to hire me I will become a hard work voluntarily, and I will help the museum add more value in the future.",
        "If you agree, I am available to trial in the morning and a full week. I can start the task right away.",
        "I hope you will consider my application. I look forward to seeing your response from the director at the museum.",
        "Yours sincerely,",
