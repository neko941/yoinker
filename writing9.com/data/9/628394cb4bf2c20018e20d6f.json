        "Hi Bob,",
        "First of all, I welcome you to our town. I am writing to know if you want to join me in going gym together.",
        "I go to a gym named Planet Fitness. It has many branches in the world. We have 2 branches within our town. In spite of having 2 branches, they are thinking to open a third branch. It is so big that it can accommodate 100 people at a particular time. Thus, allowing multiple individuals to exercise at the same time. They have every kind of equipment like bench press, dumbells, cycles, treadmill etc.",
        "I really like the spa and swimming pool they have on the backside of the gym. Although, they charge more for it. But I recommend it as it allows you to have variety in your exercise. Apart from it, we both get referrals which give us 2 months of free membership.",
        "It will be quite useful to you as you recently told me that you want to be fit and lose weight. Hence, I am writing this to you. Therefore, Hoping for your consideration so that we can both go together and be fit.",
        "Sincerely,",
