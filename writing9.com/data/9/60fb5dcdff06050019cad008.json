        "Dear Sir or Madam,",
        "I am writing this letter to complain about the room services at your hotel, Bayswater Inn International, from November 16th to November 17th, 2018. The staff in your hotel were exceptionally welcoming, and the location was quite convenient. However, I was disappointed with the room and spent two miserable nights there.",
        "Last month, I booked a deluxe room at your hotel on the fourth floor. I stayed in room 403 for two days with my company officials for two days\u2019 conference organized by Severo International in Gurugram, Haryana. I made a booking with a booking ID MN0078 through an online website MakeMyTrip, after going with your reviews.",
        "I found many problems in the room, such as the electronic appliances like the water heater and kettle were not functioning appropriately. Due to this, I had to take a cold water bath that is tough in the winter season. Adding to this, when I called on your provided room service helpline, no one responded to any of my calls. These sets of problems gave me a miserable experience at your place.",
        "For a valuable stay, I would like to recommend some improvements that may help you increase customer satisfaction level. Firstly, you need to improve your housekeeping facility and make it super active in resolving issues. Also, make a repair check on all the electronic equipment in the room before you make any further booking.",
        "I hope you will work on my given advice.",
        "Yours faithfully,",
