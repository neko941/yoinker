In addition, local government bodies decided to stop all transport services right after 7pm daily to stop these crimes. Therefore it is   absolutely not possible in your case as you will be back  home at 9PM from the workplace. Having said that, please think twice before moving to this location.",

If not, on the other side, we have a few new apartments in the middle of the town and I guess this location is also a good one if we ingone the skyrocketing  rents and other utilities charges.",
