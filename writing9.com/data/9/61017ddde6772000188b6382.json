        "Nowadays, plenty of individuals are inclined towards purchasing natural food items despite the fact that they are costlier than the normally available ones.Perhaps , the main reason behind the given scenario is the number of valuable nutrients these substances provide.I feel that it is necessary to pick up healthier foodstuff even though they are costly .The aim of the current essay is to elaborate on my opinion.",
        "To begin with, in the modern world, most of the population have had enough of processed foods and their side effects.Hence, they are into  a mindset of changing their diet plans.Thus including a nutrition-rich platter in their daily routine is the option they are in the need of.For instance, obesity is the outcome of eating  fast foods and therefore people are replacing these snacks with salads.As a result, the population is wanting to move to a healthier lifestyle.",
        "In my opinion,  if the cooking materials are able to boost our immune system and add a nutritional touch to our diet then it is necessary to purchase them even if they possess an additional cost.It is because they are worth it.Besides this, one should understand that as the organic foodstuff does not remain longer , the work involved in manufacturing and delivering them within a time frame is not that easy and consequently,  there will be a bit of extra value on the labels of these natural foodstuffs.For example, foods such as sprouts may not remain for a week ,if these are not consumed, they have to be discarded resulting in a huge loss to the sellers and that is the reason behind the added cost.",
        "In conclusion, the essay has described the motive behind why are people willing to spend more money and buy natural food items and also explained why are these eatables important to our bodies."
