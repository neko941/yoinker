        "It has been a while since we last talked. I am writing this letter to describe the special food that I really enjoy most of the time.",
        "\"Rice & Curry\" has been one of my favourite dishes all my life. It is a dish which is served mainly in the Asian region. Being the national dish of Sri Lanka, the national dish of Nepal is also similar to this although with a different name. The dish consists of a number of vegetable curries served with a cup of rice and with one kind of protein.",
        "In most instances, people are used to having this dish on a daily basis for lunch. Foreign travellers are often attracted to taste this traditional meal while they are in Sri Lanka.",
        "The main reason I like this meal is that it includes a variety of tastes such as sweet, savoury and spicy. People can choose their curries to match their preferences in taste which would produce a unique dish.",
        "Hoping to hear from you soon.",
        "Best regards,",
