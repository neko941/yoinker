        "Dear Sara,",
        "I hope you and your family are well. I never forget the tremendous hospitality you extended to me last month when I visited the city where you live. Anyway, the reason I am writing is that you are informed that I altered my flat. As you know, I am a freelancer; consequently, I occupy at home. My profession entailed far more consideration. Therefore, my environment around me should be entirely quiet. Since the prior neighbourhood was so congested and noisy, I rented a novel apartment in the calm district.",
        "My new flat is so much spectacular with a stunning court. Furthermore, it has a prospect of the ocean. As it has located on the fifth floor, I frequently witness sun dusk. Not only is there an immense shopping mall nearby but there also is a professional sports complex- the Energy Chain Gyms. Moreover, it surrounds me with the international restaurants being upmarket.",
        "I would be thrilled if you accept my invitation to meet each other at my new flat next Saturday at 6:00 pm. the address is 50th Floor, No 25, Washington Alley. Perhaps it would be better to get a taxi due to my location does not have appropriate access to the subway.",
        "I look forward to seeing you as soon as possible",
        "Best regards,",
