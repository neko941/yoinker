        "In recent times, people\u2019s personal lives get pressurized by the modern norms of living. While I agree with this notion because competition and priority for fulfilling monetary needs have increased over the last few decades.",
        "Firstly, human beings do overtime at the workplace which leaves less time for their families. This causes work-life disbalance. To illustrate, for enjoying modern comforts such as a luxurious house and car, one works hard beyond his regular physical and mental capacity to take the pressure that makes individuals stay isolated for so long from their dear ones. Consequently, more frustration due to work leads to a negatively impacting on household relationships.",
        "Secondly, people give more importance to money these days instead of love and affection from loved ones. Due to this materialistic thinking and artificial comforts, most of the population wants to stay alone or live in relationships without living with more family members. For example, a study is conducted on the young generation at  Harvard University and it illustrated the results of modern technological advances on youngsters in Japan as 85% of them do not like to have a family life and prefer to live alone in their expensive apartments and mostly socialize with online friends; thereby declining significance of family bondings.",
        "To conclude, due to the increasing modernization phenomenon in the world one\u2019s family life gets distracted which would be caused by more importance to work, money, monetary comforts and privacy. Therefore, in the future, fewer and fewer people would give preference to being married and having children."
