        "I am pleased to inform you that I am planning to give a presentation on ways to reduce the carbon footprints to protect our environment. I recently had an opportunity to attend a conference about the environmental impact due to human activities.",
        "Firstly, I am planning to cover topics on emissions of  greenhouse gases into our atmosphere due to our dependence on cars and the benefits of alternative energy sources. In addition, it would create general awareness among our employees to conserve energy and I believe it would take approximately an hour to complete the presentation.",
        "Moreover, I had plans to invite all employees and the CEO of our department to participate in the meeting. I had booked a venue in our new campus on the 24th of January 2022. I would be grateful if you could provide  approval for the same and I think this would definitely promote awareness to everyone in the meeting.",
        "I look forward to hearing from you.",
        "Yours sincerely,",
