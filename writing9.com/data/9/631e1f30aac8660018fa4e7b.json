        "I know a few shops near my neighbourhood which specialise in mending sports gear. I will take this racket to one such shop as they will fix this issue as soon as possible.",
        "I deeply apologize for this although it happened unwillingly. I hope you will understand the situation and forgive me for this mistake.",
