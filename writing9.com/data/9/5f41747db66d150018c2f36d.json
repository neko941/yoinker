        "It is a controversy that pursuing a career in the early years or changing jobs constantly will give an individual more job fulfilment. In my opinion, while job-hopping is a fitting choice for those having less career ambition, I partly agree with the notion that staying in a steady job will provide a more pleasant experience.",
        "On the one hand, people who have more job shifts are more likely to be unsatisfied with their current job. With this idea in mind, it would be better for them to change their career and immerse themselves in a new working environment. In addition, by doing this, they will get a chance to get their hands on different fields and gaining more dynamic experiences. Thus, these contacts with various fields is going to leave them with compelling stories and a range of different skill sets which can be a great help for their next job. To give an example, eminent novelist Haruki Murakami once stated that it was the experience of being an owner of a jazz bar and a marathon runner that shaped his distinctive writing style.",
        "On the other hand, pursuing a same career for a long period of time may have more perks. When being given an extended amount of time to master the necessary skills for a particular occupation, a person will have a higher chance of moving up the ladder and earning a lucrative living. Moreover, being skilled in a specific field can be a huge asset not only to withstand a place in this competitive world but also to create more meaningful contributions. These advantages will secure them to choose whichever lifestyles or interests they want without monetary worries. For example, a businessman can easily go fishing without being puzzled to make sure that his children wouldn\u2019t be starved if he caught no fish just because he wants to be a fisherman.",
        "In conclusion, although a person either having a stable occupation or a frequent changing one may go through different levels of job satisfaction, I hold an opinion that the former one can result in an overall better experience in livelihood."
