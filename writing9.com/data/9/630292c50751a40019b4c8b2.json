        "I hope you're doing well, and as I understood, you're applying for the same course that I studied at Concordia University in the field of computer science. Let me give you some tips regarding the diploma.",
        "The course is a 31-credit course which provides you with  a great background in computer science and professional programming skills. Although it seems intensive to have such a variety of subjects, that would be a fabulous asset to your CV. Moreover, Concordia University has a very good reputation among other universities in Montreal and graduating from the school of engineering will have a great impact on your both resume and career. So, I recommend you this course if you'd like to be successful in your future job.",
        "In addition, keep in mind that you need to prepare a letter of explanation to convince the committee to accept your application as well as have a GPA within the required range. I can review your LOE and give you some suggestions before you submit your application.",
        "I hope you find this helpful.",
        "Best regards,",
