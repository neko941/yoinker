I'm excited about this opportunity, however, I need to move from Florian\u00f3polis to your city S\u00e3o Paulo.",
        "Changing city makes me feel insecure because I have never lived in another city than Florian\u00f3polis. I heard that S\u00e3o Paulo has high numbers of violence in some regions and the public transportation is not so good. As you know, I don't have a driver licence, so I really need to count on quick and safe transportation between my home and work, otherwise, I'll need to live near to the downtown.",
        "Do you know if the Recreio neighbourhood is near to Downtown? I was looking for apartments to live in this area. Do you know if this place is safe, even at night? In this new job, I believe it will be necessary to make extra work hours and I don't want to be in danger while returning home.",
