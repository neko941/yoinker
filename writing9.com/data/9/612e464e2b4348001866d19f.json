        "These days , it is clear that the internet has become  the most important technological advance.Although I think that it maintains some obvious harmful consequences . I  strongly believe that the advantages of this innovation outweigh its disadvantages .",
        "On the one hand, in some cases , this advance may have some negative influences on  human life. The first reason is that the excessive uses of this development can reduce real-humans -interaction .For example, the population tend to communicate with their friends or families via social media apps such as what's up and messanger rather than  meeting them in -person, which is important for mental and physical health . The second reason is that this technological advance encourages people to spend their time in unfavourable activities . For instance , many students waste their time  playing video games or chatting on the messenger instead of working hard in order to get a bright career . That is why this development may lead to adverse effects on humans .",
        "On the other hand , there are many reasons why the internet proves to be the best development. Firstly, it provides people with  ease of communication  . In other words , the facility  and convenience to contact individuals make the population able to connect with their close persons even if there are not in the same city or country . Secondly, this innovation remains a valuable way of learning . to put it simply , it gives students the ability to access all different types of information from resources . Moreover, individuals have the opportunity to discover anything about the world only a click away.",
        "In conclusion , despite that the wrong way of using the internet may lead to few adverse results , I believe that it is one of  the best technological products   and the benefits that it brings about can exceed its drawbacks ."
