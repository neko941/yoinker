        "Dear Linda",
        "I have been surprised with your ability in your excellent performance at a concert which was held  last weekend. Moreover, I am writing to ask you for some help.",
        "The energetic rhythm that you show makes me feel very motivating. The lively music that you play can make me feel very excited which let me dance with your guidance unconsciously. For instance, while you were singing the highlight sentence, you called us to follow you. In this way, I can feel that I was involved in the concert deeply.",
        "Hence, I want to invite you to take part in my musical activities as a special performer. It\u2019s an annual event of my company. Around 500 employees will join in. I will also invite other musicians like guitar players and violin players. I want to provide an amazing live music show for my workers.",
        "I would like you can attend and arouse the attention of the audience. I hope you can play as the first person which can attract every person\u2019s interest. For example, you can sing your most famous song The \u201d beautiful girl\u201d as a former dish.",
        "I really expect you can join us. So I am looking forward to receiving your response.",
        "Yours faithfully!"
