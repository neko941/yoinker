        "It is true that youngsters should be taught to discriminate between right and wrong during their childhood. While I accept that there are other ways to teach kids without abuse, I still believe that beating is obligated to help them learn this differentiation.",
        "To begin with, there are many ways to teach your heir without punishing them. Firstly, abuse can  result in some negative behaviour when they turn older. For example, if the kid gets retribution every day, it can form a huge fear when they get older that they can not do the things they want without their parent's permission. Secondly, offspring seem that discipline is a way to communicate with other people. As a result, when other people disagree with their opinion, they will punish as same as the way their parents do to them when they were young.",
        "However, I still believe that the concept of teaching scion by a forfeiture is right. The first element is that a trial will help to teach a child how to behave as an adult. For instance, when offspring are taught how to manage their actions, they will know how to avoid injury around them. Punishment may act quickly to deter poor conduct. Furthermore, it also instils in scion the standard and responsibility. It will help kids to see the connection between what they do and what occurs next  so that they will act in a reasonable manner.",
        "In conclusion, while it is true that the youngster should be taught without punishment. I firmly believe that suffering is a way to help them learn about right and wrong."
