        "Dear Abhinav,",
        "I am delighted to hear about your official posting in my city. You are most welcome in Abu Dhabi! Please don't worry about relocation, I'm living here for more than 10 years now and will be happy to guide you.",
        "As you'll be moving in with your family, I suggest checking out Al Reem island. It's a community area having different amenities such as a central park, hospitals, supermarkets and schools in the vicinity. Most of the apartments have amazing views that overlook the waters of the Arabian sea.",
        "Moreover, the island area is well connected with the main city through 3 bridges and has sufficient public transportation facilities. You can find a bus stop and a taxi stand within the walking distance of any residential building. The travelling time to the main city and international airport is not more than 20 minutes from the island.",
        "Perhaps, it's an area where most of the ex-pats live. Every Saturday, there are events happening on nearby Cove beach. Since you are a badminton player, you can join the sports academy here to meet people with similar interests. I believe the information is helpful and I am looking forward to meeting you very soon.",
