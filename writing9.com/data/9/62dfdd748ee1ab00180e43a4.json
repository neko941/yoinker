        "I am so glad to know that you have launched your business venture on import and export in Nepal. Since India is the neighbouring country to Nepal, I have plenty of suggestions for your business.",
        "As you know, I work in the food department and am in charge of pricing, I have the following options for importing from India. Rice and pulses are the staple food of south Indians that is grown vastly across several regions. Considering these are highly nutritious and the climatic conditions in Nepal are not suitable to harvest and cultivate them, it is recommended to import these from India.",
        "Furthermore, these plantations are harvested and are available throughout the year to be imported at inexpensive rates. Apart from that, distinct varieties and grades are farmed and traded at rates based on their classes.",
        "Besides, I have several references of suppliers from whom you can purchase these goods in bulk at a discounted price which would be advantageous for your business. Additionally, Nepal and India are well linked by roadways, the conveyance will never be a concern and commutation fares would be cost-effective.",
        "Please think and let me know if you need further details. I am eagerly waiting to hear from you soon.",
        "Best regards,",
