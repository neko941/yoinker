        "I am Susitha Bandara, writing this letter to express a few concerns regarding the gathering had last Sunday at your hotel premises.",
        "First of all, our friends enjoyed it a lot that evening with the live band you have arranged and most of them appreciated that. Nevertheless, the swimming pool and the lighting are so existing and match with the table arrangements as well. Your staff has offered us an impressive service on time and efficiently.",
        "However, there are complaints from everyone at the party regarding the food items. Most of the cuisine was not from the menu which we have selected before giving the order. Moreover, some of the drinks are extremely sour and was not of the expected quality. Some of the participants had lose-motion and burning sensation once they went back home.",
        "Since we are having our gathering annually, in your hotel I would like to make some suggestions regarding the food items to not to lose the reputation of your hotel. I feel if you can double-check the food items with the menu before serving and test your food by a food-tester will be better. Please take note of this and I would appreciate it if you can consider these opinions carefully.",
        "Thanks and regards,",
