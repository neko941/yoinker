        "I wouldn\u2019t want to impose you though, but I would really appreciate it if you could find a place closer to your residence as it would be easy for me to travel to work as well as be closer. However, I do know how expensive New York can be in terms of the lease.",
        "So, I am looking for a single room and it should be enough for me as I\u2019m not bringing much stuff. I don't find the floor it is situated on. Although, I would be grateful if you could find a place closer to a subway as it would be convenient. Let me know if you know of any available options or put me in touch with an agency, it would be fantastic.",
        "Looking forward to seeing you soon.",
