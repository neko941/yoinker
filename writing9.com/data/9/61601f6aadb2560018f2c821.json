        "Since your vacation will be in July, I would recommend you to find an apartment in advance, because as a rule in the summer months we have a lot of tourists. If you wish I can ask my acquaintance, who is a real estate agent  if he has some available apartment for this period. Otherwise, you can look for something at  Airbnb.",
        "By the way, summer is a perfect time to visit Minsk. There are a lot of outdoor activities organized such as street food festivals, open-air concerts. Moreover, the weather is pleasant for sightseeing, it is not boiling hot here in the summer, you can even take some warmer clothes like jeans and a hoodie in case of rainy days.",
