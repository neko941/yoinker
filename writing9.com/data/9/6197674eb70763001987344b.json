        "I am writing this letter with reference to your request to provide contributions from the readers for an article called \u201cThe book that influenced you\u201d for your magazine and I would like to take this opportunity and provide details on the book that influenced me.",
        "My name is Farhana Jabeen and I am a regular reader of your magazine. The book I would like to share  is named \u201cRich Dad Poor Dad\u201d by Robert Kiyosaki. It emphasises  financial liabilities and assets and how to make money work for us rather than  working for money.",
        "Initially, this book was just a part of my research project while pursuing my degree in finance. However, it provided me with important advice on accounting, investment techniques and understanding of the market, which influenced me to invest in real estate and earn profits.",
        "Therefore, I personally believe that this book likely has the potential to influence every individual who is seeking ways and suggestions with respect to investment and earning effective returns along with offering financial stability and ways to effectively use their resources. Being able to read this book on investment will definitely have an influence on various age groups.",
        "I hope this information would be sufficient for including in your article. Should you require any further details, please let me know.",
