        "Dear sir,",
        "I am joseph, writing this letter to request you to change my current accommodation at Horizon Tower Flat No.5609, because I am suffering here by countless issues related to hygiene also I am varied about my studies.",
        "Earlier, I made it clear to you about things I could not manage within the accommodation. Firstly, neatness is my top priority, late night comers will disturb our sleep and enjoying high-sound music can divert the attention of others. Unfortunately, at present ,accommodations people did not maintain discipline as well as hygiene. So I cannot tolerate such activities.",
        "So kindly take the necessary steps to change my accommodation as soon as possible, because the next semester is near.  I have to do the preparation.  It is my humble request to you to provide accommodation where others students are hygienic, maintain timings and show manners while dealing with roommates.",
        "I hope you understand my situation and that I cannot concentrate on my studies because of the problems I am facing on a daily basis. Changing accommodation can be the only remedy to all the problems.",
        "I am looking for your quick action on these.",
        "Yours faithfully,",
