        "I am Karthi and staying in Rajendra Nagar, Thudiyalur. I am writing this letter to let you know that to share my travel experience in your company taxi. Generally, whenever I need a cab my first choice was your taxi. I feel that it was very comfortable and user friendly to book through the app. Moreover, I suggested to my friends and relatives to give preference to you when they it need.",
        "Last week I came across with bad experience of travelling in your taxi. The driver's behaviour was very rude and they ask for extra money to drop. Even if there is a facility for online payment he won\u2019t accept it and ask for cash payment. I was really wondering and complaint about that in your local office. But there is no proper response in your local branch office.",
        "I advise you to please take this matter and enquire about this issue. There is a good reputation about your company passenger car in all over the regional area and try to maintain it.",
