        "These days the advance of communication technology such as mobile phones ,tablets and other mobile devices is becoming rapidly. Many opine that they have more benefits rather than drawbacks. From my point of view ,I completely disagree with this idea.",
        "Firstly ,one of the main reasons for this opinion is the negative impact of using technological gadgets on human brains. For example ,there are multiple strong surveys that believe ,people who exert these gadgets to create relationships habitually can not become successful in their communications. This is a noticeable drawback that we can not say these things have advantages. Therefore ,this makes it clear there are multiple downsides related to technology and things that are dependent on it that human beings should consider.",
        "Secondly ,another drawback is suffering from mental disorders. For instance ,we all know most of the population in the world ,especially ,the young generations regularly spend a lot of time chatting ,sending e_mails and making friends on social media. These people prefer to stay at home and create cyber interactions rather than making real conversations. This could cause isolation and finally, they will suffer from  the most dangerous mental illness which is called depression. As a result ,it becomes apparent there are multiple downsides behind each upside that we can not ignore.",
        "All things considered ,I strongly disagree with this idea. I also believe the use of technology to generate communications should be halted. It is predicted that to continue this activity among humans we will witness other drawbacks that can be more hazardous in the near future."
