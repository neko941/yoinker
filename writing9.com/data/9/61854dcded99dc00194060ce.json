        "Dear Madam,",
        "I hope this letter finds you in good health. I am writing this letter to give me a favour for my serious request regarding  your air-con issue. The reason why is that there has been leaking water to my room day in day out for almost a week.",
        "In addition to this, the air-con pipe has been frequently waving on my window along with water flow. Because of that, I cannot open my master bedroom window and the water leaking case is now tending to destroy my newest floor map which was bought just a few days ago.",
        "I particular, I would like to suggest that if the pipe made some more extension up to reach the length which can put between main water pipes then this flows only through the main pipe and may not annoyed to any rooms. Please let me know if you are busy with your work, then I can help these things to make it happen on your behalf. However, I cannot wait more than two days while my temper has been reaching  the maximum plus I have already prepared to take any action with the condo committee.",
