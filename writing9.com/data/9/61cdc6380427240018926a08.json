        "Dear Mr Jones,",
        "I hope this email finds you well. If you recall, we met on our flight from Bangkok to Tokyo last month and I sat on your right-hand side at the window seat. We had a pleasant chat throughout our journey.",
        "You mentioned during our conversation that you are looking for an experienced chef who is well-versed in Thai cuisine. If that position is still available, I am interested to apply for it.",
        "I have been cooking Thai cuisine in Bangkok for more than 10 years. In addition to the traditional Thai dishes such as tom yam and papaya salad, I have also created a few Thai-Japanese fusion dishes of my own which are some of the best-selling dishes in my diner in Bangkok. I believe it will be well-loved by the Japanese too.",
        "Please let me know if I will have the honour and opportunity to show my version of authentic and modern Thai cuisine to those who love Thai food in Japan. I look forward to hearing from you.",
        "Yours sincerely,",
