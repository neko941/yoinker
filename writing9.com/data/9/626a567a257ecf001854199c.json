        "It is obvious that nowadays more and more people prefer to use various electronic devices in order to access information. It is a common belief that it is unnecessary to have copies of books, magazines and newspapers. In this essay, I will analyze the matter and explain why I completely agree with this notion.",
        "Firstly, one of the major reasons why printed literature should be avoided is the massive deforestation of our planet. The urge to own a hard copy of a certain book is one of the main drivers of paper production companies around the world. A good example of deforestation is that currently, nearly thirty per cent of the Amazonian forests are facing extinction, as well as their fauna. A huge number of international companies are adopting the \"green\" rules which advocate printing only essential documents and transferring from paper hardcopy to using electronic signatures. Such an approach greatly reduces the usage of paper in  offices.",
        "Secondly, another reason supporting the opening notion is that electronic sources are much more accessible to the population. For instance, it is of tremendous convenience when a person can acquire the required information with one click. Furthermore, it is beneficial to people with disabilities who cannot physically go to a newsstand or a book store. Also, more people have access to electronic versions due to lower prices. For example, college students can have all of their books on their computers rather than consuming and carrying printed versions around the campus.",
        "In conclusion, I strongly support the idea that we should try to use soft copies. The main reasons in my opinion are that cellulose producing companies benefit from deforestation and that e-copies are easier to access."
