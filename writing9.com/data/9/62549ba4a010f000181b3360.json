As I know, your father and elder brother are out of the city nowadays, so you just need some help to carry goods from the old apartment to the new one. Therefore, you can tell me if you need any kind of help.",

Furthermore, I can drive the loader, so it would be better if I take it to your residence with some friends. They will help to load heavy goods like safes, beds and so on. So, frankly speaking, it's my responsibility to help you in this situation because you helped me when I shifted to my current apartment.",
        "In the end, I have some questions regarding  your new residence because I also plan to change my house in near future. Can you please tell me the exact cost of your house? How many daily life facilities are available in that area?",
