        "Firstly, the schedule of using the shower, particularly in the morning. Please be informed that the three of us have the same plan of taking a bath, which is seven in the morning. Although we can discuss that between us to coincide with our schedules, however, the problem is our working and school timings are all the same, which is eight in the morning. Secondly, the study tables inside our living room are totally jammed and cannot be used. Lastly, is the location and this is my biggest concern. The accommodation is very far from my company address. I need to take two buses every day. This is added cost for me at the same time it is a waste of time.",
        "I appreciated it if you could look for me accommodation that is nearest to my workstation. Looking forward to hearing from you.",
