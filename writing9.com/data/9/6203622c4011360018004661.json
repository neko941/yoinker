It was a gift for my eighteenth birthday from my parents so not only it was pricy but also had a sentimental value for me. As far as I recall, I wore it at the beach party where had over a hundred guests, and the next morning, I looked everywhere but it was lost.",
        "Hopefully, I have  insurance coverage that will pay the full price. Hence, I would appreciate it if you could provide me with your company's lost item form so I can fill and send it to you ASAP. Should you require any further information, do not hesitate to contact me.",
