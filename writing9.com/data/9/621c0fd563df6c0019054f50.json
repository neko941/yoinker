        "Dear Amy,",

        "I took  \u2018Advanced Accounting' in my second semester of university study. I still remember we only could take these classes in the evening section as the tutor is a full-time accountant, which was a little bit annoying. In addition, this course involves two assignments that you need to submit on the fifth week and the tenth week. Then, the final exam must be passed in order to get the credit.",
        "There are two reasons why I recommend RMIT university. First of all, this academic institution has a good reputation around the world, which makes you more employable after graduation. Additionally, as students of this educational institution come from a wide range of nations, attending this university not only can learn knowledge but also provide us with opportunities to communicate with people with different cultural backgrounds, raising our awareness of cultural diversity.",
        "There is a tip that I would like you to know when you are applying for this course. Finding two or three referees with excellent social status is the main factor for being granted the offer.",
        "I hope the aforementioned information is useful for you. I am looking forward to hearing your reply.",
