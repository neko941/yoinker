        "Dear Sir or Madam,",
        "I write this letter to bring your attention to some issues I had to face while staying at your hotel last May 14th. It was mainly satisfying, but I think some little improvements should be made in the future to avoid the incommodities I had to suffer.",
        "Firstly, my company booked a double room for me in order to attend our annual meeting, but unluckily there were no available suites due to a problem with the central heating. Thus, I was given a single one with a discount. The room was adequate and the bed was comfortable, but it was not what I had been promised.  As a matter of fact, I have to congratulate your staff for their steady response and help.",
        "However, there was a wedding party in the nearest saloon where our event was taking place. So, some drunk attendants stepped onto our hall while our director was giving his speech. It was very embarrassing for us all. Even more, the music was so loud we could hardly  listen to the speakers.",
        "If the events were correctly signalled, or the volume of the music limited, I am sure that all this could have been avoided. So, I would like  your company to place an advertisement in the auditorium door stating that entrance is forbidden. If the hotel were to take this suggestion, I am sure the guests will have a quieter experience at your hotel.",
