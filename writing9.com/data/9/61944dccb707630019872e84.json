        "Indubitably paying heed to the future is colossal to achieve desired goals. However, it is reckoned by a minor section of society that it is worthless to anticipate and plan for upcoming events in advance and one should learn to stay in the present. In my perspective, a person should have a plan ready,  in order to get successful endeavours in life and save money for uncertain circumstances.",
        "To embark with, drawing a layout for the next step is a prerequisite to succeed in fulfilling desires. If an individual has no clarity about his future, there is a high probability that he may not be able to reach his destination, since only a pre-defined goal can motivate someone and does not let him go astray. An example of this could be, a learner who wants to pursue higher education in a foreign country, needs to apply for a passport and take the International English language Testing System exam in order to get Study Visa. Therefore, pre-planning will pave way for better prospects.",
        "Besides this, It is pertinent to mention here that a clear and comprehensive blueprint encourages a person to start setting aside money for upcoming tasks of life, like children's higher education, marriage & other business ventures. Although it is well known that fortune cannot be predicted, a considerable amount of saving would be a saviour during times of emergency. An exemplification of this could be,9 out of 10 Indian parents start to save money for their ward\u2019s university education so that they need not rely on others for seeking financial support.",
        "To conclude, it is incisively clear from the aforementioned justification that planning beforehand would not only empower a person to excel in life but also gratify them to retain monetary resources for the coming uncertainty and will make him independent."
