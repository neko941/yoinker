        "Undoubtedly, along with the development of science and technology, more and more countries have relied on nuclear power. In this regard, some people believe that nuclear energy is much more eco-friendly in comparison to other types of energy. From my standpoint, although the benefits of nuclear power are undeniable, it could be considered  a serious threat to the whole world.",
        "From an environmental point of view, nuclear power comes from chemical reactions which require a wide range of experiments by expert scientists, otherwise, undesirable consequences could occur. Hence, it is essential that government implement some policies in place to protect humankind. Additionally, the waste of the reactions mostly is dropped to lakes or forests which are the natural habitat of animals. It is clear that this action can lead to decreasing the population of wildlife and increasing the number of endangered animals. For example, the number of one species of fish, which was a source of income in the south of Iran, has extremely dropped off after constructing the nuclear laboratory near the sea.",
        "From a political point of view, some countries, especially developed nations, use nuclear energy as a weapon to control developing countries. This authority can result in disparity among countries which could be the main reason for external wars. Furthermore, in order to protect nuclear centres from unexpected events, governments allocate a huge amount of money to protect these areas. However, this money could be better spent on developing  solar energy which is environmentally friendly.",
        "To put it in a nutshell, with respect to the whole views mentioned above, it is not acceptable to use nuclear power since it could be dangerous for  nature and human beings. Therefore, alternative energy sources should be developed to replace nuclear power."
