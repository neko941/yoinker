I hope this letter finds you in good health. I am writing this letter to invite my brother' birthday party  next week Friday evening.",

You can reach easily  the address by using Google Maps as well as by taxi and please tell him that my home is beside Siam Commercial Bank and opposite Cherry Hill Hotel on Kabaraye Road. By the way, the number is 27 B, white colour two-storey building.",
