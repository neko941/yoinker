        "It is not doubtful that nowadays' education is supplied by loads of technological techniques. Even if using computers on a daily basis of the educational process may show many desirable benefits on its elements, but cause what is called plagiarism. This essay will thereby explain both pros and cons of such a current improvement.",
        "The first benefit of ubiquitous computer's application in schools is the superhighway properties provided to all learners. That is why students can broaden their knowledge limitations, and get a further explanation to all conflict objects, despite where it is published. To illustrate more,  just by one click on Google search, all data will be appeared sequentially providing a deep, rich source to anything you intend to know in-depth. In contrast, if there is no a limitless, fleeting avenue to knowledge like smart devices and personal computers, the studying references for students may be enormously diminished than latter, and thus limit their chances for mind's strength.",
        "On the flip side, plagiarism is the main demerit, which is claimed by many argue against the uncontrolled access of computers at learning organizations. In other words, many instructors detected currently the abusing of their pupils to the online, available data anywhere. In addition, solving any assignment is mostly fulfilled only by copying online data without their individual interruption or explanation. On the contrary, if there are identified access for pupils towards definite resources, this will limit plagiarism ultimately.",
        "In conclusion, Despite the cons of students' dependence on computers, many benefits usually overcome these drawbacks facilitating the daily learning process, and keeping its recipients updated, rather than before."
