        "Education is one of the essential parts of each individual's life. For that reason, people should be more meticulous about their choices. Depending on particular reasons, youngsters are able to make decisions between local and foreign universities. This essay will explore both options and support my personal opinion.",
        "To begin with, local educational establishments might be divided in accordance with their ranking. In that respect, new applicants can be done their search and find out opportunities, which emphasize their needs. For example, not all students around the world can effort high tuition fees or are able to get a scholarship from  international programmes. However, this does not mean, that they are less capable than others and do not deserve to get a chance to continue their academic life. Moreover, there might be some extra beneficial circumstances such as citizenship, which allow native students to get some jobs parallel to their studies.",
        "On the other hand, the young generation with higher ambition should prove themselves in different conditions and understand cultural diversities in order better understand the mechanism of their contribution to a particular area. This also helps fresh minds to enrich their personal views and think differently. For instance, it is always better to compare the advantages and drawbacks of the technology in other countries, learn unique strategies and formulate their own ideas. From my point of view, studying in abroad is worth all efforts in the earlier stages of life in order to make the new generation of graduates more creative.",
        "To sum up, a bachelor's degree should be made purposeful, rather than mechanical. In this respect, I think, graduates within their own country have fewer perspectives in comparison to those, who do their degrees  overseas."
