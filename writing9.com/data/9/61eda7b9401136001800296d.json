        "I am writing this letter to inform you that I have lost the ring that was given to me by my grandmother as a tradition in our family which was covered under your insurance policy. In fact, it was very close to my heart and there were emotional strings attached to it. Furthermore, there was an emerald stone carved on it by an ancient method.",
        "While sitting at the swimming pool and enjoying the amenities, it came to my realization that the ring which I had worn was now not with me after I finished swimming. Despite the pool being cleared, there was no clue of the ring being washed away in the water.",
        "Would it be possible if the money can be reimbursed? Moreover, it would be of great help if this is done as soon as possible considering the fact that the money is required urgently for paying my travel expenses as my stay in the hotel got extended because of this loss.",
        "I hope you will understand my situation and help me out in this need or emergency.",
