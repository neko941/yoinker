        "Dear Sir or Madam,",
        "I am writing this letter to complain about the headphones which I bought in your shop located in a shopping mall called Mega Silk Way  on 29th April. Since I work at home and am a part of a team, I normally have a meeting via Zoom with my teammates in the morning. However, the headphones pose some difficulties. First of all, the sound is unclear and this leads to underperformance at work  due to the fact that I simply do not hear properly what is my assignment. Moreover, occasionally I notice that my microphone is off while I am speaking about what I have done previously.",
        "The fact of the matter is that because of missing some words during meetings, I did not hear the exact date which was the deadline of a current project. Therefore, I am unable to meet the deadline leading to poor accomplishment at work.",
        "I would appreciate it if you could replace my headphones or I would like to receive a full refund. I would be most grateful if you could reply as soon as possible so that this matter can be resolved to everyone's satisfaction.",
        "Yours faithfully,",
        "Alice Smith."
