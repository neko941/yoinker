        "I am writing this letter to make a claim on my travel insurance that I took out with your company 10 months ago. My membership number is PC 234765",
        "Unfortunately, when I was travelling around Perth last week, my laptop was stolen from my hotel room. This Macbook was a birthday gift that was given by my husband a few weeks ago. Although I only started using it a couple of weeks ago, it contains all the important data regarding working or studying in it. I was extremely frustrated to find it was stolen, as I had to spend a great deal of time redoing the work that I lost.",
        "Despite the fact that I had locked my room securely and went out  sightseeing, we found my laptop disappeared when we returned. We immediately contacted the staff of this hotel and checked the CCTV which showed that a teenager came to my room and took my Mac book. Then, we informed the policeman and enclosed the forms that he provided.",
        "After reading the terms and the claim policy of my insurance, I believe that I am entitled to claim for the value of the laptop itself and for the time dealing with this incident. I hope one of your staff will be able to telephone me at the earliest opportunity to assist me to make this claim.",
        "I am looking forward to being contacted.",
        "Yours faithfully,",
