        "Should cabinets allocate their spending on trains over streets? I completely agree that governments have to allocate their spending on the train over roads this is because it will reduce the number of cars and good for the economy.",
        "The main reason why I believe that countries should build more railways is that it will decrease the traffic. Therefore, when the total number of cars go to the hald this means the traffic will go to the half which it will open a space for police, hospital's car, and firemen. In addition, it will lower the level of carbon in the air. For example, it itself will have minimized the risk of climate change.",
        "The second reason why I think that authorities have to build trains instead of streets is because of its economics. Moreover, people will not go to their work by car; hence, they will use trains. This means that governments could allocate the spending of construction into such as health, education, etc. Secondly, economically speaking, the dangers of climate change has been lost the job of %8 of the world. Namely, this is because climate change would affect the level of rain which mean it will affect the agriculture aspect of the country.",
        "In conclusion, I tend to believe that the government's agency must build more railways this is because of its economy's gain and its impact on  traffic and climate change. It seems that  the 21st countries are moving toward smart cities where citizen does not need to own a car."
