        "The adolescent phase is the transition phase from a  child to a young adult.In some parts of the world,teenagers are given permission to do part-time employment ,whereas some countries do not motivate them.This essay will discuss the advantages and disadvantages including why I believe that young adults should have a head start from the adolescent phase,using examples from recent studies to demonstrate points.",
        "On one hand,teenagers learn a lot during their part-time employment.They develop a sense of responsibility and become independent.Additionally,they learn financial management of their salary,which is an important life skill. For example,a recent study by the University of Columbia showed that many tech billionaires,who worked as  employees during their graduation, had better business financial management skills compared to those who never attempted to work.Moreover,they have turned out to  be risk-takers,achieving success in life.Therefore,employment from a young age instils a sense of responsibility.",
        "On the other hand,exposing children to monetary benefits may result in them deviating from the path of further education.Once teenagers start earning,they lose focus of their aims and goals in life.This will often cause them to get stuck in mediocre jobs throughout their lives.Furthermore, the salary earned by them could be misused for illegal purposes.In fact,it was noticed by many parents that their children started drinking alcohol and using drugs with their salary,often ending up in rehabilitation centres.These are the reasons why young adults should not be encouraged to work.",
        "To conclude,working from a young age has advantages as well as disadvantages.In my opinion,children should be allowed to work to make them more responsible and independent."
