        "There is no doubt that every country should have their own plans to uplift the standard of the poor. There are some advocates who think that helping needy families by giving free houses is a solution.In my opinion, I completely agree with this standpoint because this improves both individuals and  society as a whole.",
        "To begin with, it is the government's responsibility to provide  basic living facilities to citizens. In other words, the taxpayer's money should utilise to upgrade the status, which means the authority can offer free housing  projects to needy people. For example, in India, there are different  kinds of such schemes that have been initiated to eliminate poor housing issues. By contrast, if the authority did not start the programme, the country would have remained in poverty, even, today. Thus, it is clear that  building   affordable houses can help the destitute.",
        "Another  fact here is that presently many people are homeless due to multiple reasons. This is because of either family issues or  financial reasons, eventually, they may end up on the streets,  and the scenario could tarnish the country's overall developments. Despite the fact that when the affected  destitute can be helped  by offering community  houses or low-cost housing complexes. Consequently, the section can earn money to support themselves, for instance, in Mumbai, the authority  built free accommodation for city dwellers, who live in slums and their living standard has been improved, therefore, this is evident that the initiative is successful.",
        "In conclusion, it is thought that constructing  houses for the underprivileged can be positive. I strongly  agree with the statement since the  overall living conditions have been upgraded. It is recommended the authority should channelise more funds for the same."
