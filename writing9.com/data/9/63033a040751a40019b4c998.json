        "We have already discussed the start date for my employment and agreed upon the first of next month. However, I would like to ask you if it is possible to postpone this start date by a fortnight. The reason is that an uncle of mine has died abroad and it will be necessary for me to go and take care of certain legal and financial matters. This duty has fallen to me as I am his closest living relative.",
        "I would like to apologise for any trouble or difficulties that this may cause you and I hope that you will be able to keep the job open for me for another two weeks.I would be very grateful if you could let me have your decision at your earliest convenience.",
