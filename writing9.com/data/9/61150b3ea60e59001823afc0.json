        "In modern-day society, the criteria according to which people are judged are changing. Some believe that currently, the worth of an individual is directly corresponding to their income, whereas traditional values are being forgotten. Even though there are certain individuals that concentrate their attention on wealth, I disagree with that statement, due to the reason that people are appraised by the public according to their deeds, and not their earnings.",
        "Without a doubt, there is a tendency to idolise and admire celebrities for their material possessions and the status they hold in society. Nonetheless, with the rise of \u201ccancel culture\u201d wealthy part of the population is heavily criticised for their actions. For instance, well-known actors are losing sponsorship deals as well as contracts with movie production companies, due to their problematic pasts and wrongful decisions. This proves that despite their wealth and influential positions, the public will hold them accountable for their actions, regardless of their income.",
        "By contrast, rich individuals, who generously share their wealth with charities or those in need, are continuously praised by society. These people put their resources into a good cause, thus gaining respect and admiration in the public\u2019s eye. As an example, numerous celebrities are attracting the attention of their audience to current issues, by joining charity organisations. In other words, these people are getting attention and highly valued because of their kind and giving nature.",
        "To conclude, it is believed that net worth and social status are taking over traditional values, such as kindness and generosity. Although some people tend to judge others by looking at their possessions, I am of the opinion that good deeds and personal qualities are held higher in society."
