For instance, frequently catching a cold is caused by a weak defence system. Therefore, it is obvious that inadequacy of sleep will cause a lot of difficulties.",

According to the options mentioned above, one can take the best measure suitable to his conditions.",
        "To conclude, suffering from lack of sleep is a common problem in societies nowadays. Being aware of the reason and taking proper actions into account can be helpful to deal with the challenge and save the body from potential dangers."
