        "It is often argued that young people should participate in  voluntary work in their leisure time because this may provide a positive impact on the youth and  society . In my opinion , I completely agree with this view and think that there are  many useful aspects to this approach .",
        "Firstly , it is well known that  voluntary activities help teenagers to improve rapidly their personalities  .In other words , those young people ,who decide to leave their comfort zone and participate in  uncomfortable unpaid work, meet different mentalities and stop be  timid and  introverted people. Moreover , they introduce themselves to novel ideas and new skills and therefore they become more confident and mature . For example, research shows that adolescents ,who are more sociable and  communicate  with many types of people in their daily life ,develop  strong personalities and can achieve their goals in the future  . That's why  voluntary work makes teenagers able to have a wonderful personality .",
        "Secondly , I believe that this form of activity can bring  economic growth . To put it differently , If every teenager contributes to the  unpaid community work  in their free time , the numbers of paid workers , who have a mission to do the same tasks that will be done by the youngers , can show a decrease over  time . Consequently , this can help the government to save more money and use it in other sectors . Thus , the  free activities doing by adolescents  present a valuable impact on the community .",
        "In conclusion , I strongly believe that voluntary work should be an official activity for teenagers because it offers  plenty of merits to them and  society ."
