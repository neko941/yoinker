So, I am planning to make the most of it in making this trip a memorable one for us with lots of shopping, short trips across cities and delicious food.",
        "As I know that your birthday will be here in India, I\u2019ve decided to do something special for you. First, we\u2019d start our day with some shopping in a local market which is famous for authentic and hand-made items followed by a small feast by my mother as she insisted on having a soiree with a few of my friends to celebrate your day. In the evening, we could go for a long drive exploring more places in the city.",
        "What do you think about this plan? Let me know if there is anything in particular that you would like to do here. I\u2019d be more than happy to arrange that for us.",
