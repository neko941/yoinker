        "My name is Joseph and I have been staying in apartment 32B for the past 4 years.Through  this letter, I would like to  bring your attention to the loud noise disturbance that happened recently in our building.",
        "Not a long time ago, a group of college students moved into apartment 32C and they usually play jazz music  late at night.The volume of their music is far beyond the tolerable level.I am an accountant by profession. Nowadays, due to the year-end process,my workload gets intensified and I could not sleep  for the last few days due to continuous exposure to loud music.Moreover, my migraine pain became more severe with this.So I humbly request you to meet these guys and ensure that these kinds of problems never happen again.I recommend not to permit bachelors to stay in this apartment since these activities are quite common among them.",
        "It will be well appreciated if you rectify this issue as early as possible.I am eagerly waiting to get a positive reply from your side.",
