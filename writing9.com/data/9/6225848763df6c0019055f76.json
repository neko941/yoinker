        "I recently lost my Apple Watch during my holiday in Hawaii.  It was a birthday gift that was given by my husband last December. I've used it for only a few months.  Its watch face is black and the colour of the band is pink.  My family and I travelled to Hawaii from 22nd February to 28th February 2022.  We were staying at the Mariott Hotel for 6days.  I was about to go swimming at the hotel where I stayed, and because there was no safe-deposit box around, I put it on a table that was settled by the pool.  When I returned from swimming, I realised it was gone and couldn't find it anywhere.",
