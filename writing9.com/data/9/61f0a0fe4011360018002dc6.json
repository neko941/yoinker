        "Dear Mr Bertolli,",
        "How have you been? It's been a while since we last saw each other. I've heard through Samantha of your offer for me to stay with you and your wife at your while in Rome this summer. It'd be an honour to be a guest at your lovely home. Unfortunately, it is with true sadness that I must decline your offer on this occasion. However, you'd be delighted to hear the reason behind my decision. The truth is, I have won an all-inclusive 7-day stay at a beautiful villa located on the outside of Rome. It is a truly amazing opportunity to explore a typical roman village with all expenses covered.",
        "This being said, I'd love to see you on my visit to the city. I am planning on attending a music festival on Friday 7 - Saturday 8 of August and will be free on Saturday night. I'd like to invite you and Mrs Bertolli to  dinner at a cosy restaurant named La Nonna that I discovered in my previous stay in Italy.",
        "I hope to see you soon.",
