        "I am writing this letter to thank you for giving me this book which had been fully beneficial for my university entrance exam. The book was highly recommended to me by you seeing that it is considered a comprehensive source of tests for college entrance quizzes.",
        "First, as this examination has been entirely competitive reading this book had been so useful and made me familiar with the question types of each subject that I confess if I had not  read and reviewed this, the exam would have been so difficult for me. Moreover, it boosted my confidence because I had answered the questions of the previous years in various chapters of this leaflet correctly.",
        "lastly, I am going to apologize to you since I am not able to return the book on time to you seeing that my departure date to my country was exactly the day after my test and I did not find free time to get it back to you. As a result, I will return it to you with two weeks delay.",
