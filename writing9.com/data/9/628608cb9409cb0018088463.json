        "I still remember when we were younger, you didn't like school very much. So, I think the idea of you hitting the college is erroneous, and you wouldn't like the environment of everyday quizzes and seasonal exams. I advise you to keep away from it.",
        "You are currently a 24 healthy-year-old guy, in the middle of your life, whenever and wherever you send your CV, you might have a chance to get the job. This will help you build your character for the future and get other opportunities at other companies or other departments.",
        "Being a smart worker like yourself is suitable for any kind of job. But not everyone has their body shape and muscles, so I have to tell you, you belong in the gym as a trainer or as an assistant in the beginning.  I'm sure you will love that.",
        "Write me back if you get any job so we can discuss it together.",
