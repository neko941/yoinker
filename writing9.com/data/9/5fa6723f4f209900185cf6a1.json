So, for now , both adults and children could encounter this situation. In addition, if this problem has not been solve as soon as possible, it could result in either physically and mentally effects. For example, headaches, lowing energy or feeling depressed.",
        "Secondly, this problem could be work out for several ideas which are exercising, eating healthy food, and having sufficient sleep. Indeed, for the people that have  serious stress, those activities could be really hard for them to do. Nevertheless, people around them could be another factor that can help them to fight with this bad situation. For instance, going out to exercise with them, bringing them to do other activities, or talking to them and try to make them happy.",
        "To sum up, nowadays, everyone could face a stress problem because of many factors, and this could lead to many negative consequences. However, if they knew how to take care of themselves, and people around them always support, they could avoid this problem as soon as possible."
