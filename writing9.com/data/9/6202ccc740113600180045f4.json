        "For the development of a nation, governments have to improve and expand the businesses that will help to increase the economy of the country and also able to compete with other advanced countries. But, this advancement somewhere affects the local societies and businesses rapidly, besides this local culture of every region is ended-up very soon. I partially agree with this argument and in this essay, I will discuss the reasons why development is important and what should we do to build a good relationship between small businesses and local communities.",
        "There is no doubt that government construct the larger buildings in every city of their nation, to earn more taxes from their country folks, by borrowing the shops to them for selling the products or services. This is possible because of advancements in technology, which helps to expand the small markets into supermarkets, where all are items available that are somewhat not available n the local markets. Moreover, this expansion assists the customers to buy things and pay the bill with self-checkout instead of searching for staff. In addition to this, the advancements in supermarkets provide  job opportunities to many youths in the front section as well as the back section,like, the warehouse.",
        "On the other hand, there are some drawbacks to supermarket expansion. Starting with main and most effective is shut down the business of small owners who earn some money from their daily selling and fulfil the need of their family members. Furthermore, the bond between the local cultural and local business going to weaker every day, because then consumers prefer to buy things from big malls rather than visiting the small shops which are nearby their hometown. For example, in the past time, everybody likes to buy products from their town market, because of the quality of the item and easy to buy without wasting time in travelling to city malls. But, now consumers are always ready to go out and go shopping in big malls.",
        "In conclusion, I think it is the responsibility of everyone and governments to always keep a good bond within the local societies  because the future generation will learn from our present. So, if the present discloses the traditional culture then the poor person will not feed their family."
