        "Dear Sir or Madam,",
        "My name is Dima Grigoriev and I would be glad to take some of your time for discussing the incident that happened to me in your resort on May 15. I checked in the hotel at 14:00 and went to my room 215 which is situated in the main building. I  tested the water tap and realised that there is no hot water in the bathroom.",
        "Firstly, It was very surprising for me to find myself in a room in an international five-star inn without the basic amenity, that hot water definitely is. I called the reception to notice  this flaw, but the receptionist ms Hildi gave me an answer that they were not able to fix that problem fast. Moreover, your hotel did not poses any vacant rooms at that time. I really felt devastated and dirty without the possibility of taking a shower after a long flight!",
        "In conclusion, I  spent a night in your building without a shower and hot water. I reckon that it is an inappropriate state for such a high-rated accommodation. At least, I would like to get a partial refund for my inn check N212319-4 because the five-star brand should decidedly provide a hot water supply.",
        "Looking forward to your appropriate actions.",
        "Sincerely yours,",
