        "I am writing this letter to express my gratitude towards the course called \"The Amazing Chef\", which I undertook in the month of June 2022.",
        "Think of the course, I think learning to cook new cuisines, especially a few Italian dishes, each and every day was the best part of the course. On top of it, I have had a great opportunity to meet and interact with a horde of amazing people learning alongside me. Additionally, all of this culminated in great learning.",
        "Because I have a hectic schedule every now and then, I usually cook something special for my family on the weekends, enabling us to have a wonderful time with one another. That being said, I reckon you should also include a cookery course for Indian dishes as well since these are quite popular among our local community.",
