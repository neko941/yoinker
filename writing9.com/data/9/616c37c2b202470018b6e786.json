        "With the pace of the 21st-century technology is leapt to the level which was unimaginable a few decades ago . Due to this, everything is based on it like communication , transportation , education and so on . Despite some people argue that the printed sources to study will be totally changed in the upcoming time , others argue that the style to read the material in the printed method will never be demolished . According to my opinion , I think that the printed way of course will never be disappeared .",
        "To commence with , online learning is an easy method of studying . To illustrate , as it is easily provided and free of cost , we can easily come to know about international news , overseas articles , books within a second , if we order them in a printed form then we have to wait for it  . However ,  e-learning was only popular at the time of the pandemic , It does not mean that our traditional method of learning will be disappeared . As at the time of covid-19  online learning was the only plan to course for each and every country , where the risk to get infection easily was very high and schools and colleges were closed  .",
        "Moreover , it does not provide inner satisfaction. For example , during the period of pandemic students were taking online classes , they are not happy with it , they were arguing that they want  their schools open as before the pandemic . Apart from this , online learning really affects the health of  toddlers . For instance , even though the students will be totally attached to their phones , computer and laptops for their study , it really calls the health issues like back pain, weak eyesight and so on .",
        "In conclusion , although e-learning is easy to access , it does not provide inner satisfaction to the learners . I strongly stand with the point that the traditional way of learning will never be demolished."
