        "Dear Jasmeen,",
        "I hope you are enjoying your solo Europe trip. I am writing to inform you that there has been an unfortunate fire accident in your flat which has damaged the kitchen area because of gas leak due to faulty pipeline.",
        "Luckily, I am safe as I was not in the kitchen when the gas pipe burst due to high-pressure today early morning. Though there has been considerable damage to the tiles and kitchen appliances present in that area, you need not  worry about the expenses as it is covered under the guaranteed insurance to be paid by the company in case of any malfunctioning. The society maintenance department has confirmed that this incident happened due to  negligence on the company\u2019s behalf and issued them an order to renovate the entire kitchen area and pay for the loss of electrical appliances.",
        "You need not worry about the renovation as I would oversee it personally and get it completed before your return next month. Enjoy the rest of your trip and do send me some pictures whenever you can.",
        "Yours lovingly,",
