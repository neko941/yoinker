        "Dear Sir,",
        "I am writing to you with regards to your article published in 'The Times Now' newspaper dated 15th March 2022. Your article described that there is  very little versatility among the structures of town centres across my country. However, I completely disagree with your opinion.",
        "Although, there were few descriptions regarding the historical significance and artistic carvings of the buildings that you described were impressive but claiming that all of them looked similar was a statement unacceptable to me. These structures were built in our country during British rule. Each and every piece of material required for construction was exported either from Italy or Paris. Certainly, they are old and might look similar but they were designed and constructed with different techniques and shows variations if looked at carefully.",
        "Thus, I am delighted to invite you to visit our town where I will happily guide you to our town centre and provide you with the perspective to look at these centres differently.",
        "Yours truly,",
