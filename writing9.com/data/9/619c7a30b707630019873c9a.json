        "In some nations, there are a lot of high guarantee graduates except they do not have a job in recent. In this essay, I will discuss the reasons and put my opinion at the last.",
        "To begin with, it is evident that they have too much hope to work. This means that they are likely to have an unrealistic desire in the working place. For example, they want to have a high salary because they consider that they have the quality to do everything without other repetitions. Furthermore, they might be irritated about their rank because they hope their ability is incredible on their own. Hence, they have to believe the suitable treatment during work.",
        "Moreover, there is no doubt that they  do not tend to have a good conversation with colleagues. This is because they may look down on others. In particular, If their supervisor does not good at  work, they consider that why am I low status in this job and I should not work as a normal worker.   Additionally, they do not show  politeness to others because they are not able to think about co-workers\u2019 feelings. For instance, they do not want to go out and they always blame  other people except they do not get the reword in their job.  As the result, they might not fit in their place of work.",
        "In the nutshell, from my point of view, people who have high intelligence can not have a certain job because  they are too many believers.  In addition, they always show  rudeness to peers and can not fit work areas. Lastly, they might be unemployed."
