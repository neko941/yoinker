        "I am writing this letter to express my dissatisfaction with the Sony laptop that I purchased from your city centre branch 2 months ago.",
        "As the new financial year started, my company asked us to purchase a new laptop for the working purpose. When visiting your store, I was captivated by the latest Sony computer, so I decided to buy it immediately. However, after 4 days of using this laptop, I realized that I was unable to save various types of documents occasionally such as word and excel.",
        "This issue has affected my work productivity and professional attitudes. For example, I could not find the financial report that I have completed and saved when I was having a meeting with my clients. You can imagine how devasted and embarrassed I was.",
        "Based on the fact, I except my current laptop can be replaced by a new laptop that does not have any system issues at the earliest possible opportunity. In addition, I believe I am entitled to compensation for the inconvenience that this equipment caused.",
        "If you would like to discuss my issue further, please contact me without hesitation. I am looking forward to hearing from you.",
        "Yours faithfully,",
