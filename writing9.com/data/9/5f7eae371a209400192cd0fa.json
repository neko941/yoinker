        "Sports is the precedence of masses and in many realms oh the globe there is ongoing telecast for proper coverage of live sports action.However, many suggest that it discourages young ones to compete in sports whereas others disagree.My dissertation will shed light on both views with suitable examples; shaping my viewpoint at the end.",
        "To commence with, the sports shows are telecasted in order to provide continuation info to million sports fan out there. Due to this, it is often that many individuals leave their practices for enjoying the live-action of there signature players. For instance, it was recorded that during football WorldCup 2016 the training session of every city tumble with 70% and only a  few were seen in the playing grounds. Consequently,the attention of young players can be distracted from there subjective physical games as they love to watch big events like world cups.",
        "On contrary,this trend can be highly beneficial as it inspires teenagers to perform better in their respective games. To elaborate, there are a plethora of sports formats especially league which comprises most native and young players, therefore, watching them can surge the motivation among the youth for becoming a sports player. For example, Virat Kohli the captain of Indian cricket team reveals that  he grew up watching the great Sachin Tendulkar. So, the question arises, from where the prestige talent would have come? If there was no live streaming. Subsequently, the great performers inspire umpteen infant to rise in their games.",
        "In conclusion, Although, the matches distract the tenants , I believe, this is because there is affection toward te game which ultimately will uplift them to play for there nations, thus it is a positive development. Hence, the live telecast must go on"
