        "As you know it is winter now and this also aggravates the situation since I am not able to use the car. Hopefully, your homeowner's insurance will cover this kind of damage. Please check with them to see if it is covered. If they do not pay for it, I will get two repair estimates for you so that you can determine how you will pay for the repair.",
        "Perhaps we could meet this Saturday afternoon to discuss our options. In case you are not available at that time please let me know so that we would be able to make an appointment for some other time.",
        "Thank you in advance for your kind and considerate attention to the matter. Yours sincerely,",
