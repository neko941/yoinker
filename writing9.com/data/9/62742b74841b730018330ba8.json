        "I am writing this letter regarding an opening job position at one of your restaurants.",
        "I saw it in the opportunity column of today's newspaper. As mentioned, the vacancy is for the Yangon branch, which is nearby my house. Due to my concurrent studies, I still need to commute to the university after my working hours. So, I believe working at a walking distance job will be a good fit for both my education and career development.",
        "If you asked me, I would say I had previous work expertise related to the restaurant industry. To be more specific, I have been working in my uncle's food court for 2 years while I was attending  high school. After getting a scholarship to Yangon University, I had to move there.",
        "I was wondering if you could praise me for this job position. I am available from next week - around 9 AM to 3 PM. I would also appreciate it if you could arrange  an online interview rather than a physical meeting as I was out of town at the moment. I believe it is a viable idea for us.",
