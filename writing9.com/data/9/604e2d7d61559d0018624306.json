        "The government of the few nations has been suffering from many challenges. This will lead to the academic institution has to manage the pupil\u2019s action. The essay will discuss the reason for this impact and the measures that are taken to curb it as per my opinion; are discussed in the below paragraphs.",
        "To begin with, the predominant reason behind the students misbehave is that the children have given more freedom in their home. Due to this as time passes, they are not ready to hear any instructions from the person. Even they always wish to complete their desires; never think about anyone else. Moreover, with the advancement,  technology had paid its role in the child\u2019s life. As some of the programs on the internet and  television shows criminal activity which will divert the child\u2019s mind. For example, research conducted shows that the child can learn new things by taking an observation of the surroundings.",
        "On the other hand, there are certain precautionary steps that are taken by the parents and the school to manage the children\u2019s actions. The first remedial action is that the parents should spend more time with their child. As they can provide them with guidance and support as a result, they never feel alone and participate in the wrong activity. Furthermore, the schools can make a change in their curriculum by adding new subjects which teach the pupils about the discipline. For instance, this will become more impactful by giving awards at the end of each year for those who have a disciplined attitude; this provokes the students to follow the rules.",
        "In conclusion, the modernized world has played a crucial role in the change of the students' action and this will be managed by the parents by giving time and the schools by adding new subjects which inculcate its importance."
