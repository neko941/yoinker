        "My name is Arjun Anaji, a resident of Mysuru, India. I am writing to you regarding an article that was published by your magazine last week about my city as the information provided is incorrect. Please allow me to explain the issue and to request  the necessary corrections.",
        "To begin with, I read the international travel magazine produced by your publications on 12th November 2021. I found that the article contained wrong facts about the cleanliness and hygiene of the place where I am residing. It stated that most parts were full of dust and garbage. But it is not true as the city has been chosen as the cleanest one in the country for consecutive years in the recent past. Since the place is known for its rich heritage and culture,  tourism will be severely impacted  due to this misinterpretation.",
        "Hence, I would request you to perform  thorough research on this matter and publish another article with  corrections on the information that was wrongly mentioned. I hope to hear from you soon.",
        "Yours sincerely,",
