        "People have many different opinions about how the national authorities should measure their countries\u2019 progress. While I agree with the idea that economic progress is seen as a fundamental goal for governments, I support the other idea that social services like medical care and schooling programs are just as important.",
        "On the one hand, I support the idea that economic growth is one of the government\u2019s great ambitions for several reasons. Firstly, economic progress will help the authorities to allocate a larger amount of money to social security. For example, a government with higher revenues can invest many national budgets in the country's education system and hospitals. Secondly, a healthy economy will contribute to a lower unemployment rate and many high-paying jobs for all citizens. Finally, a strong economy can help a country\u2019s standing on the global stage, in terms of its political influence and trading power.",
        "On the other hand, I believe that social services such as health care and education are just as significant as the economic factors mentioned above. To put it another way, a government is created by the taxes from valuable workforces of their country. Therefore, the state has the responsibility to offer them free health care facilities and teaching programs. Additionally, the benefit of improving the medical services and the learning system is that this would produce good citizens. If a country has many well-educated and healthy residents, this will bring considerable benefits to the government, especially the economic prosperity.",
        "In conclusion, while I believe that economic growth is one of the Governments\u2019 primary goals, I support the idea that training and health criteria are equally significant."
