        "Dear Sir or Madam,",
        "With regards to a full-day meeting which we organized at your prestigious hotel, I would like to thank you for your professional services and kind hospitality. As per our meeting participants, they loved the overall ambience of the hotel, the housekeeping, and the overall experience of spending time there. If there were not for your well-trained staff and formal arrangement, we would not have received such positive comments from our guests.",
        "However, after having lunch during that meeting, a lot of our participants complained about the food. In particular, they did not like the taste, as lots of dishes did not seem fresh, and some of them were too spicy and oily. Resultingly, most of them could not eat to their full, and they had to resort to nearby restaurants afterwards to satisfy their appetite.",
        "As the rest of our experience, including the quick service and conference room, was quite remarkable. We suggest that you shall pay more attention to the training of your chefs and other kitchen staff so we can book your hotel for our future meetings as well.",
        "Yours sincerely,",
