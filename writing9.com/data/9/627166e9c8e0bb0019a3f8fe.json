        "Dear Sir/Madam,",
        "I am the manager of KMB company that reserved your hotel for an annual meeting on 6th March. I am writing to express some dissatisfaction with your food.",
        "In spite of some objections, we were enjoying lunch when the piano was played during that time  because it gave us a strange quietness. Also, your worker like waiters and receptionists were trained well, so their hospitality was great. Finally, we appreciate your design due to the flower arrangement of the hotel entrance.",
        "These days people often go on a balanced diet and prefer to eat healthy meals. Thus, some participants tend to eat fish and chips, but they did not find any seafood on the menu. In addition, serving meat was changed to cold so that it was not be eaten. Similarly, your dishes were incredibly cracked which surprised us.",
        "Hence, I would suggest you replace your containers with a new and healthy model because of respect to the customer. Moreover, warmers can be used to keep warm foods from the kitchen to desks.",
        "I hope you can settle these matters in the future.",
        "Yours sincerely,",
