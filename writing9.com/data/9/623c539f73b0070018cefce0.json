        "Dear John,",
        "Thanks for dropping me some lines. Please excuse me for being so slow at getting back to you, but I have been busy lately. I am really sorry to know that you are not enjoying your new school and that you have not made new friends already. Such horrible news!",
        "I understand that meeting people in a different environment than the one you are used to, can be quite intimidating. But if you take one step beyond, I am sure that you'll find that the rest of the students are as eager to get to know you as you are to them. If I were you I would enrol on any club or extra activity that your school offers, so you will meet people in a much more relaxed place. I suggest you  join a club that's related to anything you could be interested in, music, literature, sports... The theme is not important. Surely, your classmates will be very interested in listening to new ideas and perspectives that you could have. But don't be too smart! People hate smart-asses. And be patient. Building a good friendship always takes time.",
        "Believe me when I say that you are a person that is worth knowing. Don't worry because they will find out soon. Keep me informed about how is everything going. And I beg your pardon for not having time enough to write to you as much as I would like.",
