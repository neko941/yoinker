        "How are you? I hope this letter finds you well. As you already know, I am planning to attend my Master's degree at Queen's College in London. It is two years course along with six months project from any Industry. I am excited that my course starts in April this year.",
        "Having said that, I am also anxious about my stay expenses during the course, as things are relatively expensive in London.  As you know about the economic situation and I'm just wondering if you could help me find a part-time job there and get some references for the job, so I can cover my personal expenses.",
        "My course will take approximately two years to complete. The classes will be normally held on weekdays only and I will be free on weekends. Hence, It would be a great help if you could introduce me to any part-time job available around the University area and look for the classified section in the local newspaper.",
        "I would really appreciate your help and support. Thank you in advance.",
        "Best wishes,",
