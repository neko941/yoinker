I believe I already informed you last time that I am not happy in my previous company. My co-workers are so toxic and uncooperative. I do not want to stay in that kind of environment. It is not good for my health, physically and emotionally.",
        "Let me share with you about my new job. Same with the previous one, I am still an accountant here, but more on reporting. I will be assisting the Financial Director with the preparation of the monthly reports. The offer is  quite good, although is not the same as my salary before. But it doesn't matter and is not a big deal. My colleague is very friendly and well behaved. Another thing and another blessing is  my application for Australia was granted.",
