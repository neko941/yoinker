        "These days, having an academic scope from the institution is significant for nations in future. Although a number of voters become successful in their lives, without owing professional degree. In my view, educational qualification has been an essential factor for increasing a higher degree. In contrast, pursuing goals can be important rather than learning.",
        "To begin with, academic training is one of the vital factors that crowd assume to obtain for achievement in their lives. Also, this statement can be accurate due to when national studies at universities, all of their skills namely, leadership, communication, and teamwork can be improved. For instance, a number of nations have a communication problem and never participate in social experience, but when they will go to the public institution they have to connect to other nations. In addition, studying can provide them to contribute positively to society because the community have adequate knowledge and could improve the economy. Consequently, university education has benefits for individuals and the community.",
        "On the other hand, the educational scope does not necessary for success, there are some factors involved in it. Firstly, many civilians prefer to select work rather than study, and they want to develop their professional qualifications .Because for these national main priority is pursuing their ambitions and they want to obtain experience. For example,  Portugal soccer player Ronaldo is a successful person in the world, nevertheless, he does not own an academic degree. My point is, for some folk follow their desires are more significant than education. Hence, if you want to become an expert in a special field, you have to utilize all skills together not only concentrate on one factor.",
        "In conclusion, higher education in public universities has many pros but is not only the key for success due to some nations have other trained and they are successful .Thus, for success in  ,life some other factors are involved."
