        "I am sorry, about the noise, as you know, my apartment has two bathrooms  one of them shares a wall  with your unit. Unfortunately last week I noticed the toilet water is blocked, I tried to fix it but did not become ok. So, faced with huge repairs that were the main reason for those undesirable noises. In addition, I tried to set the best time for construction in the morning except at weekends but the repairman said did not have any additional time in his schedule, so, we had to do more hours in a day until 3 or 4 pm.",
        "Fortunately, all of the construction has been finished and I want to invite you for dinner this weekend I am sure we can have a good time  together as well as, can watch the latest Hollywood movie.",
        "Thank you for taking the time and your consideration of my letter.I will see you soon.",
        "Yours sincerely,",
