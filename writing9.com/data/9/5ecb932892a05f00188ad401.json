        "Certain people consider that finance\u00a0 for study should be utilized on the latest technology, whereas, others ponder that spending funds on the trainers could be beneficial. In my opinion, I believe with this notion that equal distribution of the budget is significant because cutting-edge technology aid students to learn innovative things and well- trained teachers can assist them to improve their scores for a great career.",
        "On the one hand, modern computers play a vital role in the education sector. To be more precise, nowadays, technology is booming rapidly, therefore, it is imperative that learners must get familiar with the best technical equipment such as graphic design, web and VFX, animation, and programming languages in the beginning, so that one can have a lucrative career when they step out into  the professional\u00a0world. Additionally, these courses are highly expensive  and in a great demand. Thus, the schools must have modernized\u00a0computer labs for smart learning.",
        "On the other hand, allocating funds to the teachers is also significant. Simply stated, instructors are the pillars in a student\u2019s life, hence, a separate budget must be given to them in order to upgrade their current knowledge, for instance, modern\u00a0teaching techniques, less homework policy, and more practical sessions to make their\u00a0particular subject more interactive. Moreover, specific classes can be conducted to handle  a stubborn child in the class without raising their hands on them and improve their results.",
        "In conclusion, I cannot but profoundly affirm that a proper division of the amount of better computers and the teachers is indispensable and much needed in the education sector to  raise the quality of education."
