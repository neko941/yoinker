        "A highly controversial issue in the contemporary world relates to whether the nation should grow fruits and vegetables for their citizens to eat well or to buy from other countries . There is no denying the fact that growing food in the home country has numerous upsides. I firmly agree and withstand the given notion. This essay will further elaborate on my visions in the forthcoming paragraphs.",
        "To begin With, There are a number of arguments in favour of my stance. The most preponderant is that beyond doubt a country with healthy management of food for their nation leads to numerous advantages first and foremost the meal is accessible to entire citizens at an economical price and the population elevate their fitness and health level owing to hygienic ingredients.  for, instance, Pakistan is primarily prominent in the world owing to its agriculture manufacturing for their nations and according to a world ,report more than 70% of folk are reliant on that profession. In addition to this, it exports sugars and rice to other countries to boost the economy. there are numerous other benefits in various fields. Thanks to the wide range of advantages it offers, not only does one benefit more when it comes to being effective, but they can enhance productivity and quality of their lives, with much ease, efficacy, and convenience. Needless to say, all these merits stand out in good stead, as far as augmenting the chances of prosperity and excellence is concerned.",
        "On the other hand, Another pivotal factor in the aforementioned proposition is that it is only likely to help one thrive and excel in varied areas. Besides, when only one follows a system, can they broaden their horizons, hence learning these attributes as dedication and perseverance. as a result, it is apparent why myriad are in favour of\u00a0extensive production of home snacks. to cite an example, bread is grown in the tropical areas contains a bunch of nutrition and healthy elevates the health levels of the nations. in order to maintain health and fitness growing the vegetables in your own country is crucial.",
        "Finally, to recapitulate the aforementioned arguments, I would like to restate my position that the benefits of home food production are indeed too great to ignore the need for imported cuisine and paid heavy taxes on it in order to feed their nations well in the current age."
