Now, I am thinking that if you can give him some extra classes so that he can learn fast that would be great.",

        "I would like to know if you are available over the weekend for one or two hours, I would be happy to send my child for extra classes. I am sure he can learn fast if you try teaching him using the computer as he is fond of it.",
