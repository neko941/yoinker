        "Dear Sir,",
        "I am Karthi and staying in Eastern Road, London which is a nearby a tennis court. I am writing this letter to express my interest in an advertisement for your tennis program. I was very much interested to play tennis. In my school days, I participated and was awarded for achievement in tennis. After finishing school I am not able to allocate time to developing my skill in tennis. When I saw your advertisement I remember my childhood and feel happy to get a chance to start again. When I saw the course duration it takes almost to complete the entire program. But my university exam begins within six months and also  I have to go for Induction training in another place. So I will be available for six months. Even though there are some hardships I am very much interested to join the course.",
        "Can you please consider my situation and admit to learning the course. If possible, Considering my short duration please refund some part amount which I am going to pay fully at the time of admission.",
        "Thanks for your consideration and hope to get a positive from your side.",
        "Yours sincerely",
        "Karthi"
