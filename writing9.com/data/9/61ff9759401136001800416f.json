        "Some people argue that pay should be the ultimate decider when applying for a job. Although money is important, however, I completely disagree with it being the only major factor. This essay will discuss other important considerations that can affect employment followed by a reasoned conclusion thereafter.",
        "Some persons are of the opinion that having a lucrative position in the office offer financial stability to the staff. As such, one can only live a good life if one secured  decent work. For example, with plenty of money in his bank account, he is able to pay bills and care for his household. Therefore, attention should be focused on being a highly-paid staff no matter the outcome.",
        "Even though the argument above seemed logical, not all high-paying jobs bring happiness. Firstly, a lot of these companies do illegal things which the naive worker can be manipulated into taking part in. For instance, statistics have shown that the most common cause of imprisonment in firms is related to fraudulent activities most of which the employees were not aware of. Hence, making them serve jail terms that can affect their careers in the future.",
        "",
        "Lastly, there are serious occupational hazards associated with some work. Consequently, it is very important to understand the nature of employment before choosing to be a staff. To further illustrate, from another recent survey, it was shown that many industrial workers who came down with occupational lung diseases years later following inhalation of chemical fumes and specks of dust agreed that they would not have taken the job if they understood the nature of sickness that could arise ab initio. Thus, having genuine health concerns is vital.",
        "In conclusion, money should not be the only determiner for working as other factors like legality and medical safety are of vital significance."
