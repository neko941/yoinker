        "Alternatively, I suggest that you should apply for a job instead. To illustrate, if you can start  yourself a proper career, you will be able to earn a decent amount of money every month, which is going to give you financial freedom from your parents. Moreover, you will also be able to travel more as you can save more.",
        "Finally, I would like to give you some hints about what type of tasks that you can look for. Since you play the guitar very well you would make an excellent music teacher. Additionally, working as a driver for Uber or Kareem cannot be a bad idea at all until you settle on a more stable career.",
        "I am looking forward to your reply; you can always reach me via email or phone. Stay safe and see you soon.",
