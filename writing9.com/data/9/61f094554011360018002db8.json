Before moving to Montreal, I worked for twelve years at a multinational insurance company in Brazil. In this company, I had had a great experience in the accounts payable department where I learned all the routines including how to manage a cash flow. After that, at the same company, I had an opportunity to work in the payroll department as a coordinator since I took some courses related to payroll laws.",
