        "Dear members of the local council,",
        "My neighbourhood has recently faced an issue with the garbage collection system we have in place. It seems that the trash containers are not cleaned up on schedule. In addition to this, they do not have top lids that could be closed properly.",
        "Unfortunately, this situation led to some unfortunate consequences. First of all, there is an unpleasant smell in this area. Secondly, we often see dangerous wild animals nearby \u2014\u00a0i.e., rats, squirrels, and even racoons. At last, it started bringing homeless people to dig in the trash.",
        "As one of the possible options, I would suggest bringing in another service company who handles the rubbish collection. Also, we can try to gather some funding from the locals to buy new trash containers that can be sealed after use. I do think that it might help us to deal with this issue.",
        "Hope to hear from you on that matter soon. Thank you for your hard work and dedication.",
        "Best Regards,",
