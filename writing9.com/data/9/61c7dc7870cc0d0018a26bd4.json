In many cases, the people being monitored are unaware that this is happening. Do you think the advantages of this development outweigh the disadvantages?",

        "Many are of the opinion that there is an increase in recent technological advancement recording humans\u2019 voices and actions while some do not aware of the happening. Although I agree that there are many advantages of advanced technology like more security for humans\u2019 lives, there are some disadvantages of rapid technology as well. Both sides along with my perspective will be outlined in the following paragraphs.",
        "There are many reasons why people think that the growth of machinery tends to interrupt people\u2019s lives. The most important one is that automatic intelligence or AI is decided for tracking everything that happened in the world, including humans\u2019 activities, leading to intrude the privacy of humans. Moreover, nowadays have been witnessing the rise of telephone features that record both human\u2019s voices automatically in their phone or private chat and human\u2019s actions with no permission from users. For instance, the feature of call in Android\u2019s phone is designed to record every phone call between callers and receivers without any setting from the phone\u2019s owners. Thus, this situation leads to more debate about how many drawbacks smart technology are.",
        "Even though there are various negative sides to technological advancement, I hold the view that the positive sides outweigh them. To begin with, the automatically recorded programs in both mobile phones and cameras are invented to be helpful in many emergency cases that most humans are not aware of. For example, many people don\u2019t know that they want more security in their lives when they travel alone, AI can be their little bodyguards that protect not only physical movement but also the mental situations for the users. To explain more, there are many cases that people have emergency illnesses such as low heart rate or high blood pressure, the system automatically sends the disfunction of users\u2019 bodies to their relatives or doctors by a signal in the phone\u2019s call, resulting in the on-time urgent treatment.",
        "To conclude, despite several detrimental aspects of automatically recording devices, from my point of view, the beneficial aspects outweigh them. However, the best way to live with the rapid automation with low human\u2019s harm may be to adopt a more private policy in the devices."
