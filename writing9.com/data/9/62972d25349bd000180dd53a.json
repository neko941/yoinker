I am  an accounting of your employees, ready to go there and learn new abilities. If you remember sometimes we have some problems with the new rules of ACCA and I believe that it is the best chance to solve them. Besides, I can visit our colleagues in head office and be friends. Also, I could  teach anything which is important to our colleagues to Mr Ramtin. He is the genius co-worker that I have ever had. Moreover, if there is another problem, he can call me.",
