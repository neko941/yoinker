However, I want to make it clear that I had no computer-related course in my elementary school mainly due to work overload. But this does not mean that I am not interested in learning about computers. In fact, I always wished to have one such course.",
        "Could you make an exception for me?I would be grateful if you give me an opportunity to do this subject. I can assure you that you will not regret  giving me a chance as I will put all my efforts to do it. Moreover, I am a fast learner and I grasp  things quickly. In spite of this, if you are doubtful about my performance, I can show you my academic grades.",
