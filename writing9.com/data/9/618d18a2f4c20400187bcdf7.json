        "Dear Mr Felix,",
        "My name is Farhana Jabeen and I am writing this letter with reference to your concert held on 26th October at LMS stadium. Firstly, I would like to congratulate you on the huge success of your show and I was fortunate enough to be able to attend it. I am a huge admirer of your work and was extremely thrilled to watch you perform. Needless to say, the performance was outstanding and it was a delight to hear you sing in person with your angelic voice.",
        "I really wanted to meet and congratulate you in person, however, it seemed impossible during the concert. So, I decided to write and share a few details about my musical activities. I am a trained violin artist. I have been practising since I was nine. I am currently a member of a band, therefore, I spend most of the time surrounded by music.In addition to this, I have recently started composing a few songs on my own and trying to seek feedback on the same.",
        "So, I would really appreciate it if you could spare some time and review my work on these songs. Although it might be challenging considering your busy schedule, it would really boost my confidence if you would share your thoughts and feedback along with suggesting a mentor for my future prospects based on your review of my work.",
        "Thank you for taking the time to read my letter.",
        "Yours sincerely,",
