        "Most nations globally are united together in the fight for humanity even if they are different culturally. Some people are of the opinion that enhancing trade and cultural relations is seen as a positive move whereas others believe that this move will annihilate the country's identity. In this essay, I will discuss both points and argue that bringing nations together should be seen as a win because of these reasons: world peace, financial help and military aid when needed.",
        "To begin, the enhancement of business and personal relationships have long been seen between nations as a great way of developing brotherhood/sisterhood. For instance, Canada and USA despite their differences are known to be allies. This helped form a bond that is mutually beneficial for trade, financial help and military aid as well. Canadian soldiers were widely known to have helped the USA when they were at war. Hence, the more the allies, the lesser the need for war.",
        "Furthermore, clothing designers are widely known to look at different countries and their styles when lacking in ideas. There is also a major difference in the ideologies of different nations politically.  For these reasons, many believe that this is leading to the lost identity of the nation in question. The more united we are, there more the loss of identity in this case according to these citizens.",
        "Finally, I believe that bringing nations together in terms of business and culture will have great advantages economically and for developing personal relationships. The loss of identity is a minimal disadvantage considering most people will appreciate the differences anyway."
