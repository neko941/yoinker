        "Dear Madam or Sir,",
        "I am writing to you regarding a recent issue with the garbage collection system which cannot remove the whole garbage from the trash cans. Let me elaborate more on this.",
        "Recently, I noticed that our trash can is not emptied properly, and the problem started about a week ago. The truck which collects the rubbish has a hydraulic arm on it which grabs the trash container and makes it upside down to remove everything out of it. And since the arm does not work fine, part of the food remaining would stay in the container. Hence, in some cases, the leftovers would cause a dreadful smell which can be sensed everywhere within the neighbourhood.",
        "Consequently, I decided to bring your attention to the problem with the system. Although it might seem expensive to replace the hydraulic arm or the motor, the resulting side effects might be more harmful to the neighbourhood and its people. I hope this letter convinces you to take immediate action.",
        "Sincerely yours,",
