        "I am writing this letter to express my happiness. Last Sunday on April 17th, I and my friends had a dinner party at your restaurant.",
        "It was to celebrate my 40th birthday on Sunday, hence I booked a table to throw a party for my friends. I would like to extend my rapture for the luscious meal and great service that we had received. We have ordered a vegetarian meal with a few starters and desserts at the end. My friends really enjoyed the delicious meal since it is freshly prepared food with some locally sourced veggies. At one stage we were in dilemma to choose the cuisine as the items were all luscious.",
        "In the end, the desert is not to be forgotten as the chef had used seasonal fruits and made a delicious fruits salad. We were extremely happy to receive the kind of service that we had received during the dinner. I would like to commend the job done by Mr John who was serving the food during the celebration.",
