        "My name is Cole. I have attended a bread cookery course last month. It was an amazing class I have studied before. I like it so much that I have told my best friend Sammy and Antony to do studying for my same class.",
        "According to the schedule, we have 2 lessons every week, so I have done eight classes in my course. Additionally, I bake one or two times in each class, which means that I have cooked more than 8 times since the course.  It is unbelievable because I didn't like cooking at all before.",
        "As you know, I like eating cake, a lot of cakes are delicious. I couldn't stop thinking if our school can supply another cake bakery program, how nice it will be. I want to open a bakery shop in the future after finishing all these courses.",
