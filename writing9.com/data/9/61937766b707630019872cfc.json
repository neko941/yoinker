        "Many people assume that the key consideration about choosing a career is the size of their income. In my opinion, it is essential to have a reasonable salary, however, there are other elements which are equally important as money.",
        "On the one hand, people find a profession to meet their basic expenses and lifestyle. For example, we all have a financial burden and need to pay for the food, the electronic bill, the house rent, the transportation fees, etc. Therefore, we go to work every day to finish our financial goals. If companies give a good income, we can feel happy daily life. In addition, we use the salary to improve ourself like studying the skill courses, having the health care or eating the organic foods, which can lead our to become productive employers.",
        "On the other hand, it is necessary to consider the other factors as significant as the salary. The first element is that the friendly work environment which can affect our willingness as co-workers. The employers usually spend around eleven hours in the company, so we need people who not only complete the tasks together but also share friends. The second element is that professional achievement like the experiences on the work, the opportunity to training or the creative activities. The more developed personal in work, the more happiness we have.",
        "In conclusion, the salary is the important factor when we decide to choose a job. Besides, there are some elements which we have to consider to our work-life balance."
