        "I partly agree with the statement that nowadays we have a lot of variety. With the growth of capitalist society and rapidly growing business, this is not a surprise, however, with the growing population and already existing billions of people, this choice is, in fact, justified.",
        "Firstly, as society turned towards capitalism from the early 18th century and open trade was permitted by governments, a bunch of businesses rose. Running a business can be one of the most profitable things. Consequently, a hoard of people jumped on the bandwagon. This increment of trade led to an increment in the choice of things available in the market. Now there are thousands of brands of clothes, hundreds of thousands of restaurants and there exists a lot of players in almost every possible type of business. This extraordinary amount of choice leads to a lot of problems. For example, people spend hours shopping for clothes in shopping complexes, and choosing a car to buy can be a process involving months of time, if per se there existed fewer alternatives to buy from, billions of cumulative hours of humanity could be saved. Nonetheless, if a person knows what they are looking for, then the choices don\u2019t really affect them as much.",
        "On the other hand, with the rapidly growing and differentiating population, every individual has their personal taste. Furthermore, said personal taste should be catered to. And considering how wildly different individual tastes can be, it only makes sense that businesses would try to cater to all of them. Like, the expendable income a person in the United States would have is far higher than someone in India would, so the business can cater to both these markers by producing goods at different price points. This way they can serve a greater audience, but everyone can still enjoy their products. Further, choice enables businesses to be more competitive and results in a better market for a consumer as competition results in lowering of prices of goods, and improvement in their quality.",
        "In conclusion, I stand by my statement that sometimes these choices can be exhausting but in the ,end these choices help improve living standards and help everyone, regardless of their financial status enjoy goods from similar brands."
