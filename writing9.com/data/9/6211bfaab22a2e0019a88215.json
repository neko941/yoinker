        "Dear Mr Smith,",
        "I am writing regarding the voluntary job advertised on the museum\u2019s website. It has been a while that I have been seeking a part-time job to spend my time productively, as I am a junior student and cannot apply for a full-time career. Moreover, as this job is consistent with my interests in history and traditional arts, not having an income is not an all-important matter to me.",
        "As I am bilingual and speak Spanish and English fluently, and most of our hometown\u2019s tourists are Spanish, I can effectively communicate with those who visit the museum and guide them around. In addition, I can advertise in the university to draw students to this centre which is financially and culturally beneficial.",
        "In terms of work time, although I have university classes during the weekdays, I can manage to be present at the gallery through the evening shifts. I can be available full-time at the weekends if there is not the exam season.",
        "I look forward to receiving your answer,",
        "Yours sincerely,",
