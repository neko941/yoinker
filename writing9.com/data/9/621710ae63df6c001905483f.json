        "There is no doubt that the life of a public figure is not easy, especially when they are popular. Although many believe that these people have their fair share of hardships, I opine that it has more benefits. In this essay, I will discuss both sides of the argument and state my opinion on this matter.",
        "First and foremost, those who believe that celebrities do not have any privacy might argue that these personalities are always in news and they are judged on every little action. One reason for this is that the media coverage has increased a lot in recent times, highlighting their private life more than their professional life and trying to create controversies. For instance, even when a popular athlete wants to go for dinner with their friends or family, paparazzi still follow them to click photographs and create some news. In contrast, if these media houses did not follow film stars everywhere, they would get some private time with their family.",
        "On the other hand, I firmly believe that celebrities earn a huge amount of wealth as a result of being popular. This is because popular film stars earn millions of dollars for every film or project. Furthermore, They also get additional cash doing advertisements or endorsing a brand. For example, Shahrukh khan who is a popular actor in Bollywood is one of the richest men in the world. However, if Shahrukh khan had not been so well-liked, he would not have become one of the wealthiest people on the whole planet.",
        "In conclusion, while there can be some complications being in the public eye all the time due to the lack of privacy, It can not be denied that public figures earn more than enough wealth via movie contracts, advertisements and endorsements compensating for these troubles."
