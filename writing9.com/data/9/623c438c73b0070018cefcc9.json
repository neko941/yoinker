        "According to the HR department in our company, Last week I attended a health and safety conference on behalf of our company. It is worth saying that the conference was a most valuable one and actually, I did not expect it before I attend it. Primarily, that conference was held by the Australian health  committee members and it lasted 5 hours of time including 30 minutes lunch break. They covered the major 3 topics by using many different examples from day to day life.",
        "Firstly, they gave information about how we can achieve industrial health and safety. Secondly, the committee members talked about social health and well being in regards to the current variety of social infections and, finally, they presented many details about how we should prepare for the employee's work safety using discussed rules and disciplines.",
        "So, I think it will be better if we can share this useful information with all our staff members and in order to present visual pictures and, videos it might be better if we can use our main auditorium for this. Then I will suggest conducting this presentation as soon as possible because it will be better for our staff's future in this company.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Regards,",
        "John"
