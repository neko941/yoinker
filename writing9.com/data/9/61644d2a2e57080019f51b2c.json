        "Dear Mr Mathew,",
        "I am writing this letter to you to bring your attention to the menu and quality of food in your cafeteria, Bruch Time. I am Isha, a student of B.Art.",
        "Firstly, I want to mention that the ambience in the cafeteria is very good and I really liked the french architect theme. Secondly, the seating arrangement is very comfortable. Finally, the location is worth mentioning as it  is very easy to reach there.",
        "However, there are some issues with the menu and quality of food. Most of the food is awesome but the dishes involved with the fish items are pathetic; they look stale and taste very bad. In addition, the number of non-vegetarian dishes on the card is very limited.",
        "Therefore, I feel that some more dishes for non-vegetarians should be added to the menu such as chicken tikka and chicken kebabs. Moreover, please check with the chef what's wrong with the fish dishes.",
        "Hoping to hear from you soon",
        "Yours sincerely,",
