        "In this modern era, some people believe that ads are a powerful tool to convince mass. However, due to its ubiquitous appearance, it is no longer draws much attention from society. There are some valid notions that support both arguments which I will elaborate on in the following paragraphs.",
        "To begin with, commercial advertisement is indeed persuasive due to its repeated exposure with great content. People tend to remember the information and absorb it into their subconscious mind, therefore will lead them to purchase the products in the future. For example, a snacks product that places its advertisement on a big billboard on a vital road, and puts the ads into the radio show will get attention from commuters who are stuck in traffic jams during busy hours. Additionally, more businesses form new ways to deliver their advertisement through influencers, for instance, one of the well-known hair care products that want to target males uses Cristian Ronaldo testimony and reviews in order to influence men to use their product.",
        "On the other hand, the advertisements no longer attract much attention due to two reasons. First, the ubiquity of the ads with the same and monotonous content will make people disinterested. Secondly, commercials that are not targeted to individual\u2019s needs and preferences tend to attract less attention. To illustrate, the diaper products ads that were seen by the teenagers most likely will get skipped since the product does not align with their needs.",
        "By way of conclusion, I believe that ads, in general, are still effective to attract customers and persuade them to purchase the product as long as there is continuous customization of the content and the right targeting to individuals."
