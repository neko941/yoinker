        "Arguably, connoisseurs throughout the world have debated whether the use of chemical manure in   the farms surpass its disadvantages or not. Personally, I believe it does not outweigh since these  toxic elements damage permanently the land. However, it has its swift benefits. This essay will shed light  on both sides of the view  and provide evidence to prove the arguments.",
        "On the one hand,  inorganic components cause adverse sides effects on land. In other words,  during the use, it removes  nutrients from the ground  damaging it permanently.  The new research carried out by the University of Exeter  pointed out that  90% of  agricultural  soils which use these harmful fertilizers become  unproductive over the years for example. As a result,  the local folk  experience famine.  Furthermore, it is  the overriding reason for  the huge  production concern in the upcoming  years since the  farms are becoming  arid.",
        "On the other hand,  synthetic  compost increases  agricultural production. Because of its power to add relevant nutrients to the soil, these particles soar the farm yield.   Although it is solely  for   a short time.   For instance, 80% of farmers who experienced these poisonous molecules  climbed their profits  ten times more than previous  years,  it is reported  by the Time magazine of last week. Hence,   the local businessmen widened their revenues. Despite the downsides, these products  have to the environment. Moreover, it is  the prime reason for  dust contamination worldwide.",
        "In conclusion, notwithstanding some  advantages chemical substances have on food production, it is a hidden  danger for  posterity since it is a silent clay killer. Therefore, I still believe that  the  pitfalls do not outweigh the advantages.   I would go as far as to say the world-ruling power should invest in  green dressing for sake of soil protection and save the future generation."
