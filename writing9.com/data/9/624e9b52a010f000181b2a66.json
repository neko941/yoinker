        "many people argue that contemporary society makes people being busier than in the past leading to they don`t have much time for  their kids ,whereas others suppose children get less attention for their parents. Therefore , I believe that parents still spend  as much as their occasion on their kids.",
        "To begin with, I agree with the first part of this statement that with the faster pace of the world , the workforce  is changing that people should adapt to a whole new workflow . For example , gender equality has gotten stronger which means women increasingly play a crucial role in the community. Moreover , because of the pressure of life that  both  parents  have to work out to pay for expensive  living costs and the basic demand of life such as electricity, water bills, house rental , children`s school fees and entertainment. As a result, adults spend as much as possible their time on work at least eight hours .",
        "However , parents seem to seek  the right balance between profession and family.while parents take responsibility for their work , they will be sent their kids to  school and  then when they go home they spend  their quality time with their families and especially on weekends  and holidays.  For instance ,   according to tourist companies during ten years , the number of family travel is increasing every year. Another thing, nowadays there are so many activities to bond family-related between father, mother and children like helping  on their home works, extracurricular courses for family.",
        "In conclusion, finding a life balance is an important thing for any individual, it is necessary to take care of children to develop themselves  mental and physical."
