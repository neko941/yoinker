        "In many nations, where people  who buy built houses, are eager to know more about the evolution of these architectural creations since  history repeats over  time, and they find related information through involving  elderly people in the neighbourhood and news articles.",
        "Firstly, to begin with,  history has been presenting similar incidents happening repeatedly since the begging of life while providing much information on the natural incidents, yet they can be very helpful in avoiding them ahead. As an example, when a house is situated close to a river, but due to the development of present irrigation systems, there may be no flood warning made for at least in the last century. However, if they are aware of the disastrous climate changes that can be repeating over the years, they can take precautions towards saving their lives. As a result, such incidents may not only help to save owners but also many of the lives in the neighbourhood.",
        "Secondly, looking in the libraries for journals and newspapers as well as talking to adults will give much information in researching about the past. This can be much easier when talking to the natives of the respective area those who may be much older. These are the precious resources of all  time that can get accurate information. Moreover, studying old newspapers and journals will provide valuable and documented evidence, yet an online resource may not be reliable in gathering details about historical events. Therefore, written and oral evidence will help in searching pre-historic data of a house.",
        "In conclusion, reading past events can be much useful when dealing with critical environmental changes, yet these resources can be found in books and articles rather than in electronic media."
