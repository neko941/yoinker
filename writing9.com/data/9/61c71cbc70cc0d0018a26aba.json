        "I saw your announcement in the daily newspaper today. As the museum is located in my neighbourhood. I\u2019m writing to apply for  voluntary work there.",
        "I have participated in some voluntary programs before. It is so satisfying. In addition, it gives me the opportunity to communicate with people. I am interested in history and due to my job, I am good at presentations. Also, I have read a lot of books and I have a good range of general information which I believe is practical for working as a presenter there. As I mentioned before, I work at the primary school near the museum and I can join the voluntary program in the afternoons every day. I am really excited about this job and I can start on Saturday.",
        "I look forward to hearing from you. Would you please be kind enough to call and notify me of the position? I will be available every afternoon at 356 091 7271.",
        "Yours faithfully,",
