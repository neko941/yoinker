        "Dear John,",
        "I hope this letter finds you well. It has been a while since our last meeting. I am thrilled to hear that you are running a new business and planning to import a product from Thailand. Therefore, I would like to give you more detail about the product and why it is interesting.",
        "First of all, I would like to introduce fried durian which is local Thai food. It is very tasty and popular among Chinese tourists who visit Thailand. Generally, durian is fruit from the south of Thailand, but local people fry it in order to preserve it. As I saw many Chinese tourists bought it a lot from Durian Shop in Phuket, so I think this will become the best-seller product of your shop if you set up your business in Nanjing, China. On top of that, there is a special tax rate for exporting this product. That means it will help you to reduce the cost.",
