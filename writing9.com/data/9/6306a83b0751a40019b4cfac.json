        "I am writing to say thank you for your invitation. During the stay last week, my son Tom was having so much fun with your son, and Martha and I were finally taking a break. We played monopoly and had a nice time chatting with you and your wife. I definitely want it again soon. Let's find a place where the kids can drain their energy on their own and we can take turns to look after them. Meanwhile, the others can chat and take a rest.",
        "When we returned home I found a few of the monopoly cards were in the big plastic bag in which we brought our toys. I guess it must be the kids making a mistake when they were told to clean up their own mess. I think we can find a time to meet again and I will bring back the cards to you.",
        "By the way, Tom is always mentioning he wants to play with Timmy again, let's make this happen soon. I am looking forward to hearing what your plans are.",
