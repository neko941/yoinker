        "Dear Johnson",
        "I am writing to inform you about some mistakes of information relating to my hometown which appear in your international travel magazine that I have read recently. In the following content, I will state the detailed incorrect information and give you particular promotional advice.",
        "The fault information about the background of a famous attraction must be correct. In your article, the historical story of the temple has been described in the wrong way. In fact, the design idea of This fascinating building originates from the traditional custom which can stand out in the culture of my motherland. However, you describe it come from the modern world. What\u2019s worse, it will misguide the tourists that the construction is a copy work.",
        "The negative social effect of this mistake is the main reason why you should make it right. If the fault information hasn\u2019t been adopted, not only the social development of my town but also the reputation of your magazine will be affected seriously. Because the scenery will lose its cultural value as an important symbol of my hometown which can improve the local economy.",
        "What\u2019s more, the obvious wrong edition will show your unprofessional.",
        "In conclusion, I suggest that you should set up a serious assessment process to avoid such a situation. For example, do abundant research about the materials that you will post. You can consult  professional workers who know about the real situation. I am looking forward to your improvement as fast as possible.",
        "Yours faithfully!"
