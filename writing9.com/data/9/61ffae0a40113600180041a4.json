        "It is a leather jacket, chocolate brown in colour with golden buttons and some fur on the collar.  It is a brand new jacket, which I hardly used.  I am very fond of this, as it was gifted by my husband on our 25th marriage anniversary.",
        "I was seated in the balcony\u2019s first row near the podium with seat number A32.  As the air condition was switched off, and I felt hot, so I removed it.  I remember keeping it on the armrest of my seat.  Also, I had my gloves and scarf inside the pockets of the jacket.  After the movie ended, I completely forgot to take it.",
        "I request you to ask your maintenance staff or any concerned person about the jacket\u2019s whereabouts, and if found I will be more than happy to come and collect it.  Hope to hear from you.",
        "Your\u2019s faithfully,",
