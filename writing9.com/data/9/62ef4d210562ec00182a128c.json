        "Dear Sir,",
        "I am writing to enquire about the complaint raised to your manager, Mr Tom Cruise, regarding the central heating system of room 501, I was staying using on 22 Dec 2022. At that time, he had assured me of compensation but I have not received it to this day.",
        "While coming from a distant village, I thought to take ample rest before my next day-long flight to Chicago. But to my surprise, a horrible noise was coming out of the heating system because of which I was not able to fall asleep. Needless to say, I was furious as I was tired and restless.",
        "I then called your front desk and since no other room was available, a handyman came to put a temporary covering on the appliance to reduce the sound a little. It did not help much and hence, he agreed to pay compensation along with spa gift certificates for the troubles I faced because of the noisy went.",
        "I expect Mr Cruise's promise to be fulfilled, and request spa gift vouchers to be sent to my email: [email\u00a0protected] If not, I will contact the General manager of the hotel through the contact form on the website and complain about what happened here.",
        "Yours faithfully,",
