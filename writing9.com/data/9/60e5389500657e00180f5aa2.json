        "Let me elaborate on the situation. When the machinery starts, it generates so much noise pollution because of the same I am unable to focus on my studies also facing a sleeping disorder problem. Moreover, it creates massive air pollution which does not let me stand on my balconies; In addition, I have to wear a mask whenever I am required to go outside. All types of these pollutants have threatened my peace of mind.",
        "It is a clear administrative blunder of the City Council by authorizing this industrial plant in the residential vicinity. Considering the gravity of the matter, I would request you to shift this RMC with immediate effect.",
        "I solicit your cooperation. My coordinate is (555) 456 982, and my email address is [email\u00a0protected]",
