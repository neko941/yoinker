        "The most crucial aspect of picking a career is debatable. Many people believe that compensation is the most vital aspect, needs to consider. This essay will discuss why I oppose that the wage is not entirely the most important factor. This essay will discuss what the essential is.",
        "The importance of earnings in many cases, on the one hand, is deniable. Necessitating to provide for families and paying bills, earning a decent income seems inevitable. making enough money for any parent, indeed, would be significant because of providing for their children. Therefore, considering salary could be one of the indispensables while choosing an occupation. Some individuals, additionally, may want to experience a magnificent luxury life, for that they may consider the compensation the only factor of any jobs to achieve to their intention. Nonetheless, this is not the case for everyone, as individuals preferences could vary.",
        "On the other hand, a wide range of factors should be measured for choosing an occupation. Undoubtedly, having a good life is related to what career an individual has. Thus picking the right career is more than just salary since a person spends a majority of daily time on that profession. it would not be appropriate if someone had to bear too much pressure on his job, even with a considerable wage, As this has detrimental effects not only physical but also mental. Only income, plus, might not be everyone goal to choose or commence work. Perhaps, many people may choose to work for different purposes. People who work for charity could be an excellent sample, which in this case, income is not the issue. in my perspective, there are crucial sides other than wage should be considered",
        "In conclusion, as the primary reasons mentioned, although the salary might be considered the most vital aspect of selecting a job, this is only one of which, should be viewed as much as other essential aspects and I disagree with it."
