        "The photograph that won the place was taken some time back when I happen to visit a famous waterfall in Sri Lanka. Indeed, it was  blissful scenery and the photo looked amazing. Hence, I decided to send it to the competition to see my luck, and to my surprise, it was selected.",
        "Moreover, I am very excited to take part in the exhibition, where there will be a massive audience from various countries. Further, I really want you to be present on this special day, and the event will be held at the town hall auditorium from 9 am onwards.",
