        "I have been a big fan of you for many years since you released your first album. From that time, I have been waiting so long for your concert to be held in my city. A couple of days ago, I was very happy that you were going to perform in Paradise Concert Hall.",
        "I can truly say that night was one of the best nights of my entire life. During your singing, I could not bear the suspense while I was singing with you word by word. In addition, It had such a lasting impression on me that I definitely attend your next concert wherever it is.",
        "I would like to share with you that I am pursuing my dream to be a professional guitarist like you. To be honest, I have been playing the guitar for six months after your last album in which you played it outstandingly, and made me interested in this amazing musical instrument.",
        "For this reason, I honestly think you can help me to hone my skill in your classes even though you have many apprentices. Therefore, I would like to kindly ask you to put my name in one of your classes.",
        "I am very much looking forward to hearing from you very soon.",
        "Yours sincerely,",
