        "I am excited to see an advert in today's newspaper regarding voluntary work in your museum. The reason why I am keen to volunteer is that I have been thinking for a long time to contribute some of my leisure time to public service.",
        "In addition to my interest in this type of work, I have a past experience of attending unpaid work in a local library as well as charity work in an old age home. Furthermore, I am a very tidy person which might help to keep valuable things in the right place and position. I would believe myself the best fit for providing service at the museum.",
        "Moreover, I am a working software professional and I am engaged all weekdays. Hence I will be available to take up voluntary activities only at weekends or on predefined holidays.",
        "Kindly keep me posted with your opinion and schedule to make myself available.",
