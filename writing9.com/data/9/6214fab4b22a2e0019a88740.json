        "Arguably, boxing  is regarded as a blood game several times  ends up in body damage. Yet its critics contend its existence nowadays. Personally, I disagree with the view since  those who  practice the sport  freely choose the game.  Albeit, many  are in the sport solely for money and fame. This essay will shed light on both sides of the view and  provide anecdotal evidence to prove the arguments.",
        "On the one hand, the practitioners are not forced to follow the field. In other words,  despite its injuries seriously the athletes, it is not an obligatory game. For instance, the international  boxing federation provides  written approval for gamers to consent to their participation  as well as handle the aftermaths. As a result,  criticising the development is a waste of time and no one has the responsibility  to deal with it. Moreover,  the foremost accountable for it are sporters and no one else.",
        "On the other hand, A significant number of sporters are in the game solely because of  a huge amount of money in it. It undoubtedly threatens them since many of them shortfall of quality causing several injuries. Furthermore, a plethora of  boxers is seriously wounded   and  found on the brink to die due to this. For example,  3 out 10 pugilists undergo surgery every seasonal fortnight.  Hence, rather than earning big money, they end up in intensive care.",
        "In conclusion, notwithstanding some participants being in the game simply because it pays well,  the critics should be aware of the rules, which  keeps the freedom of choice for the athletes. Therefore, I still disagree with the view. In addition, I recommend that the world-ruling power allows the practice today."
