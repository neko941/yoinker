        "Dear Editor,",
        "I am excited and took great pride to write this letter as I can see a few adorable things about my town's places. In addition, an article which you published on the community parks and kid's play schools is really awesome and I did not even think about it in my dream.",
        "However, as you see from east to south, there are huge differences among those centres and towns too. Having said that, in the south end, we have luxury high-rise buildings and on the other hand, we have a very small and traditional house under one roof which is quite opposite. Therefore, I strongly believe that we have exclusive centres with different designs and mind-blowing theme parks throughout the town.",
        "Last but not the least, I am more than happy to guide you and show you all these mesmerizing places. Hence, I would request you to please let me know your's availability for the same. I would really appreciate it if you could confirm your requirements in advance to execute the smooth tour without any further issues.",
        "I look forward to hearing your response with dates and availability to see these spectacular places.",
        "Best Regards,",
