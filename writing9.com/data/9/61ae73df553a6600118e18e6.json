        "Knowing that, please receive my most sincere apologies. I will try to compensate you for all your troubles. I want to invite you over for dinner to discuss this in detail, as it is the least I can do. Let me know your favourite food so I can prepare a nice banquet.",
        "I know the nuisance of a loud neighbour, that's why I have been trying to keep these meetings to the minimum. Nevertheless, I have purchased some dedicated instruments to measure the decibels levels to keep it quieter. In addition, I have attached my business card with my contact details, please feel free to call me anytime.",
        "If there is anything I can do to diminish this situation, please let me know.",
