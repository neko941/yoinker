        "Dear Lori,",
        "I am writing to you to inform you that I just arrived from the technology club annual conference titled,  \"The impact of technology on our society\". It was a lovely conference, I have learned a lot and I think it wouldn't be a bad idea to give a presentation to my colleagues on what I have learned so far.",
        "Concerning the presentation, I would like to talk about the industry insights shared by the main speakers, such as: how we can harness technology to drive productivity in our community, and the end result of society without technological impact. These topics are some of the needed information for our industry if we want to make any impact at all.",
        "Finally, I am looking at the third week of the month for the presentation, however, I realised that there will be a host of meetings for that week. So I have brought it forward to the second week, which I believe would be convenient for all the unit members.",
        "Do let me know if this is approved from your end, then I will go ahead to put all the plans together and share them with my colleagues. Thank you and have a wonderful day.",
        "Yours sincerely,",
