        "In this fast-evolving world, with the advent of technology, numerous people squander most of their time  in front of screens as a form of leisure rather than relishing in outdoor activities. Today addiction  towards computer games has tremendously risen not only among youngsters but is observed in adults  too. However, I completely affirm that spending enormous freedom on gaming can result in escalating  loneliness and depleting productivity.",
        "It is irrefutable that playing computer games for longer durations without rest leads individuals to glue their  eyes on the screen thereby compelling them to sit in the same position for an extremely prolonged  duration. In addition to this, there will be less interaction with friends and family because they will  indulge themselves in their own virtual world. As a result, this adversely affects their mental and  physical well-being giving rise to depression. This would not be possible had the time spent  were not colossal. For instance, players playing Counter-Strike are found to be more aggressive and  short-tempered.",
        "Besides this, owing to the fact that even during work, people tend to wonder day in and day out  about gaming making them lose their focus. Hence, because of this, they do not pay heed to their work  and delay their activities. Therefore, it becomes exceptionally arduous for them to achieve targets and  complete their goals overwhelming the fact that such a habit is quite hazardous for one\u2019s life. For example, a recent  study revealed that gamers who spent more than 15 hours gaming have been found to be victims of anxiety,  insomnia and obesity leading them to face troubles while at work due to lesser concentration.",
        "To sum up, although playing games can be accepted to a certain extent, I am of the opinion that if this  continues for longer durations, then it can have drastic repercussions not only on the individual but also on the people around him."
