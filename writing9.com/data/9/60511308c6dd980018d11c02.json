        "Recently, banning tobacco products has become a controversial issue around the world. Some people argue that these products and cigarettes should be prohibited because they are the main reason for the modern global health crisis. I agree with this argument; in this essay, I will discuss my point of view thoroughly.",
        "The increase in tobacco consumers leads to an increase in the individual and social financial burden. Purchasing these drug products represents a financial burden on the individual and national income. Since individuals spend much money on cigarettes, for instance, they suffer to fulfil their domestic and social needs. That is why many tobacco consumers represent a burden on their governments. Smokers seek financial aid for their domestic needs and health issues, which result from smoking. Governments, therefore, should seek to ban cigarettes and legislate a law that punishes smokers by paying more taxes than other citizens.",
        "Moreover, smoking leads to the destruction of public health. The medical treatment that smokers require is often expensive. According to the WHO, smoking is the paramount cause of diseases such as  lung cancer and heart fatal diseases. These diseases need a remarkable amount of money and medical services to be cured. Consequently, with the spread of these diseases among citizens, there will be a lack of productivity and medical support for common non-smokers, who deserve  governmental medical treatment.  Thus, laws should prohibit smoking and exclude smokers from receiving public medical services for free.",
        "In conclusion, in my opinion, smoking should be banned around the world and especially in developing countries. If countries succeed in legislating laws to ban this source of fatal illnesses, they will achieve high productive aims and be able to develop socially, financially and medically."
