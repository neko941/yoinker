        "I am writing this letter to express my interest in the advertised position for the upcoming summer. Firstly, I am a multi-skilled personality to look after many things at a time despite busy schedules such as taking notes while listening to others. In addition, assisting others while focusing on daily work. Furthermore, I can also take care of the gardening work at 6pm.",
        "Undoubtedly, I am coming from a poor family and this job can help me to come out of all my debts. On the other side, I need to pay my school fees which cost me an arm and a leg. Hence, this job is much required in all ways.",
        "As I explained, I am excited to accept the work right from August first week onwards as I am going to complete my final year exams. Nevertheless, it is very hard to join in July due to critical project work which I am doing at a well-reputed company in the town.",
        "I look forward to hearing your response with the good news about my joining date. Hope it will come. I would really appreciate it if you could let me know if any additional information is required from my end.",
        "Best Regards,",
