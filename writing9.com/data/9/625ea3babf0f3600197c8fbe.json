        "Dear Sir",
        "I hope this letter finds you well. I am Simhachalam Gouroju from Hyderabad, whom you met on the plane from Doha to Boston on 25th March. I believe you remember me now. It was a great experience travelling with you.",
        "As per our conversation, I am writing this letter to request you let me know if there are any job openings in one of your restaurants. I am mainly interested in customer service or any supervisor role as I hold a diploma in Hotel Management and got 3 years of experience in the same field at one of the International Hotels, in Boston. In my current role, I handle a team of 10 members and strive to provide the best possible service to all the customers. Also, I received multiple rewards during my journey with ABC Hotel, as a token of appreciation for my excellent customer handling skills.",
        "Hence, I believe I might be a good fit for any customer service or supervisor role that is available at your restaurant. I have enclosed my resume for additional details.",
