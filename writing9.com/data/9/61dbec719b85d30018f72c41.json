        "I would like to inform you that my views are different at some point on the article of town centres are looked similar in the whole country. I have a valid reason for proving my statement right.",
        "As, I am living in Mississauga, Canada which is a very beautiful place. Its downtown is different from others, as everyone knows that downtowns are very congested due to a large number of shops ,therefore, high volume of crowd is an obvious thing. But, the council of the Mississauga area noticed that thing and make a different concept to make everything smooth and amazing. The most attractive part of the town centre is the plantation, which gives greenish look to the metropolis. Moreover, the architecture is also modern that allures the public and at night, the lighting is 'icing on the cake' .",
        "At last, I would suggest you come here even once in your life so, you can explore the man-made beauty in my town. I hope you give a positive response to my statement.",
        "Yours sincerely,",
