        "My name is Neeraj and I am pursuing Masters in Engineering in the Department of Electronics and Communication.I am writing this letter to bring your notice to the lack of sports and leisure amenities on the campus.",
        "Since the college is focusing on  academic activities only,the management and teachers are least interested in the sports activities of the students.There are many potential candidates who can perform well in the upcoming university sports meet.Furthermore,the condition of the playground is so pathetic and it is not all suitable for daily practice.It will be well appreciated if the management makes arrangements to arrange meetings and also make the ground usable.Moreover,We will be grateful if the authorities provide badminton racquets for the hostel students since this game is getting popular nowadays.",
        "It will be appreciated if you consider these factors and do the needful.I am looking forward to hearing a positive response from your side.",
