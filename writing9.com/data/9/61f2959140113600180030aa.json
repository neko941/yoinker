        "Dear John,",
        "Hope you are doing well.I am writing this letter to bring your attention to the advanced SQL course on Coursera.The program can be beneficial both for the firm and for myself as well.",
        "The duration of the series is 3 months.The program consists of lecture series and practical sessions.The theoretical session is covered by the veterans in the area and the real-time hands-on session is organized by Intel.This series has the potential to raise my standards and I can be more productive after this.It will be highly appreciated if you allow me permission for 2 hours daily from 2 p.m to 4 p.m for attending the real-time practical session.I will be grateful if the company sponsors the cost of the course which is around 4000$.The certificate of the course is highly valuable and hence there are huge chances that the client will also promote the procedure.",
        "It will be well appreciated if you consider these factors and do the needful.I am looking forward to hearing a positive reply from your side.",
