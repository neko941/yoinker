If you missed the date, you are not able to dispose of some garbage by next Monday. Also, I have a pup, which is so pretty. I want you to take care of it carefully. There is what you should do for the pup. First, you have to take him a walk for 20 minutes around near the park, and give some puppy food to him every 3 hours. Moreover, when the toilet of it becomes dirty, please replace it with the new one.",
        "In case of emergency, please call me soon. If I was busy, I would not be able to respond to you at that time. But I'll call back you as soon as possible.",
