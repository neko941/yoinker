        "This is Parham and I have seen your advertisement in a local magazine to find someone to assist you with some work at your place. I wanted to state that I will be available from the beginning of the summer. Let me explain more.",
        "According to your ad, I would be able to help you with your garden and keep your place tidy and clean by allocating some hours during the week. Also, I have a good background in working with electronic devices and fixing them which might be practical. Although my English is not perfect, this would be a time to practice and learn more. Hence, it would be a great chance for me to improve my language skills and meanwhile help you with your errands.",
        "Moreover, as I denoted, I will be available during the summer and specifically, I can help you during the weekdays from 3:00 to 6:00 in the evening. Please let me know if you would like me to assist you.",
