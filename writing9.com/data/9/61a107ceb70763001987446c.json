        "Wild animals should spend their entire life in a sanctuary that is much farther away from  civilization. Few citizens think that a zoo is a dangerous location for any animal so it must be closed down whereas others believe that it is useful for safeguarding  wild animals. In this essay, I will look at both sides of the argument and give my opinion.",
        "To begin with, zoos are a great zone to keep species from getting extinct. Moreover, young children can visit this apartment to see various kinds of wild animals which are intricated to see in the jungle. For instance, if an animal suffers from a disease it would be very easy to provide him with proper treatment and he may recover quickly rather than dying in the jungle with no aid. Therefore, zoos are a safe zone for all  creatures.",
        "On the contrary, authorities are only interested in zoos because it has enhanced their economy. Furthermore, there are lots of restrictions applied to the animals, because they can't roam freely and enjoy their life. For example, these zookeepers pretend to treat this creature in an appropriate way when the citizens arrive but after the town is empty, opposite behaviour is visible. Hence, sanctuaries must be opened where wild animals can spend their time with their families.",
        "To summarize, I believe this creature must be present in the jungle in their natural habitat rather than locked up inside a cell. Even though, if zoos are open then government authorities should keep a clear eye on the wildlife and their health which is a crucial matter."
