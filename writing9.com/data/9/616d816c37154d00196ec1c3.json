        "How are you and how was your holiday? I hope you had an amazing time and came back fresh. Thanks for letting me stay at your place. I enjoyed playing Playstation games and had fun trying the skateboard.",
        "I have unpleasant news for you actually. After a few days of ordering both meals from the neighbourhood shops, I got sick of outside food. I decided to try cooking a simple soup although cooking is new for me. After pouring the boiling hot soup into a navy blue bowl, it slipped out of my hands while I was carrying it over to the dining table and crushed into pieces ,unfortunately.",
        "The broken chinaware seemed to be of  good quality and looked expensive with the detailed design painted around it. I am so sorry to have broken it. I feel really apologetic towards you as it happened during my stay in your apartment.",
        "Since then, I had been looking for such a bowl, and I found a similar type yesterday at a high-end shopping mall. I bought two of them in the same navy blue colour and arranged a doorstep delivery to your flat. I hope that this would make you feel a bit better. Please let me know if you like them after you have received them.",
