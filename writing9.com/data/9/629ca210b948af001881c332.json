However, my experience was pathetic. I placed the order at 1 PM but the food wasn\u2019t served until 1:45 PM. Besides, the waiter started to serve the main course without the starter. Apart from this, Even the bread was so hard to chew for me as well as my other family members. I did complain to the head immediately but he was least bothered to understand my situation; In the end, we paid the bill and left hungry.",
