        "Our new project \u201cSystem Digitalization\u201d will start from January 2020. I will need to run multiple workshops with business users to kick start this project. It will be far easier to operate the workshops from our Zurich head office as most of our users are located there.",
        "While I am away from our local office, I will still be able to access my emails via company notebook, which I will be carrying with me. I will regularly check email and revert as and when needed. I have also requested our colleague Abi to attend the meeting on my behalf, while I am away.",
        "I will be very happy if you could process my application at the earliest. It will be very beneficial if I can start my tenure from Jan 2020 onwards as our project will start at the same time.",
        "I look forward to hearing from you soon.",
