        "At present\uff0ccomputers and other kinds of technological devices are developing quickly and they also can be used in educational services. In my opinion,  human teachers will never be completely replaced by technical advancements. This essay will illustrate some reasons to support this statement and explain it with some relevant examples.",
        "Firstly, a common factor is that technological progress can not consider the diffidence between the capability of all students. Students have different learning abilities \uff0csome smart students may wish teachers can teach more knowledge in one class\uff0cand others might hope teachers decrease the speed to make sure they totally understand. For experienced teachers\uff0cthey have teaching strategy\uff0clike finished this chapter quickly in class and provide extra training for others students who do not understand in class\uff1bBy contrast\uff0ca robotic teacher only teach students in a fixed pattern and can not give extra help to other students. Compared with human teacher\u2019s flexibility and patience, Artificial Intelligence lacks the ability to assist every single student\u2019s need, thus it is less likely to be replaced.",
        "In addition, those robotic teachers can not accurately read pupil\u2019s emotions, which is not constructive for students\u2019 growth. Regarding primary school, for example, it is hard to think about how non-human teachers would face children\u2019s daily problems\uff0csuch as constantly motivating them to be concentrated on something or consoling them when they cry. However, all of the above emotional needs are need to be catered for during the whole process of learning. Therefore, machines can hardly perform the function of caring for learners\u2019 moods in order to ensure the quality of teaching.",
        "To conclude, because humans are more considerable and flexible than computers\uff0cI am not optimistic about the total replacement of  technology in the educational realm."
