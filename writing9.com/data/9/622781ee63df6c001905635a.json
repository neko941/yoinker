        "Dear Mrs Barret,",
        "I write you to express my interest in the job that is advertised in the local grocery store. I am available to help you with domestic duties since I will spend the whole of next summer at home. I am planning to take a year off my studies and travel around the world, so the money will be very welcome.",
        "As you can read in my attached CV, I am currently studying for a gardening degree in my local school, where I am trained to do domestic works that surely will fit your needs. I can work on the garden, do a little plumbing, house cleaning and some electrical amendments if needed.",
        "Additionally, I have been taking care of my grandma for 5 years, so I can help with elders in case you need it. I am completely available at the moment, so I do not care if it is full-time or part-time work. I would be very happy to have something to do this summer and earn a little money in the process.",
        "I am available to make an interview at your convenience. And please, do not hesitate to contact me for further information",
