        "In the contemporary epoch, advertisement is one of the resources businesses use to increase sales. In view of this, there is an irrefutable debate that discusses advert placement and whether it has positively or negatively impacted today's society. This essay would take an exhaustive look at these points while I conclude with my own opinion.",
        "To begin with, one of the major reasons brand awareness has positively influenced today's businesses is because it helps boost sales. Further, marketers carry out a lot of work in order to publicly paint good images for products or services businesses render so as to skyrocket sales. For example, Joe Brian a Marketing Specialist at BHM, Texas carried out  research on marketing pros which stated that advertisement has made diverse firms thrive in sales. Invariably, placing  ads for organizations has lots of benefits such as an increase in sales.",
        "Secondly, the other positive impact of ads is that it creates a unique image of products to the public. Furthermore, goods and services are now sold to customers based on the initial idea of what the item looks like as well as its' features by previewing adverts that have been placed on the television, internet and others. For instance, BMW USA always place adverts on the new release of their autos in order to give clients an idea of the features of their wheels which would be a catalyst to several purchases. Undoubtedly, advertisement aids to pitch products to several folks.",
        "In the nutshell, there are several positive and negative impacts of placing ads in today's world which have greatly influenced commerce. However, one of the pivotal resources to high sales and profits is an advertisement."
