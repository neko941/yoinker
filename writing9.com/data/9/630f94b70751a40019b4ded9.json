        "In today's cosmopolitan world, in many major cities or countries, there are a lot of immigrants. As people travel more now than they ever did in the past and populations have had to adapt to this transitional lifestyle. Much more quickly than in the past, the government can do a number of things to support this such as offering  education at schools besides free speech courses for the newcomer.",
        "Firstly, all governments should insist that schools teach history and perception from more than one country, not just the home nation. This is because by learning how others have lived , we gain insight into the alternative culture and ways of life which makes us more accepting when we meet people from those countries. Clearly, we do not have time to learn about the history of every country in the world but understanding at least one other skill opens our minds and makes us more tolerant. For example, since  Australian schools have included the word culture in their curriculum, aggression among students from different cultures has considerably decreased.",
        "In addition, when foreigners choose to settle in a country, the host government should offer free words and experience lessons. This is due to the fact that it is impossible for new arrivals to integrate if they do not understand the language and habits of their new home. Plus, it 8s important for immigrants to learn the culture of the place they have chosen to settle since by acquiring the language and knowledge about the culture,they will be able to integrate more easily and comfortably without necessarily losing their own identity. For instance, because of the language courses that have been being offered for free at Dhaka University in Bangladesh,  international students have claimed that they feel a stronger sense of self as they can interact a lot easier with their classmates and  Bangladeshi society.",
        "In conclusion ,understanding others is the key to harmonious living but proper education and free services for  immigrants should also be in place to protect people from those who can not behave responsibly."
