        "Let me give you some more details. It is a red colour one with a picture of an eagle on the right sleeve. It looks a little fancy and that will make it easy for you to identify it. Further, I was seated in the second row, and my seat number was 204. As I recall, it should be on the seat or fallen somewhere near.",
        "I would kindly request you to take the jacket and have it with you until I collect it. I will try to make a visit to the theatre at my earliest, most probably during the coming weekend. Also, you can call me on 01131249, if you have any information regarding this matter.",
