        "Dear Paulina,",
        "I am writing to thank you for agreeing to take care of my house and my pet dog. Since I\u2019ll be holidaying in Australia for two weeks, I have written down my Australian contact information in a diary which will be kept on the top of the fridge. I have however jotted down the hotel\u2019s name and contact number that will be staying in case you cannot get through to me. All the other emergency contact numbers are in the same diary.",
        "Let me explain to you in detail how to take care of the dog. Firstly , the dog needs to be fed four times a day and the dog feed is stored in the kitchen cabinet below the gas stove. Secondly,you will have to bathe the dog once during your stay. Thirdly, the dog\u2019s annual injection is due on the 4th of this month, so you will have to take him to the vet\u2019s clinic which is two blocks down the road. I have asked the doctor to call you to remind you.",
        "Moreover, while you are here, please ensure the lawn is mowed. You will find the lawnmower in the garage. Please do call the plumber to fix the leak in the bathroom\u2019s pipe. Do remember to keep the back door locked at all times. I hope you have a comfortable stay.",
