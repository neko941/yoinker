        "Nowadays, migration to other nations has been altered to be a common matter among people that needs a logical regulation to provide a homogeneous society for the inhabitants. yet, there remains a contentious debate as to whether the newcomers are supposed to follow the customs of that place or not. I partially agree with this topic and will support my idea with more details and practical examples.",
        "Firstly, respecting  the new traditions and regulations can make  harmony for the dwellers. This is an indisputable fact that living in a new area requires an intellectual connection with the traditions of that zone to provide a desirable atmosphere for the new settlers; additionally, it can be an effective way to adapt to the new situation without being disturbed in that place, which is a beneficial element to be a successful participant of that country. For instance, driving manners in a new area can be different and the travellers must learn how to observe the laws for having a desirable environment . Consequently, it is a key feature to follow the rituals established in a nation to survive living in that place avoiding any type of disturbances.",
        "On the other hand, our identity is made by our old traditions and customs which can be a detrimental matter to change .  This process can be an influential concept for  mankind to replace their instinctive habits and adopt some new ones, which can be a sign of moral decadence for the newcomers since they are supposed to forget about their real desire. Meanwhile, this variation is able to result in mental ailments for the individuals based on their high dependency on these manners. One particularly salient example is accepting the rules related to drinking behaviours in the western countries for the people coming to these nations; this new morel code is a challenging factor for them since they have some restricted rules based on the religion they follow. Furthermore, forcing the travellers to follow the new customs can lead to chaos in the area since the new dwellers can not totally accept all the regulations.",
        "As a way of conclusion, I once again reaffirm that there can be various types of traditions and customs for the new settlers to follow, which can lead to a well-organized environment for all the people.In addition, it is highly recommended to provide cognitive processes for the travellers to better justify all the new rituals with their own traditions."
