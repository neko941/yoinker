        "I have been a full-time attendee as a scholarship student of the artificial intelligence science course at the college for three months.Normally, my homeland is Turkey and living in Istanbul with my family. My tutor is Mrs Jackson, who leads the computer science division. We are all driving the speaking robot project as well.",
        "I am writing to express my excuse, which requires my weekday off. Last night, I got heartbreaking news from my parents that my uncle died from a heart attack. There will be a funeral today; after that, next week, a religious ceremony will be held in their home, which is named \"7th day from death.\" For this reason, I should fly to Turkey to bear up with them.",
        "I would appreciate it if you could permit me to be absent for the week beginning 10th July. That is to say, if you evaluate my kindly request positively, I would like to inform Mrs Jackson. We could find out solutions for our studies for our study calendar while I was away.",
        "I look forward to hearing from you.",
