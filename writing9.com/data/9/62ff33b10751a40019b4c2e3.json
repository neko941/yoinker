        "I am an international student of the Computer Science department in your esteemed institution, majoring in Artificial Intelligence. I wanted to seek  approval for leaves of 7 days from 25th May to 31st May 2022, to meet my grandmother in Punjab.",
        "Currently, I am pursuing 6th-semester and enrolled in a Machine Learning project undertaken by the class which is due this month. Considering my responsibilities, I did the early submission of my research work to the in-charge and discussed my leave plans with her.",
        "Sir, I need to visit my ailing grandmother, who is now 92 years of age and had recently suffered from a heart stroke. My hometown is far from our college and my two days will be consumed by travelling only. I wanted to spend some time with her as she had taken very good care of me during my childhood.",
        "Therefore, I would request you to please grant me leave for a week. Besides, In-charge informed me that I need your approval for the final acceptance of my project work.  I will be looking forward to hearing from you soon.",
