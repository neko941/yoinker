        "As you know, project deliveries are happening smoothly without any issues. In addition, I have been assigned  new work a week ago and before my vacation itself. Therefore, I will make a knowledge transfer plan in detail for everyone in our team. Hence, anyone can understand the requirement and how to deliver the client's work on time without any escalation.",
        "However, I strongly believe that one of my team members will look after my roles and responsibilities during my vacation and sporadically I will get in touch with my team over the phone. Furthermore, I will join on call despite my busy schedule at home. Since  we do not want to see any escalations from our great customers.",
        "I look forward to hearing a response to this request as I have to book my flight tickets to my place soon after your approval.",
