After working hard for six months I was finally able to join my dream company in Noida with an enormous package of 20 lakhs. I was over the moon when I received the call from the human resource department today morning.",
        "I have decided to meet you as you were my constant support during my struggling days and share my excitement with me. Moreover, I have also planned a trip to Shimla which was long pending because of my preparation. We will be meeting in Karol Bagh near our favourite tea stall on Friday evening at 5 and will start our journey on Sunday. We will be spending 2 days together and cherish old old memories of the hostel life.",
        "You can stay at my place as my parents are out of town and we can chit chat the whole night. If you are coming from Jalandhar it is better for you to reach Delhi before 8 in the morning to avoid rush hours.",
        "Hope to see you soon.",
