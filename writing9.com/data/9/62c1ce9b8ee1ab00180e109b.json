        "How are you? Hope this letter finds you well. I am really excited to share my upcoming trip to the UK country and I am sure that you would be the right person to provide any recommendations for the best places to visit during my two weeks trip in mid of July 2022.",
        "As you know. I will be there for two weeks in the UK hence,  I would like to know the best accommodations considering the low budget and easy access to the public transit services to save my  trip expenses. In addition, I am happier to be in shared rooms or any temporary guest accommodations. I just got to know that there are some local social groups which provide free rentals for visitors and I hope you are aware of those free services.",
        "I heard that there will be a boating camp every day at  central park in London. I would request you to please join me to have fun in the ocean during our boating. Please do not hesitate to advise me if we have any best programs rather than boating nearby our places.",
        "I cannot wait anymore to meet you and I look forward to hearing your response. I hope It will come soon.",
