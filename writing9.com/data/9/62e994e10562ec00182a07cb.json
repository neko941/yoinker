        "Some say that the essential environmental issue nowadays is the reduction of biodiversity and loss of plants and animals, whereas others believe that there is a variety of much more important environmental problems. As far as I am concerned, I believe that lots of other environmental issues must be given more concern while the figure of species is a less critical one.",
        "On one hand, there are many reasons why many opine that drawing utter attention to the loss o particular species is not needed as there are more important issues that must be treated well. The prominent one is the impact that the first one does on our earth compared to the second one. In other words, the reduction and extinction of several animals or plants will not incredibly affect people's lives as, for instance,  pollution and global warming negatively put huge stress on our earth. Moreover, a lot of scientific research has been published all over the world, for ages, they were announcing a caution about how seriously we have to manage pollution and global warming instead of the other problem.",
        "On the other hand, some people see that biodiversity loss and the extinction of species of plants and wild animals are so detrimental phenomena. In addition, nature including all its members is such a vital part of our lives, and it plays a pivotal role in many processes in the world. For example, wild animals play a key role in the balance of our planet, and the imbalance of the number of prey and the figure of pets all over the world is due to this issue. Also, global hunting has been big trouble that we must solve immediately.",
        "To conclude, from my perspective, I see that the majority of the environmental problems sound like a disaster, but the most significant one is global warming because its impacts on nature are devastating. Therefore, all members of the community should work together to enhance and positively improve our attitudes towards the planet."
