        "This will be your's first trip and I would ask you to be more careful while camping in the deep forest as there will not be any mobile network if anything happened and then you have to think and take action accordingly. Do not think about proper food and water and you must carry everything on your shoulders which may be a huge pain. I am not sure about maps and directions which may be new to everyone and please take a note of your foot movements while going to unknown places.",
        "In fact, I would like to join you during this trip, but unfortunately, I  cannot make it plan this time as I need to attend my office meeting which is very much important due to the year-end close activities. I will be available  in the third week of next month and also we can  have more fun as there will be more daylight and without any rain.",
