        "Dear Sir,",
        "My name is Jane and I am living in the Paradise Apartment where your new office is under construction. I am writing this letter to draw your attention to the myriads of issues which we are currently facing because of construction work.",
        "The main problem is the limited car parking space. As there are a large number of bricks and cement bags are placed in front of my house, therefore, it is difficult to park the vehicle. Secondly, every day we are facing trouble with sewage blocking with which wastewater flows on the streets and there is a chance of accident and also foul smell comes which is intolerable. Last week, my neighbour\u2019s bike slipped over the drained water and he was injured badly.",
        "I recommend you please put the bricks and cement bags into the vacant place which is located outside of our apartment.  For wastewater, kindly dig the ground away from the houses where you can store the wastewater so that the sewage will be unblocked and water flows through smoothly. Then, everyone can drive safely through the street. It would be great if you look into this matter and take immediate steps to eradicate these problems.",
        "I am looking forward to your prompt reply.",
        "Yours Sincerely,",
