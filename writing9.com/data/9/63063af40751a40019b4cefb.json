        "I received your letter dated 1st August 2022 where concern was raised about the nuisance the noise pollution from my apartment is causing to you ,good neighbours.",
        "Firstly, I am apologizing for the pain my action would have caused. It is never intentional to disturb you with the noise from my generator set and the situation that happened was beyond my control at that period.",
        "Furthermore, the noise pollution was a result of the faulty exhaust pipe of the generator that has devoid of all  mechanical interventions. The engineer working to fix it could not show up on time with the new replacement because of the delay with the online spare part stores and I have to put it on to power the air conditioner because I could not cope with the hot weather .",
        "However, it is worth notifying you that the part has been supplied and the engineer will be here today to fix them. Once again , kindly find a place in your heart to forgive me.",
