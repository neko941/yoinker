        "My name is Roberta and I am one of the residents at East Forest. Firstly, I would like to acknowledge my appreciation for the incredible work you have been doing in the school in the past 4 years. Since you have become the school\u2019s principal, the local residents could see the improvements you have done in the area. For this reason, I would like to volunteer myself to assist with the school\u2019s building and playground maintenance. I truly wish to help because I believe this is of paramount importance to the community.",
        "Because I am a marketing specialist who has an advertising company, I could contribute with my expertise in this field to promote a campaign to raise money for this rebuilding. As far as I am concerned, this is primordial to bring public awareness.",
        "To sum up, I believe face-to-face is always the best to debate all the strategies. Would you like to meet to discuss the options? I am available for a meeting next week from Monday to Tuesday.",
        "I look forward to hearing back from you. Please do not hesitate to ask me any questions.",
