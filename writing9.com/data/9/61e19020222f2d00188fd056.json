        "Some individuals commented that the overwhelming majority  of commodities available are made in other countries.  Personally, I believe it has more drawbacks than benefits since delaying to delivery of goods makes the recipient nation dependent.  Although, it has its advantages. This essay will shed light on both sides of the view  and provide evidence to prove the arguments.",
        "On the one hand,  late products make the recipient folk hostage. Because of the complexity in the process of manufacturing, packaging, and delivering which delays making these commodities available on the supermarket shelves, it makes them dependent.  For instance,  many African  nations are still dependent  on vaccines  coming from industrialised nations so far owing to the fact that these immunisations are fabricated  outward. As a result,  the economic growth shrunk and  the local crowd dies waiting for the medicine to come abroad.  Furthermore, it is the prime reason for the escalated death toll due to the pandemic throughout the world.",
        "On other hand,  fabricating  commodities inward of the country is public taxes-consuming.  In other words,  manufacturing methods  involve a huge amount of financial resources  which overtakes  purchasing from other lands since not every business has profits. 40% of tobacco producers worldwide reported 30- 40 % of annual losses  due to the less productive methodology which is  money-consuming and not profitable for example.  Hence, it hinders  the communities progress as well as diminishes the revenues  of the companies directly involved.",
        "In conclusion, notwithstanding some  benefits the procedure has in the country development, it makes the receiver land heavily dependent on external products. Therefore, I still  believe that it has more pitfalls than boons. In addition,  I warn the underprivileged  regime to invest in factories  in order to  make goods  available internally  for sake of providing standard social life for the local livings."
