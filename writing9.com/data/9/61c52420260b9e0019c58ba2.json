        "Dear Annie,",
        "I hope your vacation was memorable and refreshing. This letter is in regards to  window damage that was caused in your absence at home.",
        "Although every day before leaving for the office, I ensured that all the doors and windows are locked. However, due to heavy storms and snowfall last weekend, the bedroom window opened up despite  putting its latch in the morning. Indeed, it resulted in the lower two glass panes being broken into pieces. Moreover, the strong winds caused a lot of havoc and devastated many people's belongings. As I came in the evening, entered  the house and went upstairs I realized all this has happened.",
        "Apologies for not being able to avoid it. Above and beyond, I have broken your trust and failed to maintain your house, when you were not in town.",
        "Actually, I have booked a carpenter today. He will be visiting tomorrow morning and repairing the window. Additionally, he will also put an extra stronger latch, to avoid such loss in future.",
        "I hope to be more vigilant and careful going forward.",
        "Yours Sincerely",
        "James"
