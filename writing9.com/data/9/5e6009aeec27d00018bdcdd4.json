        "I am your tenant from Flat 3 on Riverside Street. We met each other when I signed the rental agreement in your office.",
        "I have lived here for 6 months now and I am writing to complain about some of the furniture. As you may remember, the dining table is in very poor condition and has uneven legs. It also does not match the dining chairs as these are too low to be comfortable for a table of that height. When I first pointed this out to you, you agreed to provide a brand new dining set. However, you have not done so and I would really like to resolve this matter as soon as possible.",
        "If it is more convenient for you, perhaps you could simply replace the table by finding one of a suitable height for the chairs. This would solve the problems without too much cost, so I hope you agree to this proposed solution.",
        "Looking forward to hearing from you, Yours sincerely, M.M. Egil"
