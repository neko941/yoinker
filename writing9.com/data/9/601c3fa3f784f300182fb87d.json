        "In the era of modernization and technical progress, some people believe that society is able to maintain a tidy eco-system and provide successful economic development at the same time. While others argue that in the modern world these two goals play an inverted role. From my perspective, it is not obvious that  nature suffers the development outcomes.",
        "On the one hand, the industry is a vital driving force for the country\u2019s economy. In fact, the consequences of the factories which provide a profit often contaminate the environment. As a result, the chemicals, namely exhaust fumes and carbon are released into the atmosphere polluting the air and water resources. A good illustration for this is China where the permanent manufacturing line determines the highest air contaminating index in the world. Eventually,  maintaining  clear ecology and harmful producing seem to be delusory simultaneously.",
        "On the other hand, despite the destructive effect on the industry, it is still possible to preserve a significantly high level of  nature without damaging the nation\u2019s economic rate. Contemporary technologies may provide factories with  eco-friendly materials and recycling technics. Likewise, reusing water, plastic as well as the paper can minimize a harmful effect on the environment. For example, Germany has started to use the innovative way for the reusing and recycling wastes investing money in the founding special companies. Hence, if each country provides eco-friendly policy, the range of  pollution will be reduced all over the world. In addition, adapting the manufacturing process to  nature\u2019s needs will give employment to the people who in the long-term perspective will provide  economical prosperity.",
        "In conclusion, focusing on  society\u2019s wealth cannot exist with the protection of the environment  since  releasing toxic materials into the atmosphere. Nevertheless, implementation the contemporary involvements will ensure the chance to minimize the range of pollution."
