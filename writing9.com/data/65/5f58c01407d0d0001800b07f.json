        "At present, there are about thousands of languages that are practised by the people across the globe. However, in this modern era, many native languages are no longer in existence and are dying out all the time. The consequence of this is that there are fewer languages now. Some people opine that this is beneficial for everyone around the world. I, however, have contradicting notion.",
        "To commence with, languages are an integral part of our lives as they are identity of a particular section of society and depicts their cultures and traditions. So, if these languages for me to cease its existence, then the people would lose a significant piece of their life. This would result in learning a new language from the very start. Taking example of tribal and indigenous people from Canada who spoke a distinct dialect and were forced to learn another language. The end result of this was that these people lagged behind from their society and faced tons of difficulties.",
        "Some people, on the other hand, believe that lesser the languages, more it is better for the population at a global level. It is assumed that if there is a universal language that is followed by everyone, then it would be a lot easier to connect with people from any nation and form relationships. Furthermore, a lot of money is spent on  translation every year, so if the language barrier is ended, then it would  save a lot of money.",
        "To conclude, there is no denying of the fact that languages are spoken, it will bring a lot of benefits but taking a part of someone's identity is also not wise."
