        "IN THE MODERN ERA, MOST OF THE SCHOOLS GUIDE THE STUDENTS TO PREFERE AN E-BOOK RATHER THAN PGYSICAL. BUT, AS PER MY VIEW, E-BOOK CONS ON HEALTH CAN NOT BE OVER COME BY ITS PROS AS IT IS AFFECTING THE FITNESS OF THE BODY. THIS ESSAY WOULD DISCUSS THE MAJOR DRAW BQACK OF USING DIGITAL booklet FOR READING THAN PGYSICAL COPY OF IT AND SECONDLY DISCUSS THE BENEFFITS OF USING THE PHYSICAL BOOK.",
        "THE MAIN DETROIMENTAL IMPACT OF REAFING THORUGH DIGITAL textbook IS TO HAVE A WEAK EYE SITE. THIS WEAK EYE SITE PERHAPS RESULTED IN THE PERMENANT DAMAGE TO THE EYE THAT CAN NOT BE REPAIRED. FOR INSTANCE, ACCORDING TO THE HEALTH CARE DEPARTMENT OF THE CANADA'S REPORT, 60% OF THE JUVENILES ARE USED TO HAVE SPECTACLE SINCE THEIR CHILDHOOD BECAUE OF THE READING ALL THE MATERIAL ONLINE.",
        "IN CONTRAST, THE BENEFIT A PERSON GETS FROM A MANUAL LEARNING MATERIAL IS THAT IT DOES NOT REQUIRE ANY KIND OF EQUIPMENT TO GET ACCESS AS IT CAN BE STORED PHYSICALLY IJ THE HOUSE. AN INDIVIDUAL CAN USE IT WITHOUT HAVING INTERNET CONNETION THAT MIGHT BE EXPENSIVE FOR MIDDLE AND IMPOVERISHE CLASS FOLKS.. FOR EXAMPLE, ACCORDING TO THE INDIAN CULTURE, 80% OF THE EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS ADVISE STUDENTS TO OBTAIN A PHYSICAL COPY AS EVERYONE COULD AFFORD IT.",
        "IN CONLCUSION, INDEED EBOOK CAN BE ACCESSIBLE FROM ANY PLACE IN THE WORLD. HOWEVER, ONE SHOULD THINK BEFORE CONSIDEREING THE E-BOOK FOR LEARNINGESPECIALLY FOR SMALL OFFSPRINGS AS IN A LONG TERM IT MAY CAUSE SOME SERIOUS DAMAGE TO THE HUMAN BODY. BUT, THE CONSEQUENCES COULD BE AVOIDED IF PRECAUTION PLACED FURTHER."
