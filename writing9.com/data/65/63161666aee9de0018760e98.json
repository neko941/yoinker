        "I am Tahsin Adam, I reserved your restaurant for a lunch meeting yesterday. First of all, I would like to thank you for your hospitality and facilities, and I appreciate the good services offered by your staff. But on the other hand, I would like to draw your attention to some comments on the food served.",
        "Particularly, the meats were so salty and oily, and vegetables were cooked unfreshly, thus all members participating were upset and they started complaining. Consequently, my director manager and I felt so embarrassed due that no one finished their meal.",
        "The company I work for arranges regular meetings with our clients and agents every month, for that reason, I will give you some advances about food quality for next time. Firstly, you should pay attention that meats cooked with less salt and avoid excessive oil and vegetables cooked freshly. In addition, I would like to suggest that you add some pasta to main course and host ice cream pre-lunch."
