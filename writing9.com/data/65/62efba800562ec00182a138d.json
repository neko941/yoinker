        "There are many athletes around the world. But, only some of them become professionals. Being a professional athlete has advantages and drawbacks which I will write them in this paper.",
        "There are two advantages for a professional athlete. The first one is earning a lot of money. When athletes become professionals, they participate in different global competitions. These competitions are at high levels. Their prices are expensive and valuable. Therefore,  professional athletes can earn a lot of money with every win. The second one is helping people to have a healthy life. We know that exercise is necessary to have a healthy body. When someone is a professional in a particular sport, it means she/he has a lot of knowledge and experience about it. Hence, this athlete can use them and teach common people to have a healthy life.",
        "On the other hand, being a professional athlete has some drawbacks, too. One of them is using a special diet. Professional sportmans should always have a kind of diet according to their sport if they want to achieve the highest ranks. they must be under the supervision of nutritionists during their sports period. So, they can't eat whatever they like. The next one is having hard exercises. Professional athletes have to practice in difficult conditions to reach the necessary physical fitness. Their workouts sometimes last hours. Because of all the above, it's very hard to be a professional athlete.",
        "In summary, being a professional athlete has many benefits and drawbacks. The benefits of it are earning a lot of money and helping ordinary people to live healthy. The drawbacks of it are having a special diet and difficult exercises"
