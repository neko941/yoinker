        "Before the 20th century, people were usually living in  restricted areas. Then, transportation and communication became popular with  technological developments and the interaction between people increased significantly. Globalization means  the increasing integration of all the countries without restrictions on their boundaries. Globalization has both benefits and drawbacks.",
        "The main advantage of globalization comes from the idea of preventing  conflicts between  countries and people. Most   industries and sectors change depending on the inside or outside of the country. If the main language would be the same  all over the world, there would be no language conflicts between the people who were born  anywhere. For instance, although some racist people will  always exist in the world,  globalization maybe can decrease the number of racist people because most   people will feel similar emotions and ideas in the long term such as in the USA.",
        "Globalization  brings such an enormous drawback which can be called  monotonous. People are getting resembling  each other  both physical and psychological. At the first glance, it maybe does not look like a disadvantage however it takes away the uniqueness of people which indicates your identity. For example, the number of aesthetic operations is climbing enormously. Even though people feel better themselves by having aesthetic surgeries, they will have  similar physical appearances after the surgeries. In addition to physical impacts, globalization also is a threat to the variety of different languages. It aims  to have a common language to communicate so that the local languages will be eliminated one by one.",
        "To conclude, globalization has both positive and negative effects on  countries and among the people."
