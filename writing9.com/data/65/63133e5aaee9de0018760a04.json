        "Most people believe working for the same company their entire life is preferable. In contrast, others disagree with this idea and assume that working for various companies is more productive. In the following paragraphs, both of these views will be discussed in detail before the conclusion is reached.",
        "On the one hand, people who stay working for a long time with the same organization will have the prospect of being promoted, having a good salary, more incentive bonuses, and a higher retirement pension. In addition, they are getting used to coordinating with their colleagues, which means there is no pressure to work together. However, one of the disadvantages of remaining at the same company is that the person may get stuck doing the same job year after year. In some cases, they will be a bore to work with as well as not have the inspiration, which affects getting the job done.",
        "On the other hand, when people move to another organization, they will gain various skills and experience. Changing to a new job might include a variety of social networking, which leads to action to develop themselves for adaptation to differentiation. Moreover, some people move to another workplace because they can negotiate with the employer to require a higher income and position, which is one of the main reasons for changing their job.",
        "People who remain in the same organization or decide to move to a different organization have a chance to get a higher salary, they are also bored with their work in the long term."
