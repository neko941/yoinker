        "We are in an age when many of us have been  in an usual  school system which include tests and examinations during  our education.There are lots of advantages and drawbacks of this system. The question is that Do the advantages of examination outweigh any drawbacks? I firmly agree with the idea.In this essay, some reasons of this situation will be discussed.",
        "The main benefit of having these testing systems  is that it helps to make students  study   instead of playing or going out with friends. Furthermore, these systems keep their interest alive on their school courses.For instance, if A male student ,who spend almost all his time with his friends to  hang out or play games such as football, computer games and so on isn\u2019t tested , he can not focus on his courses  and he doesn\u2019t want to listen his courses even if he is a clever man. Consequently, Examination systems should be carried on to keep students\u2019 focus on courses.",
        "On the other hand, These methods bring some disadvantages.These kind of systems pushes them into everyday working as far as they can do. Moreover , it can take all their social time ,which they can spend with their friends, family ,on the contrary, it can affect their social network.For example, according to the experts, students need to spend a part of their daily time to improve their networks, eloquence or social life. In spite of having lots of homework and exams, they should attempt to keep in mind these things. Otherwise, Their education can end with low self-esteem.",
        "In summary, Tests and examinations have been vital for all educational periods. My own view on the matter is ,Despite drawbacks which were mentioned in the third paragraph , the advantages outweigh .By keeping in mind all disadvantages, testing systems should continue at all educational levels."
