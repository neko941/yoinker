        "Nowadays, artists and athletes are receiving more money than other pivotal jobs which have been well-contributed to society such as teachers, doctors and nurses in which they should be more appreciated for improving their salary. I totally agree with this statement for some reasons.",
        "In recent decades, entertainers and professional athletes have been paid in a great nominal of money even though their jobs are not really having a massive impact on society. While people who work in crucial aspects such as health and education aspect are not paid appropriately with their job. There are 2 main reasons why doctors, nurses, and lecturers should obtain more salaries than other jobs. The first reason is they are the backbone of a nation, in other words, all of them are having great impact to nurture the youngsters for a better future, not only for the country's future, but also for the youngster themselves.",
        "On the other hand, doctors, nurses, and lecturers are really needed by citizens to share their knowledge and health. These jobs lead citizens to the right path. For instance, doctors and nurses tend to look after folk when they are getting sick and it is really useful for us than artists and professional players. In addition, lecturers have a tendency to bring a country for a great future due to they will teach future nations in school or college. As evidence, Finlandia has given great fees to their doctors, nurses, and teachers and  Finlandia's government thinks that it is an appropriate way for appreciating them.",
        "To sum up, doctors, nurses, and lecturers have a massive impact on society than entertainers and athletes, and those workers should earn more money than entertainers and athletes. I believe that if the government or the employees pay for those jobs appropriately, this world will be better in the future."
