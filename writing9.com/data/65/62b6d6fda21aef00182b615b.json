        "Media by definition is a reliable source to deliver news and cover comprehensive information to the general populace. They have been the main resources to publish news globally for decades. However, many assume that publishers became more subjective lately and this occurs consequence to overcome.",
        "The assumption of media is the big weapon is undeniably true. They can steer their reader's perspective towards something and influence people's choices. For example, the political parties have been using media as their wingmen to design a well-crafted image of political figures and create biased information, which might include misinformation or even hoax. As a result, the accountability of media is questionable and more people have trust issue with the covered news.",
        "We need collective collaboration between the government and citizenry to restrict the freedom of journalism. First, the government need to regulate the code of ethics for journalists. The containment includes the independence and responsibility in delivering and bringing objective news to a whole nation. Also, the institution may apply media policy to have complied with the media community. Second, people need to infringe the exposure of hoax news and can report if they find biased information that can endanger a whole community.",
        "To conclude, biased media coverage is a result of political competition, and this brings a crucial issue to the nation. The authority needs to impose regulations on media coverage and the society actively engages in notifying unclear and biased publications."
