        "The first reason is that cities have the convenience of transportation. When living in the city, it is not hard going from place to place as vehicles are easy to find. Cities also have various places like hospitals, churches, markets, schools and etc. With available access to transport, it will be hassle-free to reach those destinations. Second, having social life and entertainment. Due to being crowded with people, a person can easily talk to someone and form friendships.

Furthermore, they build more establishments that will provide work to those who want to start a life in the metropolitan area.",
        "On the other hand, because a great number of people moved to cities, they became overpopulated. As a result, overpopulation may cause a shortage of water and food because the number of people that live in an area has exceeded. In addition, it can cause traffic congestion, for many will buy cars for travelling instead of commuting that would take too much time. Being overpopulated will cause water and air pollution, for many people will just throw their garbage everywhere because no space is provided for them."
