As a result,these subjects cannot be denied.",
        "On the other hand,another pivotal factor in the aforementioned proposition is that it is only likely to help in one thrive and excel in various modes.Besides,the innoventions like internet have been a bone of contention ,especially for elders who need physical meetings and care.Furthermore,if myriads relay on machines to persue modern trend,they wouldn't be got enough exercise to stay healthy which lends an air of tremendous diseases like depression.For instance,according to a global survey, villagers have less death rate then metropolitan or modern areas ,as they don't use innovations, prefer walk for travel and held physical meetups instead of video calls.Regardless,these factors cannot be wrong to promote this view.",
        "In the nutshell,according to the afforenamed quarells,despite having some againsts like loss of our traditions and customes ,depression of not having strong bonds;whereas,the comfort and ease due to swap surpass the against."
