        "Money plays a vital role in everybody's life. Some communities believe that pupils should be paid without considering their profession. In this essay, I will discuss some pros and cons of this matter and  then I will give my opinion on this matter with relevant examples.",
        "On the one side, Some people like to work physically meanwhile some other people like to work mentally with their degrees. Some communities choose their profession based on their interest. For example, if a person, who wants to work mentally by sitting in a cabin chooses the software field with the help of his/her degree. And another good example is, A person, who has an interest in agriculture, chooses to farm as his/her profession. Based on the people's convenience they are choosing their work. So it is better to provide equal wages because some may be good at doing work physically while others are good at doing their work with their knowledge.",
        "On the other side, In this modern era, there is  huge competition around the world. Without degrees, it is tough to get settled in their career. Based on their degrees people are getting wages. Nowadays, people are trying very hard to get good scores and do higher studies for better degrees. In this competitive world, the degree is important and plays a vital role to live a significant life. For example, People are going  abroad for their higher studies because with higher degrees people are getting more wages. And based on working hours also people are getting more wages.",
        "To sum up, In this world, Everyone is equal. But due to competition payments are being given based on their degrees. Otherwise, every person will get equal wages without hard work."
