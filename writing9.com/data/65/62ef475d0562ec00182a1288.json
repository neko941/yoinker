Before I explain the current situation, I would like you to know that I have no intention to make any personal attack and I am simply telling you what I have experienced. By far I find the situation is very fragile and it is very hard to deal with him.",
        "First of foremost, my roommate made so much noise quite a few times and it seems that he did not want to change even though I requested him so many times not to make such things. Secondly, he brought his guest very often while I kept complaining to him not to bring anyone anyhow without letting me know prior. Besides, he has no discipline at all and the room is a mess. All of these problems always contracts me from my study and I am extremely worried if I can do well in the next coming exam.",
        "Apparently, sharing the room with this type of colleague is not really comfortable to me. This is why I would to request any single room if there is any available in the college. May I request you please to consider this scenario in top priority and let me know as early as possible because the exam is around the corner and I need the high score indeed in this test.",
