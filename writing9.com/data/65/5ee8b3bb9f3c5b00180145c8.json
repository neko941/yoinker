        "On the other hand, this progress has several demerits for some countries. For instance, China is one of the most prominent countries in this field and a considerable amount of portions is relevant to this country. In fact, there is an exclusion in this respect and the industry of many countries has been deteriorated by this situation because China can produce all products without any trouble and also very similar to genuine version and devote all markets to itself. Moreover, this matter has a negative impact on other countries due to the fact that they do not have enough motivation to be innovative, in addition they will be turned into a dependent country like Iran.",
