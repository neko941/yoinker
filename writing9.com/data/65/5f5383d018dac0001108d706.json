        "Noise disturbance has been a problem for many people, therefore some advocate that governments should enforce laws to limit the noise emission by individuals. This essay discusses both benefits and drawbacks of such regulations.",
        "Looking at the advantages of noise limiting laws, the most noticeable outcome is the reduction of conflict between neighbours. Policemen are often called to mediate disputes over noise. For instance, more than half of police emergency calls in Brazil are due to problems related to sound disturbance in residential areas. Another benefit of regulation would be an increase in the population\u2019s health. Researches show that noise disturbance is linked to numerous health issues, from damage to the hearing apparatus to negative impacts on concentration, there are several examples of how negative it may be. Therefore, limiting the intensity of noise would have a great impact on wellbeing.",
        "Nonetheless, there are also disadvantages related to the implementation of laws about noise. Firstly, some would argue that liberty would not be respected, since individuals could be penalized for actions taken within their property\u2019s boundaries. People accused of noise disturbance often justify their behaviour stating that all the sounds are produced inside their private properties, so governments should have no authority over there. Secondly, if no public authority is established to applicate the law, fewer or no people are to obey it. Therefore, by promoting severe regulations on noise, public administrations would have to hire more policemen to face a potential rise in the demands for law enforcement, meaning higher costs to the population.",
        "In conclusion, a consensus over whether strict regulations should be applied to noise disturbance or not is a distant perspective. The main advantages seem to be those related to the reduction of disputes between people and an increase in the population\u2019s health, while the most perceptible drawbacks are linked to damage to individual liberties and a rise in the expenditure for law enforcement personnel."
