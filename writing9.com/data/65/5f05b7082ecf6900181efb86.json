        "It is believed that with advanced technologies such as reading tablets and laptops, the popularity of books among people will decrease in the future, since e-books might become cheaper or even free, compared with printed  magazines. In my opinion, the fashion of paper based books or newspapers will go down among youngsters in this century, while the older generation members  will be interested in printed publications.",
        "First of all, even though electronic publications are more convenient, since people can download many different genre books into one device, the elderly people are more likely to purchase it from the stores. The reason why it is happening is that not all retired people are able to learn the usage manuals of these gadgets. For example, if an old person decides to buy a tablet for reading, one must have relatives who might teach him or her or go to the local community centre where volunteers might explain basics of device usage. However, if a few lessons would be unsuccessful, the person might make a decision not to use it again. As a result, one will come back to the printed publications, because reading it requires no effort.",
        "Second of all, e-books are becoming more popular among young people because younger generations are more focused on reducing environmental issues. For example, with online books purchasing young adults are decreasing deforestation and extinction of various types of animal species. Under those circumstances, the amount of CO2 is going down and many animal habitats are saved.",
        "In conclusion, it is expected that online reading will become more and more popular. Nevertheless, printed publication will remain in department stores shelves."
