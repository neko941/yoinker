        "Parents working full-time job usually find it difficult to take care of their children after their school closes because they are still at work. Schools in some countries decided to come against this problem and extended their open hours s children can be looked after until parents finish their job. Advantages and disadvantages can be found in this occurrence.",
        "To begin with, full-time workers do not need to worry about founding a babysitter. The search sometimes can be very troubling since you never know how the sitter will behave when being alone with a youngster. Father and mother want to make sure that their children will be in good hands and do not want to be stressed about their kids' safety. Moreover, when pupils stay late at school they can receive help from teachers or school guardians with their homework. After they spend the time at school  doing tasks for the institute, when they come back home they have more space for themselves.",
        "On the other hand, some kids may feel tired after the whole day at school but will not be able to rest in their bed since their parents are still working. Later on, this situation could lead to sleep deprivation as a child lacks a moment for leisure. Secondly, not every young person feels good when are too long outside of their house. Some juvenile is more comfortable and safer in their parents or siblings company or at least in their own house. Also, this could lead to setting barriers between other people and themselves.",
        "Summing up, the possibility of leaving youth at faculty longer may be very helpful to some parents. However, it is important to work out a system and a schedule so the kid knows when they will be spending more time at school. Mums and dads need to keep in minds their children needs and view on the situation."
