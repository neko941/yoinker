        "Dear Manager,",
        "I am writing to describe the appaling experience I had to go through while staying at your hotel. My name is Laura Espeso, my family and I spent our most recent holiday at The Palmas resort, located on 53 Thompson Street, right across Main Beach. I had previously booked two bedrooms months ago. In fact, I precisely expressed our need to include in one of the rooms three separate single beds. Once we arrived at the hotel, we showed our booking reference number at the front desk. We expected, as per our reservation, accommodations that would suffice our previously stated demands, however, to our surprise, the second room had only a queen bed. As the hotel was fully booked, there was no other room available for my children, so we thought we would have to leave and find another place to stay.",
        "Gracefully, the receptionist was very kind and automatically indicated other members of the staff to seek inflatable mattresses so that, at least for that night, we would have someplace to accommodate all our children. She made sure the next morning we had our full refund and complimentary breakfast as a way to express their affliction for such a big mistake. As a humble suggestion, I believe it is very important that you have an urgent meeting with your staff on how to upload the reservation's information in order to prevent  such a discomfortable incident from ever happening ever again.",
        "Hope to hear from you soon,",
        "Yours sincerely,",
