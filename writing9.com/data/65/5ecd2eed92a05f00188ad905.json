        "Nowadays, people can easily find and share information online. This can result in many issues, which calls for possible solutions to be adopted.",
        "Easy finding and sharing information online can lead to several consequences. One problem could be that scammers can steal user\u2019s personal information such as emails, phone numbers, credit card numbers or bank account information.  As an example, they will use user\u2019s personal information to scam user\u2019s friends and relatives. Moreover, credit card numbers and bank account information are vulnerable to be hacked by hackers. As a result, users can lose personal credibility and money. Another issue could be that academic information can be inaccurate. This can make you misunderstand an issue and affect study or work performance. Especially, if  you find and share unverified political information, you will be arrested and affect your future. In addition, you also will make other people have negative attitudes toward the Governing party. This can cause demonstrations and rids, therefore, the country\u2019s economy could be damaged seriously.",
        "There are a number of measures which can be put forward to ease issues. Firstly, user should not oversee personal information online and only share with trusted people. Users can also enhance online security measures by selling a unique password or apply two factor authentication to better protect users\u2019 accounts from being hacked into by hackers. Another solution could be that you should only search for information from credible sources such Government websites or university websites and avoid open sources such wikipedia. This helps you reduce the risk of encountering inaccurate or misleading information. In addition, users should not find or even share unverified political information. They should advise other people not to propagandize against the government on the internet.",
        "In conclusion, although easy finding and sharing information online can cause a number of problems, there are several actions that can be taken to address these issues."
