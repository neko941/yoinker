        "There is no refuting the fact that money is one of the most important factors in a person\u2019s life. It has been argued vociferously that one should pick a job which pays you more even if you are not content with the job. I downright disagree with this opinion and deem that job satisfaction is much more essential than the amount of wages.",
        "Ab-initio, I believe that no matter how much high your salary is, it cannot Big salary is much more important than job satisfaction provide a sense of fulfilment. Despite the fact that a person is making good money, if he/she is stressed with the nature of his/her duties, this person would not relish his work. On the contrary, pursuing your ambitions and working for it would make work a child\u2019s play and bring a sense of joy in one\u2019s life. Furthermore, doing what your heart aches for also makes you put in extra effort and result in career growth advancement. Put differently, job satisfaction is directly proportional to productivity.",
        "Employees who love their job are generally the one who triumph more than those who toil only for money. For example, Elon Musk sold \u2018PayPal\u2019 and invested all his wealth into businesses which he thought would lead to a better and more advanced world. He was on the verge of going bankrupt, but instead of giving up, he endeavoured for his dreams and today, he is one of the most successful entrepreneurs in the world.",
        "The gist of the matter is that there are enough examples present around us which points to the fact that job satisfaction weighs much heavy as compared to the money one makes."
