        "Every people all over the world was born to be part of a certain country who has the main language on daily basis, thus it is a common thing for people if there are several problems when learning a foreign language. In this essay, I will try to deliver the obstacles that most people face and how to deal with these problems.",
        "The major problem that is usually faced by people is the variety of vocabulary where some people suffer to remember new dictionary of words which is barely heard or said by them day-to-day. When people learn a new word, but they do not often use it to talk with others, thus that vocabulary will be forgotten sooner or later. Besides, the other issue is grammar, which is an important matter for several languages because it can differ the time and process about something. It will be hard to understand if someone who learns any language does not have complex rules in their native language, for example, there is no difference between verbs in the past or the future.",
        "To tackle those challenges above-mentioned, there are several solutions, such as increase the intensity of learning with more consistency in the long term, because a foreign language cannot be mastered in a short period like finish schoolwork in one night. Also, reading the news, listening to podcasts, and watching movies without subtitles, and all should be in a foreign language and done regularly to earn new vocabulary. In addition, find a partner who also learns a foreign language to have some conversations and feedback with each other will be an advantage.",
        "To conclude, the main issue in learning a new language is numerous words and guidelines, so the only way out is to stay studying consistently and endlessly."
