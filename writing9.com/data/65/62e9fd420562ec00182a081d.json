        "Ans. Many individuals opine that it is better to adjust with bad situation,  like an unsatisfied jod or lack of money.  Others believe that it is admirable to try and hoping for the best . In my view., I believe that people should try to facing their problems. This essay will further explain both the sides and provide reasons as well as, a illogical conclusion.",
        "To commence with , in this modern era everyone wants to show their luxurious lifestyle toward others,  but due to unsatisfied job and shortage of money nobody wants to deal with the situation. However,  they adopted their bad conditions rather than doing other work or job. Some of people who are stressed and struggling because of some reasons they do not want to work again. As a result,  they will comfortable with bad situation . For example,  according to a research by WHO 75% of natives are mentally depressed and they do not do any kind of work or make money in their life.",
        "On the other side, every problem have silution . If inhabitants doing work hard so they definitely achieve their goals.  They have to improve their problems by doing work hard. In addition to this,  people should have to take challenges in their life ,moreover they were able to compeate different competitions. As well as,  if people have lots of money so they can easily deal with bad situations. For instance, as per a survey conducted by 'The Times of India, 85% people were satisfied with their work and surviving a wealthy lifestyle by learning new skills from old mistakes.",
        "To sum up, I believe that both sides have their own benefit. Although,  people accept their bad situation but they have to do work hard and learn new skills."
