        "Nowadays, more families choose fast food over home-cooked meals although they know that it is bad for their health. Still, grabbing fast food has its benefits worth considering. For Example, the time it took to order fast food is substantially less than making a meal themselves and they don't have to prepare any ingredients which could save them a ton of time.",
        "The time it took to prepare a meal is essential. From my experience, it took at least 2 hours a day or more to set up. First of all, you have to think of what you want to have. After you make a list of all the ingredients you need, you are now going to a shop nearby and then carefully select what you needed from your list. This would take some time if you lived far away from the store.",
        "Next, after you come back from the store, you have to bring out what you have bought and wash anything that can be washed such as vegetables in the clean water. Then you will have to prepare all the ingredients for want you are going to make. This could take a while if you prepare a complicated meal  or a big feast.",
        "What comes next is cooking where many things can go wrong. For instance, you may add too much salt or use too much heat which could result in a disaster. However, there is the last thing you have to do whether you succeed or not. You have to clean up by washing dishes, pots and any cooking devices. This would also take time.",
        "On the other hand, if you choose to order fast food, you just have to take out a garbage bag at most or do nothing if you go eat outside. This would not only cost almost zero time of yours  but also have less complicated tasks to do. Therefore, that is the reason why families prefer fast food over cooking one themselves."
