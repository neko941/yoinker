        "Safe driving is essential to reduce the number of road accidents. There are some people consider  punishing the offender would be an effective method to tackle this issue, the opponents think that implementing other measures could be eliminated the problem significantly. In my opinion, I, personally, support the former\u2019s view since the punishment refraies people from committing wrong doing in their life time.",
        "On one hand, when a culprit is sentenced or fined for  violating traffic rules or speed driving would allow him  to  repent his mistakes while serving  a jail term. The price of a  small negligence may cost  the  life of a person, so stringent law enforcement is must.  For example, driving bicycle without  wearing a helmet is a punishable offence in India. Even though giving multiple warnings,   the most of the offenders tend to  repeat the mistakes over again and again. Therefore, it has been noted that by administering stricter rules and punishments would minimise such cases from occurring.",
        "The opponents of the above the statement advocate that by enforcing other tactics would decrease traffic violations. They tend to believe that lack of awareness of traffic rules and safety measures  are the real  causative factors of the  violation. For this, providing  free  education  and conducting skill updating classes to drivers on a regular basis  can be introduced. However,  not only  are these  methods   rarely successful,  but  this also  requires a huge funding  and people may  not value the significance. For instance, implementing these kinds of  educations surely require experts and modern teaching facilities, which may not be feasible most of the time.",
        "In conclusion, people have a different  opinion on whether giving  punishments or  implementing some other methods would reduce the offenders. I, firmly, think that stringent punishment would eliminate the problem  effectively."
