        "In many nations around the world, people are becoming more addicted to crime stories on television and in books. People consume crime fiction because of its shock value; however, in my opinion, it has a detrimental effect on  society.",
        "As we have an innate curiosity about crime. This is probably because crime is something that rarely happens to us and yet we hear about it all the time in newspapers and on television. This builds curiosity. We are eager to know the modus operandi of the criminals. We like suspense and twists. When we read crime fiction, we often assume ourselves to be the detective. We are eager to solve the crime. These stories cater to the needs of people; hence, we read or watch them.",
        "In my opinion, crime fiction has both positive and negative aspects. It makes people aware of the dangers they face. At one point, I used to watch the series Crime Patrol on television. I found the stories gripping. On the other hand, exposure to crime stories may make people anxious about their safety. Excessive exposure can even make them depressed. Crime fiction influences potential criminals too. They can draw fresh criminal ideas from such stories and books. The overall effect is both positive and negative.",
        "In summary, people enjoy crime fiction because they are intrigued by its suspenseful plots and gory details. In my opinion, this trend has both positive and negative effects. It makes people aware of the dangers they face but at the same time, it also gives ideas to those with criminal minds."
