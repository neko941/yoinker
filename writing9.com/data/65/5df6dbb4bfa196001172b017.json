        "A section of people contend that proper nutrition and physical activity are not an essential attribute to enjoy disease free long life. I completely disagree with this believe as good diet and exercise consist of undeniable importance to maintain a healthy long life and play a vital role in leading a disease free lifestyle.",
        "Firstly, a proper meal plan which is developed for an individual can help boost good immune system. A good nutritional diet including green leaves, dairy and lean meat helps in giving essential nutrients needed by the body to grow at every stage of life.

A balanced nutritional food helps in maintaining a healthy mind and body.",
