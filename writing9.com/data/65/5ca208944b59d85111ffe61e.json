        "I am writing this letter to express my concerns about some issues that I have been facing in office that are affecting me. As you are aware due to department restructuring  some of my team members were let go from the services of the company. Some of my team members are holding me responsible for this and are being non-cooperative in day to day work.This is severely impacting the departments as well as my performance.",
