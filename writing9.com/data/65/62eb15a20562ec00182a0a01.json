        "It is true that fast foold is becoming more and more popular in our lives all over the world. This trend has negative impacts on our lifestyles and diet. I mostly agree with this opinion, but I believe that people may sometimes have fastfood.",
        "There are some reasons that fast food may have bad effects on our lives. First, fast food tend to have high calories and lack of nutritions. For example, most fast foods such hambergers, potates, and shakes use too much oils, salt, sugars, and carbohydrate. In addition, people are easily addicted to fast food as these meals are convenient, cheap, and delicious. Thus, people would get weight if they have too much of the meals. Second, people may find it difficult to feel sensitive tastes once they get used to the fast food habit. As we have more oily, salty, and sugarly fast food, people would need stronger stimulation. Therefore, it would be hard to feel gentle tastes.",
        "On the other hand, there are some positive aspects for fast food. It is convenient and time-efficient. For instance, mothers can save cooking time when they are busy with their work and child care. When office workers do not enough time for their lunch, they can have it in a limited time. In this regard, fast food can be effective when it is combined properly in our lives.",
        "In conclusion, I mostly agree with the opinion that fast food have more negative effects in our lifestyles and diet. However, people can utilize the fast food when necessary as it can help them to save their time."
