        "It goes beyond any doubt that contemporary citizens buy more commodities than their actual needs. Some people think that advertisements should take the responsibility for widespread excessive consumption, and I totally support this opinion.",
        "Indeed, people have more material needs than before because of the advance in productivity which makes life standards  lifted to a higher level. For instance, the number of clothes in today\u2019s youngsters\u2019 closets is much higher than the older generation who usually wore holes in their shirts or pants. Consequently, an increasing number of commodities are produced to meet people's various needs, which enrich normal people's life as well. Material abundance gives people's choice to experience a wonderful life which means the need for goods will definitely soar than hundreds of years ago when the ancients lived a much simpler life.",
        "However, customers are more often attracted by commercials to buy things out of their plan and fall into the trap of consumerism. To be specific, in order to enhance  sales performance, some enterprises choose to cooperate with stars and send this message to buyers through the channel of advertisement, which will attract fans to buy more stuff. Purchasing  all kinds of goods only brings people temporary happiness and more crowded living space which are the reason why minimalism become popular recently among consumers who are plagued by the overconsumption problem, while the rise in sales volume brings businessmen who pay for advertisements  great financial benefit. Moreover, consumers can turn to be unreasonable and impulsive after the nonstop plausible persuasion of advertisement.",
        "To sum it up, I believe that even if the advertisement is not the only factor of overconsumption, it still plays a crucial role in  mad shopping behaviour."
