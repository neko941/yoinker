Others, however, believe that those children who are controlled are not well prepared to tackle the challenges life brings to them.\n\nDiscuss both views and give your opinion.\n\nGive reasons for your answer and include relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.",

        "While some people believe children must be forced into good conduct, others argue that such controlled children might not be able to handle real-world challenges. I personally believe that children should not be limited to obeying rules but be allowed to explore and face the world on their own. This essay discusses both perspectives.",
        "On the one hand, behaviour is an important aspect of one's personality. Such values if inculcated at a young age cement themselves as pillars of a person's identity. Doing so allows children to be upcoming model citizens of a society and they barely budge off their values. Such elegant conduct can be observed in children born and raised in the royal families of India.",
        "On the other hand, forceful induction of good behaviour can lead to frustration which often causes a child to be repulsive. The habit of obeying rules might not be beneficial when a person faces a situation or a challenge where one has to defy the rules. The child can become limited in the scope of his behavioural teachings and might not be able to cope with others in life. For example, the child of Mughal emperor Akbar was observed to have great behavioural traits, but failed to adapt once he was assigned the throne.",
        "In conclusion, while both sides of the debate are able to back their opinion sufficiently, I believe that children must be taught good behaviour without the use of rules. A child is able to learn more by observing and having real-world experiences."
