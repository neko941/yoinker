        "With the rapid development of humans, the governments decide to occupy forests in order to construct more cities. As a result, a different variety of animals face extinct threats by which their habitats have been destroyed by humans. Meanwhile, more and more environmental organizations work on appealing to the government to protect this wildlife.",
        "There will be  numerous  benefits if animals can be protected without being endangered. The primary benefit is keeping creature diversity where is significant and important for education. For example, if more animals exist without dangers, our offspring will have more opportunities to observe and study this wildlife physical, not only read information about them in books which is a much boring method to study. Furthermore, a lot of animals can contribute to human life. For instance, bees are the most important insects that help humans  cultivate crops and contribute to pollen dissemination. Additionally, people can not live longer under the condition of the extinction of bees.",
        "Governments have a responsibility to run a practical implementation in order to protect animals. In my opinion, a wildlife conservation project is the best method to keep animals away from dangers. Governments should build more zoos to ensure the security of those animals which are becoming endangered. Zoo staff help them live in an unstressful condition, and reproduction is necessary to protect them. Meanwhile, governments should take the role to construct a suitable environment in habitats where these animals originally live in. Once animals get enough cures and no risk will happen to their species, they are able to return back to their own home.",
        "Human development should ensure that it does not unduly affect other animal races  and that humans should work to protect animals at risk and create a peaceful world in which humans and animals coexist."
