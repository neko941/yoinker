        "Science is the backbone of technological developments that have helped in human dominance in the world. It is true that the government and authorities have not provided any extra incentives or scholarships to  science students. In my opinion, the government should provide extra benefits to science students.",
        "To commence with, scientists and researchers are the people who dedicated their lives to  society. Firstly, they are the people who work hard to discover new technologies, medicines and the like by neglecting their family life. As everyone knows a scientist\u2019s life is full of stress and tension, and most   intelligent youngsters have a reluctant mind to become a scientist or researchers.",
        "Furthermore, scientists are the boons to humanity. In this modern world, most of the essential problems can be solved with a mouse click ranging from e-banking to telemedicine. Moreover, Computers, televisions and mobile phones have made human life easier, faster and more efficient.",
        "On the contrary, there are thousands of students who do not have the basic facility and money to complete their elementary education which is quite necessary for the development of the country and individuals. There is an army of people who assert that a 100% literacy rate should be the primary goal of a country and the illiterate need to get more support. In this regard, providing extra facilities to the science students only might seem like a discriminative idea.",
        "To recapitulate, scientists\u2019 contribution towards society and to the world is invaluable so the science students deserve more favourable support from the government, these supports can attract more students to this field."
