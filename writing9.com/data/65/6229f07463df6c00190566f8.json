        "This is always a heated debate about whether parents should buy a massive number of toys for their children or not. Some people believe that children will obtain advantages through playing the toys. however, some people think that there are some negative effects for children who play with  a large number of toys. In this essay, I will discuss both points of view and give an example in the following paragraphs.",
        "To begin with, some parents tend to purchase a large number of toys for their children, because they want to earn attention from their children. For example, children are sensitive to the colourful toy, therefore parents will grab the colourful toy in front of them to attract their concentration. Moreover, some parents think that the toys can be a good friend accompany with their childhood, therefore they buy a lot of toys for their children then they won't feel boring anymore.",
        "In contrast, some experts believe there are negative impacts for children who hold a massive number of toys. First of all, children do not know how to control their desire, because their parents will buy whatever toys they want , and by following up this pattern, children will no longer feel thankful through the toys which they already have .  For example, it is easy to see that a kid asks for a new toy from their parent, although they have many toys in their home already, and the parent will purchase the new toy for their kid in the end.",
        "In conclusion, I believe that parent has the responsibility to educate their children. The parent can buy the first new toy for their children and teach them if they want a new toy, they need to earn it by doing a good performance. That is to say, there is nothing that is free in the world, everything needs to be gained by sort of paybacks."
