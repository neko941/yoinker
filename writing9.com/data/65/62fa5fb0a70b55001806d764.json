        "Not knowing the vocabulary of the land where one starts a new life seems to have the potential to cause serious problems. However, in this day and age of technological development, I disagree with this view to a certain extent.",
        "First, translation technology has improved significantly in modern times, and it is now easy to translate any word with a small smartphone. Some apps allow you to take a picture of a letter or text with a camera and have it instantly translated and read out loud or show the pronunciation in your mother tongue, even if you know less of the phrases. If you need to communicate with someone, you can type what you want to say in your expression into a translation app, and the app will pronounce it correctly in the new word. It is not that difficult to live without knowing it.",
        "However, as language is very much dependent on culture, if you do not understand those, you will not be able to adapt to everyday life. Respect for each other's culture is essential, but migrants, who are in the minority, need to have a bit of a 'go with the flow mentality. In Japan, too, Trouble arises in the lives of immigrants, primarily due to a lifestyle unsuited to Japanese life by people who do not want to learn  Japanese.",
        "If they try to make a living, they may not find it as complex or cause as many problems as in the past due to technological developments. However, even if it is difficult to speak the language of the destination of migration, if there is no willingness to adapt to the country's culture, Hardness may arise on other points."
