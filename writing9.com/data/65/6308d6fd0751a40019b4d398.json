        "Dear Mr Robert,",
        "I am writing this letter to express my interest in teaching a language to your child.",
        "My name is Arsalan Farooq and last month I saw the advert related to teaching  your kid my national language, French, for the whole year. However, I would be interested in it and would love to perform this job because of a couple of reasons. Firstly, I live near to your residence, so it would be feasible for me to get there and manage a schedule of classes conveniently. Moreover, I am a French teacher by profession and I have been teaching it for 10 years. Therefore, I have a vast experience in it and know how to make your child speak it in one year.",
        "Besides my core field, I can perform nursing services as well. Since you both are working people and it would surely be easier for you to look after your kid for the whole day when you will be out of the home. I have already done this work when I was in the third year of my university. I did it for two years for a well know centre and also received the award of the best Care Taker.",
        "It is requested you hire me as I will have to apply for a new job next year and for this, I need 12 years of experience. Although, this is going to be 11 years by the end of this month. But if I manage to get this opportunity I would be able to achieve 12 years in this field by the next year and would be eligible for the new vacancy.",
        "I look forward to hearing from you soon.",
