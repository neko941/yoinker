        "In these days, usually,people are captivated by their everyday life to such an extent they don't time to take care of their extended family like parents or grandparents. Sometimes they are left to fend for themselves, while Some of the oldsters are dropped into care homes or old homes also. In this essay,we will shed light on the positive and negative effects of putting elder people into nursing homes.",
        "To begin with, people in the later stages of their lives are fragile and sensitive. After a hard day,they come with a little relaxation and they deserve to be loved and cared. On top of that, they have fulfilled their duties and raised their children with all their resources hence at the end of the day, there should be some bonus for them. Secondly, although in care home doctors and nurses will look after them with medicine and a good diet. however, some times the cure for their sickness is not in medicine but in our time and our smile. Because when we sit with them and speak some gentle words then it refreshes them more then anything else. For instance, according to a survey, people at old home often feel homesickness and missed their beloved family member. Hence, it is good to take care of them at homes.",
        "On the other hand, in old homes,people of the same age are together. All of them have free time for each other, hence they share memories of their life with one another. Similarly,they got incentivized when look others struggling with their problems, Which encourages them. Moreover, specialists are always available at these centre regardless of the day and night. Nurses give them food and medicines on time. In other words, these old homes are facilitated by the government to give oldsters better health amenities.",
        "To conclude, as we know that roses are always accompanied by thrones hence there are also some pros and cons of old houses. But in my opinion, we should give them space in our homes."
