        "Some people argue that electronic games are detrimental to young people, while others think that they are beneficial. While those games are encouraging creativity and help minors learning different languages, I believe that many of those games promoting violence and being a massive distraction for children.",
        "The main advantage of video games is helping children learn foreign languages. For instance, many games are based on the English language. For this reason, non-native kids can learn English vocabulary while they are playing. Moreover, many games have speaking interactions. As a consequence, children can speak with native people, and that will help their tongue muscles be used in this language. A recent research found that almost every child video games were a fundamental thing for their language acquisition. Add to it, the structure of internet games have a massive impact on the creativity of children. Gaming designers did incredible work at the infrastructure of games. That improves the imagination skills of children. While online games are enhancing the creativity of young people and playing a huge rule in teaching a foreign language, many of those games promoting violence and have a negative impact on their academic performance.",
        "The primary disadvantage of online games is many of those games promoting violence. For example, fighting games have guns and blood shots. In addition, if a child wants to win the game, he/she will kill all the characters in any way. Those requirements maybe develop a sense of crime in young minds. A recent government survey found that 58% of young criminals online games made them want to experience a murderous crime. Add to it, many children are addicted to playing video games. As a result, overlocking their homework and lewer their grades at school. Online games have multi-levels to complete the game. Therefore, minors will be addicted to this game until they finish it. I believe that internet games have a deconstruction impact on children. For instance, addicted children always be low-level at school.  And the structure of the game is deliberately designed to make young people addicted to it.",
        "To conclude, while computer games enhancing creativity in children and have a positive development in teaching languages, I believe that online games are encouraging crimes and playing a massive effect on children's performance at school."
