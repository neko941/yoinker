        "Opinions differ on whether individuals have the same power to influence societies when compared to governments and large institutions. in my opinion, the influences from the latter are by far more significant than that from the individuals owing to financial consideration and their authorities.",
        "In order to initiate changes in a society, money plays a pivotal role in supporting the progress as well as motivating the participants. With the strong financial foundations, governments and large institutions can invest in various aspects, such as building infrastructures, supporting scientific researches and paying the manpower. These financial inputs help tremendously in initiating and sustaining a change or a development. Monetary contributions are also helpful in bringing positive messages in a society. For example, students are more keen in their academic to strive for scholarships given by government and large institutions. This creates a positive learning atmosphere among pupils.",
        "The authorities and social influences from governments and large corporations also bring changes to larger scales. By improving regulations and laws, governments can affect the public behaviors on a national level through civil obligation. Large corporations can influence the societies too by being a leading role in their industries. For instance, fair trading policies and 5-day working basis are the successful examples of raising public awareness on certain social issues. Such dramatic changes and attention can never be leaded by individuals which are more scattered.",
        "In conclusion, it is undoubtedly that individuals participation so are crucial to social changes. However, governments and large institutions have greater potential in provoking changes more significantly and effectively with the help of their financial supports and authorities."

    "submitter": "Advanced technology has changed the way people communicate. Nowadays, many of them prefer texting over talking  phes since the former enable multiple ctacts at the same time, and furthermore it aids to remember essential talks. This trend brings both advantages and disadvantages. The primary reas why people use texting to communicate than talking is it saves time. Due to a hectic work schedule, they did not get adequate time to individually ctact their family and friends through calling. Text messages,  the other hand, allow to multiple cversati at the same time. Another reas is easy to remember imperative details in the written form . Phe talks can be arduous to recall especially for elderly groups when they have to multiple work to do. For example, a reminder text message about an important meeting helps an employee to be  time. The major disadvantage of this practice is social isolati. As people more indulge in the virtual media, face to face interacti decreases. This not hampers the emotial development of an individual but also shrinks their social circle. Moreover, it affects their linguistic skills. Since mobile phes have preinstalled dictiary and auto correcti softwares, they put less affords in remembering spellings this in turn distorts writing and speaking skills.  In cclusi, although communicati via texting has some minor advantages, I believe it brings more disadvantage such as social isolati and degradati of a language.",
