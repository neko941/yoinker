        "Many try to have success in their career and spend enough quality time with their family at the same time. The important problem of these causes is exhausting and the most viable solution for this problem is by conducting a public awareness campaign, educating about dangers of working too hard.",
        "The principal problem associated with spending enough time with your loved ones and be a success in your career can lead toward burn out. Burnout is when people both mentally and physically affected due to working too hard to an extent where it may no longer continue effectively. Because of this person felt mental and physical health issues because of working too hard, it directs towards either, breakdown in the relationship in the family or poor performance at work. For example, in a recent government survey, about  93 % CEO's felt they did not spend enough quality time with their children because of working long hours completely get exhausted  when they returned home.",
        "To tackle this problem, the government should launch a publicity campaign in the media and in schools to educate people about the dangers of working long hours and not spending quality time with their kin. Many people afraid to ask their boss for the time off work because of the stigma surrounding people working less hours than normal and also they do not share this problem with their close ones. This often results in a tragic situation in the family or in a career.  A publicity awareness program could shed some light on this difficult situation and allow people to be more open and honest about their state of mind. For example, a similar initiative program conducted in Japan, resulted as 82% decrease in calling sick at work because of the mental fatigue.",
        "To conclude, striking balance between family life and success in career, which can be totally exhausting. However, this can be solved by initiating a public awareness campaign by educating people about the dangers of working too hard."
