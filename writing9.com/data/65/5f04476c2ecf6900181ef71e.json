        "It is believed by some that the most effective way to help homeless people is by giving them money. This essay will describe the negative and positive side of giving homeless people cash.",
        "On the one hand, people believe that giving homeless people money is the best way to help them. They can use the money people gave them to buy their daily needs such as foods and clothes. Furthermore, they can also save the cash people gave them to rent a place to live. Even though they can use the money to buy foods, drinks, and clothes, we are unsure whether they can go to a mini market to buy their needs or they cannot go. Then, what can we do to make sure they are going to use the money properly?",
        "On the other hand, we can also help them by giving them clothes that are still in good condition. For instance, we can give them old clothes we do not use anymore, but they are still in a good condition. This way, they can obtain clothes and they do not need to go and buy it on their own. We can also give them foods and drinks. This way, we can make sure they can get foods and clothes. Furthermore, we can also give them both cash and goods, or money, goods, and clothes.",
        "In conclusion, I agree that one of the most effective way to help homeless people is by giving them cash, but I believe we should also consider giving them clothes or foods. Even though both ways are beneficial and also useful to homeless people."
