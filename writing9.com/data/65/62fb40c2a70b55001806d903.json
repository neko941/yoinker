        "Admittedly , offspring are so sensitive about any single thing they grow up with . so, parents should be looking after their heir as much as they can . We are responsible for offspring , due to scion building the community through their intelligence and creativity . the environment of kids definitely builds their behaviours . That's why I am going to explain my opinions . on one hand , I agree with the first part of the statement that video impacts scion's behaviour . So , an heir will be very smart and educational if they watch good charges like ; educational manipulation , documentary programs and so on . And these oversights are very crucial and will influence their characters through the strong background they had and much of confidence they will be. In addition , increase their interaction with society. on the other hand, I also concur with the former view , the quantum time watching station can affect good and bad way on offspring\u2019s behaviour , the bad impact, when they spent adequate time on a TV set,a TV set can impact badly on heirs, for instance ,  hyperactivity , reduce their ability to be creative, distract their attention and encourage a sedentary lifestyle . in conclusion , parents should be very careful what their kids watch on the box and give them a specific time to watch good things far away from violence and touter handling . Enhance physical activities like ; playing with others, gathering with their peers , feeding the animals , reading books , drawing and so on ."
