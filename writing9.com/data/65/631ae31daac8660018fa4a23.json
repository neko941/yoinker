Moreover, many guests come in your apartment and make huge noise while ravishing the party. I moved to this building with an intention to prepare for a competitive exam.",
        "However, I am unable to study for last two months because of your events as you play loud music throughout the night, which hinders my sleep. Consequently, I fail to be productive while I study because of incomplete sleep, which is a serious concern for me as the test is approaching soon.",
        "Therefore, I request you to understand my circumstances and try to cooperate with me. I request you to organize parties only on weekends since I visit my parents on those days. Furthermore, you can continue your gatherings once my test is over which is in the next month.",
        "I look forward to hearing from you soon.",
        "Yours Sincerely,",
