        "It is believed that living in one place , or changing your home from place to another is a heated debate between opponents and proponents. On one hand, proponents' perspective are living at a specific destination can help in stronger relations between neighbours , while opponents' perspective  is moving can help in gaining more experiences.In my opinion , living in one town has a greater influence on both having a better relationship and supporting wealth.",
        "To begin with, if people stay in their home in which they were born , they will have  better relations with their neighbours. In other words , staying in a certain place can help in the development of  a better connection with the surroundings. For instance , a survey , which is done in Egypt by a group of researchers , found  that two-thirds of Egyptians prefer to stay in one place throughout their lives than change houses rapidly. In conclusion , it is believed that staying in one place has its benefits for a plethora of citizens.",
        "Additionally , it is believed that if we do not change the places , this will have a positive influence on our bank accounts. In other words , changing houses cost arms and legs , so staying there can support our financial status. For example , a study that was done in Egypt  found out that the more you change your home , the more negative impact your wealth is affected.To summarize , if we keep at our houses , this will save money.",
        "All in all , taking all the above-mentioned points into consideration , in the contemporary epoch , staying at the places where a person was born will affect both his community and  save him an amount of money."
