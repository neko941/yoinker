        "In today\u2019s world we can find vast diversity in cultural and social aspects. People choose different type of clothing styles all around the world. This makes themselves special and different than others. Some people think that the way of dressing of individuals, it is obvious to guess their culture and personality. I believe that this could be possible to judge someone\u2019s character and living custom at some extent from their cloths. In this essay, I am going to discuss some arguments which will support my claim.",
        "To begin with, majority of different customs have their own traditional dress or the way of wearing some cloths. This is because this kind of dressing represents their ancient people and the way the way they have lived. For example, the tribe call Banjara in India, they wear white top and trouser with a hat which usually illustrate their early lifestyle. So, when people see someone in this kind of dress, they can easily understand that this people are belongs to that particular cast.",
        "Secondly, it has been in practice for such a long time to dress certain kind of clothes when you are at work. The type of cloths people wear at work, it gives the indication about their job position and character. For instance, if we see someone in an apron in the hospital with some kind of medical treatment related equipment like a stethoscope, then we can guess that he/she would be a doctor. As a result, when we visit this kind of places, we can recognize their character and job profession from their dress code.",
        "In conclusion, although we cannot be sure about individuals living style and character by just having seen their clothing style, there are some common assumptions we can make to identify their culture and what kind of personality they acquire."
