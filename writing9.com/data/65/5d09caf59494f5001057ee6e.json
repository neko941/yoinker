        "We were just issued our Canadian Visas despite all the challenges people faced to acquire it, so it called for celebration and lunch in a reputable restaurant,with my husband and three children was most ideal .",
        "My children preferred to have rice and plantain while my husband and I had porridge beans. The rice was too salted that my daughter whose love for rice is out of this world had to reject the meal at the first spoon she took. The beans had lots of stones in it as I even bled on my tongue due to this. We all came with an empty stomach to fill it up with food at your restaurant.",
        "I would have asked for a refund but taking my present suggestion and implementing it , is enough for me. In order avoid losing your customers, it is important you send all your cooks to a reputable catering school to learn the rudiments of cooking and avoid leaving a bad taste and feeling of your eatery to clients.",
