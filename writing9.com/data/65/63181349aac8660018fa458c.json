        "With the advantage of technology development these days,  It is common for labourers to spend  energy to balance between their personal lives and professional lives, but most of them seem to fail to achieve work-life harmony. A high volume of tasks and the promotion of materialism are contributing factors to this tendency. However, it can be tackled by some viable solutions implemented by the government and individuals such as the enactment of laws on working hours and a shrewder financial plan. This essay intends to discuss the possible reasons and also suggests ways to overpower the situation.",
        "The struggle to maintain a work-life balance can be attributed to two reasons. The key one is growing demands in the workplace. To be more specific, employees are more likely to assume a heavy workload, leading to the fact that they have to perform tasks over time to be able to accomplish their assigned duties. For instance, it is reported that a substantial number of blue-collar workers in most Vietnamese factories have to work an average of 10 hours each day to finish their tasks.",
        "Another explanation is the desire to acquire more material possessions. It is believed that people in modern society tend to pursue materialism to keep up with their friends or show off their status. As a result, they would forgo their time for their personal interests or relationships and fully devote themselves to working to accumulate wealth. Another explanation is the desire to acquire more material possessions. It is believed that people in modern society tend to pursue materialism to keep up with their friends or show off their status. Consequently, they would forgo their time for their personal interests or relationships and fully devote themselves to working to accumulate wealth.",
        "On the other hand, this predicament can be tackled by two measures. First and foremost, the government should impose laws on labourers' working hours to reduce the frequency of working additional hours. Taking this as an example, companies requiring their employees to work more hours than legally mandated can face a monetary fine or be banned from operating. As a result, firms would put more control on their schedules, enabling workers to allocate time to other matters in their lives.\u00a0 In addition, individuals should make financial plans wisely to limit their own expenses. Since they save money by buying secondhand or cheaper suppliers, their expenditure would be reduced. Thus, the demand to work extended hours would decrease as they are not urged to earn more money and can spend more time on personal pursuits instead.",
        "In conclusion, the plight of sustaining a work-life blend is ascribed to increasing work demands and the pursuit of possessing more material properties. Nevertheless, the enforcement of laws regulating working time by authorities and reasonable spending plans made by individuals could improve this situation"
