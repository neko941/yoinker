        "In this industrialized world large sectors and organizations are growing at a very fast pace. Some people alleged that large scale production companies should prefer relocate in the remote area at the outskirt of cities. According to my perception, migration of these sectors is lucrative for both rural as well as for metropolitan citizens. In this essay, I will discuss my view point before giving a concrete conclusion.",
        "Commencing with the most significant reason supporting my viewpoint is decrease level of pollution in downtown. To be more specific, when large industries tend to move on remote area, it would eventually decrease the traffic level in the city. Because when such companies are in the middle of cities, the traffic at the working hours will be more. As greater the traffic level more will be the utilization of public or private transportation which naturally consume fossil fuels. However, burning of fossil fuel releasle many hazardous gases are  into the atmosphere which not only pollute the environment but also give birth to many diseases. It is generally seen that the central cities where corporate sectors are in the city centre the congestion, respiratory diseases are at maximum extent.",
        "Moving further in the same direction, location of the above mentioned companies is beneficial not only for city citizen, but also bring fruitful results to the people residing in rural areas. As it not only boost up the employment opportunities for the local people, but also for the entrepreneurs as they can hire the workers at low wages as compare to urban areas. Beside this, it help to increase the economy of that particular area.  For instance, when any industry opens in any remote area, at least one member from each home get the chance to earn, which eventually improve their living conditions for the whole family.",
        "In Conclusion, shifting of big corporation sectors from metropolitan into countryside areas brings numerous lucrative outcomes, both for urban people as well as for village residents in term of health and economy respectively."
