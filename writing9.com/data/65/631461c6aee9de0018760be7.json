        "It is often claimed that university students with flying colors academic results should be accepted, while the others believe that each student, at different ages and ability, must have opportunities to approach the same educational quality. From my perspective, university learning should be reserved for students with high scores.",
        "To begin with, it is obvious that when good students finish high school, they tend to continue their study, while the others often find some jobs after leaving school. This is because students having a great memory, logical thinking or management skills might be able to study as well as investigate intensively into their favorite fields. Then, these future talented citizens will be the major contributors to the development of their national economy and also scientific research works. Furthermore, by offering limited vacancies for study in university or scholarship, tutors and professors can supervise and grasp an individual's ability and skills, aslo, students have more motivation to try harder, which results in high-quality graduates. For instance, International University  - Vietnam National University HCMC, only admits the top grades in national university entrance tests, aptitude tests or excellent students from gifted schools. Besides academic subjects, students can not study their major unless they have good English skills, make sure curriculums are approached in the right way and they can deal with a huge amount of specialized knowledge, graduating with high-qualification.",
        "On the other hand, it may be unfair for those who do not do well at school. When working or going to university, it is more diverse and different from high school, doing great at school does not prove anything. Thus, educational institutions should not decline enrollment requests from some students. The reason is that today's society attaches great importance to degrees, although experience is more important. To demonstrate, if someone does not have the opportunity to go on to college, then their jobs in future may be narrow.",
        "In conclusion, allowing all students to go to university has many advantages, but I believe that it \u00eds only for good-grade students."
