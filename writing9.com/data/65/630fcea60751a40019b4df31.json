In addition, according to central bank the rate of inflation have increased nearly 5% whilst your company have raised the amount of payment up to 25% for each of its insurance categories which is not acceptable. In fact, putting pressure on customers to pay more may bring about an increase in the number of uninsured cars which in turn it affects the safety state of driving in society.",
