        "People have different attitudes about whether libraries are a waste of resources and finance so that computers should replace them. In my point of view, albeit there are some good reasons to consider that libraries should be replaced, I think we can\u2019t deny the significant role of libraries.",
        "On the one hand, there are two main arguments for people who say that libraries are a waste of both natural and financial resources and computers should replace them. Computers now are easier for users to store documents and other materials so that it is convenient to save several files in a same place which can be easily found. Therefore, users may not take much time to look for the book titles in a giant library in the past. Even now or in the future, it is still quite hard to set up a library because people have to think of numerous problems such as the sort of books or consumer tastes. It also takes a huge amount of money and natural resources to construct a library without the help of government budget or sponsorship.",
        "On the other hand, I\u2019m of the opinion that libraries still have an important role to play in the modern life. Reading newspapers and magazines has become a habit to the public, for this reason, libraries cannot be replaced despite the development of technology. For instance, the convenience and speed are both the pros and cons of online newspaper. People now can easily access to the latest information everywhere, which can also be an  inaccurate data. This leads to misunderstandings and then bad behaviors. Additionally, a lot of knowledge which people can\u2019t find in google and Wikipedia is only found in books or other paper documents because of the copyright law. Finally, a library is a perfect place with all the needed learning materials for students and pupils to concentrate in studying without being disturbed by noise.",
        "To conclude, despite the fact that computers are now faster and more convenient, libraries still have an indispensable role in our life."
