        "On the other hand, overusing phones can cause many problems. To begin with, the relationships of the family can be badly impacted. Second, individuals can be exposed to  online robberies. Finally, they may be influenced emotionally by their newly found friends. For instance, as members of the household use phones unlimited , the needs of the family can be misled, and they can lose their money during online shopping.",
