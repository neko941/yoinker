        "Politicians of all countries strive to reduce the unemployment rate in their country. Therefore solving this problem some experts of recruitment agencies believe that employers should consider the personal qualities of new employees more valuable than their preceding education and experience. I completely agree with the idea since, despite the professionalism of the unemployed, new employee will have to work in the all-matched teams, and also this practice to allow graduates lacking seniority to reach your true potential.",
        "Regardless of the received knowledge in educational institution and background from previous works, most of the potential employees will be forced to work in a group of diverse people. And it is this case that human traits will play an important role in a successful career.",
        "After receiving the long-awaited diploma, modern graduates are faced with the unexpected challenge of seeking employment. Due to the fact that they do not have the necessary practice, they can compensate for its lack of good communication skills, fast learning and their characteristics. For this reason, managers need to comprehend, that requiring tremendous experience of recent student is senseless. And the absolute value of such an employee is his personal aspects and skills, which he is able to reveal in the process of labour development.",
        "As a consequence, the human resource department's staff should assess not only a person has a diploma and formal qualifications, but and what hidden advantages is carried a job applicant with less qualifications, as well as take into account the employee's relationship with the existing team."
