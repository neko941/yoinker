        "Education has been given priority, even before the start of the civilization. There is differing opinion amongst the people when it comes to a child\u2019s development. Some trust that home schooling is the key, while others think sending them to institute is very important. In this essay I will discuss both the views and present my own opinion.",
        "Firstly, There is sufficient evidence and success stories about children who have followed their education within their home environment. In addition to, there are many remarkable advantages for  younger studying in the house, including they can study in their own time without sticking into a timetable. Also it is comfortable for them to ask their doubts and openly express their opinion without having any hesitation which they may have when addressing a faculty teacher. It's also proven that youths who spend more time with their families have developed a good bond socially and emotionally.",
        "On the other hand, there is no argument in most of the society about the importance for youngsters to attend an institution as it is believed to be the first step they are taking to build their future. The academy is the place where they will learn self-discipline which is a very important fact in everyone\u2019s life. Additionally to the institute subjects, pupils can learn and understand different cultures, become a good team player, learn to tolerate different views. Children attending school also have the opportunity to set the targets and achieve them with the guidance and advice from the experts in those fields.",
        "In brief, teaching children at home or sending them to school has its own benefits and drawbacks. I would say that every child deserves the education regardless their circumstances and social status."
