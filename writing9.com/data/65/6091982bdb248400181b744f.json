        "Nowadays, most people have access to education as it has been developed over the decades globally. Nevertheless, a significant number of people cannot read or write due to the inadequate facility of education. In this essay, I will discuss the disadvantages and actions the government should implement to increase literacy.",
        "Despite the increased access to education, most children do not want to complete their kindergarten education, and some parents do not force or no interest in that. Also, parents do not have adequate money to put their children in kindergarten. Moreover, the lack of mentors has significant effects on children\u2019s education because children in remote areas cannot have proper instruction, which will cause some terrible future; for example, they cannot read important notice, news, books, and cannot write at least name and address. Furthermore, the most significant disadvantage is some children will move to criminal activities, such as drug dealing, child trafficking, and trying to extort money from the people as they cannot earn money from education.",
        "Conversely, the government should implement some concrete rules about child education though they have some disabilities. Firstly, the government should offer free education for all the kindergarten because all the children will learn the primary education. Also, should develop the schools in all the places including remote areas, which can cover the whole children\u2019s literacy. Remarkably, the government should give more priority to disable people and need to build special schools and hostels to improve their literacy.",
        "Consequently, education is an essential tool for all people because, without good literacy, it is exceedingly difficult to find a white color job and expose it to society. Therefore, the government should give more concern about children\u2019s literacy."
