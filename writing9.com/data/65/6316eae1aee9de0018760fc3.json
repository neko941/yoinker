        "I remember some teachers from elementary to college. This is because people only remember others who gave an impression to them. Some teachers looked very kind and understanding in my eyes. They had a special relationship with all of the students. That\u2019s the reason I still remember them right now.",
        "In my opinion, a teacher\u2019s primary goal is not only to teach their students about the things of the subject being taught but also how to show respect for one another. They teach us how to get a better life and be a good human when we into society. In order to do that, the teachers have to be able to relate well with students.",
        "When I was in senior high school, I had an English teacher I will never forget. For me, she is not only a teacher but also a tutor for a whole aspect is my life. Upon a time in class, I didn\u2019t focus on what she is taught. I was busy with myself. I drew random pictures in my book and she was like just smiled at me and said, \u201cis okay if you prefer to draw your imagination in your book than hear my teaching but you have to respect others that talked to you.\u201d She was not angry and I just froze for a second. She respected my interest but I had to pay attention when she talked. Since that time, I love English because my teacher is her. As an adult, I realize that what she said is called basic ethics needed in society or work life. If we want to be respected by other people, we have to do so. It\u2019s a little thing but also an excellent knowledge in life.",
        "Knowledge of the subject being taught is primary, but at the same time, secondary. Teachers have to use different ways to approach their own students. For these reasons, I confidently claim that the teacher\u2019s ability to relate well with their students is more important than excellent knowledge about the subject being taught."
