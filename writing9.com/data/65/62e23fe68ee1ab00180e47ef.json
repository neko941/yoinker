        "It is true that globalization and the development of international corporation companies are changing the world in a positive way, in my opinion, however, I don\u2019t believe that everyone can benefit from this trend.",
        "Obviously, there are no arguments that multinational companies and global trades benefit our lives in many ways. First of all, multinational companies contribute to the economy of both developing countries and developed countries, because they can reduce the cost of production in developed nations and create more employment opportunities in developing areas. Furthermore, global trades bring produces with lower prices and higher quality to each corner of the world. Lastly, communicating among different countries creates multicultural societies, in which people are more open-minded and tolerant.",
        "Although there are so many advantages of globalization mentioned above, I don\u2019t think this development can benefit everyone in the world. there are several reasons I can present below.  Firstly, apart from technology and skills, western countries also cause environmental problems in poor countries, for instance, factories, which pollute water and air, are not allowed opened in developed countries and then built in developing areas . In addition, the prevalence of products of internationally famous bodies easily stops the development of local companies and brands. Last but not least, local cultures and languages are dying out due to the invasion of exotic cultures and the use of English, which is an absolutely negative trend for the civilization of human beings in a long run.",
        "In conclusion, I recognize that the trend of globalization generally influences the whole world in a positive way. however, from my perspective, it is quite hard to say that it benefits each person or each body in the world."
