        "There is no doubt,  that people who work hard and spend all free time at work had succeeded in the workspace. However, it is not always a great idea to be fully involved in work and people should find a balance between work and life. This essay will discuss the extent of importance to have work-life balance in the following paragraphs.",
        "To begin with, people have to spend as much time out of work, as it is possible. Because one day they will get retired or fired and all efforts that have been made to do a great a job and the growth of the company would be gone. Take, for example,  people who have a family or a hobby they can enjoy it. As a result, those people won't feel useless and lonely compared with hard workers.",
        "Moreover,  there is a popular phrase \"Do not work hard, work smart\" that means that success can be gained by working smart. Because the people who gave themselves completely to work, have a high risk of different diseases. Besides, people who have a rest in the weekends more productive than people who actually work in their free time.",
        "Taking everything into consideration,  keeping a balance between personal life and work is important, as a giving yourself totally to a job, will lead serious diseases, as well as a lack of a family and a hobby at the end of life. Like no matter how hard you have been working, there is always a chance to lose a job anytime.It has been noted that many people who had a big impact on the world gave themselves completely to their work and did not bother with the idea of \u201cwork-life balance\u201d. To what extent should people try to have a good work-life balance?"
