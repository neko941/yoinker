        "Nowadays, many types of jobs in our society, there are full-time, part-time, and temporary. Some people want to have more leisure time to do what they want to do, so they prefer to have temporary jobs. In my opinion, this type of job is perfect for people who are good at managing their time. The essay would share my views on why people want to be contingent workers.",
        "Firstly, contingent workers have more free time to manage what they want to do or learn; Besides, they can use the time to improve or to push themselves to be better, like study, exercise, or learn something new. For instance, I only work 5 hours per week, so I can spend a lot of time on study English which is useful for my career.",
        "Secondly, in my view, temporary jobs are suitable for people who love to work with freshness, because they can change works all the time if they want. For example, my sister is always a 3-minute passion person, so she quitted her full-time job and had a temporary job last year. She looks really happy now because she can choose any works that she wants to do next time by herself.",
        "In my opinion, this kind of job is not suitable for everyone, as I mentioned earlier, temporary jobs are perfect for people who are good at managing their time. In addition, those people made this decision, that was because they do not want to be tied down by work, and they understood what kind of life they want to have."
