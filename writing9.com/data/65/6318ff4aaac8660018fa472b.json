        "In recent times, local companies have expanded to various countries of the world as a result of the various benefit that results from this action. As a result of this development, there have been several debates as to whether or not people learn various ways of life as a result of being employed in multinational enterprises. Although, I partially agree that working at a multinational corporation teaches a person about various cultures.",
        "To begin, one characteristic of a multinational company is employing people with distinctive backgrounds. With our doubts, these different people employed have a different way of life such as dressing, food and even greetings. For instance, Nestle, which is a transnational company has staff from various nations working in the branch office in Lagos, Nigeria.  As a result, co-workers can learn and understand various lifestyles of colleagues.",
        "In the same vein, employers working in multinational companies tend to be transferred to various company branches all over the world. Without a doubt,  this move often results in staff learning and grasping the culture of places they have been to. For instance, a Nigerian woman transferred to Jamaica is prone to learn the various dishes in Jamaica and how to cook them.",
        "Although working in a worldwide company is a great way to grasp various lifestyles, there are other methods of learning various cultures that exist such as tourism, reading and even social media. The World Tourism Organisation has recently stated that people who are regular tourists are prone to understand various cultures exponentially.",
        "Conclusively, a significant number of people are of the opinion that, a great way to grasp various cultures is by being employed in a transnational company. Nevertheless, I partially agree as while a multi-national company provides employees with the opportunity  to learn various ways of life, there are various other exceptional ways of grasping various lifestyles like tourism."
