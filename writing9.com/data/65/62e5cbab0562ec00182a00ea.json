        "Many young people look up to athletes as role models. There is just something attractive about the thought of being in good physical condition and being talented in sports. Others, however, question whether they are good models for children. In this essay, I will examine both sides of the argument and present my point of view.",
        "In many cases, young, talented and charismatic athletes are natural role models for children. First, if the athlete is enthusiastic about being a role model and devotes time and energy to community activities, his or her activities are beneficial to children. Examples are making appearances at neighbourhood events, serving on local boards, or working with charity organisations. Second, if the athlete displays a healthy balance between striving for excellence and having fun in the process, he or she will encourage the virtues of working hard to achieve goals and the importance of enjoying the journey to such goals. From this, children can learn about the process of achieving goals and managing to overcome difficulties they may have in the future.",
        "However, professional athletes are not always good role models. An athlete has no moral obligation to be a role model for young people, and the role of athletes is simply to perform on the court or field of play. It is true that athletes may have money and fame and therefore take up a significant amount of children\u2019s screen time, but that does not mean we should necessarily put faith in them as role models outside of the stadium.",
        "In conclusion, many athletes can be seen as good role models in some aspects, but it cannot be said that they are perfect role models. Putting too much faith in them may do more harm than good and parents should try to provide the best models for their children."
