        "About 8 million people die every year, due to environmental pollution. Everything needs air, water and soil to survive. Pollution has dangerous side effects on all living organisms and this is the legacy that humans have left for the next generations.",
        "One of the main concerns of many populations, especially urban dwellers, is air pollution. Although factories and automobiles make life easier and more comfortable, they release greenhouse gases by burning oil that causes air pollution. Trees are the lungs of the earth, by cutting down trees we are destroying these most important earth s organs. Insecticides are other things we use every day that emit carbon dioxide and have serious side effects on the ozone layer.",
        "Water means life. Chemicals and pesticides that are used for agricultural purposes cause water pollution and these also cause soil erosion over time. Unfortunately, in some countries, domestic, industrial and hospital wastewater disposal is not done properly, which causes irreparable damage to the environment. In our country, we are facing with fine dust phenomenon, which is caused by the drying up of wetlands. Another thing that should be mentioned is chemical weapons used in wars. Every year forest fires occur in different parts of the world, which cause destructive effects on the ecosystem and put humans s life in danger.",
        "In this way, governments have a special role. The most important step is to increase people s knowledge and culture. They must pass laws to decrease greenhouse gases by using air filters in factories and developing public transportation. We should use bicycles instead of cars whenever possible. Arboriculture is another important thing that helps to protect air, soil and water.",
        "All members of society are responsible for their environment. The role of governments and people in protecting the environment complements each other."
