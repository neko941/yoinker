        "Paparazzis are notoriously known for their habit of invading the privacy of the celebrities. While some people think that the price of fame needs to be paid, others believe they must be left alone during their private expeditions. In my opinion, not every time is a good time to click a picture, so the actors/actresses should be given some personal space. This essay will discuss both views in depth and suggest why it is not a good idea to follow the celebs everywhere.",
        "To begin with, famous people are humans just like ordinary people and have the right to privacy. The showbiz journalists destroy this private space when they pursue the stars everywhere for the single best shot for their page 3 article. For instance, sometimes the media people click and post an article which is embarrassing at times to sell the paper or increase traffic on websites online.",
        "On the other hand, others believe that a lack of privacy is the cost of being famous. Artists and sportspersons enjoy a luxurious lifestyle and they are the idols of many individuals. People want to know each and everything about them hence, it becomes necessary to capture every moment of their life for the sake of others. For example, there are articles in the newspaper about the fitness regime of many sportsmen and their diet. So, many people who want to be just like their favorite star can emulate their regime and diet.",
        "In conclusion, while there are people who think it is ok to haunt the celebrities for their pictures, as it is a price they pay for being famous, there are also people who believe otherwise. This essay discussed the two sides and suggests that although it is important to provide insights on celebs\u2019 personal lives, they should do so without harassing them."
