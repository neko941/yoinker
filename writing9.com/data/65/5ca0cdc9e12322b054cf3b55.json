        "Some people believe that giving much stricter sentences on traffic offences is the only way to improve road safety. In my opinion, I disagree with this statement as I think there are other effective measures that can also tackle this problem.",
        "On the one hand, imposing stricter punishments on traffic law-breakers could be seen as an effective way of road safety. This is because it may deter drivers from violating traffic laws regulations. In fact, some people, especially adults exceed the speed limit, leading to a lot of serious traffic accidents. Therefore, giving many stringent punishments should be enacted. Also, those who drive while intoxicated or using mobile phone deserve to be banned from the road. In recent years, Viet Nam has many heart-breaking traffic accidents due to the lack of awareness of drivers who use too much alcohol. If there are fewer drivers breaking traffic laws, the roads may become safer for all road users.",
        "On the other hand, there are other alternative measures which would also be effective. Authorities could, for example, install more surveillance and speed cameras to make potential law-breakers aware of the need to abide by speed limits. This measure is crucial in many cities as a way to keep people committing illegal actions. Another sustainable measure is upgrading the transportation infrastructures mainly because the low-quality state of roads and streets are the factor culprits of the occurrence of numerous traffic accidents. For instance, in Viet Nam, there are many people falling off when their motorbikes go over a big pot-hole.",
        "In conclusion, in order to enhance road safety, it is not enough to be tough on traffic crimes by punishing harshly those violating the law. Personally, to achieve the best results, the combination of the aforementioned ideas is the most effective strategy."

Prolged life is,  the e hand, a welcome change for many individuals, yet I believe this is completely not a good idea for old people to ctinue to work due to several reass related to their deteriorated work performance and capability to adapt to new technologies. Breakthroughs in medicine and heightened awareness of nutriti are the two key factors leading to lgevity. For example, nanotechnology, with tiny robots being injected into patients\u2019 body and mending all their damaged organs, are believed to the e of the secrets to obliterate any currently incurable diseases such as cancer. Additially, people nowadays are better aware of the importance of a good diet, and such wise csumpti can ensure good health and csequently extended age. However, extending people\u2019s working age can be a catastrophe to both senior citizens and companies. The majority of people at the age of 65 or over, especially in developing countries, are unable to maintain the same degree of performance as their younger counterparts. This would eventually give rise to many unwanted repercussis that affect the company\u2019s overall profits and the persal life of the aged workers as well. Also, the fast-paced life requires quick adapti and adjustments to new technology, and this is something that the elderly may never be  par with the younger es. It is not an overstatement to say that it is a torture to work in a place where you are both physically and technologically inferior to your younger co-workers. In cclusi, my firm cvicti is that old people should not be involved in work any lger than their designated retirement age now. If the need for workforce is urgent, old people can, to a certain extent, work as csultants or mentors rather than the main labor force. 30 minutes \u2013 323 words \u2013 computer-delivered",
