        "The growth of the fast food industry has, without doubt, impacted  the eating habits and the health of many societies around the world. Diabetes, high cholesterol, and heart and respiratory problems are all on the rise due to fatty and sugar-rich meals. However, the question is whether a higher tax would improve this situation or not.",
        "From an economic point of view, the higher tax might seem sensible. In countries such as the USA, Australia and Britain, the healthcare system spends a large part of its budget on people with diet-related health problems. It could be argued that these people have caused their own illnesses because of their choice of cooking. In this case, why should they expect the state to pay for their treatment? The tax could help fund the healthcare system.",
        "However, we also need to consider which socio-economic group consumes fast food as the main part of their diet. Statistics indicate that lower-income groups eat more of this food than wealthier people. One possible reason for this is that fast food is far cheaper than fresh produce. This is because many governments offer large subsidies to farmers who provide products for the fast food industry, such as corn, wheat and beef. Fruit and vegetables, on the other hand, are not subsidised. Research suggests that many families simply cannot afford to buy a healthy drink or pay higher taxes on a fast meal. For them, fast food is not a choice but a necessity.",
        "In conclusion, imposing a higher tax on fast food does not seem to be the answer. If the government chose to do this, it would only lead to greater poverty and families facing further hardship."
