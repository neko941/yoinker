        "Working long hours will lead to some detrimental impacts on people. In fact, these days most people have a hectic lifestyle and tough schedule. They usually do not have enough spare time to do their favourite activities. After a while, they may be hurt mentally. For instance, some employees do a lot of overtime to cover their bills, and some of them are under  heavy work pressure. In this case, many of them become exhausted and even depressed. Thus, their productivity may be reduced, and it is more likely to make some  mistakes in their work.",

Some of them do not go on vacation in order to work on their tasks and projects. In addition, some others tend to work overtime to earn more money, especially ones who have  low-paid jobs. Job promotion and making more money are some adults' goals, and these achievements make them satisfied in their life. Because of this, they do not attention to the negative consequences of working a lot.",
        "To sum up, working a lot without having leisure activities has some advantages and disadvantages. In my view, health is the most important thing in life, and anything is not worth putting  health in danger."
