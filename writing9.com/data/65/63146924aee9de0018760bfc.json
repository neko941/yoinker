        "There are those who have the belief teachers at school should not give home assignments to pupils, while other think that homework is an essential way to improve young people education. In the following paragraphs, both views of this topic will be discussed in detail before my opinion is reached.",
        "On the one side of the argument, there are a variety of reasons why school should not give home study tasks to student. The main reason to consider is that if student have no homework to do, they will have more leisure time to do other activities. For example, doing some hobbies, drawing pictures, or playing computer games which of these can reduce the tension from class. Moreover, a further aspect of this argument is that some activities especially playing sports can increase happiness, social skill, team works skills and good relationship with their friends.",
        "On the other hand, some opponents may argue that doing homework is a crucial way to improve their education skills. One of the obvious reasons is that doing homework after class can help students to review lessons and enhance their knowledges. In addition, the high scores are taken by doing a lot of practices. For instance, if students need to excellent at math skills, they should practice solving math equations regularly. Furthermore, homework also can increase good relationships between students and their family because parents or siblings can guide them to resolve difficult assignments.",
        "Having considered both sides of the argument, it seems to me that both views of the argument have their merits. However, on balance I personally believe that young people should allocate time to do homework and do other activities equally. Doing so can improve education skills and decrease stress in the present and in the future life."
