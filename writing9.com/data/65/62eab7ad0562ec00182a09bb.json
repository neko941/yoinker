        "In this contemporary epoch, whilst opponents hold the belief that immigrants should not lose their cultural identity while living among other nations, proponents have a diverse perspective. I believe that they should integrate with their foreign peers to be aware of other cultures.",
        "To embark on, living with other nations demands flexibilty and open minded attitude. In other words, some advocates are convinced that living abroad is a good chance to expand their horizons and to boost their ability to understand others who have different mindsets .This might be exemplified by many Arab immgrants who have left their motherlands ,and lived in other developed countries like Germany . Thus, what can be said is that gaining more experiences through integrating with different individuals who have differnt thoughts not only will influence us positively , but it will also keep us updated with different traditions around the world.",
        "Moreover, some students ,who have abandoned their homelands to study in affluent countries such as United Kingdom, should be taught about their target countries' heritage and languages. To illustrate, that will raise their academic performance and facilitate their social and educational lives. Additionally, they will attain thriving jobs with lucrative salaries in the future. For instance, many rich countries have offered scholarships to those who are capable of learning and dealing with others . Hence, cultural diversity is crucial to bridge the gap between different countries.",
        "In conclusion after this essay has manifested the points mentioned above, it can be reiterated that it is paramount to have multi-cultural societies in this modernized world ,and this can be achieved by keeping updated with other nations' heritage."
