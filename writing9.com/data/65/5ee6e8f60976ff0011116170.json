        "When you travel to another nation you met with all different types of person who belongs to others communities. Their social life, culture and language are different. We can learn these things from them. Apart from this we also can learn some development planning from their history that how they have developed their provinces. We can apply all this in our personal as professional life both. Every individual who is alike from you, we can add some good values from them in our life.",
