        "Research has proven that lawbreaker receives a small degree of education. Many hold the opinion that the most suitable way to lower criminal offences is by teaching those in jail the skills they need to acquire employment after their release. I agree with this notion to a certain extent.",
        "Firstly, many people are sent to prison due to crimes such as theft and joining gangs that participate in illegal activities. This is because they did not graduate from school, let alone college, to obtain the tools that they need to make money in an honest way. For instance, 2019 Statistics obtained from prison research revealed that 80% of criminal offences are committed by uneducated individuals who have no other options to put food on their tables except by committing these acts.

Undoubtedly, the application of teaching schemes in",
        "prisons will not uplift the burden of their crimes once their jail time is up.",
        "In conclusion, despite the many wrongdoer's that would refrain from criminal acts, once they are released from captivity, if they were to be taught important working skills, some already posses these skills and continue to cause havoc."
