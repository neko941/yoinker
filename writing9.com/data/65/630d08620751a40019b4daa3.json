        "These days, it is a usual trend in the young community to migrate to urban areas for further study or occupation purposes. This kind of migration of young people into the cities has some benefits and some kind of drawbacks. In this ,essay I will discuss related advantages and disadvantages and show my view that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages.",
        "To begin with, the advantage of this exodus is  the better opportunities to study in well-reputed schools and colleges for teenagers. In the metro ,cities the level of education is high and many young students want to take advantage of this by studying in these universities. For instance, in London, there are many highly ranked engineering institutes located which provide an extreme level of study environment and produce highly qualified engineers. Moreover, for those who want to work in big cities, it offers highly paid jobs as well as an opportunity to learn from the new daily challenges of their work. For example, a nurse can earn $4000-5000 per month in rural areas whereas, he/she is offered about $8000-9000 salary per month in a city.",
        "On the other hand, the main disadvantage of this kind of migration is leaving old age people behind in rural area. This causes stress on the elderly people and the job can be executed by young force, elderly people are not able to manage with it.To illustrate this, if there is not enough young force in villages, old people might not be able to carry out all the physical hard work. The second disadvantage is leaving many schools and colleges without students which creates financial stress on the authorities to run and maintain them. For instance, many villages around London run schools with almost half of the capacity. As a ,result this causes a financial burden on the local municipality.",
        "In conclusion, although there are some disadvantages of reduced young force and financial difficulty for the local authorities of the urban area, there are many advantages that outweigh the disadvantages like providing exciting opportunities to study and work in the cities."
