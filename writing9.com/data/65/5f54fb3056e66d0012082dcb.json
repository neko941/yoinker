        "I am writing this letter to you in order to reconsider your decision about closing the city's playground.",
        "To begin with, the magic planet playground brings many benefits to the children in our city. Not only does it allow them the chance to play sports such as basketball, but it also provides them a valuable opportunity in order to be close to nature.",
        "In fact, children these days, in almost everywhere, have adopted a sedentary life style. Most of them find video games much more appealing than outdoor activities. Accordingly, only a few numbers of them tend to visit the park.",
        "There are some measures, however, that could be considered in order to render the park more attractive to youngsters. If the local council built a swimming pool in any available area of the place, this would definitely tempt many offspring to visit the park. In addition, establishing a food court that provides at least popcorn and ice cream would be a huge attraction.",
        "Thank you for taking the time to read my letter and I again hope you would retreat your decision.",
        "Yours faithfully,",
