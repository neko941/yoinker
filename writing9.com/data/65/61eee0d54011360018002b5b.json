        "There is a group of people think that losing specific species of trees and animals is the main environmental issue, whereas others believe that there are more urgent environmental problems which should be solved. Personally, I'm more concerned about other problems because losing living organism is a result from those problems. However, this essay will discuss both of beliefs.",
        "To begin with, extinction of plants and animals is one of the highest priority issue. Losing a plant might mean disappearing of many wildlife's habitats. Consequently, some animals will die out. This will break food chains which will destroy an ecosystem. For example, disappearing of underwater seaweeds makes many fishes lose their home. The number of small fishes decrease considerably because they can not hide from predators. But this circumstance is the effect from other severe environmental problems. If people can fix those problems the extinction problem will slightly occurs.",
        "On the other hand, there are many other problems that should be fixed before solving an extinction problem. These problems play an important role of environmental issue and it is the main cause of disappearing living organism. Moreover, this type of problems will destroy the humankind. For instance, global warming is the issue that people have encountered. In the next 20 years, if the temperature is still raised at the current rate. The human can not live anymore.",
        "To summarise, while many people concerned about extinction of plants and wildlifes, other problems need attention. Problems such as global warming are the cause of many environmental problems includes extinction. In my opinion, global warming should be given the first priority. If we can solve this problem, we can continue to fix other problems."
