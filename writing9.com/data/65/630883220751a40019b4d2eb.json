        "The first and foremost reason is that it impacts on their study, which comes in between accomplishing their goals , due to the spend flooded times on devices , for instance , a survey indicated that last year 20% of adults had become addicted to games, consequently , which will affect their career in the future.",
        "Moreover , if they will play the whole day on the PC , they will get infected to the eye , due to itself and that is the reason they have to wear spectacles , for example , nowadays , numerous people wear glasses , due to the advanced technology , as a result , if people take it lightly , it will affect more body parts. Furthermore , most of them are not eligible for a job so it affects the family budget, consequently , they have to work as  labour.",
        "On the other hand  , some students are not too good at  education but they have amazing game skills that they try their luck in the e-sports , such as , currently, thousands of children play games on computers and earn bucks rather than our thoughts , which gives them internal satisfaction.
