That\u2019s  very  important to me. You must know a lot about this college. I did really to have your honest opinion of the college. You know I have been attracted to journalism since I was a kid. Being a reporter is the eyes and ears of the reader is my dream job. I think I will earn well and get a chance to make a name for myself.",

If I have to find a room, I need your help to find a place. I don\u2019t mind sharing but the place should be airy and clean and, of course, within walking distance of the  college. I am looking for ventilated room. I am also comfortable with shared quarter.",
