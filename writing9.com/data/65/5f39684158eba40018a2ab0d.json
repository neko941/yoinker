        "Many feel that finishing the college learning is the most important aspect in securing a job while others believe that gaining skills  with real time experience is vital. Despite of, gaining a graduate  degree will be advantageous for a prospering professional career.",
        "On the one hand, getting on to a  job after the post secondary school definitely give a person a taste of experience at a very young age, but a career with no  graduation can limit the chances of  appraising to a higher position when compared to a person who have a university degree. For instance a survey conducted reveals that experienced employees with a college certificate grew up positions rapidly when compared to the employees with no formal degree. Even though experience can be a useful tool, but a higher  study can fetch a far better job with no tertiary education.",
        "On the other hand, a graduate student who specialises in a particular subject will be aiming for a better job opportunity with renowned companies and a better pay. for example, Many technology giants such as Microsoft and Google  prefer to employ fresher with a  graduation  degree directly from the university  with no considerations with those lacking a formal technical study. Further more, a  better grade at college might earn a person to work in a different country if that individual is hired by a MNC.",
        "To conclude with, it is highly recommended to have university education before starting a professional career as one with higher study and skill will always have an  upper hand for a successful profession wherein it can be acquired even after completing the education."
