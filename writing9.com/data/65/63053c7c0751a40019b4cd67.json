        "To begin with, there are many factors responsible for having a problem in sleeping and the most important one is depression and anxiety disorders. With the progress of human societies and increasing urbanization, families have become smaller. It causes reduce family ties. So, when people face problems, they have less help from their family and friends and they have to burden more problems by themselves than past. It causes depression and anxiety disorders. Moreover, having  hard work for a long time.  This problem makes people more tired. It is a serious threat which leads to the schedule messing up the body's biological clocks.",
        "Appropriate measures need to be taken to deal with this issue. Primarily, reducing stressful chores. They should not participate in work that they do not specialize in. For example, in Iran, many people invested in the stock market without knowing it and lost their money. This solution causes people to become more relaxed.  As a result, they can have better sleep at night. In addition, going to sleep at the same time. In reality, the Body needs 8 hours of sleep a day. sleeping regularly creates a habit. This habit prepares the body for easier sleep.",
