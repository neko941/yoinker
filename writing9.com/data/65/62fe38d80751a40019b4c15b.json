        "Many people think that the main reasons for learning a new language is for the purpose of travel or work abroad. While others claim that there are other reasons behind learning other languages. I believe that there are several reasons to learn languages rather than working or travelling abroad.",
        "On the one hand, in order to work in a country which is speaking a different tongue, the people have to learn their language. For instance, for the people form English countries to work in France they have to learn French language, otherwise they will not be able to work and understand the french people. Moreover, if Arabs want to travel to the USA, they have to learn basics of the English language, as they will not be able to communicate and speak with the Americans there and they might get lost while travelling.",
        "On the other hand, I consider that people learn other languages for variuos reasons. Firstly, when they want to learn about others civilzations and history, they have to learn their langauge. For example, if someone want to learn the chinese history, they have to learn the chinese language first. Secondly, when learning about other countries literature, arts, and cultures, they have to learn this specific country's language. Like people who are eager to know more about the English literature and poetry they must learn the english language to be able to understand it.",
        "In conclusion, I hold the notion that people learn different languages for several purposes like studying history, or knowing more about literature and arts. And, not only for travelling and working abroad"
