        "Nowadays, the quantity of rubbish produced worldwide is a commonly discussed topic.  Some people assert that the enemy of the environment is the plastic products. In the past people used to reuse the glass bottles, today's day everything comes in plastics. In my opinion, the worst problem of rubbish is the recyclable process and population's consciousness about this kind of product.",
        "The first point to contemplate is regarding the fact that people like the convenience. The industry works to become the life easy, creating products that people do not need to give back the packing to reuse it. This happens with bottles and others products that you need to use to carry on something. For example, the most common is supermarket's bag. Also there is another big problem with my vision, the most usable packings are soft plastics that, until no long time ago, had no recycling process for them.",
        "On the other hand, the government has now been taking too much effort about it. Honestly, I have not seen any investment in this area. The latest attitude was the prohibition of plastic bags in the supermarkets. However, there are many others countries that still selling products and packing with plastics. Furthermore, the government has to invest in studies of technology to collect and reuse this materials, also give incentives to the companies adopting the ecological packing.",
        "Finally, considering the point discussed previously, it is clear to state that people have no idea how big is this problem. The plastic is our enemy and we need to reduce the consumption of it. The government have to narrow the laws about the using plastics and material non recyclable as packing."
