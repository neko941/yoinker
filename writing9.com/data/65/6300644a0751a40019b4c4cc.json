        "Time plays a very crucial role in everybody's life. Time is a very precious thing to everyone. Many pupils are working longer and longer hours and spending less time with their families. In this essay, I will discuss both scenarios and then I will give my opinion on this matter along with some relevant examples.",
        "On the one side, some communities work for longer hours due to their working profession. For pupils who work in particular ,fields it is compulsory to work more than their working hours. For example, a person who works in the forensic department has to work more hours during the investigation process. They have to travel to the crime scene and collect the evidence. They should be available to the department at any time during the investigation process. And another good example,is  a person who is working as a software employee and also has an interest in the acting field. So this person tries to spend more hours balancing work life and passionate life. In this ,way people can fulfil their goals and work.",
        "On the other side, some communities work for more hours in the field in which they are not interested. These people will not have self-satisfaction in their work and also cannot spend their time with their families. This will lead to some health problems like stress, headache, etc. Spending time with their children is also a very important thing to a parent. For example, A person who is working in a software company spends more time on his/her work due to less experience and he/she cannot spend time with their family due hectic schedule and feeling stress in their life.",
        "To sum up, In my ,view the advantages and disadvantages of working longer hours depend on an individual and how he handles the situation. Working for longer hours has both advantages and disadvantages."
