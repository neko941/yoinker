        "Volunteering offers vital help to people in need and the community, but the benefits are much greater for the volunteer. There are some people of the opinion that scholars are to be forced to work for free in their spare time.  I do not fully agree with this statement. This essay will discuss the advantages of being a young volunteer, but will argue why it should not be compulsory.",
        "Without a doubt, volunteering could be an extension of the student's academic and life journey as it provides the individual with life skills. Being part of a non-profitable group serving the community will teach the scholars many lessons, including how to work with people from a different background and the value of hard work. Furthermore, will it develops empathy towards those less fortunate. For example, I once help to feed the homeless during winter, and this has led me to become humble and to appreciate small things in life. However, to help the needy must be a choice, the person himself needs to take.",
        "Most young people are already under enough pressure with their studies and do not need any additional responsibility to work in their free time. School is just as demanding as a full-time job, where teachers expect their students to do homework, prepare for exams and attend classes every day. For instance, a school day is 7 hours with 2 hours for homework or preparation for exams and on top of this after school activities. When young people have spare time, they should spend it with their friends. Nobody should be forced to volunteer, and this is surely the best system.",
        "In conclusion, teenagers may choose to work for free and help others, but in my opinion, this should not be forced on to students."
