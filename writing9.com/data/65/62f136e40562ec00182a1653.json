        "It is a common belief that universities should accept high-quality students so that they will fully develop their academic achievement. People think that these students will eventually result in being highly successful in their careers, and universities get a reputation for their accomplishments. However, I believe that universities should open their arms to those who might not be good at their academic performance. Even if they cannot fully show their academic abilities, all people have the right to get proper educational courses if they want.",
        "To begin with, universities might have a preference for those who are able to do well in their academic performance. Those students have willing to desire success in their academic careers so that they can get social progress in their academic expertise. For example, students with high marks easily perform their academic performance, therefore they can get good opportunities from businesses with good prospects. They have the abilities to carry out their jobs extraordinary in their position, and eventually, this makes their universities get a decent reputation by the students who did their achievements.",
        "However, I believe that people who are old enough or too young can also perform their academic performance, even though they cannot make great success in their major. Education should not choose people by their abilities. I think education must help people who have willing to learn more things if they want. For instance, there are some universities in Korea that provide education courses for elderly people who do not have a chance to learn at an early age. However, their academic desire eventually results in their academic success in the end beyond people\u2019s expectations. This is the reason why universities should provide an educational system regardless of the ages because the person\u2019s willingness decides their academic success.",
        "To sum up, the opinion that universities should offer places for people with high marks is acceptable but I strongly believe that we should also provide opportunities for those people regardless of their ages, because they will also be able to carry out their academic achievements."
