        "Smokers who usually smoke in the public not only they are endangering themselves in fact, they are causing risks to the people beside them. This has been a norm for the people who smoke in public. I completely agree with this essay as people who smoke in public areas should be fined.",
        "First of all, I believe that the best way to curb these issues by giving an order that all the people who smoke in public areas should be fined. By doing this we are able to constraint the numbers of smokers in public for the upcoming future years. For instance, since the Government of Malaysia activate the rule for banning smoking in public areas around 2 years ago, the amount of health issues related to smoking has reduced drastically compared to before. Thus, by doing this people are able to walk in public without any worries of getting infected with diseases related to smoking.",
        "Another point to consider is to have the government raise the tariff on imported cigarettes on a yearly basis. By implementing this idea the numbers of smokers will get lesser and lesser as the times go by because people will find it hard even to afford a pack of cigarettes. For instance, in a recent survey conduct by the Times magazine, it shows that in Europe due to the increase in the prices of cigarettes the number of cartons sold a day has been decreased by about 2.5% a month. Thus, by incorporating a high tariff on cigarettes prices this will undoubtedly reduce the number of smokers worldwide.",
        "To summarize, I believe that implementing a high tariff on cigarette prices and banning people to smoke in public places is the most easiest and effective method to reduce the harm of non-smoker people."
