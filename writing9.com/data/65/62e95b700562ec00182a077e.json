        "Currently, there is a common phenomenon that people are willing to deal with their physical problems by using other medicines and treatments rather than meeting doctors. Whether this trend is beneficial becomes a heated debate. For my part, although there are arguments proving this action is harmful, I tend to believe this can be beneficial for us.",
        "On the one hand, I think people should cope with these issues by themselves if they can. With the prevalence of the Internet, individuals can search the coping mechanisms if they feel uncomfortable or know about the specific symptoms they are suffering. In this sense, they can solve health problems without the help of doctors. On top of that, patients can save a lot of money since the payment to visit doctors is expensive when compared to the fee they treat themselves. Moreover, this trend can ease the medical burden for the whole society and provide more opportunities to those really in need.",
        "On the other hand, there are supporters supporting that this tendency will be deleterious for both patients and doctors. However, these views are unfounded. They argue that patients have a probability to take the wrong medicines and this will lead to serious consequences. Nevertheless, people can avoid this by reading the specifications and expiration date carefully. On the doctors' aspect, they deem the cut down of patients will result in low salaries. However, they fail to note that there is no relation between the number of patients and the amount of payment since the government use tax to pay for their salary.",
        "To conclude, despite there being people opposing this trend, the problems that patients and doctors may face can be mitigated by effective methods. I believe this phenomenon will be a positive development for society at large."
