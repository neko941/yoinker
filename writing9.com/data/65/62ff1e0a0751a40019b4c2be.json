        "The medical system plays a vital role in this modern technology. Nowadays, there is a rapid growth in population meanwhile there is also a great increase in health problems. But people are choosing alternative methods to solve health problems rather than visiting their usual doctor. In this essay, I will discuss both scenarios and then I will give my opinion on this matter.",
        "On the one side, In this modern era, there is a huge development in medical technology. Advanced medical equipment is being used in  hospitals. With this advanced technology, treatment fees also  increased. A normal middle-class person cannot afford  this treatment due to its expensive treatment. So most people are trying alternative methods for treatment rather than visiting a doctor.",
        "For example, During the Carona Virus attack, at the beginning of this attack people went to the hospital for  treatment but later they started using alternative methods like using fever tablets, drinking hot water, eating protein food, etc to reduce the virus. This is due to  financial problems and treatment is also very expensive.",
        "On the other side, Alternative methods may not give accurate results. People should use alternative methods based on their health conditions. If their health condition is serious it is better to go to the hospital and visit the doctor. For instance, If a person is suffering from cancer, then he/she cannot use alternative methods and risk their life. And another good example is, If a person is suffering from asthma and have a carona virus then he/she should visit a doctor otherwise breathing problem leads to death.",
        "To sum up, I think it is better to go to the hospital and visit a doctor when the health condition is serious. Alternate treatment can be done for small health issues like cold, headache, etc."
