        "People are increasingly suffering from sicknesses as a result of stress. This essay will discuss the leading causes of stress-related diseases, including longer working hours and increased job pressures. This essay will also suggest solutions to these problems, including improving one's work-like balance and diet.",
        "People are working longer hours than ever before. In addition, they have more job pressures. People place themselves under these unfavorable conditions because the workforce is a competitive domain. For instance, some people aspire to climb the corporate ladder to gain high status and a high paying job. This often results in mental and physical suffering because they have to work overtime and take on additional roles, which can be stressful.",
        "Maintaining an accurate work-life balance and improving one's diet are both critical to mitigating stress-related illnesses. People need to realize that if they live only for work, they will suffer either mentally or physically, and a poor diet will further exacerbate these issues. For example, many employees burn out from working too much and neglecting family, friends, exercise, and hobbies, as well as the foods they eat. Therefore, in order to reduce work-related stress, one must include a better ratio of work, rest, recreation, and dietary sustenance.",
        "In conclusion, in today's fast-paced world, more and more people are becoming ill as a result of stress. This essay discussed how anxiety is often caused by long working hours and intense workplace pressure. This essay also suggested that the solutions to this problem are twofold: to manage a better work-life balance and to eat a healthier diet."
