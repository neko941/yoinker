        "It is true that large organizations and famous corporations are usually operated by senior leaders. From my perspectives, I believe that young individuals have great potentials to become effective and outstanding leaders.",
        "First of all, one of the primary reasons why young people should be leaders is that they have up-to-date knowledge and understanding of the modern world. In more detail, young people are provided with the latest knowledge and information of the world and its trends. As a result, they are aware of the society\u2019s demands and they can quickly introduce plans or products to satisfy their customers. To illustrate, a young entrepreneur in China has been producing the famous custom face masks for consumers as it is considered to be unique and amusing. Clearly, with the modern minds of young people, many companies can offer products that are highly requested.",
        "Second of all, young people are usually creative and open-minded and they are not as conservative as some old leaders, which proves to be important during the globalization era. Young leaders are more likely to find modern and effective methods to run organizations that employees can benefit from as well as propose new strategies to boost the sales of the company. Furthermore, they can study from research papers or take advice from their mentors so as to improve their leadership style and acquire knowledge to become better leaders. For instance, there are many CEOs of large-scale companies such as Steve Jobs or Mark Zuckerberg having succeeded from a very young age due to their brilliant innovations.",
        "In conclusion, although seasoned directors are more popular among corporations these days, I still believe that junior directorship is a more desirable solution."
