        "The crimes have been gradually increased over the past two decades as punishments are not implemented for exact criminals. However, capital punishment should not be banned, and as well as a person who intentionally commits a certain felony must be executed. This essay will explain about few opinions related to execution crimes.",
        "The crimes are enormously occurring globally, and each country maintains its laws and punishments. Nowadays, most regions avoids making capital punishment because that is incompatible with human dignity. Historically, executions were public events attended by the large crowd, and the dead bodies were exposed until they rotted. Furthermore, capital executions are banned in many communities, for example, England, the USA, and all other middle east countries, since the wrong person may have life imprisonment or death penalty due the false evidence.",
        "Conversely, criminal executions may vary, or it depends on the jurisdiction. But in my opinion, a person should execute against serious crimes, for example, murder, mass murder, aggravated cases of rape, child rape, sexual abuse, terrorism, war crimes. In contrast, execution should take place with the correct evidence and under the investigation of the jurisdiction. Also, some people commit crimes unintentionally, such as abortion, and when the doctors are in serious surgery. Those cases are not considered a serious crime, and there will not be any execution. Also, some society is legalized these minor crimes.",
        "To sum up, if the country needs to reduce its crime rate, capital punishment must be implemented once again. Secondly, criminals who commit severe crimes must be executed with the correct evidence under the investigation of the jurisdiction."
