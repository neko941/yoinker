        "I am traveling with my wife and two little children. We are going to arrive on Friday evening and leave on Monday morning. Because the kids are too small to eat in the restaurant, we need a room with kitchen amenities. Also, I have noticed on the hotel website, that there are a few rooms with a stunning view on the sea, and I am specifically interested in booking one of them. Next, taking into account that the whole family will be very tired after several hours of driving on Friday, I would really appreciate if our room is not above the loud bar. It is very important, because the last time we stayed at your hotel my wife could not fall asleep due to the noise.",
