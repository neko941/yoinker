        "Every human goes through good and bad circumstances in their lives. The society has two opinions about the material drawbacks in activity. First opinion is that accepting of an unsatisfied factory job and less about money. Second view about improving and trying to solve such context. In my point of view, it is not a good decision to  accept  such setup, and I support the second though. In this statement I will discuss the both views.",
        "On the one hand, sometimes people get tired about the minds to work, challenges and survival, because of this they accept the fact that they do not have enough money to live the full activity. For instance, maybe disappointed with growth, people, or tired of trying all the time and not getting the desired result. But sometimes some people could lose the opportunity to work, becoming disabled and then.  Even if activity plays with people and if sometimes luck is not on the person's side, the people should not give up and go through the hard times and challenges.",
        "On the other  hand,many argued that the best way to tackle a bad circumstance is to try to understand the underlying cause and find a possible solution to improve the situation. Instead of being contained with their unsatisfactory job, they should look for something which they enjoy doing. Sometimes it requires extra effort and fix a goal to achieve the same, but it provides greater rewards. For instance, if someone wants to go into managerial roles, they can attend evening MBA courses and will be able to get into.",
        "In conclusion, people can sustain by yielding to a disappointing condition, I opine that instead of accepting the fate people should make extra effort to improve the situation in their favour and every individual's  destiny is in their own hands, they can build their future, if they will try."
