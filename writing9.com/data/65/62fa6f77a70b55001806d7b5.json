        "People have different views that which environmental issues are of fundamental importance. While some of them argue that decreasing the number of some specific plants and animals can be considered as the main problem, others believe that other environmental crises are more important. Personally, I do agree with the latest idea and in this essay, I will describe some opinions of both views.",
        "To begin with, a number of people think that the loss of particular species is a severe environmental problem. From their perspective, there are just a limited number of animals and plants in the wildlife that such trend can put them at the risk of extinction. Hence, this would ruin the balance of the ecosystem. In addition to this, the loss of some plants can lead to the destruction of the vegetation in a region. Vegetation plays a prominent role in facing different natural phenomena. For example, in the case of devastating floods, vegetation acts as a deterrent that could significantly diminish the speed of surface runoff and following this it would reduce the rate of soil erosion.",
        "In spite of this, there are those, including myself, who subscribe to the view that other environmental crises are much more serious. Firstly, one of the today's most important problems in the environment  is global warming. In fact, this brings about many serious damages such as glacier disappearance, rising the level of seawater and long droughts. Therefore, it can deplete the water supply which is catastrophic. In addition, nowadays the gas and fume emissions of factories and vehicles have caused air pollution. In fact, air pollution is so destructive that may result in many issues such as acid rain and health issues like respiratory diseases.",
        "In conclusion, while both the loss of some species of animals and plants and other environmental problems are detrimental under certain circumstances, I strongly hold the view that other crises more essential such as global warming and air pollution because they seem to cause more destructive problems to the environment."
