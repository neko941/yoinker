        "I would like to bring this problem to your immediate attention. I have been living in a shared room for two months. My roommate recently returned from his holiday and has been acting strangely. He refuses to cooperate with me and doesn\u2019t clean the room.",
        "I am in the final year of my bachelor\u2019s program and I have to study a lot. My roommate likes to watch the television all the time and he keeps the volume high. This disturbs me and hence I cannot prepare well for my examination. I have time and again asked him to reduce the volume, but he doesn\u2019t listen to me.",
        "My roommate also doesn\u2019t like to clean the room. I have prepared a cleaning routine, but he does not stick to it. He always leaves his rubbish on the table that he shares with me. In addition, sometimes he forgets to put the leftover food in the garbage bin. Because of these reasons, the room smells bad. On some days, especially at midnights, he uses his mobile phone and speaks loudly with his friends. This disturbs my sleep and makes it impossible for me to concentrate on my studies the next day.",
        "I really want to move out of this room as soon as possible. I believe that it will benefit both parties. I am looking for a single room with kitchen and bathroom facilities. It would be really helpful if you could arrange one near my campus.",
        "I am looking forward to hearing from you soon.",
        "Thank you for your time and support.",
        "Yours sincerely",
