        "Some people argue that there should be a ban on risky sports, while others feel that people should have the freedom to decide for themselves. Even though these sports provide opportunities for personal growth, I believe they should not be allowed because they can be deadly.",
        "On the one hand, dangerous sports can help people grow. This is because these sports involve many challenges and unknown risks, and as a consequence offer participants opportunities to develop physically and to overcome fears. The result is that they may strengthen both their bodies and their minds. A person should not be deprived of their right to improve themselves through high-risk sports. However, I think pursuing personal growth without considering other people\u2019s feelings is very selfish and irresponsible behavior. A person can cause great grief to their families and friends If they lose their lives while engaged in dangerous sports.",
        "On the other hand, it can be argued that taking part in high-risk sports can be fatal. The reason is that no matter how carefully a person plans their sporting activities, there are always some factors they cannot control. For example, a huge rock may suddenly roll down and kill a cliff climber. An avalanche may suddenly happen and kill a big-mountain skier. Since human life is so precious, I think risky sports should be banned to avoid unnecessary deaths.",
        "In conclusion, even though engaging in dangerous sports is beneficial to personal development, I still think it should be prohibited because it can be deadly."
