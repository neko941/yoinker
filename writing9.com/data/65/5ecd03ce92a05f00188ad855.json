        "It is argued that, some individuals believe in selecting high paying jobs, while others believe in selecting job with well-being workplace. Whilst a discussion of both these views is worthwhile, I am a supporter of the latter notion, because in my opinion, welfare working environment is a more crucial factor while taking opportunity.",
        "According to some, job with a high remuneration is a symbol of success and achievement.",
        "In other words, jobs with high income, people not only become financially stable at an early stage, but also gains power to buy anything which gives happiness. With the help of money individuals able to achieve or maintain their luxury status, which is important to in this fancy world. For instance, students which belong to a wealthy family and who are graduating from reputed university demands for high salaried jobs. Hence, I believe that it is vital to choose a high salaried job nowadays, which is an indication of advancement in life.",
        "However, some people opine that, job satisfaction is more vital than high salary which comes from only good working surrounding. To elaborate, some folks do not prefer to work in stressful environment to become wealthy in a short time. Instead, they believe on their knowledge and skill, with the help of which they can achieve success and career growth easily. To exemplify, scientists perform research in labs by considering well-being facilities provided by the organization which is necessary to success in research. Thus, I do not agree with this strategy of considering high pay at initial, during job selection",
        "To conclude, while people may vary in their opinion, I firmly believe that it is pivotal to choose a good working atmosphere instead of choosing a high paid job."
