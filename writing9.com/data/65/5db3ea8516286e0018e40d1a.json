        "In recent years, knowing  the  multiple language is inevitable. There are many people believe that by using transilation applications, this can be effectively resolved; however, there remain some disagreements. In my opinion , I strongly argue that these applications  would be better than learning  a foreign language due to several reasons.",
        "On the one hand, those who point  out that artificially designed translators  have many problems, when it applies  in real life situations. One  of  the many reasons is that, it may not be able to recognise regional variations, dialects and slags, eventually, communication can be interrupted. Similarly, this  technique is not fully developed to interpret all the language   in the world. Using this, requires  the internet and technical expertise to handle this effectively, but, unfortunately, this can not be possible in the most  part of the world, due to lack of technical advancement.",
        "Despite the above mentioned argument, I still support translating technology. The first and foremost  point here is that these devices are more accurate and faster than humans. In  other words, these  enable  error free, speedy communications possible by this.  Additionally, this saves time, otherwise, people require to spend  a great amount of time to learn a new language. Therefore, many people, especially, tourists  prefer this technology throughout their journey to  a new region where native people speak  a foreign language. Many other sectors: international trading, communications, research institutions are also benefited from these,  as they can communicate  flexibly than it used to be.",
        "By way of conclusion, even though people have different concepts  regarding translation apps, I again reaffirm that, in my viewpoint, this  the best method to interact with other people who speak a different language."
