        "Such are negative consequences of our works on the environment, that many experts agree that significant global warming is devastating. As a result, we need some constructive approaches to solve or alleviate the problem. In this essay we will discuss the reasons why climate change is occurring and we will come up some solutions to address it.",
        "The major issues are the high amount of greenhouse gasses in the earth layers and deforestation. Due to burning fossil fuel CO2 release. CO2 emission plays a key role in ozone layer depletion, which is the logical reason for global warming. There are myriad power plants around the world which are using fossil fuel. This release thousands of tons of CO2 into the atmosphere every year. In addition, transportation is placed in the second source of producing co2.  On the other hand, we are dealing with deforestation, which is causing a large amount of carbon dioxide to remain in the atmosphere.",

        "",
        "As far as co2 emission is concerned, there are some solutions for coping with this problem. Firstly, Authorities should encourage companies and factories to use renewable energies instead of fossil fuels. Secondly in terms of individual solutions, we can change our lifestyles like reducing disposal production as well as using electricity in an optimal way. Plus, installing green energy producing equipment and planting some trees in our house could be some great approaches.",
