        "People receives knowledge by using many techniques. Peoples tend to acquire information in the easiest way. Because of this, we seen in many schools or universities that roat learning - memorisation of data by continuous repetition - is become more popular. I think that the usefulness of this process is less effective than its negative effective.",
        "To begin with, rote learning is very crucial for lasy and bad student. Some students are too lasy to learnt their lessons and also some students are difficulty to understand their lesson as a result their creates a possibility among those students to distract from education which makes their life harder. Those students can easily grasping their object by using word repetitions which may help them to concentrate more on study. In mathematic, for example, where lots of formula needed to solve any questions. Lasy and bad students can easily find difficulties to mastering them, but using frequent word repeating can easily learn them. For this reason, some education system gives effort to the process of memorisation.",
        "On the other hand, the negative effect of this approach is far bigger than positivity because memorisation topic can be forgotten easily. Many students tend to not practice after memorising an object resulting in they can easily forget it after passing few days which can affect badly on their education career. This has lead to demotivated students from study which may make their result bad. For instance, if one student forgets a topic before his exam, he/she will become frustrated provided that it will impact on his/her exam. Hence, continuous word repetition can badly influence a student\u2019s career.",
        "In conclusion, there are lots of ways to mastering knowledge, rote learning is one of them and it is the easiest one thats why it becomes more common in some education sector. It has both positive and negative aspects, but in my opinion, the negativity is bigger than the positivity. Because, according to me, it can destroy one person life and there is no good things which will cover it."
