        "Nowadays, technology has altered the manner many people keep in touch with one another. Thanks to developing technology, from now on, distance does not matter in communication among people. For this reason, this essay will focus positive effects of technology on interaction.",
        "Firstly, in many ways, societies do not want to lose touch with someone who is relatives, family members or workmates. Since this is a result stemming from being a person and as well as this is a necessity in order to keep on healthy relation to them. For these reasons, prior to technology, people who miss friends needed to either meet them or write a letter which is full of emotions. However, today, everyone can reach someone else by touching just one button without any effort, thus there is no matter regarding distance.",
        "Secondly, in today's work environment, everyone may have a job ,not only in a company  located in their home country but also they may apply to whole firms in the entire world as a remote worker. Before then, someone looking for  a job had to move their homes to developed cities in terms of industries but now, they can do their work and also make a meeting with workmates by using some applications or pc programs, such as Zoom or Whatsapp, because of technological developments. According to my experience  being a remote worker is that I can earn much more money by working for a foreign company and I have not even moved.",
        "In conclusion, technology has provided  contact with acquaintances easier than past and has given opportunities  to reach everywhere  worldwide."
