        "These days, some cities without enough land to build house provide housing by taller building for people who work in the city. Other cities which have a wider area of the land build house. This essay will give both advantage and my opinion.",
        "The greatest advantage of housing by taller buildings can provide a great many people who live or work in the big cities. Many companies located in the central of the city. Therefore, People who worked in the company want to live near their company. However, the city without enough housing area can not build many houses and provide it for people. If the cities make the housing area by taller buildings, they provide a great many houses for people who want to live in the city easily.",
        "On the other hand, other cities which have a wider area of land tend to build the house and provide private areas such as garden and parking. Most cities with wider land locate in the rural region and have not many companies like the cities. For the reason, the cities in the countryside have a great deal of huge land to build the building. Moreover, they can provide larger housing areas than home areas by taller building for a great many people. Therefore, they need not provide housing areas by taller building.",
        "In conclusion, sometimes, we need a great many houses in the large city. For the reason, I think that the big cities without enough land have to make housing by taller buildings. However, a city located in the countryside does not need to create housing areas by building."
