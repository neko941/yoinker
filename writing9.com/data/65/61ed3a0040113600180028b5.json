        "The scheduled meeting was from 9am until 3pm with a break of about 1 hour in between and consisted of a panel of 10 members. Important details about the financial status were discussed in the beginning and around 2pm there was supposed to have a private voting.",
        "However, during the break hour, it was so disappointing that lunch was not arranged and we had to continue the meeting on an empty stomach. This was very annoying as we were not able to concentrate on the rest of the meeting. Consequently, the voting session was cancelled.",
        "It would have been appreciated, if the starting and ending time of a meeting could be considered while your organisation make a booking. If the meeting includes lunch time, organising a lunch or even a brunch would be a good practice to improve the quality of your services.",
        "I hope you would acknowledge this letter with high importance!",
        "Yours faithfully,",
