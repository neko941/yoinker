        "People's opinions differ whether the additional classes should be given to children in their free time or instead they must utilise this in sports activities. In this essay, I will discuss both views and provide my opinion while concluding",
        "First of all, additional classes can be beneficial for students fir their scholastic success. The advocates of this notion widely argue that these additional hours can be helpful for young learners to revise their homework as well as correct their mistakes,which will enable them to score higher marks in their exams. Since getting admission into a good university or college requires entrance exams, therefore, students can also study and prepare for these exams such as \"AIEE\" and so on in this time. The effective way, how this period is utilised, however, depends upon the children. In short, studying extra hours has its own benefits.",
        "Conversely, playing sports is beneficial for children's physical and mental health. To elaborate, while playing sports they not only get to keep themselves physically fit,but also  rejuvenate their minds, which in turn helps them to be more productive at their studies. Besides this, some of them have innate skills such as being good in track events and much more that can be rewarding in the future for them because many prestigious universities and colleges have a reserve quota for sportsman to enrol. Other than that, they can also choose sports as their profession. Overall, sport has its own merits for children.",
        "To conclude, although it is a contentious debate whether the children need to put their extra hours towards studies or sports, I, however, believe that the answer to this should be decided by the children themselves depending upon their interests and needs."
