        "Dear Sir or Madam,",
        "I am writing to apply for the part-time voluntary work in the Oxford Museum. I have seen your advertisement looking for a voluntary tour guide on the university notice board.",
        "I major in history at the Oxford College. I plan to do a voluntary work in this summer vacation. I attended a course on the local history this semester, therefore, I am quite familiar with the collections in the Oxford Museum. Furthermore, I am also an excellent team player, and I have experience in unpaid community service. I can speak English, Spanish and Chinese, thus I can help people from different cultural backgrounds. With my knowledge in history, various experience and multilingual skills, I am pretty sure that I would be a qualified candidate for this volutary work.",
        "I would be grateful that if you could invite for an interview. I am available both on weekdays and weekends during the summer vacation for this work. I hope to receive your reply soon.",
