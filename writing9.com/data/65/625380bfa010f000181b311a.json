        "There are those believe that in order to achieve a prolific company, the owner and staff must finish the academic mathematic subject. Therefore, it will less hassle and not difficult to  handle the business by the worker. I am strongly agree to this view.",
        "To begin with, many individual insist that mathematic is on of the upmost key in building a productive company, thus owner  should require a bsaic math. For instance, a businessman is accountable to the company and he must know how to trace their finances and learn how to calculate the profit of the marketing department and compare to the loss of the business. Moreover, by knowing to compute, the owner may get some idea to segregate wisely for the staff's salary.",
        "In addition, learning mathematic is important in our dailing living and not only in the business. Because in every day of our life people always use a number, like buying some breakfast, we count our money, and paying our bills math is always there. For example, learning how to budget your household expenses may help you to a better lifestyle provided that you already jot down your budget for the month and you can only spend money to those alloted in your list. Also, you may avoid buying unnecessary things as you can only spend the amount you have. So in my knowledge I do believe that this subject is really matter to us.",
        "I conclude that this subject has the important role in our life not only in the business but in general. However, success business is made up of a dedicated and knowledgeable owner."
