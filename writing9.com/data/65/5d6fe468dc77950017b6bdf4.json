        "I am writing this letter to convey my regards for the meal that I enjoyed with my family recently at your restaurant to celebrate my promotion at work.",
        "I and my family had visited your restaurant last Saturday (dated: Aug 31 2019). We were just browsing through the internet for some good Indian Cuisines available near to my place and I found this new place. At first, I was not really willing to visit anything new as I always wanted to go for the one that had already been. But upon reading the reviews from other customers and my wife insisting the same we took a chance. And I have to say, it was really a worth and you guys made our day!",
        "My 1 year in the workplace paid off. All the hard work put in really helped me and I got my most anticipated promotion. I was waiting for this day from last 3 weeks and I was looking forward to celebrate my happiness with my family and children. Your restaurant served the best and it was an icing on the cake.",
        "Firstly, I appreciate the all the food that was served to us, especially the authentic style Biriyani which my wife loved the most. The customer service was top notch which needs a special appreciation. The ambience was just fantastic with the best Indian classical music being played in the background. This is one of the best restaurants I had food in the recent times.",
        "I would definitely pay a visit again soon and would also recommend my friends the same.",
        "Thank you,",
