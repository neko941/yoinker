        "Nowadays, fitness is certainly one of the most important issues to the public. There are some debatings to making more sports facilities. In this essay, I am going to examine these two ideas and add my opinion.",
        "First of all, it is natural that if the number of sports facilities is increased, then there would be more people who can use them. This could lead to the result that many people will be healthier thanks to the accumulated time of exercising. Also, if there are more public who exercise in those places, then they might motivate other people to work with them.",
        "On the other hand, there are some sceptical points of view about the simple number of health facilities. The first factor is due to its expense. If well-being facilities are built based on tax, then we could use the opportunities that  could have been used in  better ways such as helping orphans or unemployed elder people. In contrast, it they are built based on private money, then obviously it would be run by the entry fee, which means there are some limits to those who have less money, which means it will make no change to them in the end. Another factor that we should consider is  the fact itself. Even there will make more health facilities, some people will still smoke, drink or do a drug which is even more harmful than just the lack of exercise. Considering this, it would be more reasonable than we should spend the money and opportunities from making more health facilities to use them for other things.",
        "In conclusion, because there are no certain results expected when it comes to the result of making more well-being facilities, I believe we should do other actions in achieving public health goals."
