        "Although many people are born with different abilities such as music or sports or take these abilities\r From the family, many people are born without these abilities. But people can learn these skills after they are born.",
        "First of all, it is a fact that there are special people in The Earth, but the idea that these people acquire\r These abilities only by birth is completely wrong. I strongly believe that every individual can learn everything they want to learn with the right motivation and hard work. I call it that being a professional.",
        "On the other hand, we should understand that there are a lot of people WHO can be professional\r After they are born. For example, Ronaldo. He is shown one of the best football players in the world like his rival Messi. The biggest difference between Ronaldo and Messi is that Messi has an innate ability but Ronaldo has reached this level by working hard and practicing the right techniques from a young age.",
        "Moreover, many people gain talent with education. For instance, me. There is not anyone WHO CAN\r Plays an instrument in my family so I did not have this talent from birth, but I went to guitar courses to learn to play guitar for years. Currently, I am a professional guitar player.",
        "In addition, many famous and talented people make hours of daily exercise for improving theirs\r Innate skills. For example, Michael Phelps, who managed to win dozens of Olympic medals, is a famous swimmer. He had the ability to swim innately like everyone else. But he has improved her skills with working of a lot of hours.",
        "To sum up, some people are born with a chance. But many people create their chance by working\r And education. The important thing is that people know that they can achieve everything by working and wanting."
