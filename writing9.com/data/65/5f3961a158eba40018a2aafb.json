        "Planning for the future is the most common term, almost everyone thinks about it, but some people get's away from the idea and celebrate their current life. I could brief the merits and demerits of both the scenario, in which i would go with the idea of preparing a slice of money to be saved.",
        "First and foremost, why the idea comes to get prepared for the future? , human being and animals vary in their life cycle, animal's utmost target is to have meals for that day, that's it, but even some animals or insects have a habit of getting prepared for the winter, for example ants & squirrels. As a human, we should be aware of all kinds of circumstances, that could affect or even have a huge shock of our routine life, such as job lost, lose in business and even particularly after marriage and kids. It is highly advisable among the people, keep some bread for future. I have a great example, Nina left her job and kept good bank balance while working, helped her to start her higher studies outside home country, which was her long term wish, without depending on the parents.",
        "On the flip side, people lose or sacrifice their most of the wishes to have savings, to build a better life or survival, which is unpredictable. As an example, God forbids, if some met an accident and died, he could not live a life, he was wishing to have. What is the meaning of saving then?, you sacrifice your current life to have a better future, which is uncertain.",
        "It has to be balanced.",
        "As a conclusion, I would agree with the idea of saving and at the same time, it should not have a big impact on our current life. A balanced lifestyle is the better choice. Thank you."
