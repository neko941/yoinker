        "Nowadays, education and medicine are the two most important sectors that society pays attention to . Some individuals believe that  the government should pay for medical and education, while some people claim that it is the public own responsibility. This essay will look at both views and I think that both statements has their own benefits , I will explain my reasons for it.",
        "On the one hand, there are many reasons why some people believe that authorities should pay for public healthcare and education. Firstly, it will beneficial for those low-level individuals who do not afford and complete their education due to expensive tuition fees. To illustrate this, if the government will help them by providing scholarships and grants then it will fruitful for students to complete their further studies. Secondly, the government should pay for public healthcare services, this is because all people are not able to afford private treatments, so authorities should give free medicines and treatments in government hospitals and also less margin on medicines in private hospitals.",
        "On the other hand, there are some reasons why some public think that it is people's own responsibility. First  and foremost, if people will pay for their education that means they prepare better because they invest their own money in their studies. Also, individuals  can spend their amount within the limit if they invest anywhere. For example, if people will buy anything then they also care about that item because that is their own responsibility, which is not very effective in the government case.",
        "In conclusion, both statements has their own benefits. However, it does not matter who pays for us, people should be good in their position in this matter."
