        "There are several reasons why shopping become so popular as an outdoor activity. The first reason is caused by productivity development. It allows factories to produce more products at the same time, and reduce the cost of goods. Therefore, companies would like to decrease the price of products to attract customers. People are attracted by low prices and are more willing to buy. The second reason is more and more advertisements. Nowadays, we can see advertisements in every aspect of our life. We can see advertisements in the street and on television, especially since the development of the Internet makes advertising more pervasive than before. Their advisements induce folk to buy goods  and even let people who have no intention to buy change their minds. As a result, more and more people would like shopping, if they have the chance.",
        "On the other hand, shopping has greatly affected our lives and society. With shopping becoming more and more popular; it is common for people to buy something which is unnecessary. It makes people lack money to meet basic living needs. Finally, people's stander of living will be decreased.
