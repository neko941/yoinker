        "Some people are of the opinion that countries and nations with more natural resources which makes them wealthier should share what they have with nations which do not have adequate wealth, while others believe that the governments of the poor countries are obligated to take care of their citizens. In the following paragraphs both notions are going to be discussed.",
        "Obviously, wealthier countries have a higher and far better quality of life which makes them lucky. But taking care of other nations in part of the humanity and if anybody tends to save the earth and the life on it has to care about other people\u2019s lives. While there is no obligation available to force these nations to help the others, it seems to be ethically, not only right, but also reasonable to take care of other human beings, regardless of race and nation.",
        "Clearly, governments play an undeniable role in protecting their citizens. But sometimes a trashy government that does not care about people\u2019s lives can endanger many valuable lives, resulting in the idea that helping in such circumstances cannot make a difference. So, in case of having a healthy and suitable government, which is dealing with daily growing issues, helping will be beneficial.",
        "Totally, caring for other nations and protecting lives while providing free education for all, regardless of gender, race, and age, are vital elements in achieving sustainable development, so I truly believe that far wealthier countries are ethically obligated to help nations in need, not to mention it is part of humanity."
