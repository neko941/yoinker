        "In regards to pursuing education in college, various people think that those who have excellent grades should have a reserved place in the institution, while others believe that everybody should be given an opportunity as well. This essay will discuss both opinions before giving a conclusion.",
        "Generally, it is common to see in university select an individual that has a good educational background. It will give a good impression that the level of education in the institution is higher and advanced. For example, most companies in other countries, only employ those individuals that have a good educational background, for it will give a boost in their profession and become of high value in society. It will also give a boost of morale to students to be able to do well in their education. Cultivating students that have an outstanding background for years, is an advantage for the school. Funding for the enhancement of facilities and equipment will not be a problem and more organizations will recognize the university as one of the esteemed institutions.",
        "On the other hand, everyone should experience the chance to attain an education. It is downright discriminating that the reason why they are not accepted is that they don't have good grades, or they are old enough to gain knowledge. In rare cases, those individuals who don't have remarkable backgrounds get the most recognition in the outside world.",
        "In my opinion, everyone should be given the right to be accepted into universities. Attaining knowledge in college is just a tool for a person to prepare themselves for the outside world. Educational background might provide better opportunities for some, but if you compensate for it with skills and techniques, it is also possible to achieve it."
