        "Global warming and climate change have played a pivotal role in disturbing the natural environment, with catastrophic consequences to mankind. For instance, natural calamities like floods, droughts and prolonged summers have shot up considerably; resulting in loss of human lives, their livelihoods and severe dent on global economy.",
        "Globally, the consumption of natural resources like coal, oil, wood has increased disproportionately. These are the raw materials required to fuel the industries and generate revenue for the economy. However, its indiscriminate use resulted in substantial deteriorations of natural resources, increase in pollutions and sudden changes in atmospheric temperature. These are primarily reasons for global warming and climate change. Recently, global economies have finally recognized them as a major threat to humanity and started recommending alternate forms of power which are sustainable and cleaner in nature. Solar energy is one such option which can be readily used as an alternate form of household energy, but, it comes with its own pros and cons.",
        "The biggest advantages are continuous availability, positive impact on the climate, and overall economical. It derives the energy from the sun, which is readily available at zero cost plus free from any harmful gases. Currently, India widely uses it for providing household electricity in rural areas.",
        "On the other side, irregular supply, expensive installation and government policies are the biggest hurdle in its widespread consumption. To elaborate, its supply will not be regular in winter and rainy season. Similarly, there is no push from the government to make it a mainstream. Lastly, installing a device which generates it is pretty expensive.",
        "To sum up, with all the above mentioned benefits, solar power is the future of day to day household consumption. However, it need to be supported with right policies and suitable equipment which is available at affordable cost."
