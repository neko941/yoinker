        "Whether adolescents should do voluntary services in their association when they are free has caused a heated debate. Some people think these kinds of unpaid jobs are beneficial to both young people and  society. My view, I partly agree with this viewpoint.",
        "It is definitely true that juveniles should do voluntary jobs in the place where they live. This is because working as volunteers can raise their social responsibility and train their social skills through having a realization of the people and life surrounding them. As a result, when they grow up, they can participate in society better and be a good citizen with good habits.",
        "Furthermore, the voluntary task has advantages to the construction of the public, which enhances the communication of neighbours and residents. This means that the public can obtain a sense of happiness and have a stable and peaceful life by working together. For example, they can organize residents to do the cleaning in the open area weekly, which leads to a better living environment for everyone.",
        "It is also true that community tasks should not be compulsory for juveniles but can be optional for them to choose from. If this service is compulsory and unpaid, it will decline the dynamic and vigour of young people, which cannot form a good cycle.",
        "In my viewpoint, youth can get social exercise and improve themselves through social services, which also develop the life level in the neighbourhood. Meanwhile, we should offer optional work which is better than compulsory and unpaid. In this way, we can actually develop both teenagers and the community to a preferable level, which is also beneficial to constructing a healthy and vigorous society."
