        "Now a days most of the people are performing tasks with the help of machines however, they previously  used to them manually.The drawbacks of this mechanical lifestyle are eclipsed by its numerous advantages. This essay will discuss  how  the positives of machines like  time savage and efficiency overshadowed the negative of human addiction to mechanical work.",
        "To begin, the most common  of modern machinery is developing human dependence upon them. Now a days machines of all sorts has been invented to perform all household chores, due to which people prefer to get all their jobs done by machines without their effort  and hard work. This consequently affect their physically fitness they eventually start getting wait and become obese.Hence, depending so much on machines make people lazy  and prone to illnesses. For example, a study conducted in America in 2007   proved that 75 % of modern population who accomplish their tasks  through machines are predisposed to hypertension and coronary artery diseases.",
        "Taking in to account the advantages, firstly, performing chores via machines help us to save time .In this world of increasing professionalism  machines act as a blessing in disguise specially for women as they can complete their tasks quickly. Therefore, they manage to have some ample time in which they can relax and take care of their family.For instance, a research  paper launched in China  about free working hours among common people , proposed that people using different appliances to perform tasks have 30% more relaxing hours than the others.Secondly, tasks done by machines are more efficient, while manually performed tasks contain errors because humans are prone to mistakes while computerized work is more accurate due to  an installed software in it. It is exemplified by  the weight machine, measurments taken by this is far more accurate  than made by hand balance.",
        "In conclusion, the advantages like  quickness and accuracy of machines over weigh  their negative of human mechanical dependency. Thus, if someone limits the use of machins and try to do work on his own  than this will surely prevent him from different diseases."
