        "It is commonly thought that orators could coach a limited number of pupils in a classroom in the past. However, on the other hand, others tend to look at this practice differently that online classrooms are beneficial with the advent of modern technology. I agree with the former view because it would reap numerous benefits to students.",
        "The principal rationale behind lectures in study hall is they enable students to develop public speaking skills. When learners attend lectures in a closed hall showing their physical presence, they become active and enthusiastic with face-to-face interaction. As a result, it increases their confidence level; they get into debates to understand more about other people\u2019s opinion, which paves a way for them to become futuristic public speakers in society. For instance, a survey conducted by the world education council illustrated traditional sessions in halls enhances the public speaking skills by changing individuals from introverts to extroverts.",
        "Another point to consider is that students will build organisational skills through classroom education. Since it demands students to be physically present, they make an effort to reach schools or institution on time, focus on working on their homework and assignments the previous day night and deliver the project work to tutors before the due date. For example, a survey conducted by the UK government shows that ninety percent of people illustrated that the conservative method of education develops the ability for students to focus the given tasks and adhere to them.",
        "To conclude, despite the fact that modern technology has several benefits owing to online classes, I strongly agree with the traditional mode of teaching because of its manifold benefits to individuals on building public speaking and organisational skills."
