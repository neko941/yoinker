        "It is a saying that memorising facts is a meaningful way to succeed in education. I partly agree with it, and this essay will explain why.",
        "Many students are troubled by their studies, and memorising facts plays a vital role in learning. If students can not remember the fundamental knowledge, further study will be arduous. Rote memorisation is a suitable method to grasp wisdom quickly; repeat it for a long time, and students will keep understanding in mind. Also, it is a way without ability limits. A number of students are not gifted; it is difficult for them to achieve a good score. Even rote memorisation can not allow them to be at the top of the list but enable them to pass tests.",
        "On the other hand, memorising facts causes some problems for students. When students are used to rote memorisation, it will reduce their creativity. They would like to recite textbook knowledge instead of using their brain to think; namely, they will use their brain less, and their thinking skill will be rusty. Furthermore, it will be tough for them to learn depth content. Rote memorisation is an excellent way to learn basic knowledge, but it only provides basic knowledge. Deep learning needs to use students\u2018 minds to think, and rote learning will slow down the learning progress. As a result, in deep learning, students are easily dragged down by rote learning.",
        "To sum up, it is difficult to tell whether memorising facts are good or bad. What we may have to consider is how to use memorising facts correctly."
