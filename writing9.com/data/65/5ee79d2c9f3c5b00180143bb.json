        "The face of communication changed with the advent of the journal as it became very easy to communicate with people at large and spread any message. As technology advanced, mass media like  TV set and internet came offering more services. It was believed that the weekly will soon be disregarded as an outdated form of media. However, did not happen and does not seem a reality in the near future.",
        "On the one hand, we cannot deny that we turn to utilize either online news or smartphone in order to update the latest information instead of the daily. Firstly, we are living in the contemporary society so that the Internet is likely to become, the most dominant source of news over time because younger people tend to read the news online and prefer not to pay for it, so those reading newspapers, the older generations, will gradually decline. This links in with the second reason, which is that as media companies start to see a drop in income from newspapers, printing them will become unprofitable and they will be forced to find ways to make money from news online.",
        "On the other hand, \btabloid remains a vital source of news for \benormous reasons due to the fact that one can read daily at his own convenience. First of all, it offers a great deal of flexibility as it can be read anytime, anywhere and in any frequency, thus, it is \baffordable and convenient to carry. \bAdditionally, it can be piled up, so one also reap tremendous benefits from referring to some, old news if required and weekly frequently puts more emphasis on the local news. Moreover, it definitely improves our \bconcerntration skills owing to the fact that we have to read word-by-word, leading to cannot distract our attention. Last but not least, the paper contributes to not only development of advertisements for businesses, shops, educational institutes, matrimony and job vacancies, but also providing entertainment in the form of jokes, cartoons, crossword etc.",
        "In conclusion, it is obvious that no other media facility can replace community. It was a crucial form of media in the past and would continue to maintain its position for the coming many years."
