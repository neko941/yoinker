        "Sharing information with the world is nowadays very popular among people. Some people accept that it is a beneficial way to share more information with the world for research in labs, business and education purposes. Others argue that some information is not good for sharing without any cost. This essay will discuss both arguments in detail and will give an opinion.",
        "First and foremost, it is very common for most people to share knowledge with the world for scientific research, improvement in business and to increase knowledge in books without any cost. Giving a lot of new knowledge to the world will help many people. For example, I got good results in my exam because some of my friends help me with my studies. Moreover, giving information to the public, related to scientific research will bring improvement in science and technology.  Furthermore, it is the best way to be more respectful among people by making new discoveries in the academic field at no charge. To sum up, people can easily earn respect with the help of sharing information for free with the world.",
        "In contrast, there are some cons to sharing more knowledge with the world at no price. if we share valuable information with people without any cost it will lose its value. For example, in my last ,semester I give my structural assignment to my friends, and they just copy it without understanding it. Moreover, people will never take serious our knowledge until we ask for a good price for it. In short, a good price will increase the worth of anything.",
        "To conclude, this essay discussed that some people state that sharing important information for free is the best way while others argue that it is not good to share information without any cost. In my opinion,  all information has to be shared at some price to increase its worth."
