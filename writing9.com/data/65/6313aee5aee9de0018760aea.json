        "Family plays an integral part in our life. From the day we open our eyes we find our parents by our side. They teach us important lessons like right or wrong being loyal , being punctual , and being honest. There is no denying the fact that family plays the biggest role in our development. Nowadays, it's very common to see people living with their guardians after graduation or after even having a job. It's quite a controversial issue across the globe . Without any doubt ,  society is divided into two groups as per  distinct mindsets of different people. A fair amount of folk agreed with the statement whether others opine because of some reason . Whether to agree or not it's a tough-provoking question. As far as I can see it's more justified to agree with the statement that it has more advantages than disadvantages. In the upcoming ,paragraphs I will not only shed light on both sides but also elaborate on my point of view .",
        "If we have a deep look we are able to find numerous reasons why a fair amount of people think it's good to stay with parents . The first and foremost reason behind this is emotional support for youngsters . In this fast pace ,world people have become human machines. They have so many responsibilities . Sometimes it becomes very hard to handle . In such situations, family support is very important .they  motivated us and give us moral support . Another striking benefit is we don't have to do house chores all alone .when we live in a family we divided the work so none can feel pressurized. Last but not least it's very beneficial for the next generation because children can learn so many things when they can spend time with their grandparents. There's no denying the fact that old people are like  a storehouse of knowledge .they are much more experienced so we have so many things to learn from them. Additionally , in the case of an emergency family comes  first. So it's always better to have them by our side .",
        "On the paradoxical side, some people opine the statement for a few reasons . Firstly, they find it difficult to cooperate with old people due to lots of responsibilities.secondly, when young people live with their parents they find it difficult to have their privacy.",
        "For example , those who live with old parents can't enjoy their life  the way they want .as the parents get old they become moody and dependent on their children . So young people have to sacrifice their dreams to support their parents .",
        "In conclusion, although there are some demerits yet it is more justified to agree with the statement . It is more beneficial to stay with parents after graduation or after getting a job because it helps to stronger the bonding .so i suppose the advantages outweigh the disadvantages ."
