She is quite intrusive and loves to rearrangere-arrangethe house at every given opportunity which drives me crazy because I get back from work and have to look for either my running shoes, my video game pad or other personal things, she has a way of forgetting where she kept these items and we get into seriesof arguments, I will spare you further details.",
