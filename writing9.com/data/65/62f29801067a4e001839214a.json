        "In this modern era, many parts of the world people teach their children by themself, they do not send them to  school. In this essay, I would explain the benefits and the drawbacks of this problem in the upcoming paragraphs.",
        "In the past, people sent their children to  school and children learn many subjects over there but nowadays parents do not send their children to  school and they learn their children by themselves. Moreover , This is not beneficial for children's growth because their parents teach only the liking subjects they can not be taught other subjects which can be hard on them . In addition, many parents do not know about all subjects  deeply so they emphasise only basic wisdom so their children would be faced many problems in their future. Apart from this , if parents send their pupils into the school so they can learn many  extra curriculum activities as well.",
        "On the other hand side , people can teach their child many outside subjects which one not included in the school also if parents have enough education in their respective field so they can easily teach their child that skills. For example, if parents have knowledge about architecture so they teach them painting and drawing easily.",
        "In conclusion , I have a concern about children's future because if all parents teach their child by themselves so the traditional way of teaching may be disappeared and students do not envoke many subjects in their study so yes this problem has more drawbacks ."
