        "Global environmental issues pose a great threat to humankind; and many people believe that it is richer nations\u2019 duty to solve it. In my opinion, while it is true that richer nations are more economically equipped to deal with environmental issues, it does not mean that less well-off countries are exempted from their responsibilities.",
        "There is no denying that richer nations are in a more comfortable position to face environmental challenges. Indeed, decades of being ahead have put these countries\u2019 economies at a far better place where they can sustain themselves, and where GPD growth can be temporarily dismissed in favour of the environment. Unfortunately, this is a luxury poorer nations cannot afford. Looking at Germany and Cambodia. A german person can easily contribute to the cause by putting solar panels on his roof and opting for paper bags instead of plastic ones. The same cannot be asked from a mother of two in Cambodia who is still struggling to put food on the table, so there is a limitation on what people and governments in less well-off nations can do.",
        "Yet, I believe developing nations must do whatever they can in their ability to help combat environmental threats. This is because the effects of serious global problems such as climate change or pollution are far-reaching, ramified, and potentially disastrous irrespective of whether you are a rich or a poor nation. When the sea level rises, it will not have any mercy on most of the coastal cities in Vietnam that are still in development. And that is why initiatives must be taken by both individuals and the government anywhere to reduce their impact as much as possible. There is no place for nationalism in this predicament, only globalism.",
        "In conclusion, I am of the opinion that despite being economically disadvantaged compared to richer nations, poorer ones are not responsibility-free when it comes to global environmental issues. Only when we unite and help each other that humankind have a fighting chance to face this predicament."
