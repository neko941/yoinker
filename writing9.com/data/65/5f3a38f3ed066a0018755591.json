        "In recent times, an exponential growth of technology has significantly changed manifold activities for entertainment and development of the young generation. As a matter of fact, a considerable majority of children prefer playing computer games to participating in sports. From my perspective, this trend could make a severe negative impact on not only adolescents but also the future of humanity. This essay will discuss the principal reasons of this problem with clear examples.",
        "Firstly, while children' health development could be progressively improved by playing sports, computer games could probably be harmful for their physical health. For instance, playing video games and using technical devices for too long could reduce the optical aptitude, leading to myopic eyes. In addition, this situation could also make several mental impacts such as headache or lack of concentration, which could be noticed through academic transcript and children's study attitude.",
        "Secondly, the demeanour of the young generation could be negatively affected by various content of computer games. As far as I am concerned, several video games could contain violent activities which are inappropriate for children and teenagers. It has been proven that the majority of youngsters' preference is brutal content in computer games. Were the adolescents to absorb that cruel mindset, this could become a severe menace. Furthermore, the more passionate children are about video games, the less time they will spend on family gathering or bonding with friends. There could be a considerable distance between not only offspring to parents but also people to people in the future. Conversely, a substantial connection could be made by sporty exercises which are necessary and appropriate for children and adolescents.",
        "In conclusion, I strongly hold the perception that children should spend time on sports instead of playing computer games too much due to its severe consequences. There should be a suitable limitation for this entertainment given by parents or the school authorities in order to protect the young generation."
