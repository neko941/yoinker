        "From my everyday experience , and observation I can claim that discussion of an important outcome with other communities brings many benefits . In the following ,paragraphs I will give my reasons to defend this statement . First of all , the different families have different opinions . In order to make the right choice public should discuss every possible settlement and its consequences . Making an important selection alone can bring many negative aspects . For instance , a person can reveal his selfishness or impatience and the consequences of that verdict can affect many nations in the future . I think that a good and wise finding can be born only in a discussion because the population can share their knowledge and experiences a look at the problem from different sides and aspects .",
        "Second of all , I think that making the settlement alone is unacceptable ,especially for a team . Imagine that a chief makes the finding about increasing a production line without discussing it with his employees . In this ,case a part of the association's profit will be spent on the extended purchase of raw materials . So , shareholders will be left without dividends . This judgment may lead to getting rid of the team's shares and as a result  a declining  value of a club as a whole . To sum up , I think that a person should always consult his relatives or colleagues when making an important opinion to avoid possible mistakes ."
