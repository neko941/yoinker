        "In the contemporary society, it is generally believed that the best solution to the environmental problems is to make the fuel expensive. Personally, I totally disagree with this statement.",
        "For a variety of reasons, it would be ineffective for elevating fuel cost to solve environmental problems. Firstly, the high price of gas does not only lower fuel consumption, it also drags down the attractiveness of other fields of the economy. In other words, since the cost of transportation, which is bound up with tourism and agriculture, and energy are considerably depend on the price of fuel, they will become unaffordable to a large group of consumers. This will seriously damage the economy. In addition, the high price of fuel also leads to multiple social problems. Although in these years, several types of electronic vehicles have been invented, it is impossible for the poor to afford these. As a result, the excessive fuel bill will leave the impoverished people no money to pay for other issues of the family causing the rise in crime rate and wealth gap.",
        "Apart from the abovementioned practical concerns, I would argue that elevating the price of fuel definitely not the best way to solve environmental problems but to create more issues. Since the restricted consumption of fuel is not a new trend, several alternative sources of energy have been discovered. However, it is proved that these methods have its own issues. For instance, the process of hydroelectric includes the construct of damps on rivers which seriously damage the natural process of the ecosystem. Furthermore, the best way to solve the environmental problem is to raise people awareness about the environment. As one of the main sources of air pollution is the release of carbon dioxide of food transportation and private tranports, consumers' awareness plays a significant role in greenhouse gas emission. To put it simply, if people avoid consuming exotic food and private transport, our impacts on the environment will be noticeably mitigated.",
        "Taking everything into consideration, this reinforces my perspective that it is inapplicable to raise the price of fuel due to the environmental issues."
