        "Social work is always an essential factor for society. In recent days, there are arguments that young people must involve them to do social activities without salary and it will enhance both environment and the people who involve in it. I strongly accept that involvement in such activities helps them to understand the view of society and more individuals involve them to take part in the activities.",
        "To begin with, the youngster\u2019s able to understand the difficulties in society. When people take part in social development activities, they easily look into the issues and provide their solutions for the improvements. For example, my friends and I were a part of the NGO academy and we were involved in cleaning activities during our summer vacation. In addition, people involved in such activities will gain a certificate. It will help them to highlight it in their resume and increase the opportunity on getting jobs.",
        "In addition to the above, working in social reformation jobs without grand will attract people in the same age groups. Many youngsters feel shy about involving themselves in unpaid jobs but  looking at the same categories of people at work will encourage them to participate. For instance, when I was a kid, I was not bold enough to take part in the activities until I saw my friends involved.",
        "To conclude, the involvement of people is always essential for social development and it is a personal decision to work on paid or unpaid jobs. I strongly believe ,the involvement of youngsters in activities without getting paid will help them to see the hurdles in society as well as more people involved by looking at their presence."
