        "I feel privilege to work with you on this topic as you have a expertise in this field. Therefore, I have decided some ideas for this topic. First of all, we need to gather all the vital information regarding our task. Apart from it, we should keep ourselves vacant for one hour after the office time as we need to practice a lot to give our best. In the end, we will distribute the topics according to our convenience, which will reduce the burden on a particular person shoulder.",
        "Please suggest me timings, so that we can cope up with the activities assigned to us. I would be free on weekend besides this we can practice during weekdays but I will be available only on alternative days starting from Monday. If possible let's tomorrow for further discussions.",
