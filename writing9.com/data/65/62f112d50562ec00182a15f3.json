        "Success in sports has been a fundamental goal of a massive group of people since it can make them feel superior in many ways. Strength is a critical factor that significantly impacts one's athletic career. The significance of this factor results in some people believing that succeeding in sports is impossible without it. On the other hand, however, another group of people thinks mental attitudes are more important. In this essay, we will discuss both of these views.",
        "No one can deny the significant impact of an athlete's toughness in their career. The more well-fit a sportsperson is, the more victorious they are in their field. Stronger people can easily do challenging exercises, and top-scoring in any athletic activity would be more manageable. However, a weak person would have to struggle with these challenges, making the road to success slightly more rigid for these people. For example, playing a basketball game can be complicated and overwhelming for a person of short height, making succeeding in this field nearly impossible.",
        "But the fit body and strength of a person is not the only factor in their success. For instance, even the fittest athletes may fail in an intense match if they don't have the exact mindset of the winners. Positive outlooks play a considerable role in the progress of people. An athlete that is slightly punnier can succeed in sport with the right mentality. Enthusiastic people tend to be more hard-working, which is essential to success in almost all fields.",
        "I believe that a mixture of robustness and hard-working spirits is necessary for triumph. The essence of an athlete is as essential as the athlete's body strength and fitness."
