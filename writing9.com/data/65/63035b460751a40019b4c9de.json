        "With the development of modern technology, more and more people are getting rid of food issues. However there are still some people in most developing countries who are facing the trouble of hunger, and there are several factors that lead to this problem. I believe that developed countries and local governments can take action to address this problem .",
        "People who live in developing countries ,especially some low incomes countries are isolated nowadays. These countries have no ability to develop their technology. The major reason is there are no equipment and funds to support agricultural technology development, and this can lead to a negative impact. One bad result we can see is people are using traditional methods to grow grains and crops because they want more food to survive, they may be taking some wrong actions to make soil productive.",
        "To solve such a problem, developed countries can work with developing governments to improve the situation. Firstly, developed countries can invest in third-world  countries' technology and infrastructure to create more job opportunities. Secondly, third-world countries' governments should make some investment policies to attract investors, and develop their tourism to attract foreigners from other rich countries as well. Finally, parents should emphasize  the importance of education, and third-world governments should make education compulsory for all children. This will build a society full of scientific knowledge which will further benefit technology advancement in the future.",
        "In conclusion,  investment from first-world countries and education can solve the problem of hunger. I believe that we will see a better situation in the future when more and more people will not have such issues."
