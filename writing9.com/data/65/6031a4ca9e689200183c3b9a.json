        "Never before has the public been so concerned about early-age education. Some people argue that the involvement of parents in story-reading is necessary while the rest believe that children benefit more from gathering information on their own. From my perspective, although the guidance from family to form a reading habit is indispensable, it is more beneficial to read independently.",
        "Without doubts, parents play a significant role in the early development of children. Generally speaking, story-telling empowers children to become curious. By listening to fairy tales from parents, children can learn about  nature and  history. They would also generate various questions about the society that they are living in from these tales, which helps to develop their creativity. Another point worth mentioning is that it takes time and efforts for children to be mature enough to read the storybooks or to understand the contents from the TV show, thus the supports from family at an early stage become more important.",
        "Despite the difficulty for children to acquire information from books and TVs directly at an early age, it is still indispensable to develop their learning skills. First of all, reading independently is the best opportunity to form a reading habit for children, and their reading and writing skills can be trained during their self-reading. By contrast, only listening to stories may ultimately lead to  over-reliance on parents, and it is detrimental to their future study in school. In addition, stories from parents are prone to be limited to their own knowledge, while tremendous helpful and fresh information, such as stories that can trigger children\u2019s interests in math, can be found in books, which contributes to a more balanced development for the youngsters.",
        "To put everything into consideration, supports from parents in story-telling promote creativity and curiosity for children at young age. However, not only does independent reading contributes to the writing and reading skills of children, but also it enables them to get access to a wider range of knowledge, which leads to  more balanced development."
