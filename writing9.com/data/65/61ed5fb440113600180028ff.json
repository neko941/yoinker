        "Nowadays, Increasing social media is developing day by day. As a result, People easily contact anyone in  society and need help with social media instead of direct meetings. If there have also disadvantages is that social media people sometimes be bad. without knowing them only the via of social media can help to befriend. Now I intend to analyse the topic.",
        "To begin with, using social media is helpful for the whole world. For those people easily contact the public in anywhere and any places without seeing them. The first and foremost advantage is that most of the people are now stay busy with their work so that they cannot connect the community people. As result social media is a great way. For ,instance if one person is a doctor but needs to help a lawyer for any reason. Though he is not interacting with the community people he is so much interacting with social media and knows the good lawyer. Then easily doctor contacts him via social media and share with him the problem.",
        "Moving to the next, helping the social media most instead of direct meeting. Even people who wanted to go to any other places or country but they did not know that community, Then social media easily helps them to contact with that countries people. For example, the student  wants to go higher studies and get opportunities but he does not  know the environment of this country. Then social media helps him to communicate with  people abroad. Though the benefit is there drawbacks also happen. Such as the student does not know people's  behaviour and how they are friendly in this country. At, first he needs to talk to them face to face and stay with them for some days or months directly. Then the student understands the people,Otherwise it's difficult for the student to know the behaviour of this country people by social media.",
        "To conclude, Social media has advantages and disadvantages both. But the busy world is now tough to communicate directly whether social media gives this opportunity. Here show the advantages is outweigh than disadvantages."
