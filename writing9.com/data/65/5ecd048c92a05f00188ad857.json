        "In this day and age, senior citizens need to compete with juveniles to seek employment. The prevalent issue is less opportunities to youngsters and the most viable solution is the youngsters have to enhance their soft skills.",
        "The primary dispute the fresh graduates will face is the chance of getting less employed by the recruiters.

The result of this is the increase in youth unemployment and graduates are feeling unmotivated and frustrated. To illustrate, most of the reputed companies prefer to employ experienced candidates over new graduates to save expenditure on providing training to freshers.",
