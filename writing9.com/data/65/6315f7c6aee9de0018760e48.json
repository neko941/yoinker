        "In recent years, distance learning has gained popularity in the education sector.  However, it is argued that  on-campus is comparatively than",
        "distance learning. Although  I believe that  there are more  benefits to studying In traditional ways, some advantages of distance learning cannot be ignored.",
        "To begin with the most conspicuous benefits of distance learning ,it is especially beneficial for those  who otherwise have a busy schedules.To explain, there are many individuals who are working in order to support themselves as well as their families financially. Due to this mode of education, they do not need to sacrifice their study just because of their Jobs. As a result, they become able to complete their higher education along with employment for their as per their Convenience and timetable.",
        "As far as  traditional ways of education are concerned studying in institutions seems to be better as more facilities are available for learners to improve their personality besides academic studies such as  labs , playgrounds, libraries etcetera  which all contribute in a more effective way to the learning environment and these cannot be provided in case of distance learning. The prime illustration is of a science subject in which students need to perform practicals and experiments for a better understanding of concepts. Moreover, educational centres such as schools ensure a properly disciplined ambience along with a fixed timetable so that equal focus can be laid on each and every subject for good academic  performance. Apart from this, daily interactions with tutors as well as peers aid students to clear their doubts and make them more confident. These  soft skills such as communication ability, teamwork, and cooperation also enhance",
        "In conclusion, even though distance learning benefits individuals having lack  time fall attend classes, I reiterate  it is not effective as on-campus education which not only provides academic education with a focused learning environment but also contributes to the holistic growth of students."
