        "With globalization, food from one country is exported to other countries. Some people think that this impacts the local economy since imported food is often cheap and it leads to the drain of wealth outside the country. I agree with this view.",
        "Some countries have developed food as an industry and this enables them to produce it at a very cheap price. When this food is exported to countries whose farmers are not competent, it leads to lesser consumption of local food. As a result, local farmers suffer losses and, in some cases, commit suicide. For instance, in the United States, productivity of land, availability of machines, high quality seeds and farms of large size have enabled the production of cheap wheat. When this wheat is exported to countries like India, the local farmers lose money as they do not have the same facilities. This has led to farm distress in India.",
        "Moreover, the import of foreign food leads to higher income for foreigners at the expense of local people. When a country purchases foreign food, it pays the country\u2019s money to others. This leads to the drain of weath which could have been used for numerous productive purposes in the local economy. China faced this situation in 1960s when it imported millions of tonnes of wheat and rice from western countries. This cost the local economy more than 100 million dollars and thousands of local jobs. This moneey could have been used to develop infrastructure such as irrigation canals.",
        "In conclusion, I strongly believe that the local economy suffers in terms of loss of wealth and jobs when a country imports food from others. Every country should encourage the consumption of local farm produce only."

    "submitter": "Advanced technology has changed the way people communicate. Nowadays, many of them prefer texting over talking  phes since the former enable multiple ctacts at the same time, and furthermore it aids to remember essential talks. This trend brings both advantages and disadvantages. The primary reas why people use texting to communicate than talking is it saves time. Due to a hectic work schedule, they did not get adequate time to individually ctact their family and friends through calling. Text messages,  the other hand, allow to multiple cversati at the same time. Another reas is easy to remember imperative details in the written form . Phe talks can be arduous to recall especially for elderly groups when they have to multiple work to do. For example, a reminder text message about an important meeting helps an employee to be  time. The major disadvantage of this practice is social isolati. As people more indulge in the virtual media, face to face interacti decreases. This not hampers the emotial development of an individual but also shrinks their social circle. Moreover, it affects their linguistic skills. Since mobile phes have preinstalled dictiary and auto correcti softwares, they put less affords in remembering spellings this in turn distorts writing and speaking skills.  In cclusi, although communicati via texting has some minor advantages, I believe it brings more disadvantage such as social isolati and degradati of a language.",
