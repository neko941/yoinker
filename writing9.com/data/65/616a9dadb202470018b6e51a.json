        "With the pace of 21st-century technology is lept to the level which was unimaginable a few decades ago . Due to the advancement we all starts to believe that there is life existence on other planets . Although I am also one of them who argue that there is existence on the other globe , there are many ways to prove that there are creatures out of the globe .",
        "Nevertheless, there are much evidence provided by our scientists , there is existence on another planet. For instance , as our scientists went to the moon for their research , they find a footprint of any creature they took a picture and sample of that to the earth . Moreover, even though after much research on the planets , they took more steps towards the success of their goal .",
        "There are many points to give proof that aliens life exists. First and foremost , By doing more and more researches . To illustrate ,  if the researchers do many and more researches like they check the oxygen , gravity and so on , they will able to prove that their is the existence on another planet . In addition , make the suitable devices .  For example , in spite of doing research , the equipment should be suitable and more effective , the outcome can be more strong and effective .",
        "In conclusion , even though by the proofs given by researchers we comes to know that their is life out of the earth , it they find more they will be able to give a strong point regarding to this. I totally believe that there is life on another plan"
