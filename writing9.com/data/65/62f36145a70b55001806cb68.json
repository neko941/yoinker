        "It is believed by some people that being wealthy and having less time is better than having more time and being less wealthy. From my perspective, I partly agree with this as I argue that having time and money are equally important.",
        "To begin with, there are several reasons why people might believe that being wealthy is more important. Firstly, having a lot of money might help people to have a stress-free life. This is because individuals could buy whatever they want to fulfil their everyday demands. As a result, it gives them the privilege of living a luxurious life, leading to a possible stress-free life. Lastly, individuals who are not as wealthy might have to work day and night for money, resulting in them not being able to make time for themselves.",
        "On the other hand, I believe that spending long hours at work and not enjoying life is the wrong outlook on life. Time is the most valuable resource in life. One can use the time that they have to make money, but can not use that money to buy more time. Spending time with your family and loved ones should be prioritised over anything else. This is because money can be made, while moments with loved ones can not be found again once it is lost. In other words, life would be meaningless if one only focuses on work.",
        "In conclusion, having money is important to fulfil our demands of ourselves, but without time, it is meaningless."
