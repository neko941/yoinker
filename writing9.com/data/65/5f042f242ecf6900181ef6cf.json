        "It is often believed by a few sections of society that there must be a complimentary car once in a month, therefore personal cars are forbidden in any public line. This essay will decipher various benefits and chances of negative effects on peoples lives.",
        "To begin with, the logic behind the person's suggestion of free transportation is because of the present situation we experience in our daily life, traffic congestions and pollutions are the major problem we are facing every day. It is evident that cars released carbon dioxide that will harm the environment. This can be illustrated by the current situation of our ozone layer. According to the research our ozone layer is the number one affected because of the car fumes. If the ozone layer continuously affected by carbon dioxide, there will be no protections for the ultraviolet rays that comes from the sun that will harm every living things in the earth. Additionally, it will minimize the traffic congestion  if this will be implicated by many states. For examples, if there have a free transportation once in month people will prefer that rather than to fuel their car.",
        "However, there are always two sides of a coin, one of the negative impact on the society is the time that can affect their working hours. For example,  I have to attend a meeting, but because private car is unacceptable in the road, I need to wait for the specific time that free transportation provided.",
        "In conclusion, the beneficial effects in the environment overweigh the consequence cause if this will be implemented."
