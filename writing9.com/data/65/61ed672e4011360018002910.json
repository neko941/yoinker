        "Driving should always be treated in a serious manner and the person who drives the vehicle should always have full concentration on the road itself.Nowadays young people always follow  unscientific driving methods.I strongly agree with the fact that  adolescence should learn the importance of driving from the school itself.In this ,essay I will describe my views with relevant examples.",
        "Firstly,Youngsters try to learn about driving and they pursue licenses during their teenage. Obviously,at that stage  peer groups give more importance to how they can get attention from the opposite gender ,hence they take any risk which in turn results in accidents.For ,instance if we consider the recent accident history the age group under 25 are in the top category. Secondly, these young generations do not give much seriousness to the traffic rules and laws.For example, every two-wheeler travellers should wear a helmet is a mandatory thing but the student group give the least preference to that.",
        "So for the above-mentioned factors giving a training session on traffic rules and regulations should be in the syllabus of youngsters from school time onwards.Furthermore, awareness classes from the motor vehicle department help to make the pupil understand  the current situations of careless driving as well as its consequences.Apart from this strict traffic rules monitoring will also be an added advantage to eliminate this trending issue.",
        "To Summup,youngsters can be trained from their school time onwards about safe driving and the importance of following traffic rules in day to day life.These awareness classes will keep  teenagers away from harmful drivings."
