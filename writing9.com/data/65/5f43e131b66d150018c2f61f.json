        "Some people are arguing that there must be a certain type of punishment for all kinds of crime, while others contend that circumstances should be considered before offering the final conclusion. This essay will examine both views and outline my own opinion.",
        "It is clear that criminal activities have reduced significantly over 5 decades. The fixed punishment such as a death penalty for corruption in China and sending to a prison show the positive impact of a decline of atrocity. For example, according to some publications, South Korea has been consistently ranked top regarding achievement a low-crime index due to their aggressive law system. Nevertheless, these types of punishment are super rigorous and next I will discuss another view.",
        "Taking into account the motive and circumstances of individual crime are more convenient in order to provide reasonable punishments. This brings an opportunity for young people and students change their behaviour and became low-abiding citizens. For instance, the thefts from children in shops cannot impose on them a tax higher than the cost of their stealing and even give them years in prison.",
        "From what has been discussed above, here should be drawn a conclusion and my opinion that a person's motive, the circumstances of the crime should be definitely taken into consideration more than setting a fixed punishment because the second is too grim."
