        "In recent days many schools of thought acknowledged that professional bodies should be united and encouraged to practice in different countries if the individual met with the country's criteria, even if not trained in that particular country. In my ,opinion I completely suggest that professionals in different areas should be given the opportunity to show their skills by working in other countries, it also has barriers such as communication.",
        "With regards to the developing strategies in the educational system that promotes people of  different specialities to be able to work in different countries, this is  a result of improved strategies. Professionals working in other countries help the institution to experience different skills and methods of doing things to promote positivity when carrying out different practices. For ,example a surgeon who trained at Net Barnes University in the United Kingdom, travelled to Korea to work as a surgeon in a hospital and performed a surgery that was meant to last for 1 hour in 30 minutes, then he was instructed to shear his knowledge with other surgeons in the hospital. In other ,words professionals should be encouraged and free to practice in another country.",
        "Furthermore the opinion of not allowing people who specialize in a particular profession to work in another country that they are not trained in can not be overlooked or neglected. This particular opinion may not be of great effect because they have so many barriers that may affect them when working in other countries such as communication, racism and the culture of those people they are meant to work for. For ,instance a Christian going to work with an Arabic native. Considering the religion of the nation could affect the ability of the individual to carry out his work effectively in a sure environment. In regards to the ,issue it is still  my opinion that professionals from other countries are free to practice in countries they are not trained in.",
        "To sum it up, allowing professionals to work in other countries where they are not trained freely. Is of great impact on the individual and country, it promotes the identification of different skills and methods in practice. But it can be affected by barriers such as communication, religion and others. I am still of the opinion that professionals from other countries should be allowed freely to work in other countries."
