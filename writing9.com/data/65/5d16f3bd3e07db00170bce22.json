        "These days, controlling the children is very difficult. Many people",
        "spank children as they think this is the best form of discipline. This essay will argue why smacking is completely unacceptable and not the best form of discipline.",
        "Many parents believe that spanking children is the right way to keep them in restriction because they may make mistakes which they are not aware of it. By doing this, they will be more cautious. They are justifiably worried about their children making mistakes which puts both of them in trouble. On the other hand, some people think that the traditional way of controlling children is the finest. A recent study done by the  professor at the university of California states that \"90 percent of the parents smack their children\" to  control them. There have been some recorded instances in India, where they use this orthodox approach to the children in order to avoid making mistakes. Therefore, they think beating is the only form to curb their children.",
        "On the other side, there are many down side of doing this. I understand why they do this, however, it is spreading a negative vibe across the community. One of the main effect is that, if children got an exposure to violence at an early age it will impact their mind. For instance, a person at new York was arrested and he states that \"he was experienced to violence by their parents\" that became him today.",
        "There are many ways to oversight them for example, by abusing or shouting to keep them in control. Therefore, spanking is not the best action.",
        "This essay argued why spanking children is completely unacceptable and not the best form of discipline. In my opinion, I totally disagree as that would affect them in their future."
