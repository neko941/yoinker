        "Climate change is an ongoing problem around the world. Some people emphasize that due to this problem, many companies are facing serious consequences though others think it brings positive effects on business. Car industry, which is one of the biggest industries, has negative effects, but in fact, there is a new chance for them to expand the industry. Thus, in my opinion, climate change brings more opportunities on business.",
        "At first, a negative consequence for the car industry is a restriction of the number of vhiecles. Because of the global warming, fewer cars which use fossil oils are produced. In fact, gasses of vhiecles are harmful because they cover the earth, and keep the world warm. This leads many countries to reducing the number of cars with oils. For, instance, some countries restricted to produce cars, and change these vhiecles to the other new options.",
        "However, there is a great opportunity for this industry because many companies produce the latest vhiecles instead of normal cars to solve the cimate change. They are electric cars which use only electricity for driving. Compared to the normal cars, electric cars are environmentally friendly. Few years ago, they were not common choices in terms of the price. On the other hand, nowadays, more and more people are purchasing these cars. Tesla, which is one of the biggest companies in the world, succeds in this industry. As this shows, climate change created the great chance, such as electric cars.",
        "In conclusion, while climate change has negative impacts on business, this also lets people get some opportunities. I agree with this idea because they became leading businesses around the world with electric cars  while they faced negative effects on normal cars."
