        "Nowadays, an increasing number of people are concerned about animal protection as well as animal rights. Whether we should utilize animals for food, clothes, and medicine cause vigorous arguments recently. However, in my opinion, it\u2019s impossible for human beings to cut down its dependence on animals completely.",
        "On the one hand, precluding animal exploitation might protect the diversity of wild animals and maintain the balance of the ecosystem as a whole. For example, possessing precious long tusks or valuable thick furs, foxes and rhinos are facing the dilemma of being targeted by hunters, especially animal traffickers. As a result, it can be predicted that a variety of animals will be on the vedge of extinction in the future if the government does not implement any solutions to deal with this problem.",
        "On the second hand, I would argue that it is unrealistic about human\u2019s life without using animals. The first reason is that yet, there are no substitutes that can replace food products derived from animals in order to provide humans a healthy and rich-nutrients diet. Secondly, in the medical field, conducting animals experiment before medicines are introduced to the public is necessary for the manufacturing process, or people would be using products that are potentially harmful. For instance, experiments conducted in rats and apes contribute to several successful vaccine inventions, which prevent both humans and animals from devastating diseases.",
        "In conclusion, I believe that some behaviors that harmful to animals should be prohibited, and using animals for human purposes is indispensable because of some indisputable reasons above."
