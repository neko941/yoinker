        "I hope this letter finds you in good health. My name is Angel Dy, and I've been your tenant for two years. I live in B-3 and I'm writing this letter to make a complaint in regards to the tenant that lived in B-5 who just moved a week ago. I'm complaining about the noises he makes every night and how it displeases me. During the night, he listens to music which is a rock genre and sets it to a higher volume. Not to mention that he also invites his friends and throughout the night I can hear laughing, shouting and stomping of feet like they are having a party. This activity of his is giving me a headache because I can't sleep properly with all the ruckus. It continued for days and because of that, I feel sleepy at work and sometimes doze off accidentally. I tried to talk to the person and voiced my complaints but he didn't listen. I talked with other tenants and it seems they are also bothered by this. As the owner of this building, I would be pleased if you can solve this problem. In my opinion, I think it would be great if you can set a few regulations, like curfew hours and the time to which visitors are allowed in the building. If you could also talk to the person himself and reprimand him for his actions.",
