        "In this day and age, more and more contemporary attention has been placed on the opinion that the advent of tourism is a determining factor propelling English into the most common language in the world. Therefore, a lot of perspectives suppose that this phenomenon will lead to English becoming the sole one to be communicated globally. In this essay, the pros and cons of this issue will be discussed.",
        "From my point of view, there are two major benefits from only communicating in English. The first advantage is that global citizens will not concern about the language barrier. To be more specific, difficulties and challenges that non-native speakers encounter will be no longer a huge problem, thus, the interaction by words among people from different nations will be easier and more convenient. For instance, Vietnamese residents, who want to study abroad, will deeply invest their time and effort in pursuing the job that they want to do in the future in lieu of having to devote their time to learning the main language of that country. The second one is that those who have a desire to travel or migrate to foreign nations will adopt new environment faster because they are fully aware of the customs, traditions and costumes\u2019 ingenious people.",
        "Besides cons about the possibility of speaking one language mentioned above, it is undeniable that this phenomenon also has some noticeable drawbacks. The first disadvantage is that the cultural identity of one country will be gradually faded since the mother language is the symbol of any nations\u2019 culture in the world, however, with  less use of it in daily conversations, the erosion of mother language will be an inevitable consequence, leading to a culture lacking its own identity. The second one is that it will take a lot of time and money for the translation. This is because people are accustomed to using English and as a result, they will have a tendency to read all documentaries written in this language instead of reading ones written in their mother language. Therefore, the government has to rent translators to translate the content of all documentaries written in the mother language into English. Undoubtedly, this is time-consuming and money-wasting.",
        "In conclusion, speaking solely English has its own benefits and drawbacks, so it is a need to consider this problem carefully."
