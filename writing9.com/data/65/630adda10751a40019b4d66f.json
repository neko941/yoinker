        "On the other hand, various possible actions could be taken in order to tackle the above. Firstly, physical education should be made a mandatory subject in the school curriculum encouraging students to follow a vigorous lifestyle. Secondly, the government should implement health care policies to raise the individual's awareness about the importance of eating healthy and exercising regularly. For instance, advertising in the local and congested areas, launching a nationwide campaign and establishing free clubs may tempt people to ameliorate the level of their health.",
