        "Most   people in modern society believe that overheating is one of the government's responsibilities as well as companies. Furthermore, there is no contribution needed from civilians. Some argue that it's the responsibility of both parties. In this essay, I will explore the validity of this statement and figure out my opinion regarding this. Firstly, I will show why I believe that both parties needed to be responsible for this and secondly I demonstrate how both parties can involve in making this correction.",
        "With the rapid urbanization and competitiveness of the economy, governments and companies try to develop their productions without concerning the environment. Due to this, lots of polluted air is released into the air by those factories.However, the Ozone layer is destroyed by that polluted air. On their behalf, civil people cut the trees to build their houses. Doing that  may be caused  an imbalance in the water cycle and reduce the rain. Newspapers cited that the percentage of water that can be humanly taken is less than 1%. In addition to this, they are burning some bad chemical containers like plastic bottles, and plastic bags.",
        "However, both parties are responsible for the protection of the environment. There are some sets of things that both can do to solve this problem. Government can add a set of rules for the action done by anyone, which are reasons for over warming. Companies must release the air after purifying. On their behalf, they can add their contribution by funding to protect the environment. Civil people can reduce the amount of cutting trees, make discipline to avoid burning bad chemical containers and plant new trees.",
        "In conclusion, most  companies, factories and government actions become a reason for this root cause. Somehow, civil people's behaviours also needed to be concerned. In my opinion, by  forworking those two parties ,together it is easy to reduce global warming."
