        "We always heard that practice makes a man perfect. In Europe, some people believe that their children should learn more practical subjects which will help them to get a good job in their early age. Whereas other people opine that they should study academic education. Let us discuss both points of views with some relevant examples.",
        "To begin with, many schools teach students more practical subjects. The parents think that by doing  more practice can make the kids more understandable of any subject. For instance, there are 70% of labs are present in every school in Europe associated with different subjects. However, some kids do not have the capability to remember the tough topic and when the teachers show them with different diagrams, graphs on a board they can learn the tough syllabus.",
        "On the other hand, some parents keep their children in schools who teach them more academic study. It is also worth considering that they should learn first the actual topic and then should do the practice. For example, 60% of students have to pass the theoretical subjects in schools  to go to next grade in Europe. As we know they have to understand first the actual structures, different syntax and formulas before applying them in actual.",
        "Anyhow, the schools should make a balance between the theoretical and practical syllabus.The employers always ask the students for years of experience in their interview. With only theoretical knowledge , the candidates can not get a job. Along with academic studies, they have practical knowledge as well.",
