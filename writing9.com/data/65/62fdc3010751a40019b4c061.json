        "It is often argued that mobile phones are irrelevant for the younger generation, while others believe that it is useful. This essay will discuss both opinions before giving a conclusion.",
        "On the one hand, having mobile phones can benefit an individual on various occasions. Firstly, it can help young ones with their education. It is a tool to get access to educational information like assignments, ideas for designing a school project and classroom presentations. It also allows a person to have knowledge of what is happening around the world. Secondly, mobile phones  can be of help in regard to communication. A person can use it, in case of emergency purposes and it can be used to talk with their loved ones. Lastly, digital phones can help the younger generation reduce the stress they build up in everyday schooling. Going to school is fun, you get to see old friends and meet new ones, however, it also give pressure on different occasions. Using cell phones to play games and engage in social media will alleviate some of their worries for it entertains the user, even just temporary.",
        "On the other hand, prohibiting the younger generation to have mobile phones might push them to make effort in certain things. They will persevere to look for information in an old fashion way, they won't succumb to the temptation that they have seen on social media. Furthermore, not having cell phones in their day-to-day life, will promote less distraction and they would be able to hang out with their friends outside and have recreational activities among their peers.",
        "Although it is for the best that young ones don't have mobile phones, in my opinion, they should be given one, for it will give them security and protection in emergencies. In addition, they would have access to information, whether it's for educational, personal or entertainment purposes."
