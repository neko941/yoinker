        "Nonetheless, there are a few other reasons why I should go home earlier. Primarily, I want to take a treatment for my eyes because the university\u2019s doctor recommended it last month. Furthermore, I bought some gifts for my parents\u2019 special day. Lastly, I have finished my final assignments from all subjects already.",
        "There were only 2 supplementary classes in this semester which were Economics and Finance. Both professors required me to email them written summaries of the last classes\u2019 articles, in order to mark my final grade. This is why, I can assure you that my early departure may not have detrimental impacts on my academic achievements.",
        "I hope you will understand my situation.",
