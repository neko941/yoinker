        "Dear Martin,",
        "I hope you are doing well. I am writing a letter to provide you an important information since you are planning to go first time on a camping holiday this summer.",
        "I am very much confident that you will really enjoy the camping holiday. Firstly, the location is extremely beautiful, clean and safe. Fortunately, it is very close to river which will definitely give you nice surrounding and you will enjoy nature. There are so many facilities at the site, therefore, you will not face any difficulties.",
        "However, I would like to mention some drawbacks as well. The area is having telephone network issues. Thus, you will not be able to contact someone. For that, you need to go nearby town. Furthermore, you have to be careful about insects which will harm you during night time. Nevertheless, you may use spray to avoid it.",
        "I wanted to join with you. Unfortunately, I am having practical exams for last semester of my engineering couse. As a result, I would not be able to go with you for it. No worries, we may plan again in future and enjoy it",
        "Please take care and give my regards to your family members.",
