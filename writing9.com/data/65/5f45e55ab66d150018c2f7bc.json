        "Many students are made to attend certain classes when they are 15 years of age, while others are required to learn various subjects before leaving school. Although an education system with a broad range of subjects can provide diverse knowledge, that with a narrower range is better as learners have more time for other activities desired.",
        "Those supporting the former education system may claim that students can access a wider range of knowledge that they may need in their later life. Having a chance to attend many classes, students are taught numerous lessons related to various fields, many of which can be of great help when they grow up. For instance, in Vietnam, students aiming at engineering courses in university are only required to have good grades in Maths and Physics. However, the knowledge they have acquired in non-major classes like English or Computer Science can offer them a competitive edge when they apply for a job in a multinational company, compared to those who are not familiar with foreign languages or computers.",
        "On the other hand, students who study only a few subjects have more time for other purposes than those studying so many. With fewer subjects to learn, they have extra time either for stress relievers such as playing some sport or taking a rest or for further research related to their chosen subjects. The former activity helps students relieve pressure at school and recharge their energy, whereas the latter is a good way of reviewing the lesson taught in class. Scientifically, these activities increase their study efficiency and academic performance, so such an education system is much better than that forcing students to learn various subjects.",
        "In conclusion, although the knowledge learnt in various classes is potentially helpful, I believe that a study program with not so many classes is more beneficial to students who can have more time for deeper study or relaxation."
