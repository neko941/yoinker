        "Globalization of the internet through the continents is allowing the majority to have access to lots of information including e-books. There is an idea being claimed by a number of people that paper books are about to get lost due to  e-books, while others believe that paper-based books will never vanish. In my opinion, due to the availability of different types along with time-saving of the reader, electronic books will continue to increase in need, meanwhile paper books also have their importance and they will keep being a part of the reader\u2019s life.",
        "To begin with, the development of the internet has positively affected the way people read. In other words, for the last couple, of years numerous electronic versions of new and historical books are uploaded to the internet from where a person can get his lovely book not regarding his location. For example, a recent survey conducted by Oxford University asked 100 students to find historical books (some of which do not exist in paper versions) around the Bristol libraries, surprisingly 98% of students found books  in e-version. In addition, the trend of electronic books led to saving vast time, especially in student life. That is to say, when there are examinations or assignments upcoming, students may find e-books handier rather than going to the libraries since it saves their precious time.",
        "On the other hand, handbooks had been a part of humanity and will continue their importance. With the help of paper-based, books our ancestors left essential education for hundreds of years. Moreover, a physical book is less stressful compared to e-books (the majority of ads may appear while reading) that attracting many to prefer paper-based ones.",
        "Way of conclusion, though handbooks have importance and good feelings during the reading which can not be replaced by e-books, electronic types will be in much demand in close future for their benefits mentioned above."
