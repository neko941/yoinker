        "Sports have always been a substantial part of humanity \u2013 hence, athletes are treated as eminent and respectable persons. Whereas some individuals hold a belief that success in this field is a matter of physical capacity, others claim that it is mental wellness that has the most paramount effect on sports achievements.",
        "On the one hand, the more a sportsman trains, the more likely he will achieve the desired goals. Admittedly, keeping fit and being in a prime can be attained only through regular strenuous daily exercises. It is common to see healthy, muscled and well-built individuals among athletes rather than untrained and fragile ones. Most of them dedicate a great amount of time to exercise. For instance, high-level athletes usually train 2 times a day for 2 or 3 hours.",
        "On the other hand, it is quite prevalent to see how people who were in their physical prime could not deal with a burden of mental pressure, resulting in a subsequent failure in their whole career. It is obvious that apart from training requirements, the particular level of ability to endure moral stress, constant competition and fans\u2019 attention is the commitment of every professional sportsman. The vast majority of those, who have achieved a lot in sports, becomes followed by thousands of public eyes on a regular basis. Thus, almost every action is accessed and even criticized by publicity. Courage and capacity to cope with these detrimental aspects of this work are in demand for all professional athletes.",
        "To conclude, though physical abilities are highly important in terms of reaching something in sport fields, I truly believe that the presence of moral spirit has more influence when it comes to the work preservation and dealing with adverse traits of it."
