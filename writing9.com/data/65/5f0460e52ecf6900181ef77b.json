        "Capital punishment is a matter of active controversy in several countries. Some people claim that this is the most effective way in which the major crimes would be prevented. While I accept this idea to some extent, I also believe that carrying out such a sentence has irreversible effects.",
        "On the one hand, today, we are witnessing a great deal of serious crime which is only punishable by death. In this sense, some nations resort to the death penalty in the aftermath of violent attacks to protect national security. For example, the support and sentencing of execution have been growing in India due to the anger over several recent brutal cases of rape, murder, and so on. By enforcing death to such criminals, fewer offenders would dare to commit them. Therefore, I assume the death penalty is only morally justified when applied in such heinous crimes to ensure the safety of civilians and make a righteous society.",
        "Despite the above arguments, I support the view that taking someone\u2019s life is the worst violation of human rights and encourage a culture of violence. Indeed, our laws and criminal justice system should lead us to higher principles that demonstrate complete respect for life, even though being a criminal. Recently, many nations have abolished the death penalty in law or no longer use in practice which contributed to a peaceful society. Moreover, it is frequently occur that the capital punishment cause miscarriage of justice since the complexity of investigation processes or perhaps the mistake made by police at the time of capturing an innocent individual. By doing so, the public would lose their faith in law and justice and there would be no chance to make the victim back to life which in turn could be considered as an Unforgivable crime.",
        "To conclude, it seems to me that implementing the stricter law might be the only efficient method to stop wrongdoers from committing terrible crimes ,however, the human rights should not be ignored in the first place and the action of death penalty need more precise proof."
