        "Nowadays,technology has become the most important aspect of our life.We receive a huge advantage from the internet.However,there are a lot of disadvantages  such as security and control that outweighs the benefit.Personally, I strongly agree with the statement and the reason will provide on the following paragraph.",
        "Begin with, the first reason why technology in field of security has the  disadvantages more than benefit on the internet is lack of privacy.There are many problems that we face from the internet especially on the social media.Some people do not have their comfort zone for posting code or picture.This is because a stranger can see their post due to the place and time that we go.Moreover,Online society can not control who is the murder , every people can access to find their information very easily.Then it will create many a lot of crime.For example, according to my experience, I used to be a person who is addictive the internet, I always post my location every day.Then it causes the murder to follow every step that went.After that,they came to my home and stole my notebook.Therefore I never post anything on my media because I am very curious and panic.",
        "In addition, another reason is people will gain a misinformation from the internet.There is a lot of fake news on Facebook or twitter.So we can not know what is the real knowledge.Moreover, most of the problem comes from people about sharing their comment that makes people confusing.For instance, my mom usually read a newspaper, then she compared the information with the internet.On the other hand, the result was completely different.So she seldom read from the social media.",
        "In conclusion, there are many advantages and disadvantages of the internet. We should concern in the privacy and misinformation."
