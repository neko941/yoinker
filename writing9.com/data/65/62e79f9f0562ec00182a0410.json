        "I have recently seen information on google about a very good course called \u2018HOW TO GET CLIENT\u201d. It is a five-day program starting on 15 April being offered by AL Saleh and Associate Law Firm.",
        "I believe this course will  benefit to our company as you know we have some issues in attracting clients before 4 years and I thought that program will  solve our problems especially that a lecturer is a lawyer in  a very big firm and they have  a crowd of  a client. However, there are a lot of joiner associates in this program I can talk with them and discuss about offering them to work in our company.",
        "For these reasons, I am requesting paid leave from 15 to 20 April to attend the course and I believe that you will encourage me to have this course.",
        "I look forward to hearing from you soon",
