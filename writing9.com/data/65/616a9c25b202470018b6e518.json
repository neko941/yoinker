Why do you think some parents put too much pressure on their children to perform well at school?",

        "There are two ends of the spectrum in this regard. On one hand, many children receive none or almost no form of encouragement from parents, whilst on the other hand, some parents can be very overbearing meaning that they put colossal amounts of pressure on their children. Both of these traits can have devastating effects on a child. In this essay, we shall see why parents put much pressure on their children.",
        "The job market today is highly competitive and every parent wants their child to get a good, well-paying job. However, for that to happen, the children need to achieve nothing but excellence in their academic roles. For example, in Kerala, the academic competition is so high that, 40% of children who score in the 90th percentile in their final boards still find it hard to get admission to colleges. On the other hand, you have parents who show no interest in their child's academic life and provide no encouragement. This may be because they believe that, celebrating your child's smallest achievement is not the way to help them achieve their true potential.",
        "The role of a parent should be more of a nurturer, more than anything else. Parents need to realise that no one individual can reach exceptional levels all the time, and rather they should concentrate on being there for their children rather than force them to achieve excellence all the time. If parents pressure their children to do nothing less than attain 100% grades, there will be a disconnect between the parents and children, because if the kids are unable to achieve this grade, they will become ashamed to tell this to their parents.",
        "In conclusion, parents play a key role in a child's academic development, and they should understand that they need to be nurturers more than anything else, for the sake of the youngster's psychological development."
