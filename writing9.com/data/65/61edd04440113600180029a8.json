        "Global warming and greenhouse gases are the biggest threat to the global environment and governments are  working on different strategies to control the emission of greenhouse gases and save the environment. On the other hand, some people believe that raising fuel costs for combusting engines and fossil fuel using industries will overcome the problem, I am against this idea and discuss the Pros and  cons of the price change in the following paragraphs.",
        "First, a hike in price will not only affect cars and other vehicles but  will cover all the transport system which depends on fossil fuels from cargo trucks to railway engines,which will bring the value of daily use products higher ,ultimately leading to inflation.Secondly,it will put an unnecessary burden on middle-class families, who either have to compromise with their living standards or use up their savings.Additionally,such increment can make people against governments.As recently I heard on the news that one  government of the country need to resign after a fuel price increase and violent protest from citizens.Furthermore ,there is no guarantee that this decision will solve the problem.Because those people who can afford costly cars for them little more fuel prices not going to change anything",
        "supporters can argue that extra revenue from price differences can be invested in generating clean energy for vehicles but that can be done by redirecting other resources too.In spite of all the exercise of fossil fuel price, the problem stands still and make peoples life harder,so why we should go for such a solution?",
        "In final say, I strongly oppose  increasing petroleum products prices and look forward to other rational solutions for environmental problems."
