        "I tend to confess that most of the people think that completing University education is thought by some to be the best way to get a better job. At the same time, other people taught that technical skills and soft skills must be required to get a good job. The following essay will outline the ways to get a good job.",
        "Certainly, To get a job in public sector companies or private sector companies, they must have at least graduated. Many companies looking for the graduation passed students only. Because in the university education, they will teach the technical skills. Most of the people will start searching for the job after completing the academy education because of their personal responsibilities also.",
        "Some people believe that, for seeking job good subject knowledge is enough. Because once they get the job automatically they will get the experience and will learn the required soft skills. At the same time, some companies will provide training for the freshers.",
        "On the flip side, other people believe that getting job in good reputed companies must need good communication skills and experience. So after the university education, they will start learning leading technologies in the market and soft skills. Because some companies are looking for the people, Only with the experience and good communication skills.",
        "In my opinion, people must start working immediately after the university graduation. If they start working, automatically they will gain the experience and soft skills and at the same time, at least they must have some knowledge about the technologies to start working in companies."
