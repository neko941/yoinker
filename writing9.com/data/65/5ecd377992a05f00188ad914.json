        "Pollution is the biggest problems of todays economy. However, minimum measures are taken by countries to control it. It is the fact that, plastic takes millions of  years to decompose naturally So banning it becomes necessary to protect our limited  natural resources. And I totally agree with this statement.",
        "According to me, plastic bags are available in abundance. To explain in depth, All small and big stores provides plastic bags to its customers to carry their groceries because it is cheaply and easily available.Further, plastic bags have multi-purpose use in many household, but hardly recycle it. For an instance, my neighbours  never separate plastic waste or recycle it as they think it is not worth their time. The government should impose strict rules so that people will recycle plastic.The Government should also create awareness among people about why and how to recycle plastics. But our surroundings have damaged to a great extend that banning it is necessary",
        "Additionally, polythene  is not environment friendly. It's not only damaging land and air but also our wildlife. For example, last month a whale dead body  was found near a beach in New Zealand with 6 kg of plastic inside its stomach.So the whale might have died because of eating plastic.On land as well many animals and birds accidentally eat plastic  bags and end up dying.In order to stop this people need to stop using plastic materials as much as they can. Instead of plastic  they can use alternative. For example, people can take their own washable cloth material bags for shopping.",
        "To put in a nutshell, to protect our environment, it is high a high time for all the government authority to come together and outlast  ban plastic bag. People should also get  aware of the situation and stop using plastic bags."
