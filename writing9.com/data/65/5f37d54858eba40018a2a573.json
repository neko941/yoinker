        "More and more parents refuse vaccinate children due to their own reasons. These people claim inoculation to be hazardous and useless at the same time. However, should we agree with their point of view? This essay will argue that preventive injections are obligatory and very beneficial for kids, despite its small side effects.",
        "Preventative measurements were always doubted by parents. Unknown substances, which are injected to their offsprings may be frightening, because parents are always very protective about their kids. For instance, many fake drugs are produced in our country, so it may be dangerous to inject substance, which you cannot check. Additionally, various news reports are shown about tragic accidents, caused by the cure. For example, a month ago a 3-month baby became disabled due to measles vaccination. This single occasion created a panic among the population and more people refuse vaccination.",
        "Despite the trifle chances of complications, this method contributes to protect children from a huge variety of diseases. Recently, a scientific journal reported, that the death rate among children is lowered to almost a minimum after vaccines were provided. On top of that, the repercussions of illnesses are far more dangerous than ones from the injections. That's why, it is better to protect kids by the vaccine rather than go through malfunctions.",
        "This essay argued that people, who avoid vaccination are undergone to fatal consequences, which are far more serious than single occasional drawbacks after using vaccine. Parents, who avoid this way of protection, they underestimate the seriousness of the situation."
