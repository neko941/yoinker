        "There is a growing consensus among many people that individual photographers should not follow famous personalities and interfere in their personal life by capturing their private photographs. Whereas, others opine that this is the price to pay for being famous.",
        "On the one hand, it is indisputable that people intruding on your territory, trying to take a picture of your\u00a0every movement could, to put it mildly, irritate. Celebrities are often bothered by photographers who capture every moment of their life. For instance, while coming out of a gym or a  movie hall or even a doctor\u2019s clinic, they are being watched and followed. In addition to this, they are restricted to dine out with their families. To illustrate this, a recent UK government report showed that a large number of celebs, including sportspersons, actors, actresses and models have been chased by intrusive photographers and consequently meet with fatal accidents.",
        "On the other hand, although privacy is essential, nowadays celebrities have adapted themselves to such behaviour as they gain popularity through it. Media persons have a complete right to intervene in the private life of famous personalities due to which the public has made them shining stars overnight. Additionally, through the love and support of the people, they have climbed the ladder of success. For instance, the airport looks have become so common nowadays for the same reason. Karan Johar, the famous Indian director, once said in an interview that he prepares and dresses up to catch the eyes of the photographers.",
        "In conclusion, I believe that famous personalities should not be disturbed when they are spending some quality time with family members and close ones. However, while it is true that media should respect the privacy of everyone including celebrities, famous people also need to realise that encroachment on privacy is the price to pay for being popular. Those who really value their privacy can always choose not to be a celebrity."
