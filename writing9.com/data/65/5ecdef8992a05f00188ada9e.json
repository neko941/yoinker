        "In recent times, having many options for the format of work could teach skills for humanity. In my opinion, the best format is the team activities. Team activities could teach more skills for life than others.",
        "There are a variety of skills of life are the community could teach for people. Firstly, It is could be co-operation and conflict management skills.  In fact, each person has their own particular personality which leads to the difference of point of view in any statement and it is easily led to arguing together, so that team working gives chance to humans to experiment with each other in the group of team and can be well-operation which is solo activity could not teach. Secondly, Team-work could help people have more responsibility. The stagnation of participants in the group can have a big impact on the way to get the target of the team, so this aspect made the participants have to take responsibility for their mission.",
        "Another compelling reason that team-work could help humankind comprehensive development. Likewise, people can learn leadership, decision-making, and create critical thinking while doing team activities, those that skills are tremendously useful in real life, for example, humans can get a huge benefit through the right decision in businesses. Furthermore, it is could assistance people in intrapersonal intelligence such as listen to other's views and learn how to accept the correct suggestion of others, people can gather the right suggestions and show their excellent decision.",
        "In conclusion, teamwork or individual work both have their own advantages. Basically, in my perspective, group jobs would be more to improve the necessary skills in life."
