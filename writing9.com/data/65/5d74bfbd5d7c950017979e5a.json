        "Language translation softwares have become, astronomically, popular among users, these days. Behind the scenario, a number of reasons are contributing to enhance the use of translation apps. The fact is that people are benefiting a lot, which outweighs the disadvantages of such services.",
        "To begin with, the transformation of any types of languages helps people to get other languages that view is considered as the  main reason. For example, in China, a growing number of people intend to learn their mother language, so that when they deal business with foreign people, they cannot understand them. For that reason, now , they have started using translation apps like google translation and using other related-devices which, invariably succour them to get any languages such as English, Japanese, Korean and so on , to name but a few. As a result, they are able to communicate with other people without any human translator. Moreover, translation apps enable people to work faster, even in schools, businesses and office-related work. Thus, people are keen to use such types of software.",
        "On the contrary, people have notions that translation apps could bring negative effects if people rely on them now and then. The reason is that most of the translation through google would be inaccurate and unreliable. Besides that the device that people use for translation could interrupt in the crucial moment. For instance, when presidents hold the microphones into ears, it is possible that this technology could not produce the sound, which is required in the desired moment. That is why, their business may hamper which consider not only embarrassing but also disturbing. Using the online site, therefore, interrupt the activity and connection.",
        "In conclusion, general, as well as the most sophisticated person would prefer to use translation devices for business and other communication purposes. For that reason, I would say that having such apps have the greater outcome than its demerits such as incorrect translation and deter in listening to the desired languages sometimes."
