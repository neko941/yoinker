        "To commence with , in the cutting-edge era wind transit increasing very highly . And it produces many hurdles for the environment . First and foremost is deterioration . To explain it , breeze movement exists high levels  of harmful fumes . So it directly affects pollution when the whiff contact with the fumes , and the wind is polluted . For instance , in the article on the new international , the airport  posted that every day 1200 airlines run on the runway .  Hence , it is proved their plan influence a very high level of pollution in the wind .",
        "Shifting towards remaining reasons , low expenses . To explicate it , every masses want to go in air transport . When the expenses of atmosphere traffic are very low then individuals travel at a high level . When the no. Of travellers is increasing than definitely no. Of traffic will increase . So it is not a good thing for the environment and our natural life . Because air pollution is the cause of many diseases among  humans and wildlife live .",
