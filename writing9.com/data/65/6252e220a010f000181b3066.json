        "The motivation that encourages me to be interested in studying in MSc International Finance program is the impact of money on the individual, organization, and society from the past to the present, such as foreign exchange rates, economic situations, and the interest rate. For example, the currency appreciation or currency depreciation of each country causes the cost of goods and services in everyday life to adjust accordingly. The changes in price give dramatic changes in terms of advantages and disadvantages towards personal expenses. Moreover, this effect also has an impact on each company\u2019s expenses because the company has to use more money for expenses from increasing commodity prices. Increasing commodity prices causes Federal Reserve Bank to increase the interest rate in order to reduce the inflation in the financial system. However, the rising interest rate has a negative effect on the firm because they have to pay more loans resulting in the bankruptcy of the firm. When there are a lot of companies considered as default states, the result makes drastically negative changes in the GDP of each country. The impact of lower GDP will accelerate the deflation to occur rapidly. I am confident that if I study this program, I can use the knowledge that I get from this program to adjust and adapt to the firm. For instance, I can analyze when the interest rate will rise or fall, I will be able to make a suggestion to the president of the company at that time on how we should operate the business."
