        "I am a regular visitor who eat lunch at the college cafeteria purely on grounds that the food service in it is hygienic and fresh, suitable priced and it has a friendly atmosphere. There are, however, a number of deficiencies which I believe should be put right.",
        "To begin with, although your staffs try to keep the tables clean, there are not enough employees at peak time to clear their tables themselves then they finished eating. Moreover, certain students do not bother to do this, there are a numerous students who do not wait in the queue to be served, which is very annoying for the majority of us. Last but not list, there is only one billing counter and this makes it extremely busy.",
        "As mention earlier, from my perspective, it would be a good idea providing that more signs were put around the cafeteria asking students put their plates and cutlery on the trolleys provided and throw awaytheir leftovers and rubbish. In addition, you shoul tell students when they are being anti-social and jumping the queue. Finally, you should consider add more billing counter so that we not be late for our classes.",
