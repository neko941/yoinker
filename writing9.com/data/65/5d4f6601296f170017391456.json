        "Dear James,",
        "Hope you are doing great and thank you for writing to me. You have asked for my advice regarding the next step in you should take - either to join a college or alternatively get a job. I would suggest that you should gain some work experience before pursuing higher education.",
        "As I personally know you, you would not enjoy going to college right now because you have always wanted to work and what better time can it be to work than now? I personally feel getting a job is a better idea for you as it would expose you to the real business world which you can capitalise in your education since you are interested in studying in business administration.",
        "I have started my University just after finishing high school and consequently, I couldn\u2019t get any job experience in my field which I often regret. I believe you should not make the same mistake and instead take the opportunity to gain some valuable skills such as delegating tasks, managing time, meeting deadlines and working in a team. The job experience will enhance your decision-making and presentation skills. Moreover, it will open doors for better job opportunities in the future.",
        "I feel you should work in a large retail shop as a salesperson or perhaps join a small company that serves customers directly. It makes sense as it would be easier for you to find such a job in your city and it would let you understand the business frame closely.",
        "I hope my suggestion would help you decide what is best for you.",
