        "In recent times, most elder people have been living in care homes or nursing homes. The main advantage of this trend is that it helps to improve their life's style and the main drawback is that it can affect their mental health. In this essay, I will discuss both sides.",
        "On the one hand, as busy schedules, people are trying to settle their old parents in care homes, care home has a crucial part in its society. There are many benefits. which contribute to society. Such as it helps to maintain their day-to-day life without any difficulty whereas they are regularly examine their health and treat them carefully. For instance, research shows, that in Uk aged over 70 , 70% of people have been living in elder's home and treat them well. If they live alone and have had illness it is very dangerous to who lives alone, that's why this method is best. Moreover, old people believe it will be helpful to their children because of their busy schedules, As a result, They would experience the best hospitality.",
        "On the other hand, the main disadvantage of this phenomenon is that sometimes it can provide a negative impact on  their life,  Probably elders have to live in the same place end of their life.It can affect their mental well-being. Which leads to physical diseases. For example, research shows, in undeveloped countries, that older people have been living in the same place and there are no extra-curriculum activities, As a consequence, they would feel a lack of happiness",
        "In conclusion, after a thorough analysis of the topic. Living elder home has numerous benefits instead of owning a home. It also plays a vital role in its society. It can enforce the right method while  It can reduce negative effects."
