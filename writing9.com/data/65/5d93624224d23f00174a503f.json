        "I\u2019m writing with reference to the Bus No 5678 that plies the Lekki-V.I route. I have been encountering some issues as a result of the poor service in my area. I have to be at work for 8am every morning, therefore I have to leave with the 7: 00am bus. However the bus is at least 45 minutes late daily and that means I end up getting to work late. The usual response from the driver upon enquiry is that there are not enough buses to cover that area hence the delays.",
        "This is really causing a lot of problems for me at work and I would appreciate if this is addressed to avoid me getting into any more trouble.",
        "I suggest that the company adds more buses to their fleet so that more than one bus can be allocated to each area. This would help reduce the persistent delays and unreliability that various areas including mine keep experiencing.",
