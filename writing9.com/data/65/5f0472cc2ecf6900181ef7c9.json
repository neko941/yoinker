        "The globe in white and black would be gloomy and depressing. I trust this statement as colours have associated with our feelings and emotions as well as it is a great way of communication with nature.",
        "Have you ever thought what it would be like to live in a earth without any colors?\u00a0First and foremost, we can identify objects and our\u00a0shrouding\u00a0and as a result, we have strong connections with our outside world. Hearing and touch alone, are not enough to define objects. Furthermore,\u00a0colours\u00a0play an integral role in our lives as well as one of the indispensable parts of our environment. Wonderful green landscapes, turquoise sea and the\u00a0blood-red\u00a0sunrise do add happinesses in our lives. As an example, we can take recent researches which may show us that without any clears' the humanity will die out within the next 100 years.",
        "Apart from that, colours affect our susceptibility and emotions. For instance, some\u00a0colours\u00a0can help relax people while others can arouse aggression. When we see the rainbow after the rain, it improves our mood or when we see the horror\u00a0movie\u00a0on television, colours add something like action, and we are scared. Therefore, colours tend to make our feelings more sensitive and have a great impact on our mind, as without any colours at all, humanity cannot exist in such a world.",
        "To conclude, I fully agree with this opinion, as it is evident that the world can be a better place with colours as colours undoubtedly bring some positivity in our lives."
