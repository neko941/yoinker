        "Undoubtedly it is true fact that in the cutting-edge era stress level is increased among the masses . Few individuals don't have the natural power to learn languages . Many institutes should push the learners to experience oversea languages . I totally agree with this notion . I will discuss the reasons in further paragraphs .",
        "To commence with , in the modern era language make a very essential part of the human soul . Because it helps to understand each other .",
        "To explain it , language is a common source of communication overseas . So it must be crucial for folks to learn this language . So masses are not able to learn their external language because they do have not the good ability to learn this . For instance , some folks  want to learn the English language and they do a lot of effort to learn the language but after doing a long practice they did not adopt the new language of skill . Hence , in this , matter folks have not any fault .",
        "Moreover , sometimes reformatory pushes the tutees to learn the new overseas language . It is not a good way to learn English  among  individuals . To explicate , every masses have their own choices so authority and schools have not any type of opportunity to force them towards language . For example ,  all masses have their own rights so they can do according to their choices. So lawmakers and institutes have not gotten any power to grab the rights of individuals . Hence , in the present , epoch masses can live their lives accordingly .",
        "To sum up , it is true that learning languages are very important for people but no one can push the masses toward languages"
