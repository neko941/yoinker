        "It is true that gender equality is a sensitive topic in many areas. While I agree that balancing the quantity of male and female employees through passing regulations has several advantages, I believe that imposing it widely does not always bring positive results.",
        "On the one hand, I agree that by enforcing a variety of regulations in workplaces to have an equal number of men and women would bring various benefits to the corporations. Firstly, this will enhance the diversity of the workforces significantly, thus better performance at any specific task. For example, men are expected to do physically demanding activities while women are well-performed at pinpoint accuracy tasks. Secondly, this equality can increase the opportunity for finding sufficient jobs since it negates the discriminatory. As a result, this could lead to an increase in living standard and have a positive influence on their child development later on.",
        "On the other hand, I believe that imposing laws on any sectors of the companies is not always be an ideal solution. To begin with, some occupations encourage more female employers than male and vice versa. By introducing these legislations, it would be a hardship for both businesses and governments to abide these laws since they have to recruit more than their demand to equal these types of workers, which is unnecessary. Furthermore, there are other ways to encourage the equality instead of passing these regulations. For instance, the government could provide scholarships for females who study science majors, which are usually for male students.",
        "In conclusion, while equaling the number of men and women worked in companies and governments is the quickest way to prevent discriminatory, I do not believe that it is worth to apply it on every workplace."
