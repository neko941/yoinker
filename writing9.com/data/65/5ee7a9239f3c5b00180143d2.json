        "As far as I concerned, to develop in society, people have to work more than in the past especially for people on lower incomes. This can have reasons such as develop the cities, economy and in the result pay the taxes, raise the requirements in lives.",
        "Firstly, develop the cities, brings facilities and entertainments for making our life easier and better than past, such as malls, big parks, universities, hospital and restaurants and for the use of those, buy goods or something else, they need more money. Because of this, they have to work 24 hours to provide enough income to live in cities and use the facilities. for example, a father works 14 hours per day and has ideal income, but he does not enough time to enjoy of his life.",
        "On the other hand, time is a valuable thing even more than a diamond which make memories and people live with their memories. So working near 24 hours a day, take whole their time which spends for reach income, so more time at work would mean less time to care for kids and house due to they cannot make good memories with them. It would mean less time to bring-up children also less time to make a good next-generation and to create a community that keeps the world going to progress. In addition to all the problems mentioned above, these people are exposed to many physical and mental problems. Because the human soul and body need enough rest and fun.",
        "To sum up, working more than 12 hours in a day has many negative effects on relationships, families and people's mind. This can destroy civilization and our next generation and convert human to robots that it will be very dangerous for the future of humans."
