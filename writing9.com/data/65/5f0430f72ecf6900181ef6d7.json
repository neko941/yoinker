        "Some people argue that for the majority of people, news has little impact on their life and it is  unnecessary for people to waste time on reading news. From my opinion, however, I strongly disagree with the statement.",
        "Initially, news offers people the latest information, especially for some emergency public events. These days\u2019 pandemic can be a good illustration. When the epidemic first broke out, it was the broadcast news and newspapers that informed people with the deadly coronavirus. Without news, people could not realize how serious the virus was and how could they protect them from being infected. News, to some extent, is one of the most influential publicizing tools, which can help the public equip the appropriate knowledge to fight against the pandemic. If people pay no attention to the news, they may can not tell the difference between medical face masks and non-medical ones, which can put them into a dangerous position.",
        "Another reason why news is necessary is that it can help people better integrate into society. During the daily life, it is undeniable that the most frequently discussed and argued topics are related to the news, ranging from political news, economic news to the entertainment one. Once people want to get involved in a conversion, they must have acquired the knowledge of news, otherwise, the only thing they can do is to keep silent, making them isolated from others.",
        "To sum up, I hold the view that news plays a vital role in people\u2019s life. Only to catch up with the latest news can people respond to the emergency in a proper way immediately and gain a sense of social participation."
