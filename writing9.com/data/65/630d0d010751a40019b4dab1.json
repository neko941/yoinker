        "New technological methods have emerged recently, which provide people with fast communication. However, the users of new techniques have fewer chances to communicate in person. While some drawbacks are associated with the modern touch, I believe the main benefits are more substantial.",
        "On the one hand, a potential disadvantage of new communication methods may be the lack of possibility to meet other people face to face, which could not provide all our needs, such as emotional ones. Sometimes, we need to hug and kiss our relatives. Another perceived negative is that sometimes we find it difficult to convey our thoughts by phone calls and to send messages via the Internet. Since often we are unable to use our body language, it could lead to misunderstanding.",
        "On the other hand, a primary advantage of high-tech devices such as the Internet and mobile phones is that we can communicate quickly with others. A thousand years ago, if ancient people wanted to send a message to another, they would be sent it by horses or trained birds. In such situations, it may last days or even weeks. However, it is undeniable that nowadays, we can access whomever we want to call worldwide within a few seconds just by dialing their phone number or sending emails. A further benefit is that some activities no longer need to be held physically. For instance, weekly meetings or theoretical classrooms can be stored on the Internet, which makes communications easier for people who are long distances or unable to attend school.",
        "On balance, emerging modern ways of communication would indeed seem disadvantageous under certain circumstances. However, in my view, its positive effects in terms of fast and facile methods override society's weaknesses."
