        "While more and more people tend to watch films that are produced overseas instead of those made locally due to a range of reasons, it seems to me that the trend could be changed provided that certain actions are taken. I therefore suppose that governments are supposed to support local film industry financially.",
        "There are a variety of factors that lead to the popularity of foreign films altogether. The first point is related to the impact of globalization, which not only has been making some languages globally spoken, but also causing some cultures and celebrities universally recognised and appreciated. The other thing that contributes to this trend is the excellent quality of foreign films. A significant number of those films have both well-organised plots and terrific actors, backed up by developed film industry. That is to say, they have sufficient budget, up-to-date technology as well as a whole set of production line. Hollywood films would be a perfect example to illustrate this.",
        "Therefore, I would argue that government should take steps to aid local film industries with fund both for economic reasons and for cultural considerations. From an economic perspective, the production of local film could increase job opportunities as well as exports. Some of them, especially science fiction film, could additionally encourage innovation and the development of high technology. For instance, the superhero films are made up of computer-generated imagery. From a cultural perspective, governments are obliged to lessen the impact of foreign cultures and similarly prevent their own cultures and native ethics from vanishing. Moreover, as the local films become desirable and prominent, the chances are that the country would have an increased economic and cultural influence.",
        "In conclusion, although foreign films are popular currently because of various reasons, local films would have a bright future on condition that the governments could give them financial support."
