        "Sleep disorders in all forms have become one of our main problematic issues. The number of people suffering from sleeping problems seems to grow in recent years.",
        "The human body needs the right amount of rest within 24 hours. It is one of our basic needs to refresh our mind and body with quality sleep, especially at night. Having not enough food or drinking water less than what our body needs may cause several problems for us. We have the very same response to lack of sleep, which means our mind and body cannot work properly without enough rest.",
        "Lack of concentration, miss-orientation, or even some levels of dizziness is reported as the result of sleeping disorders. Driving in these conditions can be quite dangerous and unfortunately, statistics show a meaningful correlation between car brutal accidents and drivers\u2019 sleep problems.",
        "Besides the above-mentioned issues, even minor rates of sleeping problems can negatively impact our personal lives and relationships. Negative changes in our mood, potential unacceptable behaviours, miss- judgment, constant fatigue, and unproductivity are known as some results of the incomplete sleep cycle.",
        "Stress full working hours, unhealthy nutrition habits, racket growth of digital devices and applications in our daily life and to cut the long story short our modern life is one of the main causes.",
        "Adding daily workouts and sports to our schedule, like simple running or judging besides Coffin control, and limiting the screen time, especially 2 to 3 hours prior to our bedtime can help us to have a better sleeping experience.",
        "Making a bedtime routine is also very helpful. Set a relaxed atmosphere like listening to a piece of relaxing music or taking a warm shower and maybe drinking a glass of warm milk can also improve our sleep quality."
