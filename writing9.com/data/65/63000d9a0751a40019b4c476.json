        "For some people, the dream of owning a house is not possible or is unfavourable. in some countries, many people decide that renting their home is preferable to buying it. In this essay I will discuss why renting can allow for a more flexible lifestyle, but why it can eventually be financially disadvantageous.",
        "The main benefit of renting a house, rather than buying one, is that you can move at any time. If you change jobs, for example, and your new office is far away then you can rent a house closer to work, which will save you lots of time commuting. Or, for whatever reason, crime becomes an issue in your neighbourhood, you can pack up your belonging and move. Clearly, being able to move is a key advantage of renting.",
        "However, the major drawback of renting an apartment, relative to buying one, is that it is a waste of money as you're not paying off the house. If for a certain reason you have a misunderstanding with the owner of the building and you have to relocate to another mansion, will obviously cost a great deal to rent a new home within a short period of time. Another example is that you spend a lot beautifying the dwelling only to abandon it for another.  Definitely, renting a residence several times due to relocation has a colossal financial disadvantage.",
        "In this essay, I argued that renting provides greater flexibility while owning results in greater financial reward. Personally, I prefer to rent so that I can live a more flexible lifestyle."
