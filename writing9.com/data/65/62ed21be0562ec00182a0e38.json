        "Consumption of sugar is harmful to health as it frequently leads to diseases like diabetes, heart disease and obesity. a number of people deem that authorities should play a crucial role in limiting  sugar intake, while others believe that it's the individual\u2019s responsibility to take care of one's health and consume nutritious foods. In this essay, I will discuss both sides of the argument in detail.",
        "Firstly, the usage of sugary drinks should be discouraged by imposing  higher taxes on the products by the government. The addition of tax on these products will increase the retail price and increase the financial burden on the individuals. For example, India is considered the diabetic capital of the world, to defeat this and improve the lifestyle of their citizens, a few years ago the government introduced a sugar tax on products such as bottled drinks, canned foods, chocolates and icecreams, this measure eventually lead the consumers to buy healthy drinks, also the revenue to the government increased multiple times. On the supporting side, the government can provide additional subsidies for healthy foods, so people will consider including them in the monthly groceries list.",
        "It is also important to consider fruits and vegetables are expensive, so people prefer packaged foods and drinks which are less expensive. However, the responsibility for eating healthy food also lies with the end users. People opting for a healthy lifestyle are less prone to diseases. Reduced sugar ingestion has shown reduced cholesterol levels and diabetes among patients as per a recent study conducted by the Food Authority of India(FDI). In addition to this, an active lifestyle has a positive body mass index and thereby reduces obesity. For example, one who exercises regularly has optimal weight and prolonged life expectancy in comparison with someone who does not exercise regularly. Hence, healthy food recipes and a good lifestyle promote overall well-being.",
        "In conclusion, although the government has access to bring reforms to restrict sugar consumption, it is the equal responsibility of the consumers to make healthier choices."
