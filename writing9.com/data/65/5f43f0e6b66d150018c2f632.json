        "In general, people say the education system at all levels are too centric towards the learning facts, which means a theoretical approach rather than practical skills.",
        "In a country like India current education system drives the theoretical approach in all the levels of the stream. Right from kindergarten to universities. The syllabus  was designed in such a way that students will focus majorly on theory classes. These theory classes were evaluated through a term test followed by a ranking system. Moreover, current system focus on major subjects like science, mathematics and languages. The current method of learning missed to focus on life skills and practical sessions. To some extent I agree that practical sessions were used, but only on the higher school grades and in universities, even that's too insignificant.",
        "Psychologically practical methods are more impactful than theory. I am not against to the theory methods, but if the concept would have been taught in a practical way,  students will not forget forever. This was proven scientifically. Current infrastructure may not be supportive to be practiced in many of times. But technology has a solution for this issue. Web based applications like Google, YouTube are very popular nowadays. Teachers shall use those platforms and help the students to explain the concepts in a practical way. Once my son came to me and ask for a help to create an electrical circuit project, I have directed him to learn from the YouTube, initially he was resistive later he enjoyed the learning and this process gave him a satisfaction of achievement.",
        "In conclusion, I strongly agree that  the current education system doesn't support enough on the practical side of the learning. It would be better if the method of  teaching and evaluation should shift towards the practical side which will give more balanced education system."
