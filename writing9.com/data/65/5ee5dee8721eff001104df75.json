        "In the modern world, advertising has become a crucial factor to promote products, and several sports product companies are using sports stars for advertising their goods. In this essay, I will discuss the advantages and disadvantages sides of this, and then state my own opinion.",
        "On the one hand, there are numerous positive sides of using sportsmen to advertise special products. One of them is that it may help companies to expand their profits and brands over the world. It is not secret, well-known sports players have a great number of fans who follow them and try to imitate as their favorites. Last year, thousands of football T- shirts have been bought after Cristian Ronaldo altered his football club another new one, for example. In other words, companies can link their name to successful players. Besides, encouraging this way might be beneficial for society in order to choose healthy lifestyle. It means, the majority of children or teenagers want to be muscular and achieve a strong body shape like their heroes.",
        "On the other hand, although this process has a great amount of positive aspects there are some drawbacks. Firstly, it can affect the cost of products which are advertised by well-known sports player. Unless sports companies offer high salary, sports celebrities may not promote their products, and naturally, companies add extra money to the price of sports items for recovering that spending. As a result, sports products might be unaffordable among some people. In addition, this is trigger to unplanned expenditure. Little children pester their parents to buy the advertised product with sportsman on TV or media, for instance.",
        "In conclusion, despite the minor disadvantages, using Sports player in promoting sports products is beneficial for mentioned facts."
