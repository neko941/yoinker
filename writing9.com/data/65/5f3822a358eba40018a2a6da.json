        "Our concern about environmental issue has led to the dispute whether it due to the destruction of some biology species or the other significant environmental problems. While I agree that the habitat strongly affect some crucial environmental issue, I extremely believe that the ecological imbalance are involved as well.",
        "Firstly, global warming is threatening our planet. These past few years, our Earth has been warmed by the greenhouse effect and it leads to the worldwide overheat, particularly in the two Poles. Consequently, it changes the normal climate, causes the rise of sea level, transforms the seasons and they all form more frequent plague. For examples, the sea water poured in the river delta in Vietnam due to the rise of sea level causes the soil pollution and water pollution as well.",
        "Secondly, the extinction of biology species has an enormous affect on our environment. For centuries, people hunted rare animals for medicine or for their cultural belief led to the elimination of some important animals such as Cucullatus, Mammoth, Quagga... and threat the extinction of other species, White Polar Bear, for instance. In addition, we are losing around 12 billion trees each year because of deforestation for industry and agriculture. This sets off for the ecological harmony which lead to some serious calamity. For examples, the cut down of trees causes the annual flood in the highland, drown out thousands of houses and people.",
        "In conclusion, the cause of environnmental problems are combined by two factors: the ecological imbalance and the global warming. Both of them are created by human activities."
