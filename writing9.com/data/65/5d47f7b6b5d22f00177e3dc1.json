        "I am Surya, I am a teacher with the Master's in Computer Science and Engineering. I have recently noticed an advertisement for the requirement of a teacher at the community college. The college is located on the Elcamino road 10 meters from the bus stop.",
        "I looked into college course work and came up with courses that interests me to teach. I am willing to take up courses in the field of computer science. The course offered will be on Artificial Intelligence because of its popularity among current trends, apart from that I like to teach the basics of Computer science and Operating System. The AI is mostly about the computer artifically learning to search/identify objects based on the models we train.",
