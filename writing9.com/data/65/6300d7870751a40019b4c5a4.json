        "After the invention of smartphones, drastically the usage of social media increased and there are people who are using these resources which are annoying to  celebrity kids who are still minors.I strongly obey to the point that taking photographs of these celeb kids without their consent should be banned by implementing stricter lawers that prohibits the photographers from taking  photos.",
        "Firstly,taking pictures of these kids who are below 18 and posting them on social media leads to  insecurity in these teenagers.Furthermore,any wrong step that these children take for example, if one of these celebrity kids walks on a road and if a person comes and asks for a selfie and if the kid rejects,this leads to  social trolling stating that the kid is headstrong due to the money,fame their parents had given them which is almost character assassination, irrespective of the point that no one thinking about the mood and situation in which the kid rejected a selfie with the audience.",
        "Since these kids who have not yet fully matured can go into depression even due to the small negativity they see on themselves on  social media.In extreme ,cases these innocent kids can attempt suicide.In order to  avoid all these the governments should bring a law that punishes and impose a penalty on the accused so that others will not repeat the  mistake again,seizing the photographs and cameras used to take the pictures should be done by the law enforcement department so that this creates  awareness among  the public.",
        "To conclude,bringing  extra pressure on the sensitive minds of  celebrity kids by taking their photographs should be barred and laws should be implemented to bring an end to this major problem of the kids of actors working in the entertainment industry."
