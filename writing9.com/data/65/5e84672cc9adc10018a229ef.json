        "Nowadays, tourism plays a vital role in the economic development of nations. Although local cultures and environments are indeed affected negatively for some reasons, there are still some solutions that tourists can take to minimize these damages.",
        "The serious environmental impacts of the tourism industry are undeniable. Firstly, trees and forests are destroyed to construct tourist accommodation such as resorts, hotels, which contributes to reducing pristine areas and deforestation. This can result in soil erosion, forest fire and even climate changes that is a global problem now. In addition, mass tourism destroys national and cultural identities under the appearance of foreign cultures. Visitors bring their own customs, traditions and especially languages to communicate and fall in line with the locals so residents will gradually learn their languages and copy their habits.",
        "Nevertheless, these harmful impacts can be reduced considerably by some actions taken by tourists. Travellers should preserve local and natural areas by complying with rules like not touching ancient monuments. This is because too many visitors try to touch relics for their misconception. Moreover, they should be aware of not leaving litter, especially not throwing garbage in natural or historical areas. This is a little thing that everyone can do but plays a crucial role in preserving local cultures and environments.",
        "In conclusion, it is important for people to immediately take actions together to preserve tourist attractions. And the best way to do this is to have a good sense."
