        "Technological  equipment  such as  mobile phones and computers have acquired their significance  in  the  modern day",
        "communication  of  the  young.  Personally,  I  believe  that  this has  both  positive  and  negative  effects  on  their  reading  and  writing  skills.",
        "On  the  one  hand,  I  agree  that  excessive  reliance  on  these  devices  is  responsible  for  the young  generation\u2019s  poor  performance  in  reading  and  writing.  Firstly,  many  people  have  a strong  preference  for  computer  software  when  composing  text  documents  due  to  its convenient  functions.  For  example,  Microsoft  Word  provides  users  with  the  ability  to modify  or  erase  a  piece  of  text  without  effort,  simultaneously  slowing  down  the  writing speed  of  the  users.  In  addition,  young  people  who  spend  much  time  playing  with  their phones  and  computers  are  likely  to  have  insufficient time  for  reading  activities.  Gradually, the  lack  of practice  may  impair their reading  competence  in  the  long  term.",
        "On the other  hand,  it  is  also  true  that  the  proper  use  of  electronic  devices  can enhance their reading  and  writing  skills.  The Internet  has  now  been  made  accessible  through both  mobile  phones  and  computers,  allowing  young  readers  to  gain utmost  knowledge  from  a wider  range  of  sources.  Online  English  newspapers,  as  an  example,  are  useful  for  English learners  to  enrich  their  vocabulary.  Using  computers  to  write  blogs  is  also  a  good  way  to embellish the  writing  skill.  Today,  the  availability  of  Internet  infrastructure  can  enable bloggers  to  update  their  stories  at  their  convenience.  By  writing  regularly,  the  writing ability of a person is certain to improve.",
        "In  conclusion,  it  seems  to  me  that  the  use  of  electronic  equipment  items  can  have  both advantages  and  drawbacks  for  the  reading  and  writing  skills  of  users,  depending  on  the  way  they  are  used."
