        "Having routine days and weeks during a month, not only do human beings have a safe life but also is suitable for conservative people. As a vivid example, an employee who has a daily fixed task to do  neither has to think about the task nor make a decision. So there would be less responsibility in comparison with whom have to make a decision. Moreover, those people who are not eager on testing new food thought \" tested food which is delicacy is much safer than the new one and they would not sick by eating them\".",
        "On the other hand, there are many people who enjoy trying new things such as places to visit, and having a new meal. there are some researches in the same field which reveal the relationship between the type of personality and occupations. Most people who like to have new experiences in a vast range of tasks  do not like a routine career. While they do not like daily tasks, they are successful in occupations which need creativity and decision-making.",

In addition to some research, conservatives have no problem with routine jobs as well as eating repetitive products. On the other hand, others like to do something new and they are successful in creative tasks and can make better decisions"
