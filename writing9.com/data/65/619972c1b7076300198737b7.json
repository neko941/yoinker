        "Achieving a work-life balance has been a goal of many but few have obtained it.  Attempting to achieve such a balance, however, is of difficulties and I will identify some problems of this attempt and suggest the possible solutions corresponding to these problems.",
        "Among the issues, the most prominent one is probably the difficulty in trying to delineate a clear boundary between working and personal lives. In their attempt to maintain this boundary by aiming for fixed working hours, people tend to become rigid and refuse to take on necessary extra working responsibilities which could eventually boost their careers. As a result of their inflexibility, they might find themselves ending up stuck in low positions with unattractive salaries. Another problem of trying to juggle between work and life is that it is almost impossible to separate the two as family lives do not stop during working hours, at least not for families with children. When a family emergency such as an accident of family members occurs, professional life will inevitably be interrupted, and work responsibilities will probably have to be compensated in personal time. It is, therefore, almost impossible to have a rigid division of professional and personal time.",
        "The key to tackling these problems and obtaining a desirable balance between work and life, however, is not about maintaining the fine line between them rigidly, but rather the opposite; introducing the maximum level of flexibility. Flexible working schedules that hold employees accountable by the working responsibilities rather than fixed hours are likely to solve people\u2019s struggles between their professions and family lives. Under such administration, individuals can attend family affairs without concerns about losing advantageous positions at work as they know that their professional prospects will not be jeopardised provided that they fulfilled their roles when convenient. This is probably why working from home has been growing in popularity in recent years. Not only can working parents fulfil their childcare duties, but they can have more time to either relax or be productive with this innovative way of working freeing up time spent commuting.",
        "In conclusion, the issues with aiming for a perfect work-life balance are a concern for career development induced by being inflexible with working hours and the difficulty to prevent personal life from interfering with work routines. To promote a well-balanced life, it is important to embrace the inseparable feature of these two lives and adapt with flexibility."
