        "By and large, the role of sport in our life is irreplaceable as well as invaluable, especially for youngsters. By the means of this, they may obtain a plenty of skills and also strengthen their health states concurrently. However, it depends on the types of sport that they are going to involve in, so one them can be the best for the individual achievements while another one merely focuses on carefully playing as a team. In this essay, I will scrutinize my ideas after having some discussions on both aspects.",
        "First and foremost, physical activities have an indispensable role in our lifetime. Significantly, without them, illnesses would be unavoidable. Due to this reason, parents tend to make their children enroll at various kinds of sport in order to urge their developments. Several of them provide main imputes for enhancing personal results. For instance, the box or the judo wherein prodigious tactics are taught for each sportsman for winning competitions individually. During that period, basic knowledge will be secured and they will clearly have enough experience to meticulously defeat their opponents.",
        "On the other hand, other types of sport for example: football, basketball and volleyball, may exceedingly ameliorate their team work. To illustrate, owing to have regular trainings as a whole team, your communication abilities will be honed and they, in turns, will help you to pedantically keep up with your teammates. To clarify, they will easily feel when they should pass or goal because of working so many times together. After having intensive trainings among players, during the game it will be so easy for them to win matches due to possessing proper understanding among each other.",
        "To sum up, taking part in sport helps people to enhance their particular sides. One of them can teach them how to survive by competing till the end. While, a section of activities may profoundly train you to work as a unity without falling behind another player in your team. Above all, in my point of across, both situations have their own positive and negative sides, nevertheless, generally each type of exercises are inevitable vital for sustainable development"
