        "A lot of people tend to spend more and more time with electronic gadgets. Communication, media are widespread all over the world. However I believe that the mass media are the main reason of ruining people\u2019s relationship.",
        "People from different parts of the world are connected since the first computer was launched. Electronic devices such as computers, televisions, and phones are developing each day. This provides human beings to communicate more quickly and easily. One beneficial example is social networking sites, which give a chance to meet new people or get to know more about their culture. Young people even may build relationships which grow into marriage. There are numerous efficient points from electronic media.",
        "On the other hand mass media provides significant points towards personal relationship. Most people do not speak to each other due to overwhelmed life in online life. Individuals tend to make lots of friends on social networking sites rather than maintain relationships. However elderly people do not know how to use electronic media. They are the most vulnerable groups, who suffer from loneliness and lack of conversation. If someone spends a lot of time in front of the computer or phone it would damage individuals\u2019 bond with the rest of their family.",
        "In conclusion, in the technological generation more people contribute their time and efforts to the electronic gadgets. The popularity of the electronic gadgets is growing rapidly, therefore reducing a good effect of real communication. As human beings are more social creature media\u2019s influence should be limited."
