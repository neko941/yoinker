        "The issue of whether all cities should provide medical plans at no charge to citizens has to be controversial. Divergent as people's views on this issue in question may be, I totally do not agree that every government should offer a medical plan to citizens at no fee.",
        "Of all of the reasons why the government should not provide a free medical plan to people, none are as significant as the fact that the hospital system might be overloaded. With this in mind, a free medication plan could bring more patients to hospitals where they have not necessary need to see a doctor, it will impact the efficiency of hospital operations. Without the charge of medical consultation, people will easier to go to the hospital. However, with the fee of the consultation, people will predict what they are necessary for and then decide to go to the hospital.",
        "Another justification deserving our attention is that the demand for doctors in the cities will obvious increasing, but the income for doctors will decrease. If the government decide free of charge for the people see doctor, it means the government need to coordinate a group of doctor and due to this problem,  the government need to pay  doctors. It comes to doctors' income stability.",
        "Judging from this, it is patently obvious that government should not provide  medical services without charge, which with impact more patients and less of doctors in the cities. However, if the government can consider a medical insurance policy for all citizens, such as in Taiwan, it will make it more convenient for the citizen."
