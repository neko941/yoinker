        "A section of society holds a belief that planting more trees in a public area in cities and towns are more  vital compared to increasing  residential. This essay will highlight both aforementioned issues, as well as my perspective regarding this matter.",
        "To commence with, there are a plethora of environmental issues that lead to global warming in this millennial era such as the deforestation and illegal logging activities. Therefore, enriching the trees in the urban areas will be a huge assistance in providing oxygen to the nearby surrounding. In other words, this kind of modus operandi can counter back the carbon dioxide that are released by the factory. Hence, folks who live in the urban area will no longer to bother about the quality of air, along with lower the surrounding temperature.",
        "On the other hand, folks reckon that  enhancing the housing is most likely will destruct the flora and fauna habitat. To exemplify that, the planned construction site is likely to be the previous shelter for endangered animals. As a result, some animal species are on the verge of extinction. It is undeniable that every single construction will cause a subsequent repercussion for the flora and fauna. However, undoubtedly, due to the rising of population mostly in all nations, this kind of construction is a prerequisite in order to provide  shelters for people.",
        "In a conclusion, although it is a prerequisite to plant more trees in urban area, housing construction need to be prioritised to provide the shelter for folks. In my opinion, I suppose that providing more housing is not a huge deal as long as the planning is properly done to preserve the habitat of flora and fauna."
