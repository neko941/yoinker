        "According to some people, voluntary work is needed to be included with the major courses in the secondary school curriculum.  In my opinion, though it will benefit the students by extending their practical knowledge, it should be added as an optional subject otherwise this might hamper studies for several students.",
        "Acting as a volunteer will broaden the level of student\u2019s horizons. While commuting such tasks to aid, health, social or educational organizations, the pupil is likely to be introduced with life-oriented issues such as, health care, the process of cleanliness, socializing, knowledge sharing, and so on. Gradually, these participants will not only grow a sense of responsibility in them, but also become empathetic to others. Moreover, volunteers will also gain certain competencies, which they can use later in their life. Thus, community service helps the youngsters to grow as a person. For instance, it has been observed by many business organizations that the employees, who were employed as a community worker in their early life, are more managerial at the office and home compared to others.",
        "However, incorporating community service as a mandatory subject might restrain the main purpose of high school. It cannot be denied that, not every child has the same capacities in terms of physical and mental specifications. Besides, the secondary school syllabus is already filled up with an extended number of textbooks and other learning programs. Therefore, associating with an unpaid job will let the youngsters' overburden and less time remain on hand to complete their studies. Despite this, it would be appreciable if the pedagogues thought to add it",
        "as an elective course. Probably it will relax the children to choose with interest and give their best. For example, a survey conducted by \"Monster.Com\" reveals that those adolescents usually are the best performer in extra-curriculum activities, who are keen to do that by their own.",
        "In conclusion, including social service with the core learning program will bring advantages for the youngsters as their knowledge will be expanded with practical experiences. Nevertheless, students should be given the freedom of choice; this will make them better executer and not hinder their education too."
