        "Overweight and Obesity are considered as a major public health concern in the growing world of globalization. It is believed by some people that this problem can be tackled by increasing the price of the fast foods. However in my own perspective, I disagree with this notion and suggest that various other reforms should be launched into making a healthy society.",
        "To begin with, the globalization and materialization have raised the level of expectations among the society which makes them work for a longer hours in the office with hardly any time left of the cooking. In addition to it, the palatable taste and cheaper prices of these food items further encourages to thrive on them. However, these pre-cooked meals are unhealthy in the terms of their high salt and fat content which predisposes the communities to obesity and obesity related disorders such as hypertension, diabetes and heart disease.",
        "To tackle it, raising the prices will not be beneficial as it will increase the financial burden on the society and can\u2019t keep children away from eating the burgers and pizzas from the big companies such as KFC, Dominos and McDonalds. In fact, the food companies should start practicing healthy cooking measures in their outlets such as limiting the use of salt and fat in the preparations and increasing the use of boiled vegetables in them. Apart from it, the use of electrical home appliances such as automatic rice cooker should be used for instant and quick cooking. Moreover, the government should organize various awareness campaigns on maintaining the healthy weight by practicing the balanced diet and regular physical exercises.",
        "To recapitulate, I opine that the multiple efforts in terms of healthy cooking, eating balanced diet and doing regular physical activities are required for the weight loss and maintaining a normal weight."
