        "Nowadays young generation is more and more concerned about taking a whole gap period before getting into university life. This essay will examine the advantages and disadvantages of a year off for young people.",
        "There are several obvious benefits such as relaxation and broadening their horizon before a new start of another hard work. Mostly in developed countries such as the USA, Australia or Great Britain students could gain a lot of useful experience during their trip or meet some new friends. Their mindset might change by the influence of their surroundings. Another positive aspect that they will earn some money if they work while this time. School graduates might learn to be more independent. All their experience will bring them new ideas during their studies at the university or college.",
        "The impact is not always positive as there are some disadvantages. First of all there is a chance to lose the whole period for junior. Also there are numerous dangers as they leave their homeland. The most common criticism is that they have to spend their parent\u2019s money for their first journey. Another negative effect is to their health. After finishing school pupils could choose to work instead of travelling. However employees are looking for the stuff with appropriate qualification. That is why young person could find only blue-collar jobs. Mainly it includes agriculture, manufacturing, construction, or maintenance. These types of jobs might worsen their health.",
        "To sum up the disadvantages outweigh the advantages. Break for a year would not be stimulated by every young student. Personally, I believe that young men should start their journey with their own choice."
