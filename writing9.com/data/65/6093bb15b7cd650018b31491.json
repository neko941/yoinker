        "In this modern times, using picture in a Newspaper to support  data has become increasingly popular.It is often argued that pictures are not a trustworthy source of news whilst others disagree and reckons photographs as an undoubted source of the broadcast.however,I am with the latter view.",
        "To begin with,the individuals who think picture able news is  unreliable provides their reasons that Since a vast number of fake broadcast are occurring it will be a wrong-headed decision to support  data just by seeing a picture . moreover,there is a plethora of technology available right now in the market which can be used to edit a scene.For example,in Bangladesh a photographer edits a picture by changing the victim face with a political leader to misguide the government and the local community.that is the main fact why a huge number of Masses believe the picture is  not  reliable stuff.",
        "On the other hand,some experts consider the news with photos as  irrefutable.although there is a tendency of using fake pictures in the paper ,  they still believe it is  undoubted news .since many publishers made paper with a lot of research this there is a lesser chance of appearing fake pictures.For example, a machine available which can detect wrong or editing photo .",
        "In conclusion,I would say I think news which is available with photos can be taken as a reliable."
