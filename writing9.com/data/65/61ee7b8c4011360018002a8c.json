        "Today, raising children in single parent families is becoming a common trend in society. Some of the main reasons are divorce because of imbalance between family and work and early marriage. The consequence of this trend is low self-esteem in children and an inability to develop to their full potential.",
        "There are two main reasons leading to divorce which are parents' workload and getting married too soon. When society is developing day by day, parents also have to work harder to be able to compete with others at work. In that way, they have a place in society and make money easier. When they spend too much time at work, they don't have time for family. Controversy is inevitable and the final result is divorce. The next reason for divorce is getting married at a young age. When parents fall in love and get married too soon, they may drop out of school and give up the diploma. Nowadays, a diploma is indispensable when applying for a job; therefore, it will be difficult for them to find a job with a good salary. Financial difficulties are also a cause of divorce when the amount of money spent for the family is not small. For example, a recent survey found that those who married early had a significantly higher divorce rate than those who married late.",
        "The consequences of divorce are the children's lack of adequate love from both mother and father. That lack will have a significant impact on children's psychology and thinking. Children raised in single parents families will not receive enough love and affection from their parents, which will affect their character and behaviour in the long run. Children will become self-esteem and afraid to communicate with people around them. In addition, they do not reach their full potential. When the family has only a mother or a father, the family's finances will be limited; therefore, investing in children will become harder. The physical and mental needs of children are also more difficult to meet when they lack a parent. For example, children raised in single parents families often do not have the opportunity to explore the world around them.",
        "In conclusion, two common reasons for divorce are the imbalance between family and work and early marriage. Being raised by single parents  makes children with low levels of self-esteem and unable to reach their full potential."
