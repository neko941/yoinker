        "The supplied pie chart highlights the information with regard to the total of bottles, which were sold by Coca-Cola in 2000 across the world.",
        "According to the chart, we can observe that beverages of the Coca-Cola industry are extremely common among the residents of North America. A more detailed look at the pie chart affords to infer that 30.4 per cent of North Americans are composed of a consumer of Coca-Cola. Likewise, 25.7 per cent of the population of Latin America prefers such a company in order to make a purchase of sodas. Also noteworthy is that among Europeans and Asians such drinks are not immensely popular in contrast to American continents and a quarter of the residents of European countries and approximately 16.4% of the Asian population make a purchase of carbonated drinks, which produce by Coca-Cola.",
        "The given line graph reflects the cost of Coca-Cola\u2019s share throughout the period from 1996 to 2001. According to the graph, it can be spotted a substantial increase in share price from just over 30 dollars per stock to 70 dollars. Thus, the rise has consisted in twice during the first year of the research period . Onwards, the price of the stock has declined throughout the first two quarters of 1997 and since the third quarter cost has spiked. After that, the price reached a peak in 1998 and that we can notice a gradual dwindle of price by the beginning of 2000s with inconsiderable growth in the year of 2000."
