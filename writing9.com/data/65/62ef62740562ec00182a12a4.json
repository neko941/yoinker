        "It is controversial that whether the History subject is more vital than Science and Technology or not in modern society. In my opinion, the History is same important as the Science and Technology since they belong to different subject class, humanity science and nature science.",
        "To begin with, it seems to me that there are three main reasons that why some people believe that History is more important than the other two. Firstly, the primary reason is that history can provide many experience to us.  For example, people in China can find the historic counterparts of almost every modern events. Secondly, those experience is really meaningful for our modern society and our future according to my knowledge. Finally, I am sure that those whose major is History are more likely be a leader in their jobs.",
        "However, although the History is important for us and will benefit us, we still cannot put it at a position that is higher than that of the Science and Technology. As the history is very important in humanity science field, the science and technology is also very important in nature science field. Furthermore, the humanity and the nature are the two main factors in modern society. Each factor is indispensable for us. For instance, the History can make us knowledgeable while the Science and Technology can promote the development of our society. So it is no meaningful to compare them.",
        "In conclusion, I insist that the History and the Science and Technology are both significant in different field, so we cannot compare them."
