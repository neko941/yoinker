        "Some people believe that student should choose their subject at university. While the crowd claim that youth should only learn subject helpful for future like science and technology, I believe that student has freedom of choice about major.",
        "First of all, companies and employer not only rest on your subject you studied but also depend on your skills, character, attitude\u2026 about the position you apply. Actually, a lot of people who don\u2019t study major about communication but still can get a job to involve in this one. For instance, my aunt studied business administration at university but then she became a Public relations manager. Constantly, when you chose a major that you not into it, you get tired and hate it quickly. My sister used to do this she said she got into the Medical profession because of her family. After 2 year-study at Ha Noi Medical University, she gave up and decided to study abroad with another major. So nothing is impossible, just believe in yourself what you have, what you interest in.",
        "Secondly, don\u2019t think that studying science and technology is easy to get a job in the future. Having a high unemployment rate in Science and engineering major recently. According to Viet news, over 32% of undergraduates can find a job after graduations. Because of the amount of IT, computer programer,... is overeating. Too many citizens are trendy about these major. Moreover, some student decides to give up their favourite subject just for the reason that technology subject can bring higher job opportunity.",
        "Taking everything into consideration, undergraduates should study what they really into. Learning what you like make you happier and better at this.  Job chance comes from your real ability not your major."
