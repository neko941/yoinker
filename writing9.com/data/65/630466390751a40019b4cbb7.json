        "To commence with, the supporters of the former viewpoint argue that discovering modern places is spectacular due to the fact that it might enhance life. To elaborate more, new animals and plants might be found there as well. Hence, scientists will have an opportunity to educate themselves about them. Therefore, a cure for certain diseases could be found. Accordingly, life will have higher quality. Despite the previous fact, a non-known area has the potential to live in it. Therefore, crowded cities might have space. Thus, the amount of CO2 will be diminished, which will affect positively the global climate.",
