        "On the other hand,adolescence have a good sense at communicating are preferable in many situation.To illustrate,they can contribute the feeling of impressed to the examiner by starting a satisfactory conversation.On that account,this dominant ability is remarkably vital for surviving in this generation.Nevertheless,juveniles who lack this talent seem to be a lost for them because they barely deliver main point of view to the questioner and even cause a mistaken in their  tranmission.Furthermore,interviewee who has a large influencence on their response will gain several positive feedbacks from the auditors and somehow one can pass the low expectation from others because of a low academic record.",
        "To conclude,we can see that the communicating skill and the standard of pedagogical qualification have played an important role on the account of judgement.Although a person who has acceptable results from their background yet does not have the ability to talk thoroughly will also get a chance to fail because they miss one of the element contributor.Above that,we can a clearly image of the tension of the competion at the moment."
