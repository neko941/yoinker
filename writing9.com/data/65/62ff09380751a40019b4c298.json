        "Crime is a serious problem rising in today's world. To tackle it, a large number of people think that criminal should place in jail  for a longer time for their offences, while others believe that other methods will be more effective to decrease the crime rate. This essay will look at both views and explain why I think that shorter prisons with psychological treatment will better method for criminals to  not crimes again.",
        "On the one hand, there are many reasons why people think that offenders should send to prison. First and foremost, in prison due to corporal punishment by prisoners  criminals, they fear committing crimes again. Also, people feel relief to send criminal to lock up, this is because the community live a good life without worries about crimes. Furthermore, during spending longer time in prison offenders  realise their mistake to spend their half of life in jail. But due to spending longer in lockup and for corporal punishment they do not survive in the community and have no energy to work in  society in their old age.",
        "On the other hand, in my opinion, a better way to curb crime is by providing psychological treatment to offenders during their short-term time. To illustrate this,  giving psychological treatment to their offence  will be beneficial for them to realise their past mistakes. For example, countries like Netherland adapt these methods to apply to their criminal and also announce offender's prison term time will be no more than six years but must get psychological treatment during their period in jail, and as a result, from the last few year's records can be seen that the crime rate in Netherland is decreasing dramatically.",
        "In conclusion, in my opinion, providing short prison along with mental treatment help individuals to  not crime again and also they can realise  their past crimes  only by this we can decrease the crime rate in this world."
