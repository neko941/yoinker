        "It is true that the use of computers has been growing in popularity. While some people believe that computers will eventually replace the role of teachers in the classroom, I would argue that real teachers still play an integral part in the education of children. On the one hand, there are two primary reasons why computers have now been more and more popular in the field of education. Firstly, with the assistance of computers, a wide range of difficult lessons has become easier for students to comprehend. For example, complicated definitions of some theories in math courses can be explained by the detailed illustrations presented on the computer screen with the help of a slide projector. As a result, school students find it less complex to absorb the knowledge passed on from the computers. Secondly, it is essential for students to acquire information technology and computer skills in order to get a high- paying job in the future. It is necessary for them to start learning how to use computers at an early young age. Therefore, schools need to adopt the usage of computers in the curriculum system. On the other hand, it seems to me that despite the vast benefits of computer in assisting the knowledge acquisition of students, human teachers can not be replaced with the intelligent machines because of various reasons. One reason is that young students are usually ignorant about the different functions and features of computers, so that it seems impossible for them to study without the teacher's guidance. For instance, students from kindergarten and primary schools could not familiarize themselves with computers in the early stages of their learning journey, which seems like that only real teachers are capable of helping them to study effectively. The second reason is that it is evident that few students have self-discipline. Most of them are easily distracted when leaning with computers because they could not resist the temptation of attractiveness of computer games. As a consequence, they would abandon academic studies for the sake of these interesting games. In conclusion, I concur with those who agree with the view that it is impractical for computers to replace the role of teachers at school despite the undeniable benefits of computers."
