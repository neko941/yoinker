        "It is said that living in a foreign country comes with many n difficulties. Communicating in a foreign language is difficult, and you may have to confront many problems. I generally agree with this idea. I will summarize the reasons below.",
        "First of all, living in another country comes with a language barrier. For example, when shopping, native speakers cannot understand your pronunciation and you cannot buy what you want. Also, even if you want to make friends, you feel alienated because you cannot participate in the community because you do not understand the language. For these reasons, learning the local language is essential to becoming a member of society.",
        "Second, language barriers also have a significant impact on the quality of life. For example, if you want to work somewhere, you cannot be hired because you cannot speak well. Even if they manage to find a job, it is difficult for them to demonstrate their ability, and they end up receiving low evaluations and wages. Of course, what can be covered with a translator when you are alone is not useful when interacting with others. If you live in another country, you have to work harder than others to get a fair evaluation and a good living.",
        "For these reasons, I must say that living as a foreigner is hard because of practical problems like communication and employment. It is preferable to learn as much of the language as possible before going to a new place."
