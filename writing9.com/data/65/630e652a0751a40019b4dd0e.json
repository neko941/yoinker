        "In the modern era, guardian always worry about their juveniles future. There are two different opinions for this, the first group of people believe that children should be promoted by their parents to participate in organised group activities in their liesure time. However, other group of individuals argue that  it is mandatory for young ones to learn how to become self dependant. In this essay, I will discuss both opinions and in the last share my point of view.",
        "On one hand, younger has to take part in organised group activities because such types of tasks help children to learn teamwork. This will help them in their studies. There are several companies nowadays, which required employees who can work in a team. So, if children learn this thing from their childhoods it will definietely help them in their future. In addition, tasks in team teach many things to children like how to deal with other person, communication skills and etc. As an example, several schools in Canada, recently added new activity in their curriculums in they give task to their students to work in group which are made by their teachers. By this, academics try to communicate with unknown person and can improve their communication skills.",
        "On the other hand, children has to learn how to utilise themselves on their own because there are some benefits of this too. Firstly, if children become dependent of other to do any kind of task they may face difficulties in their future. As an example, If a juvenile needs to make science assignment by himself because it is individual task and he always takes help from his friends for this type task. Then, he can not do his work properly.",
        "In conclusion, I believe that children has to take part in group activities compared to do their work by themselves which help them to become self-dependent. The main reason behind this is by teamwork they can improve their communication skills which help them in their future."
