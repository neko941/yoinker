        "Owing to the rise in unemployment and increasing in university fee, some people suggest about institutions must focus on practical subjects rather than arts and subjects related to the history. From my opinion, even though practical lessons rises task opportunities, art subjects also have equal importance  in contributing growth of our public.",
        "Admittedly,  art  plays a crucial  role  in the growth of our nation. This is primarily  essential  for our students to get  about our culture and milestones of our country. By studying them people will understand about the human behaviour and the  reason behind it. Hence, they will also develop creative and innovative skills based on  different cultures",
        "And to avoid  inappropriate behaviour towards others. Therefore, studying these subjects will  enhance   to improve thinking abilities of each individual.So that, the culture and ethics of our nation will not decrease. Every human being should need to know the progress  and defaults in our system upbringing.",
        "However, diminishing employment opportunities and increase in university fee have made professional course more viable. By teaching job prospects such as accountancy and law will increase the job chance for employees.",
        "For example, multinational companies need a candidate those who  studied accountancy subject well for preparing their financial statements. Once people find profession the unemployment rate gradually steps down and state progress. It is obvious demand for the professional courses in at all time is high.",
        "To sum up, professional courses demand more employment opportunities for meeting for daily basic needs. Likewise, arts and history subjects  also help in social life. So in my opinion, both  subjects should be taught in universities."
