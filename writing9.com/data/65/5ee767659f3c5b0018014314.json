        "In many big cities, traffic and housing issues always raise some discussion nowadays. Some people believe that moving large companies and their employees to the countryside is an effective solution to these problems. I disagree with this idea.",
        "Firstly, relocating big enterprises and their staff could make the traffic more crowed. As most constructions like supermarkets, cafes, and gyms are located in cities, many staff highly likely keep living in towns in order to have a reasonable quality of life. This means those people who take public transportation to commute before have no choice but to drive private cars because of the undeveloped public transportation in rural area. As a result, the burden of traffic would rise.",
        "Secondly, moving big companies and their employees out of a town tends to strengthen housing problems. There is no doubt that those big companies have a great competitive force in the areas they located. Were they moved out, there would be fewer competitions for small firms, which would encourage people to start more business. This means the other employees would be recruited into this major city. Plus the big companies\u2019 staff who keep living in the town, the house demanding would show a sharp increase, which will definitely cause more problems in the housing issues.",
        "In conclusion, moving out big enterprises and their staff of big cities can only make a few employees live out the towns, and the population in the cities will still rise. Thus, instead of solving traffic and housing problems, this method can strengthen the problems."
