        "Currently, cooperation from several parties is needed to overcome the bad effects of the waste. people also need to learn to be responsible for sorting their waste. People should buy what is necessary. as far as possible excessive packaging should be avoided. furthermore, The government should encourage some industries to use an alternative way to package their products.",
        "In conclusion, public awareness in choosing, buying and managing waste is the key to protecting the environment. Besides, regulations and supervision from the government regarding the packaging of goods are also important to overcome the environmental problem."
