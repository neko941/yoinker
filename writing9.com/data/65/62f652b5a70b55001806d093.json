        "Globalization is a catch-all term that refers to any activity that involves more than one country, for example, driving from one country to another. The dramatic increase in transnational driving in recent years has sparked controversy over the potential impacts of this trend on the individual states, especially those new member states of globalization. Some people are concerned that the upsurge in new arrivals will prompt local hostility against the company, instead of promoting their understanding of the mutual cultural background. This notion should be rejected as one can see many facts in favour of this development between communities.",
        "The first reason why international sightseeing would never bring conflict is rooted in the fact that both companies and locals are economically motivated. International flying opens up opportunities for business development throughout the world. Entrepreneurs are interested not only in the domestic market but also in the overseas market. Foreigners should learn the culture of a country before winning over the local people. In turn, locals should show their hospitality to a company in exchange for their trust. They share a view that acceptance of each other's cultural background is a necessary condition for cooperation.",
        "Understanding a culture has other implications. Differences in social background, cultural values and religious beliefs might make the discrepancy between foreigners and local inhabitants on some issues indelible; however, the higher interaction, the higher level of communication and understanding. Arabians, for example, used to consider westerners as their foes. Now they have concrete relations with their western allies in many fields. In the initial stage, their divergence seemed inherent but over time, with better mutual understanding, they take the same position on many issues.",
        "Undeniably, it is likely that in some resorts, foreign guests repel the local community with their scant regard for the local environment and conventions when they first arrive. However, it should be noted that most offence is accidental, rather than intentional. Instead, guests disobey rules and conventions simply because they have no knowledge of them. This situation is expected to be improved with the passing of time when foreigner from different people increases their knowledge of  local culture.",
        "According to the above analysis, we can observe that the increase in  international driving should not be taken as the cause of any conflict that arises between two people. Alternatively, one should recognise its role in improving mutual understanding between two lands."
