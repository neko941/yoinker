I would like to inform you that we have already moved to a new house in Oakville. We are now near the city business district, about 20 minutes by train. You already know that my husband, Edward, is always complaining about the long hours spent in commuting from his work. That is the reason why we had to move.",
        "Our new dwelling is now bigger that what we have before. It consists of 4 bedrooms with two attached bathrooms and two separate bathrooms. It also has a dining room, well-decorated living area, and a big balcony with an amazing outside view. The pride of the house is its modern kitchen and bathroom with a beautiful marble tub. This area has all the facilities such as gym, jogging track, supermarkets, cinemas and it is very calm and quite for a living.",
        "I would like to invite you to visit my new house with your family on this coming weekend. I hope we can have fun and enjoy with each other.",
        "Look forward to hearing from you soon.",
