        "It is true that people in industrialized nations have a longer lifespan than ever before. Although there will certainly be negative consequences in relation to the aging popularity, governments could take steps to solve the problems.",
        "As the limits of lifespan continue to increase, there will be consequent problems that can be anticipated. The main problems in relation to the aging population are financial ones. Longer lifespan means that the number of the elderly will exceed the number of the younger generation, therefore, young people will find it a struggle to financially support the entire elderly population. Apart from that, there will be a significant decrease in workforce and more people will claim a pension. In other words, governments will only receive a small amount of money in taxes, and at the same time, more funding will be diverting into elderly care. As a result, there will be a lack of funding that is meant to be spent on other areas.",
        "However, there will be several steps that governments could take to mitigate the potential problems mentioned above. The simple solution to the problems would be to encourage people to have more children. This can lighten the burden the young people carry. Another tactic that government could take is to increase the retirement age, perhaps from 65 to 70, and this could lead to a more productive working life, which will increase the income tax revenue. The money from taxpayers could be spent on public infrastructure, which will improve our living standard. Finally, private pensions should be encouraged, which will reduce people\u2019s dependence on state pensions.",
        "In conclusion, various measures can be taken to tackle the problems related to the aging population."
