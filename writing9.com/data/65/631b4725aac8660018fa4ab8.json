        "In recent times, children's usage of computer games increase because of development of the technology. Some people believe that playing computer games have adverse consequences in children's well-being while others say it would positively affect children's creativity. In this essay, I will discuss both sides.",
        "On the one hand, many youngsters utilize computer games because of it contained attractive features and modifying technology. There are some equipment use for games instead of computers including tablets, phones and PlayStation. It is clear that excessive using of computer games can negatively affect children's health and physical health. this reduces  physical activities. Because it can create diseases such as obesity and laziness. For instance, research shows that excessive usage of computer games that children diagnosed with eye disease and depression. Moreover, another proved information is that it mitigates social interaction because it would negatively affect children's academic life. Especially for growing children. First period of growing children must need social - interaction and academic knowledge. I believe that parents should limit their activities, If not it would affect their knowledge and experience academic failures.",
        "On the other hand, computer games would aid to make children more attractive person. Because computer games contained think-related activities. For example, that children who play computer games they are more active than the ones who did not. Furthermore, it would help  to children's problem-solving and decision-making abilities improvement and mind development.",
        "In conclusion, after a thorough analysis of the topic, playing computer games has negative impacts on children's well-being. I believe it is beneficial for their brain development. Gaming can help them to be creative and solve difficult situations in their childhood."
