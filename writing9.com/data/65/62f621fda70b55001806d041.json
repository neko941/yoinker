        "In the present day, many people argue that medical doctors are both high- skill doctors and the best researchers in their area at the same time. Hence, I am of the opinion that the best physician can do the best thing in both the treatment of patients and upgrading their knowledge in scientific research.",
        "On the one hand, everyone agrees that the own responsibility of the doctor is cured for people who got illnesses. For example, the internal physician can treat heart or diabetes diseases and the surgeon can remove the tumor from the body of the patient's cancer. Nowadays, there are plenty of diseases around the world and patients had been suffering its everyday. Moreover, there are new problems of health appeared each minute or hour. Consequently, the experience of the physician is very important to treat all that conditions. Indeed, the physician can get their experience throughout their work every time during treating health conditions. In addition, the best doctors have to accumulate their skills gradually.",
        "On the other hand, it is undeniable to say that the advance of science and technology is changed during the time. For instance, there is the development of new machines or chemical tests invented in the world that can detect and diagnose difficult diseases that people had not done before. Indeed, if doctors don't learn and research new technologies and skills in their area, they are not catching up on new knowledge. Besides that, doctors need to make research about new diseases, so they can save more ill people.",
        "All things considered, it is no doubt to say that medical doctors are not only the best physician for recovering patients, but also they are the best academic researcher.  Furthermore, the learning upgrading the mind is the whole - life responsibility of all doctors."
