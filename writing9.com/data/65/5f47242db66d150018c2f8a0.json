        "Nowadays, providing university education for a large number of young people has been high on the agenda of many governments. I believe that this progress has a wide range of benefits but also is improbable.",
        "To begin with, giving almost all young people access to tertiary education is advantageous for both students and society. Firstly, the university curriculum offers students the theoretical knowledge and practical skills needed to open the door to better job opportunities in later life. For example, teamwork and extracurricular activities can encourage their problem-solving and interpersonal skills. Secondly, on the societal level, university graduators constitute a well-qualified workforce, which contributes to an improved quality of life, and a productive and prosperous nation.",
        "However, the likelihood of implementing this plan is slim. This is because an increasing number of juveniles presume that they do not need a formal qualification to get a well-paid job. Instead, the working environment is more conducive for gaining hands-on experience which helps young people enhance their career prospects. More importantly, not everyone can afford the university tuition fee, and a lot of students have to rely on financial support from governments. Even in some developed countries, the authorities cannot allocate ample resources to ensure that most young people have access to university without financial burden.",
        "In short, higher education is beneficial to both young generations themselves and the community, but to offer it to most young people is impracticable."
