        "Recently there has been a rise in the popularity of  second-hand clothes among  younger people. There are many reasons behind that and I think that it is a good thing as it reduces  waste . So it has a positive effect on  development. In this , essay I will discuss these reasons.",
        "Firstly teenagers prefer it as it is cheap and reasonable for them. They want to save as money as much possible  to buy other things they are interested in such as games, tickets and food. So  they purchase used clothes for this.  For example, if they want to follow the new factions so they get to the newest factions for a decent price.",
        "Furthermore, teenagers want to try new things so they get second-hand clothes as it gives them the opportunity to have a lot of new clothes . All these effects of course  the development.",
        "One of the effects is that it reduces the industry and this leads to reduce the number of workers at that factory since it does not make a lot of clothes . So some people will not be able to find a job in this area of industry. On the other hand, It reduces the waste of  energy and products and this helps to protect our planet and our environment.",
        "In conclusion, Today's young people purchase a lot of used clothes because of many reasons. This has a lot of effects on  development. I think that it is a positive thing for  development."
