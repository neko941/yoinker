In my opinion, there are more benefits, which can enable students in order to be successful and get a good result.",

For example, they will focus on a practical task as compared to the theory. Firstly, the burden of homework will be decreased. Thus, they can do other activities, which a student can acquire. Secondly, removing assignments from school can only help them to get not distracted from their education. In addition, they can also improve their other skills such as general knowledge, English speaking, and sports skills while they have limited homework",
