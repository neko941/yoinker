        "Being strong and mentally healthy is mandatory for a sports unit to succeed. These two attitudes are like the wings of a sportsperson: A team or individual player cannot be successful without having one. Below, there are two main ideas about this subject.",
        "Much of the sports fields are team ones. In a team, members can complete each other. There are teams with diverse members: some excelling at being strong and fit, and some excelling at mental attitudes. Usually, these kinds of groups are successful ones. For example, a team captain must have leadership skills, and being a good leader is directly related to mental attitudes. On the other hand, the same team needs members physically strong to win a game.",
        "In individual sports, things are a bit different. Here, there is no team with whom to be completed. One should have both mental and physical strength to be a successful individual athlete. For instance, a mentally healthy runner will never be successful if she does not have an appropriate body. In the same way, a physically gifted person may not be a good athlete if she does not have a clear mind ready to practice hard.",
        "In conclusion, the attitudes needed for being a sports champion vary by type of sport. In a team, the overall unit should have both perspectives, while every individual can contribute to only one of those perspectives. In contrast, for individual sports, every athlete should have a bit of both mental and physical strength. The formula for being successful in sports is a combination of both these aspects."
