        "In the past decade, there has been a spurt of tourism across the world. This essay will discuss the positive and negative impacts of this increased tourism activity.",
        "Firstly, tourism is advantageous to the economy and growth of a nation. So an increase in tourism would mean an increase in the GDP of the country by providing its people with livelihood and business. For instance, in many countries of the world, like Thailand, tourism is one of the most lucrative industries. Secondly, increased tourism activity is also massively beneficial for the tourists as well. It opens them to new places and cultures, and broadens their horizons, which they can then share with their peers back home.",
        "However, in spite of all the positives, over tourism can become a serious problem. Continuous exploitation of nature in the beautiful scenic tourist spots can lead to depletion of resources for the wildlife in that area. For example, Maya Bay Island in Thailand had to shut down for over two years to restore its flora and fauna that had deteriorated because of over-tourism. Furthermore, in the last two years, tourism has increased so much that major airports around the world are unable  to keep up. Heathrow Airport in London is a prime example of this, where the traffic of passengers was so much that it led to a 12-hour wait for security clearance.",
        "In conclusion, I opine that while an increase in tourism is a good thing and can be advantageous, it can also lead to over-crowding and over-exploitation of the resources that are available."
