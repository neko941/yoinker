        "While many believe that professional careers should be supported rather than sports and entertainment personalities, some opponents consider that allocation for entertainment jobs might make contributions to the society one way or another. I agree with the latter argument and my reasons will be elaborated on this essay.",
        "To begin with, it might seem sensible for some that doctors and teachers should receive well-paid because these kinds of jobs play an essential role in our society in these days. To simply explain, the public sectors such as healthcare and education could directly benefit citizens. Without sufficient funding to support teachers, children in the future will lack quality knowledge. Most of the teachers in Thailand, for example, have always been overlooked and have been given unsuitable wages. Consequently, many people who have potential tend to opt for well-paid jobs instead of public jobs. From this perspective, it is logical why some have the opinion that governments should solely consider these areas.",
        "However, I would personally argue in favor of paying entertainment industries including sports, arts, and music should also be taken into consideration by governments. To illustrate, although working in these areas seems to be unnecessary, they could cure the mental health of many people. Anxiety disorder, for example, is one of the most severe diseases that citizens suffer from in this day and age. If people feel too stressed from working for a long period, visiting art gallery could help them release their anxiety. Therefore, entertainment careers should be encouraged to help our societies.",
        "In conclusion, although it is undeniable that social jobs should earn more return, I am of the opinion that the world could reap great benefits the entertainment personalities."
