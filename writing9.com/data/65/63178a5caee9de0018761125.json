        "Unfortunately, in modern societies, violence is rising and playgrounds bullying seems to be growing too. People\u2019s opinions differ, as to whether parents should teach their siblings not to hit back at bullies or they should teach them to be able to defend themselves. While there are some strong arguments in favor of hitting back, I still believe that violence only breeds further violence.",
        "However, there are some examples when violent attacks were stopped as a result of victims hitting back or their elder brothers protecting them by threatening or beating up the offender. It shows that in some cases violence helps to handle bullying. For the last decade, many types of research have been made and proved that children who grow up in violent families often grow up to be violent themselves.  In addition, some children may enjoy the power associated with violence and develop into bullies. So, it goes without saying that parents should promote anti-violent behaviour.",
        "Furthermore, different organizations should attend schools and speak with pupils, explaining the way of handling different problems. Evidencing that schools should have various psychological sessions acting on different kinds of conflicts and showing that all conflicts can be resolved through discussion and compromise rather than force. In my view, this will have a great positive impact on growing people and I am absolutely sure that when they are adults they will behave similarly and try to avoid brutality.",
        "In conclusion, although there are some examples of violence being an effective weapon against bullies, I strongly believe that teaching non-violent strategies is way more productive in the long term. And I think that governments should introduce inti-violent education into schools. Organizing discussion clubs, inviting victims of violence and psychologists, specialists in violent behaviour and showing examples of successful solutions to the problems."
