        "The natural world consists of air, water, land, universe, vegetations, and wildlife, however many people are not aware about the worth of these resources due to their self oriented and selfish behaviour. Various sincere reforms should be implemented by the government to increase the awareness level among the public.",
        "To begin with, the globalization and materialism in the world have raised the level of expectations among the individuals which has lead to their tightly packed work schedule. In fact, the people are hardly left with any time to think about the nature and its resources, instead they like to spend their leisure time on the social media applications and online shopping. Moreover, the deforestation is practiced in the cities to create the open spaces for the construction of offices, apartments and buildings. Hence, the importance of green surroundings in the terms of cooling air temperature and cleaning the air by reducing carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen has been lost due to the greedy attitude of the human race. Similarly, the use of fertilizers and pesticides are done to increase the crop yield, however consequently this has resulted in soil and ground water pollution by high doses of chemicals. Therefore, the self centred personality of the human race is spoiling the world of the mother nature.",
        "Conversely, the government should introduce various advertisements through newspaper, television and social media in the different local languages and paste billboards around the cities to increase the awareness level among the community. Several schools and colleges should be motivated to teach students about the natural resources conserving measures. For instance, more trees should be planted in the open spaces, avoidance of the plastic made products and bags, and preferring bicycles over cars in the cities.",
        "To recapitulate, the materialism has diverted the minds of the society from the preserving the natural resources towards expanding their businesses and earned their comforts. The use of advertisement industry with the help of famous personalities can encourage them to initiate steps to save the nature."
