        "Recently, it has become evident that sports stars can earn more money than other important jobs. While many people believe that it is well worth their effort, many argue that it is unjustified. In my opinion, I disagree with the idea that many talents in sports should receive higher incomes.",
        "There are various reasons why they receive high salaries, and the two most important are based on their devotion and the potential cost of their career. In order to become professional athletes, they have to train exceedingly from a very young age, and thus it becomes a major part of their lives. But unlike any jobs, athletes often have shorter-lived careers due to numerous injuries and career-ending problems. As a result, their salaries probably involve medical treatment and early retirement insurance. Moreover, many sports stars are regarded as celebrities who earn money from television shows and endorsement of luxurious brands. For example, Roger Federer or Tiger Woods can earn a substantial amount of money from many advertisements for sportswear companies.",
        "The opponents of sports stars argue that there is an unequal pay gap between people in useful jobs such as doctors and teachers and athletes. Although they put their lives in danger and challenges to help people, their salaries are relatively small compared to sports professions. It can be explained that meaningful jobs often belong to public organizations; so government funds cannot pay a higher salary than private corporations. Moreover, audiences also favor sports entertainment rather than academic journals and documentaries. This all causes the rising pay gap between sport-related and other professions.",
        "In conclusion, although sport starts to receive high earnings due to their effort, it is still unjustified for other essential jobs. In fact, governments should focus more on raising base salary for other jobs to reduce the income difference."
