        "To begin with, I have a roomate who is a student of music and he needs to practice his musical instruments all day. In addition, he often listen to the music loudly deep in the night. His activities have negatively affected my concentration on my work. For example, a couple of days a go I had to take an important exam and I needed to have a bit quiet to review my papers a day before the exam.  However, my roomate started playing his violin without paying attention to my request. It resulted in a serious dispute between us so that I decided to move out the room as soon as possible.",
