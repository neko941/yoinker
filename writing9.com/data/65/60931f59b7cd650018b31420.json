        "It is commonly stated  the money should be better spent on railway systems  than roads by the government. I (completely) agree with the given  statement due to a couple of reasons.",
        "To  begin with , there is an  array of factors triggering why the government should spend  more money on railways .Firstly; the railroads  are more comfortable  and cheap than main road transportations.Put simply, train travel gives people using this method to go to somewhere opportunities ,such as economic and  physical conveniences.If individuals buy a ticket before visiting ,they may not be able to pay exorbitant money for the cost of the seat. Moreover,as  this trip is  more comfortable compared to  road travel ,they could not suffer from physical disturbances. As a result, those preferring this system will have paid the least money for a ticket and will be comfortable during the trip.",
        "Equally importantly, there is no traffic jam on the railway. That is to  say,  the railroad road enables  travellers a trip without traffic.Therefore , people committing every day do not suffer from traffic problems ,which contribute to  workers beginning the day without stress.Additionally, on railways systems ,the rate of the accident are lesser than others ,which offers passengers a reliable travel opportunity.",
        "Finally ,  technology has brought  significant changes in human  life and  railway systems are improved day by day .Especially, in the modern world ,the developed underground systems are used by millions of people every day,and  gone are the days when we have spent a lot of time  transport .The rationale behind these behaviours is  to  want to access  where we will go easily ,also,  without losing time. Therefore , the underground roads  that are faster preferred by most people.Take developed countries as an example;  in these countries, funding   more grants to train road.therefore it aims to solve traffic accidents and traffic jam problems.",
        "To  summarize in  light of the information  given above  I  completely  believe that the government supports more  railway systems than roads."
