        "Nowadays, it is belived that history is very important and it can teach us many valuable things and lessons. While a lot of people think that it would be nothing to gain from learning about the past and I  completely disagree with this statement.",
        "On the one hand, there are some reasons why people do not need to learn from the past. Firstly, history is the field that is rarely used in people\u2019s lives, therefore, they tend to pay attention to science and technology rather than focusing on something that brings no relevant values to the present or future. Secondly, each history events now are interpreted differently based on different facts and perspective so there is no guarautee of the accuracy of the information obtained. Finally, if history documents were falsified, it would cause a tremendous damage to people\u2019s culture and religion.",
        "On the other hand, history contained many valuable lessons that people can learn. History helps young people understand the culture and how their country has evolved. For example, a lot of schools in Vietnam has encouraged students to participate in history classes. Youngsters need to know how their ancestors defended the nation against invaders throughout many dynasties and maintained the peaceful of country. This would develop their patriotism and pride. Moreover, history depicts the mistakes made in the past so this helps people avoid the similar ones in the future.",
        "In conclusion, it is obevious that it would be nothing to gain when learning from the past. However, it is undeniable that history brings many important things and lessons that will be necessary for people."
