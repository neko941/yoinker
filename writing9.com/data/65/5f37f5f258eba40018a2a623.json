        "Predicaments have long become a great concern to individuals. While many people accept suffering, the others make an effort to tackle these problems. In my opinion, these issues have demonstrated both beneficial and detrimental consequences.",
        "To begin , it is inevitable that people should be satisfied with what life brings to them. On the other words, this has enabled them to have a better sense of security , which has constantly increased their happiness . For example,  a worker would  accept a low-paid job with a long working period rather than work for high-paid company with short working period. Predicaments are also considered to be a solution to a better life without severe and negative thinking.",
        "However, I side with those who believe that people should do their best to move up in life. First, it is apparent that the advancement of human civilization has been made by those who strongly believe that there are always ways to make their lives better. Without this spirit, great inventions like light bulbs, electricity, computers or the Internet could have never come to life. Furthermore, the most compelling argument is that only by solving the existing problems, not by simply accepting them, can people discover their abilities, improve their skills and live their lives to the fullest. There have been instances of entrepreneurs, sports athletes or scientists in many countries who achieved stunning success thanks to their never give up mindset and continued effort. Therefore, I believe that in most cases, the effort to better unfavourable situations would be rewarded.",
        "In conclusion, although in rare cases, making changes sometimes seems quite dangerous, in the vast majority of instances, not only does this action bring about great success, but also helps people identify their potential and live their lives in a more meaningful way. Therefore, on balance, I believe that striving to change unhappy situations is a much more sensible approach."
