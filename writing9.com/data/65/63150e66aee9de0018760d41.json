        "A rising incidence of vexation and infuriation is progressively witnessed in our modern society.\u00a0 As far as i am concerned,\u00a0 this could be due to a psychological phenomenon exacerbated by wrong parental background as well as setting unrealistic goals in life. However,\u00a0 to be candid,\u00a0 this is a step in the wrong direction\u00a0 and i will explore my reasons as we proceed.",
        "There is little doubt that the perception of faulty parental background appears to be the leading cause for the growing fury among the\u00a0 people. An individual who comes from a home where either of the parents is seen always to be\u00a0 upset at the slightest provocation,\u00a0 might end up being a copycat\u00a0 and even worse in most cases. For instance,\u00a0 a survey carried out on the likely causes of resentment among people\u00a0 by the Federal Ministry for Family Affairs,\u00a0 an advocating organisation for women and children, in Nigeria,\u00a0 attributes 45% of the causes to\u00a0 family background. Another possible factor why people are increasingly becoming outrageous is because most times, people are usually in a hurry when planning for their life,\u00a0 so they set goals that are not feasible.\u00a0 They most times,\u00a0 eventually end up being depressed. It is therefore pertinent to note that the aforementioned factors contribute greatly to making rage increasingly popular in our modern world.",
        "A detailed evaluation of the perspective of affairs\u00a0 above gives me a distinct impression of not a welcome development because it can lead to numerous problems such as heart issues and headaches.\u00a0 Additionally,\u00a0 anger can be linked to violent behaviours,\u00a0 thus, posing danger to the society.",
        "In conclusion,\u00a0 the rate at which people get furious is on the increase.\u00a0 I am convinced that it is a negative trend because it appears to be detrimental to humans and the society."
