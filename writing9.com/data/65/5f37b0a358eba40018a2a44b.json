        "Many people believe that since we cannot reach all people in need across the world, we should only care about our own countries' issues. I do disagree with this viewpoint as we can help as many people as possible regardless of where they are.",
        "In my opinion, it seems wrong that we cannot help people from other countries. There are a number of opportunities for people of all ages to do volunteer work in any foreign country where inhabitants are impoverished and disadvantaged. Aside from helping people on-site, those who are concerned about their issues can donate clothing or financial support through international charity institutions. Even when we cannot provide the disadvantaged living thousands of miles away with tangible items, it is totally possible to encourage contributions from other philanthropists through sharing and connecting on social networking sites. For example, with the explosion of online platforms, such as Facebook, Instagram, a story about a person bravely fighting against cancer can widespread be shared, thus creating domino effects with more people helping him or her.",
        "At the same time, it is always essential to help our neighbors and fellow citizens. However, the globalization requires more of our engagement in dealing with transnational problems whose examples can be environmental pollution and diseases. Particularly, the environment would not get polluted in a specific region separated from others, so protecting the environment must be considered all individuals' responsibility. For example, regarding an ailment, people who had died of virus disease in Africa should have been saved with vaccines sponsored by affluent nations. If without proper control, that disease would probably become a pandemic posing a threat to all humankind, such as COVID 19, SAR. Then some seemingly national or local problems would no longer be as they might look.",
        "In conclusion, indeed, we cannot help everyone, but national borders will never stop us from reaching people in need, sometimes helping others mean contributing to ourselves."
