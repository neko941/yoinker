        "It is stated that all vehicles such as cars, buses and trucks will be driverless in the future and passengers will be the only people travelling inside them. In my opinion, there are more advantages to using driverless vehicles namely convenience and safety whereas there are a few disadvantages such as loss of jobs.",
        "First of all, convenience is a major benefit that people can gain using driverless vehicles. These vehicles may have the capability to drive to any location that the user provides. Therefore, people do not want to worry about anything related to their travelling and they just provide the destination information. These automatic vehicles will decide the path to travel, speed limits and skip heavy traffic areas.  For example, Tesla company has recently produced one  driverless car which has the most auto-driving features. The second advantage is the safety of passengers. Driverless vehicles are manufactured with the latest sophisticated technologies. Thus, the possibility of happening accidents in driverless vehicles is considerably less compared to vehicles that people drive. As a result, automatic vehicles are more controllable and accident-free vehicles which consist of extremely higher safety levels.",
        "On the other hand, people who are working as drivers lose their jobs when driverless vehicles are popular. Currently, this is one of the most famous jobs that most people are doing in all the countries and most families rely on this job. Therefore, this will badly impact  a considerable amount of people all over the world which can consider  a disadvantage of driverless vehicles.",
        "To conclude, even though there are some disadvantages such as loss of jobs by introducing driverless vehicles, in my point of view, convenience and safety are extreme benefits that passengers can obtain automatic driving vehicles."
