        "Some people alleged that large scale production companies should prefer relocate in the remote area at the outskirt of cities. According to my perception, migration of these sectors is lucrative for both rural as well as for metropolitan citizens. In this essay, I will discuss both pros and cons of shifting the organisation from well developed area to suburbs before giving a concrete conclusion.",
        "To begin with, the most significant reason supporting the positive side of given statement is decrease level of pollution in downtown. To be more specific, when large industries tend to move on remote area, it would eventually decrease the traffic level as well as the pollution  level in the city. As greater the traffic level more will be the utilization of transportation system which naturally consume fossil fuels. However burning of fossil fuel release many toxic gases into the atmosphere which not only pollute the environment but also give birth to many diseases.",
        "Furthermore with the development of factories and enterprises in the remote area give a plethora of employment opportunities to the local people. As a result which help not only to lead the poverty eradication but also improve living standard of local people.  For example, establishing industries in the suburbs will trigger the development of rural areas and will prevent the imbalance of people migrating to cities. The youth in villages would not migrate to mega cities if better job",
        "Admittedly, there are some limitations of moving companies from city centre to the suburbs.  First and foremost, transportation facilities and resource material are not adequate in remote areas which naturally affect production of products. Obviously, loss of revenue would occur in initial stages.  In addition, customer base may not be as expanded in the urban areas, which may cause the economic crisis to the organization.",
        "In Conclusion, although shifting of big corporation sectors from metropolitan into the countryside areas brings numerous lucrative outcomes, both for urban people as well as for village residents in term of health and economy respectively but, their adverse effect on the development of a company cannot be neglected."
