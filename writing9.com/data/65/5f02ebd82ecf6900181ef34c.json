        "Tourism is one of the most important components of the global economy. Some people believe that tourism brings enormous benefits, while others claim that it exerts negative impacts on societies. This essay will discuss how tourism affects local communities.",
        "On the one hand, tourism is of paramount importance to localities. Firstly, tourism increases locals budgets. When visitors pay a visit to a place of interest, they have to purchase tickets or fees to enter the entrances and enjoy the services. This money could make up for a significant proportion of the local economy. Secondly, promoting international tourism can raise the profile of communities in the world. This is because tourism grants the locality a chance to show off itself by sharing the local customs and traditions with people around the world. As a result, the fame of the place and the locals can spread quickly.",
        "On the other hand, tourism can be the root of several problems. One of them is that tourism has been a major cause of environmental pollution and destruction. For example, most tourists generally drink bottled water when on holiday, which creates mountains of plastic waste every year. If that amount of waste is not treated appropriately, most areas of countries can be littered. Furthermore, the invasion of tourists into certain places can disrupt the local wildlife and ecosystems. For instance, inhabitants can cut down on forests to produce souvenirs, causing the loss of animals\u2019 habitats.",
        "In conclusion, tourism has a vital role to play in the development of local communities. Despite of its adverse impacts, tourism is a worth sector that should be promoted in most countries."
