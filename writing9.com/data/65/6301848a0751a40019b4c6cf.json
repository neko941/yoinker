        "With the fast development of society, everything is changing tremendously, so it is the same with the mindset of people. Some people thus consider that conventional ideas from the older generations are no longer useful for younger generations nowadays. In this essay, I will argue that even though some traditional concepts are definitely outdated and even pedantic, there is still valuable wisdom that young people should learn from past generations.",
        "During the past years, lifestyles have been changing a lot, and some traditional concepts towards genders and family from the older generations are faded off and no more fit for the modern world. For example, the idea that men are superior to women in hierarchies has been abandoned gradually. The old hold the idea that females should stay at home to take care of the family while education is a privilege only for males. However, the idea that men and women should have equal rights to receive an education and have  equal choices to work is becoming the mainstream voice in modern life. The pursuit of gender equality is popular among the younger people, which is considered to be a significant way to realise a sustainable society. Unlike older population who are working for money and would prefer a stable job, the young hold new attitudes towards the meaning of work: it is not only for money, but also for self-fulfilment. For example, many parents instruct children to study hard and then work in government so that they can have a steady job, which is no more appropriate to the diversified society and variable world full of uncertainties. The young groups are more valorous at chasing their passion and value, which I consider as progress of human thought.",
        "On the other hand, the classical opinions towards life from the wisdom in the past are still quite useful and can be a lighthouse to lead a happier life. For example, what Confucius, one of the greatest saint and educator in ancient China, said in his book <The analects> is still widely circulated and help the young population set up their sense of morality in a right way, like everyone can be your teacher and would have something that worth to be learnt from. Standing on the giant to learn from their past experience, great spirit and wisdom is the best way to avoid unnecessary detours and obstacles, and lead to a shortcut to success. We can learn the spirit of never giving up facing any failures from Edison, who failed over 10 thousand times before successfully inventing the light bulb. The voice for justice and respect in his speech \"I have a dream\" from Martin Luther King is still powerful, and inspires the young community to pursue the truth and make a difference in the world. The spirit of hardworking and concentrating on problem-solving instead of escaping is still instructive to help young crowd away from impulsiveness.",
        "In conclusion, the progress of human society should depend on both past experience and new explorations. Rather than saying that traditional ideas from older generations are no longer helpful to younger generations, it is better to say that not all the past experiences and ideas are appropriate for modern society considering the diverse growth environment that different generations are experiencing, but we need to have the discriminability to take the essence and drop the dross for a better life."
