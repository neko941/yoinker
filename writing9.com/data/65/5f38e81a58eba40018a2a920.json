        "People have different views about how their offspring should be taken care of when parents are busy at work. While there are some benefits of having close relatives such as grandparents taking care of the child, I would argue that nursery schools provide the best preparation for a child\u2019s development.",
        "On the one hand, a child should be looked after by their grandparents for various reasons. Firstly, grandparents and their child share a biological relationship, for most of the time resulting in unconditional bond between them. As a result, a baby would feel the warmth of a family\u2019s genuine love and therefore growing up to be a family-oriented, positive member of society, something that is beneficial for a child\u2019s upcoming years. Secondly, since grandparents have a great deal of firsthand experience raising their own children, they know what to expect and how to deal with them effectively, especially if any emergency occurs. For instance, grandparents can immediately provide the best medical care from a wealth of life experience should the offspring be taken ill.",
        "On the other hand, I would argue that it is better for young toddlers to be sent to daycare services. The first reason is that employees at the centers are always professionally trained and licensed before they are allowed to work with children, which could help to improve both physical and mental growth of the children. For example, highly skilled staff will teach their students how to behave courteously as well as encourage young individuals to explore new educational platforms using the appropriate modern techniques. Another reason is that playful and curious toddlers are more likely to enjoy interacting with their peers during this time at nurseries. This will positively contribute to developing essential social and language skills, giving the youngster more opportunities to thrive in the future in a highly demanded world. If they just stay at home with their grandparents, the options are more likely to be limited, making it longer for a child to form the aforementioned skills.",
        "In conclusion, while letting offspring be taken care of by family members is advantageous to some extent, I still believe that kindergarten is the best option for the broad-spectrum progress of a child."
