        "Education is a weapon to change the world. It is believed that learning is a basic right for human, that should not be affected by the low economic status. I totally agree with this point of view, as free schooling can civilize citizen and boost the economic growth in long term.",
        "Firstly, having free study can attribute to the civilization which aids people\u2019s personal growth. Take Hong Kong as an example, Hong Kong implements  zero-cost schooling in primary and secondary school. This policy can rise to Hong Kong students\u2019 competitiveness. Thought learning, students can find out their interest and talent, citizens literacy rate increase as well. Thus, this can keep the Hong Kong international status by armed with powerful human capital, with the diversify in job nature and low crime rate. All these merits are contributed by costless education policy.",
        "Secondly, the free cost in learning can result in economic growth in the long term. For instance, some well-developed countries like Germany, Sweden provide a comprehensive costless program in educating citizens. On one hand, this program can screen out potential students for further cultivate; on the other hand, it becomes a pull factor to attract foreign talents. While human capital rise means that the soft power of the place increase and become competitive. The economic boost gradually. Therefore, costless learning can increase the country\u2019s economic status in the long run.",
        "In conclusion, knowledge can make a huge difference in both nation\u2019s civilized and economic levels. Although free training might not benefit everyone, the power of wisdom can lead the world to improve."
