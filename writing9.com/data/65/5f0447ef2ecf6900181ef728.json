        "A highly controversial issue today relates to the children and when they should leave the parents settlement. In this essay I am going to examine this question from both points of view and then give my opinion on the matter.",
        "On one side of the argument there are people who argue that the benefit of their youngsters leaving the house as fast as possible considerably outweigh its disadvantages. The main reason for believing this is because they need to develop their mind and become that adult ready to confront the societal challenges. Parents, mostly the fathers, often tend to push their beloved ones away and advise them to look for a future of their own. This is believed to have a huge impact on the children's perspective in life and will make them stronger and less vulnerable to the world negative sides. One good illustration of this is when I was just a fresh adolescent and my own father pushed me out of the house, explaining that the time came for me to become a man. And I did, I manage to find my own place, lived alone and all this helped me to focus more on my future and my carrier, therefore that push from my father was an advantage that guided me go through life.",
        "On the other hand, it is also to make the opposing case. It is often argued that in fact kids should remain home with their parents as much as they prefer. People often have this opinion because they like to see their toddler growing, but also to be there and protect him. A particularly good example here is represented by mothers. It is a general truth the fact that mothers get very much attached to their children and try to keep it home as long as they can. In many cases this affection will result into an emotional youngster who is not ready to confront the world.",
        "In conclusion, I believe both arguments have their merits. On balance, however I feel that guiding our teens into an independent world, represents a huge plus. This is because they will evolve faster, and they will be understanding what it takes to make a carrier."
