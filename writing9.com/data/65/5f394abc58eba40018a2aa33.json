        "There are different opinions about whether accepting a bad situation like lack of money or dealing and improve them is the best remedy. In my viewpoint, I believe that the most ideal solution is to deal with and find the right way to improve a situation.",
        "Accepting and not to do anything else is a great and easy way to do when having a bad situation. When dealing with a bad situation in life, people often become anxious and panic so their choice will not be wise and efficient, thus, they will not know what is the right way to solve that problem. If they choose a wrong solution, it can make the circumstance more serious and even worse so maybe do nothing could be the best remedy. Moreover, depending on the seriousness of the matter, that situation can be better and accepting it is accepting new things, new challenges and that means that situation is not as bad as it be.",
        "Dealing and improving is the key to a bad situation for some reasons. Action and find the right way is what people do when being in such a situation so by improving that, a situation will be less serious and will not be a threat anymore. Besides, If people do not improve and find the solution, they will be forever stuck in that bad circumstance. For instance, If a person was abandoned in a desert, there are no other things can help him out except finding sources of water and food and then finding a supports. If he was just standing there so he will never get out of that desert which is his bad situation.",
        "In conclusion, I personally think that it is a wise choice to improve such a bad situation depending on the seriousness of the situation."
