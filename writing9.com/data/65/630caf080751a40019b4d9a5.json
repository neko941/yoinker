        "Few languages are on the brink of being forgotten because few people know and use them. It is often argued that the administration should invest funds to save these dialects while others think that it would misspend. This essay will explain both sides before giving a conclusion.",
        "On the one hand, having to spend the money to save some ancient languages that our ancestors used will be shown that the newer generations still value the heritage that the older ones left them. The national council can preserve these languages by several means. First, the government should issue mandatory learning of these dialects to public schools like elementary and high school. At such a young age, they will be taught the importance of their mother tongue and it should be used and proudly galavanting to other nations. Second, the administration should have a program on tv and radio to promote these dialects, for ,instance an educational channel that kids will love and enjoy. Lastly, a language seminar that will encourage people especially, those that lived in the countryside to be aware and well-informed on their country's forgotten languages.",
        "On the other hand, many new and popular languages have emerged and are easy to understand that the people used. These languages are more evolved and used by most people in different nations. Nowadays, individuals don't care what language they are speaking, as long as the other person understands what is being spoken and they can communicate well. They will choose the most well-known language that the majority is using  to stick to a language in selective people know.",
        "In my opinion, even if the government provide funds to help preserve their language in order for it not to be extinct, I believe that majority of people will still use the most common language that society has been using."
