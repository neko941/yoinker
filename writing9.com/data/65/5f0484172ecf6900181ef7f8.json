        "Films have been an important part of human's life. While some people prefer watching films over phone or tablets others like to be taking full advantage of the moment and watch in cinema theatre. In my opinion, it is true that watching film in a cinema theatre has more influence on an individual's everyday leisure time and overall personality.",
        "Films released in cinema theatres have been with us since generations. The news of release of new movie excites an individual specifically youngsters thereby influencing them to watch movie in cinema. Additionally, when a person decides to watch a movie, he prefers watching along with his friends, co-workers or family members by allowing themselves to have quality time with their loved one's. For instance, Study of Unites States, shows that people who watch movies in a cinema tend to be more extrovert in nature, friendly than people who watch the same move at their own homes. Thus, people who like to watch film in theatre outside, enjoy the time to the fullest and be more expressive  while bonding over relationships with others.",
        "On the other hand, some people argue that seeing movies in their phones or tablets is more enjoyable. People say that by watching films on phone is more convenient as they can move and adjust the device as per their own preference. Furthermore, they assert that this also saves their additional expenses and valuable time. To illustrate, if a person watches a movie in their own pocket device, he or she does not have to additional expense of watching movie in big screen, pay for their snacks and pay for traveling expense. However, experts suggests that when people watch a film in their phone they do not enjoy as much as people watching in a cinema theatre. These people appear to be more introvert and not expressive as others.",
        "To conclude, I believe that watching film in their phone limits an individual at sampe pace with little or no learning and growing as per the terms of society. If people would watch movie in cinema theatres then they would be more enjoyable rather than enjoying alone, this would likely leader stronger relationship with others and overall growth of person as an individual as well as an increased national economic prosperity."
