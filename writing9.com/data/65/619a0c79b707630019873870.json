        "Recent years has witnessed tremendous growth due to technological advancement. This has led to a huge generation gap between the young and the older generations. People born before the technological era face difficulties to keep up with the latest techniques moreover, their past experience is becoming obsolete faster. While some believe that even after this great revolution of technology, young and aspiring adults should still rely on the methods followed by past generations as it is more reliable and experienced, others argue, that challenging this old point of view is a must. In my opinion, there is a risk of not achieving new results if we stick to the old methods hence, it is absolutely necessary for innovation to try something new and test some old ideas which have been followed blindly.",
        "To begin with, Every invention was created with an idea that was beyond the traditional concept. while  it is undeniable that old concepts lay as the background for all new ideas however, it is required to challenge some old concepts to invent something new. For Example, After vehicles were invented, it was considered the fastest mode of transport for several years, until airplanes were created. The idea of travelling through the sky which is a common means of transportation now, was hugely criticized and deemed impossible back then.",
        "Although, Challenging an outdated idea is healthy for growth, it is important to understand the concept beforehand. Since, these methods are developed over a long period of time, they can be beneficial if followed to a certain degree. For Instance, In the field of medicine, though advancements have led to finding cures for most ailments, traditional medicines are still considered natural and healthy.",
        "To conclude, Though I firmly believe that it is necessary to break the old barriers and find new techniques for growth, it is also much important to keep in mind some old experienced methods laid by our forefathers."
