        "It is thought by some that teachers should not give school children homework. Nevertheless, it is my belief that homework is useful to educate children.",
        "On the one hand, it is understandable why some people believe homework should be eliminated. For one, the school day is already long enough for children because it lasts about 8 to 10 hours a day. Therefore, children may feel tired and overwhelmed if they have to do any homework when they return home. Another reason is that children need time to play rather than spend an enormous of time to do homework. Many researches have shown the importance of play to the children\u2019s brain development and the diagnosis of disorders such as autism.",
        "On the other hand, I would maintain that homework has an integral role to play in the schooling of children. It must be recognised that homework has a beneficial influence on the education of children. This is because exercises can fill the knowledge and skill gaps of students as they can deepen their understanding of theories and concepts which they have learnt at school on their own. For instance, by doing mathematics exercises, students can continuously assess their levels, which is shown to be a key of excellent academic performance.",
        "In conclusion, while it is true that homework can sometimes bring with it several disadvantages, I believe that it has a more important role. It is therefore advisable that people should take into account ideas about play-based learning to reach the comprehensive education of children."
