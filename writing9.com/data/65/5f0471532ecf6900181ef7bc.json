        "Environmental problems either at the local level or at the global scale require massive support from the governments over the world. It is argued that the government should lessen its spending in local environmental issues and allot more funding towards more urgent and threatening issues such as global warming. Personally, I disagree with this argument.",
        "To begin with, all the major environmental concerns today have evolved from pollution created at the local scale. Actually, global warming is the result of greenhouse gases, which is emitted to the atmosphere day by day. For instant, an increasing number of personally-owned vehicles in the world are one of the primary factors that lead to the increasing of greenhouse gases in the air, and thus the global warming, which need immediate attention from the administration. In some countries, governments are making some vital strides in this regard, such as encouraging public transportation usage by designate benefits for people who use public transportation only like free bus tickets for elderly people using buses.",
        "Furthermore, most of the countries in the world are also accelerating global warming through deforestation. Forests are considered as the lung of the earth, which absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen to the atmosphere. This procedure not only keeps the air clean but also regulates the earth surface temperature. People of some developing countries are clear-cutting their forests in order to maintain their life. Luckily, governments in these countries have started to realize the impact of deforestation and now they are working on protecting the forests and start reforestation activities.",
        "In conclusion, in my viewpoint, it is better to focus on dealing with local ecological issues first then problems like global warming can be easier to tackle with by the improvement of the environment in each country."
