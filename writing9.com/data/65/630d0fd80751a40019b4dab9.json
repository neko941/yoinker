        "Today's world depends on social media websites as a tool of communication such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram instead of face-to-face methods. Certainly, this can be easier for connecting together and may consider a benefit, but this way of communication has serious harms. In this essay, I will demonstrate the advantages and disadvantages, while explaining why I think that the drawbacks outweigh the benefits.",
        "Nowadays, there are a lot of advantages to using social communication, which makes it easy to use. One of the advantages is its nominal price. It doesn't cost you so much to call your loved one at any time you want. Furthermore, it makes us keep in touch with each other easily. For this reason, it can keep our relationships strong, even if we are living in different countries. For instance, I call my friend every day who lives abroad in the USA, while I live in Egypt. So, no one can deny that social media makes the connection more available.",
        "On the other hand, it has dangerous disadvantages. The most threatening one is that it tricks us with a pseudo connection. We think that we are in a real relationship when using these applications, but we live in an illusion. We think we express our ideas well and confidently, while we lose the sense of real scenarios. For example, it's now considered a disease if you addict the using these apps.",
        "In my opinion, the disadvantages of using social media as a communication method outweigh the advantages because of its threatening effect on us.",
        "To sum up, we replaced face-to-face communication with using social media apps in this century. To be honest, it has many advantages but it affects in a bad manner. I think that its drawbacks are greater than its benefits because it may confuse the person to be not able to differentiate between real life and illusion one."
