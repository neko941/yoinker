        "On the other hand,In the field of  social ,media  technology contributes detrimental effects on people. Most , teenagers,They are all addicted to  online apps. Approximately 90% of  youths spend  more time on these online media. Because of that  ,they lose their social skills  which they even don't know about their society and even also they do not have contact with their family also. For Instance,In this century,  we cannot see any children play with their friends outside.Everyone kept inside and watched those internet activities. This led to the new generations being introverts.",
