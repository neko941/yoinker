        "Learning the difference between right and wrong for children at an early age is a fundamental skill. Punishment can be a way to teach them to be better generations in the future. I completely agree with this idea.",
        "To begin with, the young one has no idea about what is good or bad manner. Both nice and bad concept can only be labelled when there is any further actions following the activity that they have done. Thus, they need assistance from adults to make it clear. If parents have never punished their kids, how can kids\u2019 behaviour be built. For example, a child pushes her friend in the playground while they are playing together, and her parents who are watching it prefer to do nothing. This can cause her to do the same thing again in the future and might impact her ending up with no friends.",
        "On the other hand, kids need control of their life. Control can be made by giving an appropriate sanction for their bad actions. For instance, a toddler refuses to eat his dinner and prefers to throw it on the ground. To deal with this attitude, giving their limited time on their favourite gadget can be a good solution as consequence. Moreover, He has learned that what has done with his food is unacceptable and the possibility to repeat the same habit is lower.",
        "In conclusion, I believe that giving appropiate punishment is the right tool to help children building their personality. However, the punishment should not include any physical actions."
