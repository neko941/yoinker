        "It is believed by some that over the years books are getting more and more unpopular as a source of entertainment and information. This essay will discuss why books are losing importance as a source of information and entertainment.",
        "On the one hand, books are a good source of information, since the books are written by professionals. Furthermore, the explanations in books are more detailed than on the internet, because the people who wrote an article on the internet are not a professional. The internet is not a reliable source of information because as I have said, it is not written by professionals, and it also often contain false information. In addition to that, books are also a good source of entertainment for people who enjoy reading. then, why are books losing their importance as a source for both, information and entertainment?",
        "On the other hand, some people believe books are losing their importance because of the advent of the internet. Right now, people often search for information on the internet since the internet provides more information and is also a lot simpler than books. For instance, students often use internet to help them understand the lesson or to help them do their homework. This is because if people want to search for something using the internet, they just need to type what they are looking for and there will be a bunch of websites that contains the information they are looking for. Moreover, the internet can also entertain people. For example, people can watch videos on YouTube, scroll through Instagram, and tweeting things on twitter. Furthermore, people can also communicate with others through direct message or Whatsapp",
        "In conclusion, books are a reliable and trusted source of information despite the fact that it is loosing its influence."
