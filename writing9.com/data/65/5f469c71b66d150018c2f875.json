        "A majority of people are apparently of the opinion that hard diet and the extreme exercise in a short period of time may help to meet the fitness goals. However, perhaps, regular moderate exercise and healthy eating style might achieve the result slow but sustain it forever. I have given my both views as follows.",
        "Our body is very flexible and can me made in shape in a short time because of diet habits and choices of workout. However, such practices may show the result very fast and last for momentary. The individual might see the results such as weight loss or removing fat on body immediately, but It can harm the body in another way. The sudden drop in diet or heavy workout or exercise may damage the body cell and reduce the body immune's system. For instance, as per research conducted by university of India, more than 50% of people noticed the adverse effects on body due to excessive workout and active diet.",
        "On the other hand, It is undeniable that moderate exercise and healthy eating style definitely support the body on long term. In other words, the body will get some time to recover the cells and slowly but efficiently adopt in a stepwise manner. Besides, the combinations of healthy food and moderate exercise will improve the stamina and protection against the virus. To illustrate, As per an article published in 'The Times' reveals that those who follow the simple diet plan and medium level of workout have found healthier than others. In fact, they do not find any detrimental effects on body during long term as well.",
        "In a nutshell, It is evident from the above discussion that short term solution is favourable be if someone want to keep the body healthy forever, those who need their frame to be fit and shape, they should follow the approach of long term solution with moderate exercise a healthy diet."
