        "The enormous number of people living in urban areas has been increasing in last years.  With this boost of the population, many problems have arisen. In this essay, I am going to discuss some these problems and propose some solutions.",
        "The major problem is the increasing of homeless people. The overpopulation makes house prices going up so fast that incomes cannot follow. Hence, the high competitiveness makes people accept fewer salaries. Moreover, without a limit on these prices, many cities can reach a collapse about the number of people living in the same geographic area. Furthermore, to tackle this, politicians could make acts that limit prices and also it would offer opportunity of more people can afford for a house.",
        "Another problem is the production of trash in big cities in large scale which frequently brings consequences such as an increasing in land pollution. For instance, many streets in S\u00e3o Paulo \u2013 Brazil have tons of rubbish which offering risk to the citizens whom live around that area in terms of health. In addition, to solve this issue, the government must invest more in cleaning department and also develop new policy to make people aware how harmful it is to their own health discharge rest of foods and trash on the streets. Besides, more institutions can join to environmentally friendly program and make the globe more cleanly as well.",
        "To conclude, the overpopulation is a huge issue to catch attention and all these problems mentioned before creating a cycle that has no ending and no beginning. Thus, to break this cycle in order to overcome all of it, politicians and individuals will need to work together."
