        "There is a growing trend in parents sending their children to boarding schools in Asia, notably in China. Nowadays, parents prefer boarding school over government school as there are many benefits that can be enjoyed by their children when they enrol.",
        "There are many reasons why parents choose to place their children in boarding schools. The main reason is parents are too busy working to provide a better lifestyle for their children. Thus, they have no time to send their children to school and make them breakfast. Moreover, after a hard day of work parents are too tired to teach their children let alone ask their children about their day. Due to this reason, parents opt to send their children to boarding school.",
        "From my perspective, boarding schools can have a positive impact on their children. When children go to boarding school, they learned to take care of themselves, do their own laundry and even make their own beds. This gives them a sense of independence and individuality.",
        "Additionally, boarding school is good for children\u2019s social and emotional well-being. This is because they have the same circle of friends. Thus, they are able to share their experience, ideas and ambitions together. This sort of social exposure at a young age enables children to improve their communication and collaboration skills with their friends, teachers and parents alike.",
        "In conclusion, boarding schools can be a safe haven and provide a positive learning atmosphere for children when it is governed in the right manner."
