        "In recent decades, many governments have spent money on art preservation, such as wall arts and music, while some people say governments should spend money on improving public services instead. Hence, this essay will discuss why this essay strongly agrees with this statement.",
        "On the one hand, the governments can manage some amount of funds for art preservation but they provide a lot of money for this. Although art preservation is necessary, there are many things that are more important than investment in the arts in many developing countries, such as public transportation and education. For example, in Bangkok city which is one of the worst traffic in the world, the government invests big money on art wall preservation in many temples while Thai people are suffering from stuck on the roads. Moreover, many underprivileged children in Thailand still need education. It would be better, if the government spent money on improving the education system. On top of that, investment in public services in developing countries affects  the economy in countries greatly.",
        "On the other hand, many artworks are disappearing, such as the arts on clothes. For instance, some villages in Thailand have a unique clothe style, people in villages transfer knowledge about how to make clothes to the next generation. Unfortunately, there are fewer clothing makers because they can not make much money from those clothes. Therefore, the government has established a department about art preservation. This department is responsible for promoting  artwork products and funding.",
        "In conclusion, This essay totally agrees that governments should invest in public services, such as public transportation, because many developing countries need citizens to be well-being for economic development."
