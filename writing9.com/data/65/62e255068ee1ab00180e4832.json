Anyway, I'm writing to inform you that my 18th birthday will be on October 30th, three weeks from now. I'm inviting you to come on that special day as we've been friends for almost 3 years. Some of my relatives and friends will also be there but I assure you that the guests will be limited, as we're still in pandemic. You've been great at lending me your ears when I have problems I can't tell to my parents and friends and you're guidance really help me through it. That's why I will appreciate it if you can come. After the party, you can spend the night here at my house as I'm sure it will end late at night. I can ask my parents for permission, I'm sure they will agree. If you need transportation to reach this place, just let me know.",
