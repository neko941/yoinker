        "High level of sugar contains food and beverages can cause so many health problems , today so many manufactured product contain dangerous level of sugars . some people believe that kind of food should be more pricey because that can encourage humans to buy less sugary product . In my personal opinion,  I completely agree with this statement.",
        "Firstly, medical bills can be more expensive, so it is ok to increase prices of sugary foods. For example, in Sri Lanka diabetic tablet prices are very high one tablet price is nearly rupees to 350 . So many people cannot afford that kind of prices.  it can be really helpful if companies can increase the prices of that items , because of prices people going to reduce the purchase of particular things. However less purchase means less consumption. That lead to minimize cause of health problems. So, this can gives you extra benefit, which are you can save money or you can invest that money for something else .",
        "secondly , rise prices of sugar products makes people go for healthy and the natural products . since people careful about their expenses, it makes them buy less expensive products. Moreover people can go for the substitute . For instance, there are so many sweets, that do not contain sugar , like ice cream, chocolate and beverages . they are use substitute for sugar. thus , people can easily being healthy while eating sweet things.",
        "In conclusion, people suffer from health problems that cause sugars , so you can use healthy product instead and you can save your medical expenses following these things."
