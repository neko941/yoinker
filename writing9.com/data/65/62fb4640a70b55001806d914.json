        "Progress is the main booster of a country\u2019s development. Therefore, various controversies have emerged as to whether the economy or others should be put in the first place. From my perspective, economic progress shares as much importance as other types of progress. In this essay, I will depict both aspects and elaborate on my personal opinion.",
        "Economy progress is a fundamental booster of national power.  a such booster can both brings material wealth to its people and consolidates  national security as well. Israel, amid threats from its Arabic neighbours, has successfully reformed its main industrial component from agriculture to high-tech innovator. On top of that, the nation gains countless wealth which not only improved the living condition of its citizen but also prevented itself from being invaded by others.",
        "On the other hand, other types of progress, such as education reform or welfare system establishment, are also as much vital as their economic counterpart. Admittedly, money is the promoter of various kinds of improvement; however, those improvements will later shape our offspring into  suitable heirs to inherit  affluence from the elders. For instance, northern European countries, such as Denmark, Finland, and Sweden, are well known for their society organising which well cultivates the youth and preserves exceptional environmental conditions for the further generation.",
        "By way of conclusion, progress is equally important from one to another, regardless of type. While the economy supports human activities, other sorts of progress are also backing our prosperity as well. Therefore, authorities should focus on every domain instead of merely on one."
