        "These days health education plays a very big vital role in the community health in any part of the country in our modern society. I strongly agree with this statement as with health education many individuals will know how to care for their own personal hygiene as well as the basic knowledge of taking care of themselves if they fall sick.",
        "With this specific type of education being put in place in the community health, people will firstly, know how to care for their own personal hygiene such as taking a shower daily, washing their hands before every meal. As these are the few common reasons that contribute to poor health in the rural areas of some countries. Furthermore, with this knowledge being in place, the community will then know how to better take care of themselves in which will lead to a lower number of people falling sick or dying due to common illness.",
        "Secondly, the public will have the basic knowledge of which medicine to eat when they are ill. For instance,normal flu or headache can be simply cured by taking painkillers. Furthermore, with this ,teaching the public can go to the nearest clinic or polyclinic to visit a doctor for the common illness instead of going to the emergency ward at the hospital which is intended for serious cases.",
        "To conclude, health education is an important element in the community health. With this, health education must be enforced strongly in the rural parts of the country as many people will better know how to take care of themselves and not fall sick easily."
