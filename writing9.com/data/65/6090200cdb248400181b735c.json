        "For centuries history has been an integral part of the core curriculum in post-secondary educational institutions as it is synonymous with studying and analysing past events,inventions and cultural heritage,also stories of the nation's heroic events of great men. Many people think that learning history is important. However, others argue that it is waste of time. In my further writing, I will discuss both the views and shall delve into my opinion before reaching  a logical conclusion.",
        "To initiate with, the past plays a significant role in every individual's life. One will come to know about the ancient culture as a result will able to recognize the people who had given their lives for us. In addition to this, the past tells us the mistakes that happened in the past.Thus, people will not repeat the mistakes which had done in the bygone era. Therefore, can able to make  decisions correctly and confidently. For instance, nowadays if we talk about the political parties they are aware of the past history and working according to it.",
        "On the flip side, there are a lot of communities that consider history as a wastage of time. Many people think that history should not be taught in  schools since students are very much engrossed in other subjects. For example, this is the era of competition where everyone is running behind jobs but no one wants to gain knowledge. Therefore,they start preparing their respective goals from school time only,thus they do not want to waste their time on some other subject.",
        "According to my perception, history plays a vital role nowadays. One should learn  history whether in school or in college because it teaches us in many ways. One can collect a plethora of knowledge by learning history and we should not consider it as a wastage as it will definitely help us in the future.",
        "In conclusion, although everyone has a different perception of history  it benefits us in many strata of life. We can gain knowledge from  past events owing to the solution of many upcoming problems."
