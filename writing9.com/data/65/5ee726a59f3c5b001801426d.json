        "Technology is advancing day by day. Every aspect of our lives is related to technology. However, there are advantages and disadvantages when it comes to technology.",
        "Advantages, for example, technologies such as social networking namely Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram make people feel connected regardless of geographical location. People can share their stories with their friends online which keeps them in the loop and eliminate the fells of distance. There are apps like Tinder which lets one person talk to another with the same interests and date them when they feel a connection. There are tons of people who found their soul mate via dating apps. Automation really brings people close. Automation virtually shrinks the earth to the size of a small village because everything is connected. When strange things happen on the other side of the earth, people from the opposite side are mostly going to know because of the Internet. It is undoubtful that technologies bring us close. However",
        "However, there may be certain situations where technologies make people more distant from one another. It is like everything in our lives. Too much of something is going to become a disadvantage. When people are too attached to technology like social networking, they tend to avoid real human interaction. When people are too addicted to messaging, they do not want calls even from their loved ones. They would wake up from the bed and the first thing they are going to do is check their Facebook notifications.",
        "In my humble opinion, automation it does no harm. It is the people that use the automation in their own way. The obsession is the real harm that poses a threat to the person, not the other way around. If modern automation is used enough, people will become more sociable and if modern automation is abusively used, people will become less sociable."
