        "I am writing this letter to express my dissatisfaction with the public transportation in our district \u201cGawler\u201d.",
        "First problem is that only two buses depart from the station at 7AM which is a peak hour when most employees have to go to their workplaces. In addition, because of the works running on the main road the buses have been late during this week and they have not followed the scheduled program.",
        "Therefore; most employees could not use the buses because they are extremely crowded or they have been forced to wait in the stations for a long time. This negatively affected all the area residents and they are disappointed by being late in their work or being forced to use their private cars which is much more expensive than the buses.",
        "It would be great if more buses are put in use in the area and if the buses are directed to use another road until the works end so that they can arrive to the destination stations on time.",
        "I look forward to hearing from you.",
