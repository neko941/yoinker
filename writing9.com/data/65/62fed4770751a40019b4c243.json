        "It is a universally accepted fact that wild animal inhabitants have been threatened and reduced over the past years. This essay will discuss the causes and effects of a reduction in wildlife animals including a logical solution for animal conservation.",
        "A number of factors may account for decreasing wild animals' growth rate, but one main cause is the process of human civilizations. To accommodate and feed our world's population, we exploit and destroy every last square meter of land which is mostly used by other species on earth. For example, the destruction of rainforests in African countries has made imbalance effect on the earth\u2019s climate as animals absorb oxygen and produce carbon dioxide to stabilize their natural habitats.",
        "Another reason is keeping these animals in confined small places to protect them against  food availability bad weather and predators is a prime cause of the growth rate reduction. Although keeping these animals in the zoo is safe and costly as it demands a lot of investment, they would not be able to breathe and get fresh air when we isolate them from their natural habitats, resulting in the extinction of a species.",
        "To solve this problem we must put endless efforts to conserve the animal population on the earth planet. It is hard to imagine our world without animals. Therefore, we should spend huge investments to keep these creatures in their natural habitats. We should also avoid using harmful chemicals in the environment which may turn hazardous to other species on earth. Governments should charge penalties against those who get involved in the extinction of endangered species.",
        "To conclude, while, the biological diversity of animals has been affected due to human activities to accommodate the wild population, we must spend some resources to preserve animals and create harmony on our planet."
