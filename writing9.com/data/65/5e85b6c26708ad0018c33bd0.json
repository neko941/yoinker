Though, guardians send them to international schools where the weight of the school bag is heavier than kids even after school there are private tuition, though they don't have enough time to bloom their hidden talents and pursue their hobbies on weekends and that led them to stress.",
        "Some kids addicted to western culture by putting traditional culture beside and try to apply in their lives. For an instance, if they influence by electronic gadget they want their parents to purchase it at any cost either is required or not and if they unable to provide, they get an unnecessary load even some time and that makes them rebel against the rule laid by elders.",
