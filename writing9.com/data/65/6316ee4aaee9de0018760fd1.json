        "Nowadays, the demand for suitable news sources has been seriously focused on. One school of thoughts opines that the optimal way to catch people up on the lastest news is through printed newspapers whilst others select media-based outlets as their best choice to acknowledge the news. This essay will disscuss both views and give out my opinion.",
        "On the one hand, the number of people counting on  newspapers may be due to its high authenticity. Firstly, prestige and reputation are the critical factors of publishers and printers, so they must ensure that before their publication, the contents must be checked, edited, cencored thoroughly.  Furthermore, news from newspapers is well-written by professional journalists and reseachers with years of experience, much more reliable than the other unofficial sourses with amateur writters. And secondly, as newspapers have been introduced for a long while, they become an indispensable part of people\u2019s day-to-day reading habit, chiefly among the senior citzens. Looking up to our perceding generations, like our gandparents, we can easily recognize they stored tons of newspapers at home.",
        "On the other hand, there are also reasons for the people rely on social media-based outlet to receive news. This method became ubiquitous with the widespread presence of the internet. With its speed, people with portable devices like smart phones, laptops can acess the news storage nearly imediately through different platforms at anytime, anywhere with just a few clicks. Neverthless, it sparks concerns when, news via social media is mostly uncertificated; plus its tremendous spreading speed, thereby creating serious controversy. For instance, last year, a fanpage established news titled: Billie Eilish commited suicid, consiquently, it became a hot news and left a detrimental impact on the singer\u2019s mental life.",
        "In conclusion, despite all the advantages and disadvantages of the two mentioned methods. I firmly believe that receiving news online is the better way."
