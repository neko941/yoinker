        "Talking about the technology development nowadays really affecting many sides of our life which also develop and change as time goes by. For instance a thing that we usually do on a daily basis  is read books or newspapers. Seeing that phenomenon I agree if we go over the years in the future and even right now we will change our ways, in particular reading books or newspapers in an online form.",
        "News information and also books that are provided on the internet or  online way really help us in many ways, as an example there is a service for book subscriptions or  easy access for people  online, in line with nowadays people's schedules and also business that will shorten our time on taking books or newspapers also make it more effective and efficient. In between our time at work or when we have a little free time in the morning, we can directly open through our smartphones anywhere and anytime without having to bring the printed one or bring it in physically. Other than that, because of the wide access on the internet to the news, we have so many sources to read information so we can choose which is more accurate and valid. Moreover, the speed of information dissemination recently is faster, so we can get more writing up to date.",
        "Furthermore, discuss  books, right now there are lots of platforms that we can subscribe to so we can read not just one book only. This means that we don't have to pay for that particular book as before. But now we can choose whether we will buy books just for each of them or directly make a subscription because it will be more efficient where we can pay for example in one month and we are free to choose which books we will read according to our individual preferences.",
        "In contrast, there are also many contradictory things that occur including the supply of books and newspapers that we can find on the internet, many websites give you access to download books illegally and this is a disadvantage to the author of the book or the owner where we should pay as author credits.",
        "To sum up, this topic is one of the positive impacts of technology, it gives us the facility and easiness to read books or get news information. Even consequently, there will be the negative side to it as we mentioned before that there will always be  illegal access to get it. It is our responsibility to do so."
