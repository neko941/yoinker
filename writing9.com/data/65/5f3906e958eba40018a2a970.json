Some people argue that these experiments should be banned because it is morally wrong to cause animals to suffer, while others are in favor of them because of other benefits to humanity. Discuss both views and give your opinion.",

        "There has been a heated debate on animal exploitation in laboratories. Some people are opposed to it for moral reasons, while supporters think that human take advantage of those studies.",
        "It is true that these days, due to the growing demand for medical treatments and beauty products, animals are increasingly used as guinea pigs to test efficiency and safety. For example, new vaccines to treat diseases are pricked on mice, or some cosmetics brands do experiments on rabbits. On the one hand, there is mounting evidence that animal research has benefited human beings. This can be named as experiments on cows which were instrumental in developing the vaccine that eliminated smallpox, or dogs were helpful in the discovery of insulin to cure diabetes. Therefore, experimentation on animals has saved thousands of lives.",
        "On the other hand, torturing and exploiting innocent animals to is wrong on principle. Mice are born vulnerable to radiation, the high exposure to which may kill them. More advanced mammals, such as monkeys and apes, share the same complex nervous systems like us, so they can suffer from pain and fear. Our animal cousins do nothing harm to us, but it is human who are the culprit to deaths and extinction of species for economic and medical gain. Instead of such cruelty, scientists can conduct research with more humane and effective alternatives.  They can replace live animals with tissue and cell cultures that are grown from their stem cells or single cells. Due to the advent of technology, computer simulations are also highly recommended.",
        "In conclusion, I would believe that it is time we stopped our use of animals in tests despite the merits offered to human beings."
