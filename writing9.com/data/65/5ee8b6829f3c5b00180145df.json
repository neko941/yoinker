        "Unfortunately many university students have to choose a different career path.The reasons for the same are mainly due to imbalances in the job sector.In my view, proper planning by the government can bring the situation under control.",
        "Crucial factors contributing for not finding a job in chosen profession are lack of availability and pay disparity. In many countries, jobs available and university offering courses are not aligned properly. For instance, an excerpt from the Stanford mentioned that half of the graduates from United Kingdom have pursued business and one in every three graduates from India is an engineer. This is forcing them to shift to a new industry for a living. Also, salary differences in some of the industries is also leading to change their profession. For example, scientists in many developing countries are paid often very less where they do not have any option but to quit and continue in a different domain.",
        "This inequality can be mitigated by careful planning at individual and government level. Governments should understand how the market is shaping up, focus on increasing the corresponding skill set. Also, ensuring there is a correlation between the no of graduates and the employees for a particular industry. For example, Vietnam focused on improving industrial skills as they knew many industries will be set up because of its economic policies. This helped immensely for the students and resulted in double digit economic growth. Although planning from the congress is required, one must understand the trends at individual level for a better future.",
        "To conclude, many graduates are ending up in a different profession than they wished for, because of the inequalities between the courses offered and industry prevalent. Countries should predict the market trends and focus on providing the necessary skill set for its graduates."
