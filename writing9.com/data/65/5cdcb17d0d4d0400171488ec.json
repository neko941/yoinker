        "The majority of the pupils are striving for higher qualifications. It is often argued that, the sole purpose of university education is to pursue a good post whilst, other disagree, and think that, having a professional degree is beneficial to  both individual and society. I strongly concur with the notion that, the university helps in individual  and collective well being.8",
        "On one hand, people believe that, getting higher education is the key to secure the best position. Because we are surviving in a competitive world, where competency of  a person is judged on the basis of his degree rather than other qualities. However, I  disagree with this opinion as, certainty to get a particular service  not only depends upon knowledge, but also require technical skill  and good previous experience in the specific field. For instance, a company dealing with information and technology will prefer to enroll a candidate, who had been working in the same field for long time, rather than a person who had recently got graduated.",
        "",
        "On the other hand, some argue that, having a graduation degree contribute to personal and social welfare. I too agree with this, firstly, in big institutes one have to interact  with so many different personalities, in addition, they have to overcome various  challenges  like  financial and educational stresses which give him an opportunity to grow as  a person. Such a groomed individual in turn  serves the nation and elevates the economy of the country. For example, India is well known for the best hepatic surgeons, all over the Asia, hence, people across the countries, visit them for the liver surgeries and transplant, in this way they earn individually  and also add a lot to the country\u2019s reserves.",
        "In conclusion, higher education not solely aim for perfect job opportunities, while, it is too helpful for people and country in order to built finances"
