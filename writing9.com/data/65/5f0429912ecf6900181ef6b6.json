        "As is the belief of most, happiness is the most important aspect of existence, and money is the cornerstone of being happy. Nevertheless, it is my opinion that while money does have the power to purchase convenience, true happiness can never be attained with monetary prowess alone. This essay will discuss the long-debated relationship of happiness with money.",
        "Money serves as an end to our means. So, being monetarily stable ensures that one can afford the various comforts and conveniences that comes along with it, thus contributing to overall satisfaction in the long run. Riches also provides security, which in turn eradicates fear and instability. To reinstate my point, owning a car is much more convenient and comfortable than relying on public transport alone, which can only be possible with an individual being financially stable. Hence, money can purchase convenience, which provides an illusion of happiness.",
        "However, not all happiness can be attributed to one\u2019s monetary status. The core human aspects of happiness such as love, peace and contentment cannot be attained solely with the act of cash changing hands. Research by the WHO stated that undiluted happiness is more commonly associated with children who still have not yet grasped the concept of money, as compared to the general public who devote their lives trying to decipher the quantity of money which shall be enough to make one happy. So, money is an end to our means and not the destination.",
        "In conclusion, while money can create the illusion of being happy, true happiness cannot be forged with the power of the currency alone. Despite the general perception of money being the base on which happiness is built, I opine that monetary might can never deliver the more humane and finer aspects which gives birth of real happiness."
