        "Getting a job as a fresh graduate may sometimes be difficult. While some people think that an academy diploma is the key to landing their dream career, others insist on getting real-world experience instead. This essay will explain both positions and prove that a degree is a crucial aspect in the process of getting a good job.",
        "There has always been an opinion that teenagers after graduating from high school, most likely do not know what profession to choose, and therefore, many of them do not want to waste their time and money on a diploma that might not work out well in long perspective.  Work experience can quickly leverage the abilities of one and give a kick-start for a better career. Moreover, starting to work earlier means being ahead of other people of your own age. For instance, in the past 5 years IT field hired 23% more applicants compared to 2010-2015 years with no degree but some prior experience, which gives some young professional advantage over those who choose education.",
        "On the other side, university program gives better understanding of how the system works. Throughout the years, higher education turns a teenager to a real professional. Not only does it provide them with essential knowledge, but it also gives them a lot of networking opportunities and develops problem-solving skills. A connection that is established in the university are most likely to boost one's career. Besides, dozens of jobs require a proper understanding of the topic that cannot be acquired through working right after school. That would be anything related to medicine, law, engineering and science. For example, rocket science, which is usually addressed as one of the hardest jobs, requires at least 6 years of education before one could start a career.",
        "In my opinion, the work experience without a degree can only work in certain cases when the person is talented, has a strict plan and willingness to work hard. Nevertheless, it is very rare that one can get a high paid job without a university degree, but with the experience for the position that does not require any knowledge prior to start.",
        "To conclude, while getting your foot in the industry right after school can be time and money saving, I strongly agree with the idea of getting diploma first as it prepares students for the real world\u2019s jobs, gives the comprehensive knowledge base and useful connections."
