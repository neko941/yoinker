        "It is believed by some that the government funds should be utilized to develop an interest in the sports among the students going to schools and colleges, whereas others think that it should be spent on preserving the cultural art and professional sports. However in my own perspective, the budget should be used with a plan to develop sport as a hobby for youngsters, and to generate the revenue from the art and professional sports events.",
        "On the one hand, the subject of the physical activity must be included in the school curriculum in the growing world of science and technology. It has numerous benefits in terms of developing a strong mental and physical health. For instance, the sedentary lifestyle of watching television and playing video games majority of times along with consuming the highly palatable, fast foods has raised the prevalence of obesity among students. Hence, these sports are required to lose the extra kilos and maintain a healthy weight and body. Moreover, the team sports help to inculcate the qualities of team spirit, interdependency and communication skills. Therefore, this expenditure will support the community by making a healthy nation.",
        "On the other hand, the globalization, modernization and digitization have diverted the minds of the public from the cultural and sport events towards the social media applications. Thus, the government should make efforts to preserve the various arts, museums, monuments and sport events by providing them an adequate amount of funding. This in turn will help the country in creating the jobs, generating the profits from the tourists, preserving the tradition and culture for the next generation, and further boosting the economy.",
        "To recapitulate, I opine that the well planned measures should be taken by the government to maintain the art and sports in both the young and adult population."
