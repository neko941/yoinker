        "Nowadays, an increasing number of people are concerned about the finance issue after they retire. However, whether they should save money by themselves or receive assistance from the government is a controversial issue. This essay will discuss both sides and my view is that a financial-independent person will bring more merits.",
        "It is clear that authority plays an important role in allocating resources to improve their national security and the general welfare of its people. A disturbing fact is that there are a lot of older citizens who unable to work to earn a living out there, some of them even do not have their own children to rely on. So, the government should give their top priority to assuring high-quality life for especially the elderly. However, a strong rising of the old-age dependency ratio year by year seems to be a great burden on the government efforts of improving the quality of life. If each person can save money on their own, the government could spend these expenses to solve other problems like reducing the unemployment rate or tackle environmental issues and so on.",
        "Besides, it is undeniable that the older generation today have rich knowledge and gain many practical experiences through their career, hence, they have self-awareness enough to prevent themselves from becoming a social burden as they are afraid of being an unworthy person when they get old. Although each family member should take care and provide basic needs for the elder people, it would be unethical for the old to rely totally on them. So they tend to save a certain amount of money from their monthly income in their early period of a career in order to avoid dependency on others and enjoy their old age.",
        "In conclusion, despite governments should hold the duties of providing its citizens with efficient subsidies, I believe that people should prepare for their living expenses when they get older rather than expect from government grants."
