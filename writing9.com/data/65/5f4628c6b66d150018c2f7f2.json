        "Recently, there is a tendency for men playing a major role in households whereas women paying more attention to their career paths. This phenomenon could be explained in several reasons and I completely agree that it is a positive development.",
        "The changes in roles played by female and male are caused by various reasons. Firstly, the contemporary society promotes the idea of gender equality instead of distinguishing women and men in a traditional way. Therefore, women are encouraged to continue their careers after the marriage by this novel idea because they have the right to make a choice of being a housewife or still working, just like what men do. Secondly, a relatively large number of women receives high education and performs quite well in different fields, such as medical care, children education, and even engineering area. This means that they also have the ability to work as perfectly as men so as to support their family.",
        "Imperatively, this adjustment described above should be seen as progress. Fathers especially those prefer staying at home to take care of their children are willing to embrace this new trend while mothers who are ambitious in workforce are given more time and energy due to the help from fathers. Therefore, a balanced and harmonious family is formed which also provides a stable environment for children to grow up. In addition, responsibilities in a family can be distributed reasonably in this way because the particular roles for parents are broken, thus couples make a decision on their jobs depending on their personalities or strengths.",
        "To sum up, the adjusting responsibilities in a family are affected by a lot of reasons, and gender equality is the most significant factor. This trend has positive effects in different areas which not only gives more opportunities for people to choose their suitable way of living but also benefits children due to a happy family."
