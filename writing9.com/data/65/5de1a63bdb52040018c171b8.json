I joined this company as a fresher and leaving as a fully confident Network Engineer thanks to the support of the colleagues of this workplace. I have taken this decision due to my future plans, not because of any dissatisfaction with my current work situation.",

That is the reason for my early resignation.\u00a0My plan is to find a employemnt oppertunity in the similar field in Canada as well. Therefore, I have included you as a refree in my resume. I know that you will put a good word for me if you were asked.",
