        "Whilst, some mankinds think that cross media Facebook, Instagram and other applications have had a vast adverse effect on both humanity and local communities. However, in my opinion, it is beneficial for people as well as union but it damages the relationship. I would discuss both views in the following paragraphs.",
        "To begin with, there are myriad reasons, why I am claimed that social networking has beneficial for people. The first and an important reason, it has easy to communicate with each other. For example, if a person lives far away from his family then he can easily connect with his family with the help of social mobile. It is cheaper. Moreover, it has reduced the distance; time is saved. Thus, everyone can easily connect with one another owing to these website; and make more friends.",
        "Contrary above to the statement, it has some negative effect on individuals and club. Many people make fake news on these websites, after that they viral it; sometimes it creates great issues in mankind's life, which is dangerous for some individuals. Furthermore, these days, most of people spend their time on these social communication; they waste their precious time and they procrastination their work day by day. For this reason, they do not achieve their goal easily. In addition, individuals do not take participate in any local activity; during this purpose relationship is less since people do not meet each other face to face.",
        "In the conclusion, it has both positive and uncooperative effect humanity and group. Social networking website have beneficial of humankinds and local communities such as easy to communication, time saved. But it has also negative influence it damages the relationship among people."
