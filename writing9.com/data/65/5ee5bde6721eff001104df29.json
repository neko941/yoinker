        "The question on whether to spend the public funds on removing the reason behind the crime or punishing the criminal for the unlawful act has always been debatable. There are valid arguments for both the sides, however in my view, the sincere efforts should be done to treat the cause of the government and the society in order to decline the crime rate.",
        "On the one hand, the government should work to control the various factors such as poverty, unemployment, drug abuse, and low education level predisposing the people to plot the offences. For example, free education services provided by schools and colleges will help to learn basic vocational services and grab a decent job. Additionally, the steps should be taken to generate job vacancies, and companies should be given some tax rebate those are creating the work opportunities. Hence, both education and employment will help to empower the poverty and subsequently raise the standard of living. In addition to it, alcohol abuse and illicit drug use are the major reasons in committing criminal activities such as robbery, rape and murder due to their disturbed decision making abilities. In such scenarios, these individuals should be made to join rehabilitation program in helping them to become sober.",
        "On the other hand, the persons who are punished should be given the rehabilitation therapy to improve their mental health and resolve their psychological issues so that they do not plot another illegal act after releasing from the jail. In addition to it, the government should help them in finding a job which will give them a sense of security in their life and this will further decline the crime rate.",
        "To recapitulate, I opine that the sincere measures to control the predisposing factors such as poverty, and unemployment should be followed along with the implementation of strict rules and punishment to control the acts of committing the offences."
