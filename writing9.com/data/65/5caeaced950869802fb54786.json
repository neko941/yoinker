Therefore, the lowest employment rate made a trend which is that those who want to earn more money supposed to work long hours or shift duties and work pressure increased compared to past job markets. On the other hand, most of the place\u2019s computers are an unavoidable thing and those who are working for long hours they could have been facing the disorders in the sleep.",
        "Secondly, people lifestyle got changed due to this modern technology and most of them are leading an individual lifestyle. Subsequently, they spend their night in the social media via mobile phone or laptop and this also results sleepless night. In addition, morning hours they will not fresh and their attitude become anxiety, hallucination and short temper. As a result, happiness will be so far from this lifestyle and they will be more interested in drugs or alcohol in order to get recharged. Nowadays, young children are part of the crimes and parents do not have any control over it.",
        "To conclude, Insomnia makes people become \u2018Zombies\u2019 and upcoming future the scale will get increased. Hence, everybody must understand the purpose of human life and should start awareness about this dangerous disaster."
