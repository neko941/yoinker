        "Although, some people believe that children's choices are beneficial on their daily routine, while others believe that only an important things should be addressed by them which actually affects them in genuine. In my opinion,  make your own decisions only matters whether it is related on menial level or for imperative work which directly impact them.",
        "On the one hand of discussion, mundane activity does not matter on big scale but make oneself decisive and confident. In other words, daily things like choices of dress, food are very ignorant to discuss with anyone. But, they have been improving the skills on day-to-day basis by making them an independent and built confidence in them. These practices, make youngsters proactive, to get used to take decision for any situation. For example, a boy knows why he needs to watch a program without asking anyone then he ultimately develops the skill of what is suitable for him.",
        "On the other hand, apart from everyday discussions over ignorable topic,  other parents believe to focus on significant and relevant decisions which affects them in terms of career, life. They find mundane choices, just waste of time and resources. Furthermore, according to them, career and life choices are the main focus of anyone's life. For instance, a student should responsible for its career decision instead of its shirt color.",
        "In conclusion, despite  people having different views regarding of choices, I believe it would be better to allow a child to take any decision, by guiding him the right path. Because, it will help them to built there skills for their future."
