        "It is argued that in the field of protecting the environment, it should be taken higher responsibilities by developed countries by some sort of community. However, others think on the contrary way and argue that all countries have to protect the environment with the same attention and management despite their levels of development. This essay will discuss both views and give my own opinion below as well.",
        "On the one hand, it is somehow true that, progressed societies have to protect nature with bigger attention and power due to some reasons. Because they have enough opportunities to make it in progress if it is compared to early developing ones. For instance, in already advanced regions they have huge budgets and also high-developed technologies and particularly clever populations including famous and intelligent scientists and inventors such as Elon Musk who could invent items that can work for increasing the quality of nature.",
        "On the other hand, it should be protected the nature equally by all countries around the world and separate all duties similarly between them. Because we all live on this existing planet so have equal responsibilities to do our best to protect it. For example: despite having lower opportunities and strengths the nations of all countries furthermore breathe from particular air and live in the same nature.",
        "In my opinion, in order to protect and save our nature in the incredible conditions, all types of countries should be encouraged despite their developing conditions like developed, developing and others sorts."
