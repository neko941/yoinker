        "Few people have faith in renting an accommodation but others think totally opposite of it and believes that owning a residence has its own advantages. I also agree with those who believes in owning a property.",
        "It is a sense of personal achievement for a person who invests in purchasing a home. Investing to buy a home is a permanent asset because day by day housing prices are increasing. For Instance, we can buy a house in today\u2019s era and sale it in future with flying prices. One can generate an income from his own dwelling by renting it which helps him to pay monthly mortgages. Moreover, there is no risk of a sudden notice of evacuation. So, you can breathe freely. The biggest benefit of owning a mansion is that you can construct it the way you want. You can include the amenities according to your choice and enjoy it.",
        "On the other hand, renting an apartment has its own benefits. If you rent a house or apartment, then you do not need to pay a huge sum of money. Apartments or houses usually operated and maintained by managements and owners so there is no need to pay extra money for it. Besides of this, you can get relief from paying property tax also. In addition, you can change your residence, according to your job location and schools which saves your commute time. At last, we do not need to worry about renovations if we are renting a house or an apartment.",
        "All in all, I think that benefits of owning an equity overweigh the advantages of renting a property. Owning accommodation gives us a personal comfort and the feeling of happiness which we cannot get from rental one because in rental apartment we know that at the end it is not our personal belonging."
