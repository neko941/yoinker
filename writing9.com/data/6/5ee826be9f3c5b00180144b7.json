        "Most of the population argue that crucial decisions must be made individually rather than opting advise from others. However, i completely agree with the idea of individual decision making since it can improve our critical thinking and wise decisions are made as we are solely responsible for our actions.",
        "To begin with, when we are in a situation to make a key decision then it is preferable to think of ourself since we start thinking in a critical way.  This is because critical thinking makes a person to view all the aspects of the problem and helps to find an optimum solution for the issue.  For instance, from my personal experience where i have to give my opinion on my companies' performance, i thoroughly looked into all the important details of the firm and then gave my opinion in a way that didn't disappoint any board members' feelings even though we were bad at our business.",
        "In addition, we can also make wise decisions because we are more conscious of our actions as we are the one responsible. Being responsible creates a sense of fear in us and this makes us take decisions effectively and efficiently. For example, one among my work colleague  Kiran always takes his decisions by his selves without any other person's opinion and  as a result most of his actions turned to be positive and effective. Hence, better results are obtained by practicing individual decision making.",
        "",
        "To recapitulate from the above information, it is evident that positive outcomes are drawn if the decisions are taken by individuals. Critical thinking and effective thinking  are the two main advantages gained if we make decisions by ourselves. Hence, this essay has successfully agreed on individual decision making for important things and moreover, it also supported with some personal experiences."
