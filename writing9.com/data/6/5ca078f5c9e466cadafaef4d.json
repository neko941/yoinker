        "Recycling waste materials should help to tackle both the mountains of domestic rubbish produced each year and our depleting natural resources. However, recycling programmes need the full cooperation of residents if they are to be effective, and unfortunately, this is often lacking.",
        "Even though many countries already have sophisticated systems and processes for recycling used materials, far too many recyclables continue to be thrown away with the general waste. As a result, our growing rubbish dumps are having a devastating effect on the environment. Moreover, throwing paper, plastics, and glass into the general waste means losing the chance to extract precious raw materials so that they can be used again. This is a pressing problem that we must do our best to solve as quickly as possible.",
        "Many people say they do not recycle simply because it is too time-consuming, and, in spite of the many educational programmes about this, many say they are confused about what can be recycled. Given the information overload we are confronted with every day, it is perhaps unsurprising that adding even more information has little impact and is easily Ignored. Unfortunately, we humans are creatures of habit and tend to carry on as normal unless we are forced to change our ways. Thus, the only effective way to bring about a real change in our behaviour is to implement new laws governing our domestic waste.",
        "To sum up, increasing our recycling levels is imperative given the impact our waste is having on the planet, yet our busy lives mean that we are not paying enough attention to this. Thus, I completely agree that we will only achieve success through new laws and regulations."

Prolged life is,  the e hand, a welcome change for many individuals, yet I believe this is completely not a good idea for old people to ctinue to work due to several reass related to their deteriorated work performance and capability to adapt to new technologies. Breakthroughs in medicine and heightened awareness of nutriti are the two key factors leading to lgevity. For example, nanotechnology, with tiny robots being injected into patients\u2019 body and mending all their damaged organs, are believed to the e of the secrets to obliterate any currently incurable diseases such as cancer. Additially, people nowadays are better aware of the importance of a good diet, and such wise csumpti can ensure good health and csequently extended age. However, extending people\u2019s working age can be a catastrophe to both senior citizens and companies. The majority of people at the age of 65 or over, especially in developing countries, are unable to maintain the same degree of performance as their younger counterparts. This would eventually give rise to many unwanted repercussis that affect the company\u2019s overall profits and the persal life of the aged workers as well. Also, the fast-paced life requires quick adapti and adjustments to new technology, and this is something that the elderly may never be  par with the younger es. It is not an overstatement to say that it is a torture to work in a place where you are both physically and technologically inferior to your younger co-workers. In cclusi, my firm cvicti is that old people should not be involved in work any lger than their designated retirement age now. If the need for workforce is urgent, old people can, to a certain extent, work as csultants or mentors rather than the main labor force. 30 minutes \u2013 323 words \u2013 computer-delivered",
