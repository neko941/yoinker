        "It is true that while there are a large number of college students accommodating with their parents, others choose to move out of their houses to settle in new places. There are considerably both benefits and drawbacks when it comes to these circumstances.",
        "Living with parents may be too protective for the students that they could not grasp experiences of the outside world as much as the ones living independently. As a result, they would tend to keep themselves in their comfort zones because many real issues, even the most basic tasks have already been tackled by their parents. For example, these students do not have to pay for the tuition fees or monthly rents and other service bills since their parents would take responsibility to pay for them. In contrast, students living away from home may sometimes feel homesick and isolated in new environments. Thus, they would spend more time traveling back to their home to visit their parents, especially on special occasions and holidays.",
        "Students living in their parents\u2019 homes may have more time to spend on studies and other activities such as joining clubs at college. Besides, their concentration levels in studies are much more improved as they need not be concerned about any arousing problems, compared to ones moving out. These problems are already taken care of by their parents. Regarding students staying away from their families, they can seize the opportunities to develop their soft skills and life experiences as they meet people from different cultural backgrounds. In addition, these students can also raise their sense of independence such as finding part-time jobs or self-managing their budgets.",
        "To recapitulate, there are both benefits and drawbacks to university students when considering moving away from families or staying home with parents."
