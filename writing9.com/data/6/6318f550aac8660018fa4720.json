        "More people will go on holiday to their country of origin in the future and will not travel abroad on holiday. I completely disagree with this statement because the experience of a new culture and more people will become richer.",
        "The main reason why I do not think that more people will go to their own country on holiday in the future is that they want to experience different cultures. This is to say that it is interesting to see how other people live, dress, eat and worship. People can not gain such experience in their own country, and, therefore, many people will seek discoveries by travelling to a different country. For example, a survey which was done by the ministry of foreign affairs in Japan shows that the reason why most of the international visitors who came to Japan this year wanted to experience the culture of the country.",
        "The second reason why I disagree more people will choose to go on holiday to their own country is that people are getting richer. This is because a large number of people are joining to the middle class in developing nations. For instance, many people from India and China are expected to increase their income in the coming years.",
        "In conclusion, I believe that more people will go on holiday abroad because they will experience a new culture and many people will become richer."
