Such gadgets that individuals can use to download any type of book have been used for a long time now, but this is an excellent example of how technology has influenced people\u2019s hobbies or the activities they love doing in their free time.",

That is so unhealthy and can affect  their eyes sides poorly.",
        "In conclusion,although information technology has influenced  people's day-life, there could be existed  altogether with positive and negative effects. In spite of having a few demerits in this option,advantages can lead people to a higher standard living."
