        "These days it is becoming increasingly common for parents to spend less and less time with their children. In my opinion, this is because of some distinctly modern distractions and has a far greater effect on children.",
        "Both parents and children are vulnerable to today\u2019s consumer electronics. In the past, parents and children might have been distracted by television or a good book but they were also likely to play a board game together or go for a walk. This started to change with the advent of the internet and portable devices. Many children only care about using their phone or tablet to play games or watch Netflix. Parents are similarly addicted to games, entertainment and the allure of social media. This inclination towards passive entertainment persists even when taking their children out because though parents are physically present, phones often demand most of their attention.",
        "This primarily impacts children as they are more impressionable. Research has shown that the majority of an individual\u2019s personality and habits are formed early in life. If a parent neglects a child in favour of their own desires then they are likely to either act out seeking attention or withdraw into their own shell. The child in question might lack not only the supportive and unconditional love that is essential for a healthy upbringing, but also assume and repeat the negative behaviours of their role models. Many children overcompensate for their parent\u2019s implicit rejection by numbing themselves by retreating into books, television, YouTube, social media or whatever will give them the attention they crave. This long-cultivated trauma can even follow them throughout adulthood.",
        "In conclusion, the growth of consumer electronics is the source of parental neglect and it mainly impairs the mental health of children. Parents must take it on themselves today to find ways to counter the injurious implications of trading their children\u2019s well-being for a sustained glance at a screen."
