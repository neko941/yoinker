        "A group of people prefers to live in a house. By contrast, others like to live in an apartment. While there are some drawbacks associated with living in a house, I believe the main benefits are more substantial.",
        "On the one hand, a potential disadvantage of living in a house may be burglarized. Sometimes a house is empty. Thus, it is more likely to be robbed by a burglar. Whereas, the number of people who are living in an apartment is more than that of in a house and burglars are not willing to enter these places with many people. Every second, they will be captured. Another perceived negative is that most of the women are not able to sleep alone in a house. They will be afraid and will turn on the lights in the morning.",
        "On the other hand, a primary benefit of living in a house is having more space compared with living in an apartment. Many houses have several rooms and family members can have private rooms where lead to more privacy. It is undeniable fact that many houses have backyards and front yards. The yards can be designed and decorated amazingly by city dwellers and children are encouraged to play more there where it is a relaxed atmosphere.",
        "On balance, living in a house would indeed seem disadvantageous under certain circumstances. However, in my view, its positive effects on the standard of living with having privacy more and a beautiful yard for rest and fun override the disadvantages."
