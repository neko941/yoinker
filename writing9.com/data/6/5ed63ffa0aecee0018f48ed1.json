        "The term happiness differs with individuals. Some people believe that money and materialistic wealth can bring contentment. Besides the fact, it solely depends on the perception of a person. According to my level of perception, money can't bring joy into someone's life. I wil explain my sort of happiness and joy in this essay.",
        "Firstly, materials and wealth will not be the same throughout our life. For instance, an individual having more wealth in this world then anyone might not be happy with their needs, whereas, a person who doesn't look for contentment in those materialistic stuffs is likely to be happy with his own needs. Therefore, the mindset of an individual takes up the responsibility of contentment.",
        "Secondly, my level of peace of mind is achieved by helping others with their needs. Money can bring temporary peace of mind in life but it cannot satisfy an individual's need throughout their life. As per my belief, money is needed for food, shelter and safety rather not for happiness. In this current situation, there are still many people living in poverty without their basic needs and suffering for some change in their life. Even though they suffered for their basic necessity, they have pleasure and unity among them to fight for their basic needs.",
        "To conclude, in this materialistic world where everyone is busy with their competition of earning a salary, they have lost the real meaning of peace of mind.  Sharing and caring is the only way we can earn bliss in our lives. We should learn to see prosperity and comfort from the economically disadvantaged people and we should share our belonging to them to bring that contentment and bliss into our lives and make our world a better place to live in."
