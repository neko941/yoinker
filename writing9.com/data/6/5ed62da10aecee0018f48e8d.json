        "On the other hand, everything has pros and cons. So, Everytime we are using these sources, they require our personal data and data keeping it on the verge of being stolen and misused by the hackers. Furthermore, Kids are more prone to get cyber bullied as they are na\u00efve. For illustration, Blue whale game where children were forced to do hazardous tasks and risk their lives.",
        "In a nutshell, if people are more aware while using and sharing their personal info on social media and keep an eye for the younger ones then definitely the advantages of being a part of a social media site outweigh the disadvantages."
