        "Some people hold the view that school teachers are supposed to give homework to children as it contributes to their educational success, while others believe that school children should not be assigned homework. On the one hand , doing homework provide students with more practice opportunities and helps them better use their time at home. However, those who are again homework assert that children need more freedom and rest while they are not at school. This essay will discuss both views and present my own opinion.",
        "The experts and parents who favor giving school children homework put forward the argument that it can play a salient role in their education. Firstly, they contend that homework can offer students more practice opportunities at home, enforcing what they learn at school. It goes without saying that this leads to deeper learning of the school subjects. The other argument this group puts forward is that doing homework at home prevents children from wasting their time while they are not at school. A survey conducted in a number of Canadian schools has demonstrated that school children who regularly do homework tend to outperform those who have no assignments to do at home.",
        "On the other hand, some people oppose giving homework to children. The main argument they propose is that students need more freedom outside school to pursue the other facets of their lives and have more time with their families. There is some research evidence supporting this line of reasoning. For instance, a study conducted among a sample of German elementary students has revealed that those with no assignments to do at home tend to have a higher level of interpersonal skills.",
        "In summary, some people belive that school children should not be given homework, while others consider it necessary for thier development. My personal view is that doing homework can have a constructive impact on students' learning, leading them to a higher level of academic achievement. However, there should be a balance n the amount of homework assigned to them, so that they can develop the other aspects of their life and personality."
