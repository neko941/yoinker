Punishment is necessary to help them learn this distinction.\nTo what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?\nWhat sort of punishment should parents and teachers be allowed to use to teach good behaviour to children?",

        "In my opinion, children should know about what is wrong or right as early as possible. Sometimes, kids have done wrong things unconsciously. But, unfortunately parents communicate with them like adults and punish them with difficult things.",
        "First of all, I would like to talk about why children should learn good manners and the ability to know right from wrong things. If we learn it as early as possible, we will be able to make right decisions in some sort of situations. For example, choosing our friends, helping others or studying well. These types of decisions shape our future. From the beginning, if we do these basic things right, we can get more opportunity and seize them. Because, we know them right.",
        "On the other hand, kids are like white paper. They are born to learn things and adapt them in their own way. So only family members or teachers can\u2019t influence them by their act or words. Kids learn from other people who have bad manners or behaviours, too. Sometimes they act wrong and unconsciously do not so good things. But, If parents or teachers use wrong punishment like hitting their body, hurting them by words or standing for hours, they will learn it from them and use it to their kids and as a result it will never end.",
        "So, us, adults should teach our next generations how to be good and make right decisions. But when kids do bad things we shouldn\u2019t punish them. We can talk to them about their actions, they will understand it. Or we can fix it together."
