Some psychologists claim that the basic reason for this is that children these days are not getting the social and emotional learning they need from parents and teachers.\n\nTo what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?\n\nGive reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience..",

        "It is often believed by some that natural ability is needed to be successful in a sport activity. While others are of the opinion that working hard and training can yield similar result. I will examine both views and discuss why success based on either talent or hard work depends on the particular type sport.",
        "On the one hand, some argue that natural endowment is needed to excel in a particular game. As people we created with different qualities, thanks to our differences in our genetic make up. Therefore, in order to succeed in a sporting activity, you need to utilize those natural talents and physique to make a stand out performance. A good example is the serial Olympic gold medallist Usain bolt who has been a record breaker for several years in the 100 and 200 meters sprint race thanks largely to his tall and athletic body build up. Hence, all his dream wouldn't have come true if he were a dwarf.",
        "On the other hand, some believed that working hard and constant training can make a sportsman successful. It is a common knowledge and belief that repetition teaches the donkey. If an individual wants to excel at a top level, he or she has to commit more than others. This is exemplified by Cristiano Ronaldo, who is believed to be less talented than Lionel Messi but has won the same number of ballon d or. This surely has come due to his excessive and overzealous nature to become better day by day. Such attitude makes him to be the first to come the training ground and the last to leave. Thus, proving the old saying, \u201cpractice makes perfect\u201d.",
        "In my opinion, being successful depends on the particular type of game. This means that while certain sports requires inherent ability others demand hard work to achieve success. A physically challenged individual can never achieve what a ussain bolt has accomplished over the years, so also Cristiano Ronaldo would never achieve greatness if he was a lazy footballer.",
        "In conclusion, while talent and hard work are needed to achieve success in a sport, some sports can't be conquered without natural capability while others need an individual to work on his talent before achieving success."
