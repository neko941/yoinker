        "In recent days, some individuals believe that experienced workers can bring immense contribution to an enterprise. However, there are some folks who agree with the idea that juvenals have more benefits to give to an organization.",
        "On one hand, employees with more age have experienced more situations throughout their lives, thus they could be able to deal with a plethora of situations in the context of the job occupation. To exemplify, some arguing moments could happen in the organization, during a brainstorm, for example. In this scenario, the knowledge of the life could be a wisely tool in order to set things calm and collected again.  Consequently,  the environment could be peacefully again and people with maturity could show that not only the knowledge of work is of pivotal importance. Experience of life has been worth itself, can bring benefits as well and can avoid querulous demeanour.",
        "On the other hand, young people are full of energy and have the desire to gain their own space in the market. Due to this fact, they relish working overtime and achieve higher goals. For instance, there is a company in my hometown that always look for people under the '30s. And the reason is that they want the fastest results and be ahead of their competitors. As a result, the new age people work overtime most of the moment, which could be beneficial for the company, in order to show their boss that they are able to develop that activities and have a real chance to work regularly full time in that company.",
        "To conclude, I consider that leaders have to bear in mind that is necessary to find a balance among their employees. Decide whether an old or a young person is not the main point but be aware of the real necessity of the enterprise. Moreover, there are some job occupations that can fit for anyone who desires the job and, in this case, the age is not the main point, but the knowledge of the candidate."
