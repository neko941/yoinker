They believe that certain workers deserve to retire and receive a pension at an earlier age.\n\n\nDo you agree or disagree?\n\n\nWhich types of workers do you think should benefit from early retirement?",

        "Many people have the opinion that having a set retirement age for each and every person regardless of their job, is unfair. They also have a strong believe that ceryain range of workers should retire early and get pension at earlier age. As this total argument is true, I will illustrate my opinion below.",
        "Firstly, a set retirment age is very uncertain and unfair as they are many kinds of jobs , all those jobs donot support the same time retriement, As some work is physically and mental stress. So it is always varied from work to work. For instance, My father is an school  teacher as he is workiing from 20 years, his vocal chord is delibratately affected and know he's not able be talk as he would earlier. In this is case in should be a necessary option to have a eariler retirement and should initiate ann early pension. My father got the justice as it is a serious problem is got the retirement at the age of 45.",
        "Secondly, Workers with more physical pressure should be benifited from retirement. Physical work that includes the construction business in which the people will have more stress as compared to the government employs. The hospital staffs should also be supported. For example, as cricketers will have before time retiral from work, as they cannot work as effective as they work below the age of 30, so the maximum age will only be upto 35 years age and after the retiral age they will be given other jobs which are suitable in that given year.",
        "The conclusion, I definitely agree that 65 years age is to suitable to all sorts of works. Professions like Teachers and Police officers and others, should provide an early pension then it will be fair in all aspects."
