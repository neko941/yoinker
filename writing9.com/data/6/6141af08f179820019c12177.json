        "It is considered by some people that telephones should be used for only personal purposes, whereas others hold the view that in most cases phones should be for working processes. While cell phones should be private as it is the information storage for all people, I strongly believe that using telephones only for work reduces its drawbacks.",
        "",
        "To begin with, majority of people use phones for personal goals such as keeping in contact with others, saving photos as a memory and as an information storage. Using telephones at work can make people distractive in real working time, as these gadgets can divert their thoughts. For example, usually people doesn\u2019t feel the sense of time while they take their telephones. Thus, it decreases the productivity and obviously, damages the company.  In addition, it kills time management of employees which can cause some conflicts and challenges in corporation. So, telephones mostly should not be used in working time.",
        "",
        "On the other hand, as it is known for everyone telephones have some disadvantages which can destroy the health of users. People spend their time using it for personal purposes as watching films, searching information and obviously, for chatting with others. These non-beneficial activities can cause health hazards such as headaches, impaired immune system, memory loss and eye problems. For instance, spending more than 2 hours using phones for personal activities cam reduce the eye vision as gadgets. Eventually, despite the fact people can be used for only personal purposes, however, it can have advantages for other sectors of life like work, economy and technology progress of the country.",

        "All things considered, after analyzing both opinions, it is clear that using phone gadgets with a limited time for personal and work activities is essential as it reduces the drawbacks of them."
