        "I have been interested in art and design since I was a child. However, here in Taiwan, if you can be an engineer or a doctor, you are encouraged to be one, and I am no exception. During my high school years, I was influenced by my peers, starting to change my career path to engineering. In 2016, I selected mechanical engineering as my major. It didn\u2019t take me much time to realize that I was not good at the discipline I had chosen. Not knowing what I am capable of doing, nor do I know what I like, I could not be more lost and frustrated.",
        "Luckily, by the end of the semester, there was a design workshop drew my attention. Out of curiosity I signed it up. During the speech and activities, I felt something that I didn\u2019t have while I studied engineering. It was the first time that I felt the passion lay within my heart. In the following semester I selected a course related to design. As I dived down deeper it became apparent that design is the field that I am good at. However, I struggled. Setting my career in design implies giving up the stable income and a smooth career path which staying in engineering  guarantees. There is a voice inside telling me that I am supposed to follow my heart, but there are also many people think this is an absurd act. The two forces inside were tearing me apart, and under this situation my course performance only got worse.",
        "One day, it dawned on me that only if I do the things I like can I optimize my career development. As a result, I signed up for our school design program to help me broaden my horizon. Although studying engineering is difficult for me, I consider it as a challenge and a complementary support for my design. Besides learning through courses, combining what I had learned, I designed new products and joined in competitions. To challenge myself, I became a teaching assistant tutoring students in design. As a freelance graphic designer, I designed the logo and packaging for a foreign coffee shop.",
        "Still, even with all these experiences, it is still not enough for me. I want to test the limits and break through. Attending graduate school is a perfect opportunity to help me integrate all my skills better. It took me a long time to get myself prepared. To have my own portfolio, new products had to be designed, and there are so many design tools that I had to be familiar with. After two years of preparation, last Christmas I submitted my application.",
        "I can still remember the day I received the admission letter from California College of the Art. I woke up and check my smartphone as usual, and there was a notification popped up. For the first time in my college years, I was finally relieved."
