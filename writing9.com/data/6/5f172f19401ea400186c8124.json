        "People tend to shop more online instead of going to local shops while the appearance of the internet. This essay will discuss two main problems that will be caused which are the increasing number of shops closing and decreasing in employment. This essay will also suggest solutions to those problems, including pricing differences between online shops and high street shops and set a well-known minimum number of people needed in different jobs.",
        "The numbers of High street shops will gradually decrease and the difficulties to find a job will increase.  Internet makes shopping more convenient, people do not need to spend their time to go and choose what they want, they can find basically everything by just typing into their searching engine without being led by a person. For example, a person who lives far away from shoe shops can buy shoes online without having to travel for hours. In addition, this will make shop assistants be forced to leave their job because of the lack of customers. In short, the improvement of the internet will bring a decrease in the level of employment and hardships for those who prefer to shop in stores.",
        "To announce a minimum people needed in stores and balancing the price between online and high street shops are both useful methods to help the problems caused by the internet.  Businesses will not earn enough income for its capital, which includes rents and employees\u2019 salaries while online shopping becomes more popular because it is usually cheaper. Indeed, to buy a cloth online, will cost a person only about \u00a310 but may spend more than \u00a320 in a local store. Overall, to set a fair and similar price can reduce the number of shop closure therefore certain number of jobs will be insured.",
        "In conclusion, to buy things online becomes more popular as the internet is more commonly used. This essay discussed why there are drops in the level of employment followed by increasing numbers of shops being closed. This essay also suggested the solutions to this problem which includes setting the price as fair as it can be and insure a minimum job place."
