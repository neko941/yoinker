        "Generally, adult and young people prefer to live in a foreign country for their job, education or social opportunities. This circumstance might give some trouble about social and practical who speak another language.  I am going to tell of  social and practical problems.",
        "In this case,  some people migrate to other countries and also they may not speak the countries language. So this person a lot of spending time to adaptation. For instance, the turkish person starts living the USA and this person cannot speak English. Hence this person would not understand others and communicate with other people. It is a big social problem because people are social animals. They need to talk and communicate to another person.",
        "On the other hand, some people go to other countries with international project or ERASMUS programs.  This education has some requirements, some language, team work, etc. Therefore, students have to speak education, language, \u0131f the could not they could not work with project team. It is a social problem.",
        "Additionally, some people go abroad for learning a new language, but  in spite of the fact that according to me people need fundamental language information for could pratice others in a new language. For example, if \u0131 was going to Germany for learning German language \u0131 need some basic info about German language. Thus, \u0131 could improve my language skill.",
        "To sum up, language is crucial for communication to others. Additionally, \u0131 agree this topic because humans need to speak and sharing their feelings to others. By the way, they have to speak the same language when they are talking or sharing information."
