        "I am a resident of Goodwill society and writing to show my concerns over the ever declining standard of the main street in the society.",
        "The main street has proudly been a  linkage between city and main town for years. However , over past two years the situation of the street is deteriorating . There are cracks all over, it is totally overgrown with weeds and accumulated with that leaves and twings from trees on the it's sides.",
        "I am very concerned that the pits on it are major hazards to children and elderly who can easily have serious accidents. Moreover,as rainy season is about to began so there is every possibility that these cracks will be flooded with rainwater, becoming breeding place to Malaria causing mosquitoes. With rain, heaps of decaying plants remains  can be washed into draine causing the blockage of sewerage system. As a  preventive measure, I believe that repair work should be done immediately including filling of all cracks , uprooting of weeds and removal of decaying leaves and twings.",
        "I Hope you find my concern genuine and take immediate corrective action.",
        "Thanking you in anticipation.",
