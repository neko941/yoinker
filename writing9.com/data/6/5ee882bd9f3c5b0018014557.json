        "Most of the newly hired employees lack essential soft skills, which makes it difficult for businesses to survive in a competitive environment. The reason for this problem is that the education system emphasized more on theoretical subjects and, also, there is less human interaction due to the increased access to social media. However, there are a number of solutions which should be implemented to improve soft skills amongst people.",
        "Firstly, the main reason for this issue is that colleges and schools focus more on academic subjects and good grades. As a result, teachers and parents encourage students to spend most of their time studying rather than gaining practical experience. However, Theoretical knowledge will not be sufficient for students to survive in the corporate world. Secondly, with the increasing access to social media, most of the people spend their leisure time to connect with friends online rather than meeting them in person. This has led to a lesser development of socializing skills among people.",
        "However, there are two solutions to overcome this problem. The First and foremost solution is that the Government should encourage colleges and schools to inculcate soft skill subjects in their curriculum. With the help of these subjects, students can learn to develop necessary skills such as interpersonal skills, leadership skills, and, so on which is help them in their professional life. Also, students should be made to work in group projects so that they learn team-building skills, task achievement, team coordination.  Apart from this, companies should start a few weeks of softskill development programs for their newly hired employees as a part of their orientation program.",
        "To conclude, less practical experience and human interaction are the leading causes due to which employees lack interpersonal skills. However, if concerned authorities take practical steps, then this problem can be reduced."
