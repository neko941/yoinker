        "There is no doubt that these days, working for a while after graduation from school is a perfect way to get some practical skills about your major before going to the academy. The question is it will affect young people to get a career for a few years after graduation from school and go to university in their life? In this essay, I am going to discuss both views and draw my own conclusion",
        "In terms of advantages, act experience is one of the important to get good work. The main reason given to support this appeal is that help them to get more know-how by learning more about work setting and take responsibility. To illustrate, many students in America try to find a job before going to university because help them to get a good job after graduation variety. In other words, they will have a big opportunity to be accepted in a company if they have the related work experience to the offered position instead of those without training",
        "However, young people who take a job for a few years before going to university will face some problems in their life. firstly, probably they forget the basic knowledge which had been taught in school. Secondly, their academic incentive will decrease to complete their study at the university, and they need to improve their important knowledge in their major to get a good job. This is because work could become a large distraction and chances of keeping working is far greater than to the continues their study at university.",
        "In conclusion, although it is said the academic incentive will decrease to complete their study at the university, work experience is important to get a good job after graduating university. Therefore, I believe that chance to work between school and university is very important because this way will define me to the chosen major right for me"
