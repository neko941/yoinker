        "In our days and age, road problems seem to be increasing day by day. This most of the time is a result of the common use of the roadway from both cars and bicycles. The aetiology and possible solutions on this issue will be further discussed",
        "First of all, priority is one of the main reasons of road conflict between cyclists and vehicles. Usually during traffic, bicycles give way to cars in order to not cause  any congestion. However this is not what happens in the majority of times. In their attempt to equalize their rights, they drive in extremely high speed, without the proper safety measures and braking abilities, leading to serious problems. It is clearly observed that this issue could be avoided if the roads were re-stuctured, in such a way that there would be a section just for cyclists, including the corresponding traffic lights for them.",
        "Furthermore, many collisions are due to a not proper indicator given by the cyclist driver. In fact, last year, one of the biggest accidents in Chicago is proved to be because of wrong signaling. Driving in a relatively narrow road, the cyclist gave a late signal rising his hand, resulting in a collision of five  upcoming cars with 10 deaths and 3 hospitalised. It is clear that with a proper signaling device in all bicycles and the appropriate clothing, the rate of accidents would  experience a dramatic drop.",
        "Conclusively, the use of a street  from both cars and bicycles leads to many roadway issues. It is expected that without taking into consideration the introduction of a  separate bicycle section and changes on the way of driver\u2019s signaling, the annual death rate due to accidents will be increased."
