I usually wake up early to jog at the park, and try to do yoga before hitting the sack. I always go swimming in the summers, as I cannot bare the heat. I rarely hit the gym, in fact detest it. I don't like running on the treadmill, while simple staring aimlessly into the space.I make it a point to go trekking once a month, and go to the sports club once in a fortnight.",
