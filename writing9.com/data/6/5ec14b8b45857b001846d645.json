        "Many divergent views exist on the importance of the university admission process. A great number of people, including myself are of the opinion that higher education institution should facilitate the entry of low-income students as well as those who come from poor background.  In the following paragraphs, I will provide the rationale for my viewpoints as well as proffer justification for my own opinion.",
        "The primary reason upon which my viewpoint is based is that such policy can help in shaking off the poverty of their families.  It goes without saying that when impoverished students are offered an opportunity to pursue higher education studies, they have a wider choice of well-paid jobs after graduating. My university course mate, Ben, is a shining example of this, Ben, who came from a very small town and a family of farmers, tried very hard and successfully completed the four-year undergraduate course at the University of Toronto. Before he knew it, he was offered a well- paying position at an international bank. The annual income he receives is way higher than the salary he could have been given by any farming job.",
        "Not only does this policy lead to the reduction of poverty, but it also increases diversity at universities. It stands to reason that the more students from different economic backgrounds and other groups are accepted, the more their presence will be noticeable on campus. All these groups of students will make the university a culturally diverse place where inter-cultural learning is celebrated and promoted. Unsurprisingly, a 2019 study conducted by a team at university of Toronto found that \u201cinclusion and diversity\u201d were two top factors that influence to a great extent future student\u2019 choices of university. Hence, anti-discrimination admission policies can help higher education institutions attract more students",
        "To sum up, I hold to the opinion  that universities should provide easy access to tertiary education for less-privileged groups as this can be beneficial for both future students and the universities"
