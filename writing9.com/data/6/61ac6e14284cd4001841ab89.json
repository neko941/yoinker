        "Some people are of the opinion that technological advancements have made the public more sociable whereas some think the  social gap is widening  due to rampant use of technologies. The below essay will discuss both sides of the coin before arriving at  a logical conclusion.",
        "To begin with, current modern techniques helps the masses to be more socially active nowadays. Social media has played a crucial role in people being socially active, as we can share, view and express our feelings for our kith and kins, dear ones and friends through the network of likes Facebook, Instagram or WhatsApp.we can get instant information on whereabouts or occasions.for instance nowadays It's common to create   social groups on what Sapp and share their information, views and know bouts there. Communications can happen easily despite   the distances are. Instances like marriages, birthdays, and promotions can be easily notified by media and hence helping people stay connected and socially active. On these platform greeting and views can be easily shared among other group members.",
        "On the other ,hand social gaps are increasing nowadays due to the widespread use of modern networks which although connects, but distant physical connectivities.masses connected with each other and occasionally meet. The isolation is getting widened the social gap and despite people having achieved  materialiastic success they feel social loneliness. In the past people used to go to their neighbours, relatives and spent time there, embracing and chatting for hours but nowadays such things are uncommon.",
        "In conclusion I would say that on the one side modern technologies   help us to connect twenty-four seven and enhance our connectivity, on the other side it's widening the physical gap of meeting in physical which resulted in psychological isolation of peoples."
