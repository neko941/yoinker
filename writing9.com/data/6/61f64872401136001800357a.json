        "It is argued that, currently really famous people like films stars, pop musicians and also sport stars are got extremely huge amounts of payments more than they are actually deserved by some sort of public. I totally agree with this statement and give some evidence to this argument, furthermore consider on jobs which should be paid more than they are used to.",
        "To begin with, in a real it is totally true that a sort of community who has big fame around the whole world are earned a lot money. These types of people particularly earn such kind of huge money due to the different factors. First and foremost, businesses are ready to pay such kind of big cash for them for working together. For instance: making an agreement to make advertisements for these firms to increase their number of sales or popularity in the markets. Secondly, it is an incredibly valuable opportunity for businesses make their customers be more loyal to this company or brand.",
        "However, there are other types of employments that are deserved to earn more salaries than they are getting now. Because these kinds of jobs are deeply connected with a high risk firstly to themselves and are really beneficial to communities. Great examples of these jobs are doctors and firefighters. They always work hardly to help their populations without any danger to die. Because even in the pandemic conditions they worked with the chance of dying from the covid. Further, the same with firefighters. They always start their jobs from early mornings with understanding that this day can be the last they exist.",
        "In my opinion, despite giving a lot of money to the famous sort of public with the advantages of increasing businesses, it should be paid more money to our hero people who work under peril such as doctors and firefighters as mentioned."
