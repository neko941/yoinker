        "Social media has taken over the entire world, with even the remotest area having an access to internet and social networking. But its advancement has resulted in teenagers being granted greater access to internet which can lead to potentially harmful consequences.  This essay will discuss the possible solutions for this problem.",
        "Firstly, the use of internet and social media is inevitable in today\u2019s technical world. Restricting youngsters from using the web is neither possible nor ethically correct; rather they should be encouraged to do so in a responsible manner. They should be given counselling and advice on the correct and incorrect use of internet and must also be made aware of the dangerous situations which, its wrong use can land them in. For an illustration children refrained from visiting certain websites just because they were advised not to do so by their parents or teachers. Thus, using counselling to create awareness among the younger generation can be one possible solution to the problem at hand.",
        "Secondly, certain content on the net is quite inappropriate for the younger generation to access, even accidentally, in that case parents can take help of certain softwares  which restrict the teenagers from viewing the content not meant for their age group. For reference, Netflix uses one such software which shows media options only according to the age limit, set in the viewer\u2019s profile; and the profile can be locked with a password. Therefore, showing the possibility that technology can aid to mitigate some of the adverse effects of technology itself.",
        "To conclude, this essay suggested that counselling to create awareness and a sense of responsibility among youngsters along with smart use of technology can help us to stand against the potential risks, that the unlimited access of the web, given to teenagers, can result in."
