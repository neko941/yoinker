        "Health experts and researchers have proven that the excessive consumption of junk food can be troublesome for one\u2019s health. It has now given rise to many health related concerns. A lot of fitness experts, dieticians, and nutritionists are trying to teach the people about the consequences and associated risks of junk food. In my opinion, these awareness campaigns certainly help but they are not enough.",
        "Generally speaking, people have no idea of their daily intake of carbohydrates or fats. Both are present in higher quantity in all types of junk food. Hence excessive consumption of fast food may create many health problems in the future. The recent statistics show that there has been an increase in the incidences / cases of heart problems, diabetic issues and obesity problems amongst even young people. To counter this, the government has already launched many health education campaigns. In my opinion, these campaigns certainly help people to distinguish healthy food from unhealthy food.",
        "However, by simply imparting education about the importance of eating right, the government cannot reduce the consumption of junk food. To start with, many people who consume these convenience foods are highly educated. They know fast food harms their health; yet they consume it because they find it easy and convenient. For example, busy executives do not have time to cook proper meals. It is easier for them to grab a packet of instant noodles than to prepare dosa or chapathi at home. Health awareness programmes may not have the right effect on them. A better solution is to make healthy food more affordable and more easily available.",
        "To conclude, launching educational and awareness campaigns about the harmful effects of junk food is certainly beneficial; however, that alone is unlikely to reduce the consumption of junk food because lack of awareness is rarely the reason that encourages people to eat junk. A better solution is to make healthy food readily available."
