        "Nowadays, the growth in traffic and pollution are the main problem the world is facing. Some people think that rise in petrol will solve this problem. To certain extent, I agree that it will solve the issues while there are also many other measures to tackle it.",
        "To begin with, rise in petrol prices may not be the best way to reduce congestion problems. If the petrol prices increase, there will be less people who can afford it, which means only few people will drive. As a result, there will be less congestion on roads and less pollution. For example, in Mumbai, many people can\u2019t afford the fuel prices and they drive less. Moreover, the rise in the fuel prices will result in increase in prices of food, clothing, etc., which will affect common man because most of the industries depend on the petrol prices.",
        "On the other hand, there could be other solutions to improving traffic jam such as increasing public transportation to encourage more people to use it and making it better. Also, increasing the frequency of public transport during peak hours with cheap tickets can help individuals to use it more frequently as well as adding it from various locations at peoples\u2019 convenience can benefit everyone. For example, more the number of bus stops in the community encourages adults and children to use bus instead of driving. Another solution is to add some charge in populated areas when using cars to discourage people in using their cars and also have no traffic zones in city centers.",
        "To conclude, solving traffic and pollutions problems by increasing price of petrol is not an effective way but rather improve public transportation in all areas so that people use it more than driving."
