        "In recent times, it is often seen that in many country\u2019s higher authorities are taking the initiatives to set up industries and businesses on the outs cut off the cities. In my opinion, the merits of this supersede the demerits.",
        "To begin with, many people from rural areas migrate to the cities for better job opportunities as a result the cities become overpopulated and face many problems like unemployment, but if production units are established in the rural areas it will open the door of job opportunities for the village people. For instance, the Nano plant, which was established at sanand, created many job opportunities for the nearby population, and hence this improves the overall standard of living rural people.",
        "Secondly, the people of the countryside are often deprived of basic amenities, but industries are established in the county side, it will lead to flourishing development like construction of better road and bridge, electricity 25x7, transportation and many more. Not only this, but it will also promote small businesses to flourish like local shops, restaurants and many more.",
        "On the other hand, there are certain drawbacks of setting factories in the village due to industrial development, the villages will start exploding natural resources like land and water and this will result in the pollution and spoil the natural benefits of the countryside. Moreover, most of the people in the regional area are engaged in the agriculture sector, but if we establish the factories, many people will move to the industries for better opportunities and thus the agriculture sector will suffer.",
        "In conclusion, the decision taken by the government  to set up, industries will prove to be fruitful as it will upgrade the rural areas, but at the same time, certain drawbacks need to take care while setting up industries."
