        "There is no country in this world which is untouched by the phenomenon of multiculturalism.Some people say that union of different cultures might bring various problems like cultural loss and racism in a society.I firmly believe that multicultural communities have more advantages than disadvantages.",
        "A quick perusal of this issue at hand would throw up a surfeit of seminal reasons supporting some peoples perspective is that ethnic diversities may lead to the disappearance of an indigenous culture in a host country.The proponents of this view also feel that, racial discrimination is the other disadvantages of cosmopolitan culture.To give an ideal example is in the USA, where recently a white policeman killed a black person in the public, and it indicates that  the racial disparity among the white and black people are still existing there.",
        "However,living in a diverse environment has a lot of benefits to a nation.Recent studies indicate that it is only likely to accentuate in the coming decade considering the ground realities of the modern world.Firstly, multiculturalism will help a country to boost their economy and social development.For example, the affluent cities like Dubai and NewYork are economically well advanced due to the hard work of many migrant people from various cultures and tradition.Secondly, fusion of different civilizations will teach us how to respect other community people.When we respect each other the society will become more supportive and open minded and that will help to reduce the concept of racism and maintain harmony either.In addition, we can adapt in any situation if we live in a mixed population.We can experience different food,clothes and lifestyle by living in a diverse society.",
        "To conclude, while it can be argued that too much emphasis is placed on the side effects of multiculturalism, my own opinion is that our society is largely benefited with ethnic diversity."
