        "It is believed by some that as men and women have different traits, so it would be wise to eliminate each gender from certain professions. I completely disagree with this view. In my opinion, in present scenario, both sexes are performing well in every area of work and equal rights should be given to men and women.",
        "To begin with, some people hold the opinion that employment should be given on the basis of gender because it is a common belief that women are better at managing finance and office related jobs, while men are conducive to perform works require physical strength. However, it is not true in real context. As, women are performing outstandingly at borders and men are doing well in the nursing profession. Thus, it would be unjustifiable to say that there should be discrimination while allocating vacancies.",
        "On the other hand, it is a basic right of each individual to get appointed on the basis of their academic performances and their potential without any discrimination. Every candidate has to go through different procedures to prove their credibility. Hence, employment must be given to the one who meet the job criteria.  Moreover, if the government promotes such kind of attitude in the selection process, it would set a wrong example in the society. One of the both can feel worthless or low because of this practice. Thus, selection committee should act wisely while appointing a person for a particular job.",
        "To conclude, despite few people believe that positions should be based on male and female; however, in my opinion, appointments must be based on credibilities and performance of male and female while interview."
