        "A teacher  is a person who helps pupils  to acquire  knowledge. However,  some individuals think that  getting  the same instructor for a few long time is beneficial  for the pupils. Other think that getting  new educators is more advantages for students. I opened that both statements play a vital role in students life and I will  justify my point in the following  paragraphs.",
        "",
        "The prime reason to have same instructor is   a comfort zone for pupils. To explain it further, the student can feel comfortable with the  same teacher, who has been teaching  them for many years,because  pupils  get familiar  not only  with their nature but also their teaching  methods. As a result, students  can ask their  queries easily.  To exemplify, Indian Government reported in March 2018 that some pupils are feeling shy to talk with her person and ask any questions about their doubts. Besides,  according  to the survey students  like to talk with whom they are feeling comfort.",
        "",
        "The key reason to have modern or new educators is students  can get different  types of learning  method.  To make it more clear, teachers are having different method to teach students as per their knowledge.Thus, student can learn new things from new instructors,  rather than learning with same educators, they only get one method or same thing, instead  of gaining new knowledge. For an instance,  The Time Of India  reported in march 2018 that student has learn many new thing from modern educators and got new method for learning  easily.",
        "",
        "To conclude, it can be seen that student can learn new  thing from new teacher and they can feel comfortable  with same teacher.so both play vital role in their life."
