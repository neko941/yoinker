        "At present, due to busy lifestyles and dire need of the time, it is mandatory to perform various tasks in batches rather than doing a single.Although many might agree with this statement, I completely agree with this notion, not only because of convenience in performing difficult tasks and advantages in terms of social interaction, but also its benefits towards the organization.This essay will explore how these factors justify my opinion.",
        "Firstly,the factor that compelled me to agree with this statement is the convenience in achieving problematic goals.As many minds, when grouped together can easily rectify the issues.Take an example of the invention of Influenza vaccine in 1970s for Influenza which had killed millions of humans few years before the invention of the vaccine,it was merely possible by the efforts of various scientists because of their joint and collaborative work.Thus, any task when jointly performed, will be accomplished conveniently.",
        "Secondly, merits of social grooming in society while performing in groups cannot be sidelined.As it provides a forum for humans to share their ideas and social experiences.For instance, during the global workshop in 2010 regarding the future of IT  conducted in western Australia, provided a huge opportunity of scholars from various nations to share their social experiences.Hence, doing tasks together will benefit social circles of society in the long run.",
        "Finally, working in batches can lead to progress of organization.As, when various experts will make efforts to join a task which ultimately lead to the development of the organization.",
        "To sum up, I believe that I completely agree with this statement, not only because of the convenience in task achievement and enhancements in social interactions but also because of ultimate benefit for organization."
