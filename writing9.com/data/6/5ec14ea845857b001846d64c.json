        "Parents can have crucial roles in their children\u2019s education. They can motive their children about their results at school, and they can force them to study hard, which can have many side effects on them.",
        "It is on the one hand obvious that some parents think if their children get better marks at school, they can have better lives in the future. Some parents opine putting pressure on children causes they get better results at school. These parents are not moreover aware of the side effects of this method. They also believe if their children cannot get full marks at school, they will not have bright futures. Taking a weak student as a clear example; their parents may think their son will not be successful in the future unless he passes all school subjects with high marks, in this case, parents force him to perform more than his capability.",
        "It is on the other hand clear that parents have major roles in children\u2019s education. One of the most important roles that parents can play in their child\u2019s education is motivating them. Parents can furthermore teach their children that there is always room for improvement in their work in courses. They can also guide their children through their school subjects. A girl having learning difficulty in mathematics can be an example; her parents can motivate that girl to deal with the learning difficulty in some practical ways.",
        "In conclusion, parents have determined roles in their child\u2019s education. Some parents want to guarantee their children\u2019s futures by putting pressure on them, but I personally believe, parents can motivate children to learn school subjects by their hearts which is a more practical way than putting pressure on them."
