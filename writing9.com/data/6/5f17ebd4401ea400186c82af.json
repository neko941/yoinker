        "It is argued by some people that the government should be responsible for education and healthcare costs for the sake of the citizens. Others, however, believe that everyone should share this burden. In my standpoint, I totally agree with the latter.",
        "On the one hand, the state is thought to bear the costs of schooling and health services due to some reasons. First and foremost, education is undoubtedly considered to be one of the leading factors for the sustainable development of a country. Because of this, the government should ensure a wider range of public access to proper schooling, irrespective of any backgrounds by defraying all the tuition fees for people. More essentially, this investment has a fundamental impact on the national economic progress as it helps create a strong intellectual workforce in the foreseeable future. Secondly, with regard to healthcare services, we cannot deny that medical treatments are criminally expensive, which has become more of a challenge for low-income households. Were there to be a great source of state funds for these services, then they would be further more accessible to the general public, thus improving their health and raising their overall life expectancy.",
        "On the other hand, in spite of some aforementioned reasons, I would argue that both school and health fees should be paid by the citizens themselves. To start with, there would be an enormous strain on government budgets if education and healthcare service were given without any charges. In fact, when governments allocate finite national resources to covering tuition fees and healthcare expenses, other sectors of the economy would have to suffer. Secondly, in terms of individuals, bearing those costs themselves plays a crucial role in raising their own awareness of both their health condition and schooling. In other words, knowing that it will cost a fortune for hospitalization, people will pay more attention to their healthy lifestyles by adopting balanced diets, playing more sports and doing more regular workouts. Last but not least, holding a sense of responsibility for paying tuition fees assists learners in  building their own personal learning discipline, therefore motivating them to attend classes more frequently and avoid playing truant.",
        "All things considered, although there are some persuasive reasons why the state should grant its citizens the costs of education and healthcare systems, I firmly believe that it would be much better for people to spend money on those services."
