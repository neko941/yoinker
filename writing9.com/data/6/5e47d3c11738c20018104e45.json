        "There is a massive range of materials available to the modern teacher in this digital era, and the correct selection plays a key role to succeed the teaching-learning process. I agree that course books are more suitable, despite the many benefit of internet when it comes to conduct teaching-learning process.",
        "Firstly, course books (whether digital or printed books) are carefully designed by pedagogical experts to satisfy learning objectives. Prior to its publishing, a research is frequently conducted to see the real needs among schoolers based on their level and to discover the best possible approach and subsequently create the most suitable materials. The course books are also integrated with comprehensive assessment method which allows teachers to measure pupils\u2019 development once they have completed a particular topic within a syllabus. In addition, the course books are enriched with various examples and exercises, leading the students to practice independently. For this reason, the existence of modern book will be much more beneficial not only because of its comprehensive system but also its contents are set to make students more active. Getting involved in a study group, they will be much more engaged in learning process rather than just listening passively to their teacher\u2019s explanation like what is usually illustrated by the old-fashioned root learning method.",
        "Secondly, it is absolutely true that the internet will be invaluable for adult learners (especially for distance learning or self-study) where they can discriminate which information that is useful to supplement their knowledge. However, we should not assume that young learners are ready to do this since it requires comprehensive knowledge and logical thinking.",
        "In conclusion, it appears that the use of course books, with their comprehensive system and depth material, are more suitable because they are set to be integral part of the syllabus. The use of the internet can be judged useful if it used wisely and under supervision, especially for young learners."
