        "In today's modern era, it is agreed that people are using computers and the internet for almost everything ranging from looking at a cooking recipe to learning the language. Therefore, I agree that people don't need to waste their time learning a foreign language because the computer helps to translate every word efficiently because of its time consuming, stressful, and require cash.",
        "In my opinion, learning a new language is a time taking process. Every language has its dialects, phonetics, and many other aspects that learners have to consider. Also, every word has a typical way of pronunciation, making it difficult for the learner to imitate. As a result, the listener will not understand the speaker. Eventually, the learner who spent a lot of time will go in vain. To illustrate, it's not mandatory to learn mandarin who wants to establish a business in China because due to the availability of numerous digital applications, which can translate every word, and a person can communicate fairly easily.",
        "Learning a new language can be stressful. People cannot spend their leisure time with family and friends with a piece of mind. I believe people can use this precious time to meditate or some relaxing activity instead of learning a foreign language.Instead can use a mobile application to translate if needed.",
        "Also, learning a language can cost a reasonable amount of money. In many circumstances, students have to take expensive language learning courses with books, and some teaching institutes offer the mandatory paid mock test. Therefore I believe rather wasting money, use the translator devices, which would be the one-time investment.",
        "In conclusion, instead of wasting time, money, and energy in learning language, utilize the computer."
