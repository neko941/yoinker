        "The Members of Logan are divided on the issue of representation in the public network. \"Our position between Brisbane and the Gold Coast, combined with our connectivity and our diverse, professional community, provides us with a forum to success in our potential as a creative, vibrant future region\" (CEO Silvio Trinca Region of Logan, 2018). The media disadvantaged people of the community through prejudice and reinforced stereotypes. This essay provides some cases and example, the media has revealed Logan on the basis of stereotypes and discriminatory attitudes toward Logan City, and it\u2019s focusing only on certain people.",
        "The media disadvantage the depiction of Logan by representing Logan based on stereotypes and discriminatory attitudes towards Logan City. To clarify, Google reported that Logan City is the most terrible area in Brisbane, and that the \"clashes\" people are living in Woodridge (Logan City suburb), and the online urban dictionary categorized Logan people as a \"bogan\"(R. Wickes 2013). While Rebecca Wickes \u2013 a lecture in a Criminology / Science Fellows at the University of Queensland \u2013 stated this identifies are \u201cat least in part, biased.\u201dIt suggests that Google and the online urban dictionary websites are media sources that they falsely portrayed people living in the Logan community by simply identifying people in the Logan people relied on stereotypes. In 2020, on Chronicle\u2019s website, N. Brown launched an article in which Furphy and Rissole claimed and ranked Logan City as the worst place in Australia in 2019. The reasons given for their claim were that \"the entire council was sacked for alleged corruption\" and during a bushfire a \"grub stolen 1,000 litres of water.\" People in Logan society as well have \"common hobbies\" of \"shit-faced\" and attacking people with wood strikes. They are committing ram raids in hot-wired Holden, Honda civics, and intergenerational welfare dependency.\u201d All the reasons given were evidently from \"a pair wrote in a city review.\" This clearly shows that, formed on the views of others, Logan City was rendered by the Chronicle website to be one of the most awful city in Australia. Through the depiction of the city as the most unpleasant area established on stereotypes and discriminatory attitudes towards Logan City, many news outlets thus disadvantaged Logan\u2019s representation.",
        "In addition proven to my claim that Logan's portrayal is disadvantaged by the media, it has only focused on certain people to represent Logan. In 2009, NewsComAu revealed Deakin University's damning survey and Australian Unity insurer found \"Logan City delivered Queensland's lowest \"personal wellness index\" score and Australia's sixth lowest.\" The media also shared the perspective of Logan Mayor Pam Parker on Logan City, \"What makes Logan different is not just its beautiful venue, it's the people and the community spirit that's second to none,\" and that Logan has got a whole lot better in recent years. The publisher, however, released the article entitled \"Logan City's \u201cunhappiest\u201d urban area  to live in Queensland,\" consequently demonstrating that the NewsComAu depicted Logan in a derogatory way assumed from solely on Deakin University's survey and Australian Unity insurer. In 2014, Ahuri published report and stated, \"Interview participants reported drug-related crime issues, including vehicle and property offences in the area. But most acknowledged low perceptions of community safety in the area.\u201d Deakin University's survey shows, Logan area is not safe because it has lack of security. But because the study was conducted by \"interview participants,\" the research focused on only certain people rather than a whole community. In 2018 NewsComAu again published an article showing a picture of money on the floor in a letter \"South Side 4114 *.\" The title was named \u201cBrazen youth ganges terrorising Brisbane\" representing Logan City's perception. It indicates that this media has focused only on these people to demonstrate Logan City in a negative way. By concentrating on certain people, many media outlets have damaged Logan by portraying the city negatively.",
        "To sum up, the representatives of Logan City were disadvantaged as the media based on negative stereotypes and discriminatory attitudes toward the city, and focused only on certain individuals. In consequence, it is clear that the concept of 'Bogan,' 'Clash', a common 'shit-faced,' and the worst city to live in, depicted by Google, the online urban dictionary, the Chronicle, the NewsComAu, and the Ahur cannot be support that Logan is the worst place to live in. It is clear that after a thorough analysis on this subject, the media has importance roles in the present and inform correct information."
