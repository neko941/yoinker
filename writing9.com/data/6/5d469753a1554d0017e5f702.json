        "It is irrefutable to say that children are the future of the nation and if they started job early  without high skills and maturity.  then the  nation's future gets in a dangerous  direction.  So,  Government bans the underage  children for getting full-time employment or jobs in some countries.  I am totally agree with the statement.  My inclination to the statement justified in the following paragraphs.",
        "There are  so many good reasons for prohibiting the underage children for getting full-time employment.  Firstly,  growth issue. If children get a permanent job with small qualification. After some years, the growth or promotion chance  will be less because of qualification constraints.  Although, children won't not enhanced it.  Example as if a children work as  a labourer in a factory, but they will not become a manager of the company because of qualification issue and changing skill.",
        "On the other hand, children age to learn and get the skill. By this I believe that  children do study  and go to school and university.  So,  if they get a permanent job, it's not easy for him to get further study.  Thus, children to get  some  experience for the job and then proceed to further study which makes it life brighter.  The small job detrimental  the  child's life. The growth of the nation which not increase as expected and  economics of the  country could be low.  And last  it is difficult to survive this type of jobs.",
        "I am totally agree with the government step to banning the underage children to get permanent jobs."
