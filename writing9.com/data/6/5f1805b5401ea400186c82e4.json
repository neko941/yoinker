        "Traffic congestion is a major concern in metropolitan cities and towns. It increase the time cost of travellers to go to different destinations. However, most urban areas have not yet had the solution to solve this traffic problem.",
        "The popularise phenomenon of car ownership increase the number of cars sharply in these two decades. Lower manufacture cost of producing a car allows the general public to buy a private car at a cheaper price. With the increase of accessibility of private vehicles, more workers tend to drive their cars to work and send their children to school. Consequently, the highways and roads in urban districts are over-burden that they cannot handle such high volume of traffic. Traffic congestion then happens more frequently that the travelling time cost increases.",
        "The deteriorating situation of road congestion urges the government to control the rising number of vehicles. The authority should increase the tax of automobile ownership to reduce the accessibility and affordability of cars. Meanwhile, encouragement on taking public transport such as underground and bus can alleviate the traffic burden especially in the peak hours. Besides, the government can subsidise the public transport to provide a better price of travelling fees to increase the financial incentives of the general public to give up buying a private car. Not only do the price of purchasing a car rise, but also the public transportation fee decline, the traffic problem can be solved.",
        "In conclusion, traffic jam is becoming more serious in the places all around the world because of the large-scale production of private cars. The governments in different nations should take control on the car ownership to prevent further deterioration of transportation problems."
