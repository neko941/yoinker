        "There is no doubt that throughout the last decade, the rise of living standards has turned human lives into new pages, especially entertainment industry, which has been known for its glamor. It is generally believed that with full of money and fame, celebrities can live happily ever after, however, it is not.  From my perspective, I strongly advocate with the idea that despite richness as well as reputation, stars are not satisfied with their own lives, which serves as the cost of popularity.",
        "More specifically, celebrities do not lead happy lives in terms of privacy loss and heavy pressure. First, considering privacy, being famous mean being kept an eye on everywhere. There are thousands of times we found Justin Bieber feel annoyed being followed by paparazzi through streets or even on his way home, for example. It is apparent that media, press are making profit by putting more emphasis on private lives of stars than ever, which can cause serious privacy invasion. Second, regarding heavy stresses, the more famous stars are, the more pressure they are put under. Stresses come from different factors such as family responsibilities or fans' expectations and even rumors. Therefore, celebrities nowadays have to cope with so many problems that they end up using alcohol or drugs as a way of escaping from this heartless society.",
        "From my point of view, an unpleasant life is the price for their reputation. As we all know, putting one leg in this industry means trade the freedom and ordinary lifestyle in turn of fame and money. Taylor Swift, for instance, is caught on secret dating with her boyfriend by bombarding of paparazzi. Moreover, being rich and gain publicity as being role models, obviously public are willing to dig deeper hole in celebs daily routines out of curiosity. A typical example of this is Shawn Mendes, the more popular his songs are, the more fans want to know about his daily lives.",
        "In a nutshell, both private life and pressure are two most outstanding reasons lead to dissatisfaction in celebs' lives and that are what they have to trade for being a public figure."
