        "Digital development nowadays has some impacts on education in many countries. One of these effects is the approach/pathway people adopt/take/are offered towards higher/further education at the ultimate academic institutions of universities and colleges.  These days, some universities have started to open courses online so that students can study from their homes. In my opinion, this is an innovation of  education; however, we also need to consider their drawbacks to the university system.",
        "Nobody can deny the convenience of online courses at the university. The first reason to be discussed is that taking online courses is time-saving. Travelling to school does not seem to be an issue to students living nearby but it is a huge deterrent to those who have to spend hours commuting to school. By applying for online courses, students are encouraged to learn  suitable courses without worrying about the distance from their house to the university. Secondly, online courses provide learners with more flexible time to study. Students can arrange their schedule to make full use of their time and obtain/acquire extensive knowledge in their specialized field while they still have time to relax after studying. On the other hand, there are negative sides of online courses that also need to be considered. Firstly, this course limits the direct interaction between the students and their classmates. There are other things besides the knowledge that the learners will take after the course, such as communication skills or team-working skills. These soft skills can only be practised when people actually talk to each other in person. Secondly, everyone is not supposed to have the same ability of self-study, which makes the results can differ among the students. Online courses are a considerably alternative for a well-organized person while they can cause failure for lazy students. In conclusion, online course is a huge step in the development of education, which can take all advantage of students. However, those who have no motivation to learn by themselves had better apply for courses at the campus because they can receive  encouragement from friends and lecturers there."
