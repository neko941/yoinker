        "The world population is growing for decades. Some people believe the increasing rate of people on our planet will end up with a global crisis. I totally agree with this opinion and I will explain why in this essay.",
        "The main reason I believe the inflation of world\u2019s population is insupportable, and will lead to a global crisis, is because of the natural resources. As all the scientists know, natural resources of our planet are not limitless, therefore with the population in a continuous growing is impossible to sustain that world economy. It a natural course for the planet resources to be required in bigger quantities if our population is in a growing process, but as it has been demonstrated by studies, world reserves are not to be forever. For example, take coal; this mineral resource is used in multiple industries, and now at days because population has increased, is consumed in even larger quantities. Because of this influence that the large number of people has, coal will bean extinguish mineral, thus the main resource of industry will stop to exist resulting a global economy.",
        "Another reason for which I agree the world merge into a global crisis because of the humans consuming and wasting. Numerous studies have shown that world agriculture now at this moment cannot sustain the world increasing population, therefore with such a big problem laying in our back it will be just a matter of time until universal crisis will affect us. To illustrate people, consume a lot, but they also waist a lot; markets are now filled with outstanding offers of their product, making them cheap and easy for people to buy in large quantities, even though, they don\u2019t need. Increasing population means more consuming and more waist, and all this in the end leads into a global crisis.",
        "In conclusion I totally agree with world economy is suffering because of the increased number of people, therefore natural resources and human waste should be watched and controlled with a higher attention."
