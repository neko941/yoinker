        "I sometimes change my daily routine. If it is a weekday, and I am on leave that day, I probably break the routine and have fun doing something I like.",
        "No, my daily routine has been different when I was a child because I was neither studying nor working. I just used to play games and watch cartoons all day.",
        "It depends on who you are and what you are doing. If you are not a very busy person and have a very busy schedule, it is better to have a routine for managing your time wisely. On the other hand, if the situation is not like that, you don't need to do the same thing every day at the same time because it is boring, and it may lead you to depression."
