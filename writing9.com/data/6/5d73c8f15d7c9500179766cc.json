        "Various conflicts are going around the world,due to which government of many  countries impose sactions on people for their safety.Some people think that government imposed sactions on young people after dawn is acceptable.However,I disagree the above line of thought,and belive that infringes the right of freedom and better police protection during nights will solve the problem.",
        "To begin with,young people should not be bound by restriction.Our forefathers have fought long battles so that everyone would live a free life .If there is no freedom, then the  person will not develop into a mature and fearless beingand perhaps may be aggresive to society.To illustrate this ,many convicts who have been booked for petty crimes, after serving in confinement become more aggresive and commit more henious crimes later on.Hence, it is necessary for teens to be given their own freedom.",
        "Furthermore,People of young ages ,particulary teens are adventurous in nature hence will venture out at night without permission of their gaurdains.Our modern society should understand their nature  and should have tight patrols in nights for their protection,since there might be some time that a kid would be in unfavorable situation.For example,one of my cousin's kid went out at night for a party with his friend ,but while coming back to home he fell into a ditch.Since his leg got hurt, he could not comeout.but fortunately a patrolling policeman heard his cry and saved him from ditch.So, it is necessary to have proper police protection inspite of curfew.",
        "In a nutshell,a curfew is not needed in developed society such as America.To encourage maturity and fearlessness young ones should be given freedom toexplore and enjoy their lives.And for their proctection,a proper police function at nights is required."
