        "In the present age, taking a job for some years between university and high school is playing an increasingly important role in students \u2018life. Whether, it is a blessing or a curse has sparked a lot of debate in our society. Some people agree that taking a job has many advantages in our community. While, Others argue that taking a job before university has a lot of harm as well. In this essay, I will discuss two points.",
        "A convincing argument has been made that taking a job between university and high school has many advantages. To start with, the students who work in a specialized job, they intend to work in after university, will be more experienced at this field. They will acquire more and more skills as speaking fluently and communicating with others. In addition to, financial factor plays a great role. Students who work gain more money to live better and pay for their study in university. Furthermore, taking a job before university will help the students get jobs after finishing university easily as they have both experience and qualifications.",
        "Admittedly, profit driven from work before university has widely affected young people, especially when they end up their study forever and never returning to study. Interims of enjoyment of work life they decide to continue to work instead of boring study. Another disadvantage is losing of good study habits and forgetting study and learning. Moreover, they will be involved in work field and gaining more money to improve their life. For example, they will be able to buy whatever they need through work which provided them with money.",
        "In conclusion, I am convinced that human being should have their own choice, luckily, there are holidays to work and gain some experience and money at the same time. In my opinion, the advantages of having a job far outweigh the disadvantages."
