        "It is a common belief that higher studies provide better jobs. However, some people opine that university education offers more benefits than improved career prospects. This essay will discuss both the views in detail.",
        "On the one hand, education provides knowledge and wisdom. Knowledge in turn boosts one\u2019s self confidence which reflects in one\u2019s personality. It also develops sound understanding of the subject. All of these are instrumental and crucial to acquire a suitable job. Moreover, in today\u2019s competitive world only the best will win. Hence a person lacking proper qualification and sufficient knowledge will lose the race and lag behind. A recent study by \u2018Education Forum\u2019 magazine suggests that the service sector recruited 75% graduates and 25% undergraduates the last year. This in itself shows how important higher education is to acquire a good job.",
        "On the other hand, education not only benefits one\u2019s career but also changes their outlook towards life and society. Knowledge helps to develop strong reasoning and analytical skills. This empowers people with the ability to distinguish between right and wrong, good and bad. Educated people refrain themselves from blindly following any superstitious beliefs. One educated person can educate the entire family and their surroundings. Moreover, knowledge develops moral values of people and makes them responsible citizens. For instance, if we look back at history the great Raja Rammohun Roy and Vidyasagar struggled hard to eradicate social evils like SuttidahaPratha, child marriage etcetera. And they were all well qualified people who fought against such social norms which were very common those days.",
        "To conclude, I am of the opinion that University education has a larger role to play than just provide good jobs to people."
