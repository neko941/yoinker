        "Secondly, I will explain you the plan and facilities of this new apartment. It is very spacious with a living room, three spacious bedrooms with a beautiful view and attached washrooms, one dining hall with an open modular kitchen, two balconys and a large wash area. Another good thing about this house is it is fully furnished. I have a maid and helper too. Previously, there was no availability of helpers in the old house.",
        "In addition to this, this apartment has also a play area for children and a swimming pool with regular measures and hygeine. A super market is located in the ground floor with all groceries, dairy products, bakery and confectionery products, vegetables, fruits and all household items. For gatherings and parties we have a mini bar and restaurant. I am really enjoying every day here. It is very pleasant and peaceful.",
        "It will be my pleasure if you come here and stay with me for few days. We will have a good time. So plan a week at your convenience and come down. I will be waiting for you baby.",
