The accommodation which has been allocated to me is too far from the university and I have to travel 3 hours in total per day. Apart from the traveling issue, there so much noise coming from the nearby society due to construction work going on day and night.",

Probably, it would reduce my transportation cost and simultaneously decrease my travel time and I would be able to concentrate on my studies in a much better way.",
