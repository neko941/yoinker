        "Nowadays, in some ,countries the young generation population overtakes the old ones. Some people think that time situation can bring more benefits to the countries. This essay will discuss the advantages of this situation is outweigh the deaverages. The essay will first demonstrate that the more younger adults it has in the countries the more benefits can be added. Next, the essay will illustrate the drawbacks and negative impacts of this situation.",
        "First, the benefit of the relatively larger number of young adults are it will decline the pressure on every young people. In this modern world, some countries\u2019 children rate population had declined significantly, such as Japan or Taiwan, the rate of children  per woman is only less than 1. This means that in this recent years, women dislike having children, in the future children will decline whereas due to  medical development the older people rate will increase. To take care of those older people, every young people pressure will increase. Therefore, having a high number of young adults is good for society and as a ,result there will have more people who can look after the older.",
        "On the other hand, high numbers of young adults mean that the work opportunity of each people will decline. There is going to have lots of people who contend with the work opportunity because the numbers of work might not increase. However, this situation will not be a serious problem, it is possible that in the future the work opportunity will increase and will have various kinds of work involved.",
        "In conclusion, countries include a relatively large number of young generation than the number of old people advantages outweigh the disadvantages. The more  young people there are the less pressure will be taken on looking after older people."
