        "Dear Mr. Walter,",
        "I am Charvi Patel pursuing a specialised course in Marketing Management. I am here for the short term course of 3 months sponsored by my company Kaizen consultancy. I am writing to bring into notice about the several difficulties I am facing here at the accommodation.",
        "Let me explain, because of the fellow flatmates I am feeling disinclined towards studies and which is creating negative impact. We are four flatmates in total and other three are here for the training course of computer skills for which they are not at all serious about studies. Moreover, all the time they does disturbing activities such as partying at our place, playing video games, calling their friends and chit-chats for hours.",
        "As a result, it is directly affects my studies as I always quest for tranquillity for better concentration. However, while providing me the residence I was told to that the other flatmates would also be of the same course stream and a personal room will be allotted which is not the thing.",
        "I would be glad if I am relocated to another room where I can have the room for myself, or I may use the money kept for accommodation for hotel payment.",
        "I look forward to hear from you at the earliest.",
