        "In the modern age, children are likely to be putted under pressure from their parents. In my opinion, this is because the pride of the modern families has been linked more deeply with the children, and this is a negative movement for their development.",
        "Children recently are becoming the representative of their families. Their parents will take their grades and achievements at school as a symbol of the talent and hard-working of the whole family. Therefore, their parent\u2019s expectation for their children has increased significantly since the education system evolved to be more challenging to students. In our country, high school students must always strive for an \u201cExcellent student\u201d certificate, otherwise they will be classified as an odd individual of the family. This trend has forced us to study harder, and putted us under constant pressure throughout the entire high school period.",
        "This trend is having a negative impact to the development of normal children. Youngsters who haven\u2019t developed a strong mindset can easily suffer from mental diseases such as depression or mind-retarded if they have too much stress. Moreover, forcing students to overwork prevents them from having the pleasure of participating in social activities. This will isolate them from the community, restrict their relationships, or even trigger autism. At the very least, children working productivity will decline significantly when they are under pressure.",
        "In conclusion, parents are putting an overwhelming responsibility on children when making them the representative of the family, and this will affect children\u2019s growth in a negative way."
