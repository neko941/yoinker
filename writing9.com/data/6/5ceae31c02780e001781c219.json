        "Budget utilization by countries requires careful decisions. Although it is commonly stated that states utilized behemoth amount of money to ensure the safety of wildlife other sectors are more crucial to look after. I partially agree with the statement, and in my opinion, governments should spend little amount of money on wild animals protections and more on other sectors such as health and education.",
        "Admittedly, there ought to be some basic amount of utilization of money on the survival and betterment of wildlife. Wild animal habitat protection and maintenance is beneficial, in terms of the flourishing of tourism. Which in turn means, the economic growth of a country, as tourists influx can lead significantly to more revenue generation. For example, the economic organization of Indonesia has revealed a report that, the country has gain 5% increase in revenue, with the greatest wild living manifestation the country possess. Therefore, allocating a little amount of cost is advantageous up to some extent for a country.",
        "However, the government should consider and utilize major amount of money on other critical areas such as education and health. Firstly, spending enormous amount of finance on learning sector is vitally important, as more literate number of people means the prospering of a society. Which in turn means, high employment and working for the development of a country. Secondly, health sector ought to be taken in to consideration highly while utilizing money. This is because this area faces certain problems such as lack of proper medical equipment and different medicines, especially in underdeveloped countries. In Pakistan, for instance, the government is allocating 33% of budget on the medical sector, owing to the rising problems in it. Thus, money should be spend in areas which are more vital by the state.",
        "In conclusion, people believe that countries spend more on unimportant sector like wildlife and other crucial areas are there which should not be neglected. In my view, states ought to allocate minor amount on wild living sector and significant amount on other essential areas like medical and education."
