        "Nowadays, the majority of people are confused between going out or cooking at home. Many people said that having homemade food is a waste of time and eating at good restaurants is much better. I firmly agree that preparing and consuming meals at home is a better alternative than dining out in restaurants.",
        "",
        "Firstly, home-cooked meals are the main source of healthier food because fresh and clean ingredients like organic food can be used in any meal. In contrast, many restaurants even a good one still use frozen ingredients, preservatives to keep the good looking and the good taste of the food. Secondly, you can easily control your economy and also saving some money because you don't have to pay for tips. For example, when you having a meal in any restaurant you must pay a higher price for the same home-cooked meal because of the service taxes.",
        "",
        "However, some people believe that going to a restaurant can save many times and homemade food is not as good as a restaurant meal. Nowadays many pages like 5 minutes craft, Russian hack can help you to cook from scratch so it is very easy to do it yourself and there are many simple recipes for you to try out. Take myself as an example, currently, I am a student and I have to cook lunch alone for myself every single day and it only takes about 15 to 20 minutes to prepare a good meal.",
        "",
        "In conclusion, I strongly believe that cooking and dining at home is better than having food in restaurants; people can have healthy meals and save money in the process. But sometimes going to a restaurant to chill out is not a bad idea."
