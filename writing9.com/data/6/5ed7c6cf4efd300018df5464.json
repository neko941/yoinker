        "As the advance of the transport industry and the commonness of the vehicles, there is a growing requirement for fuel. Consequently, it is essential to discover more sources from those distant and unspoiled regions. Some people strong believe that it can benefited the entire mankind, while others oppose with this statement. The idea of both sides with my own opinion together will be further discussed and elaborated in this essay.",
        "Sustaining the productivity of a nation as well as the development of the global economy has always been the primary reason for unearthing a new petroleum field. For instance, the popularity of air travelling enables us to travel back and forth to different countries within a day. It is not only providing the mobility for people and goods, but also delivering funds and aides to faraway countries with needs. As a result, it will ultimately improve and  facilitate the living standard of the whole human beings.",
        "On the contrary, unduly digging out the gasoline will engender the depletion of the natural resources and bring a number of destructive consequences. Take Australia wildfires as an example, it was fuelled by the record-breaking temperatures and months of severe drought that caused immense casualties and damages, not to mention with destroying a vast of inhabiting areas for koalas. Accordingly, excessive use of fossil fuel can accelerate the speed of global warming and then resulted to climate change, rising sea level, and the extinction of many species.",
        "To sum up, the two sides of view argue the possible merits and demerits of finding out a new place for gas and oil. However, after analysing both sides that it is crystal clear to me that the drawbacks of immoderate exploitation of oil are far more than its benefits."
