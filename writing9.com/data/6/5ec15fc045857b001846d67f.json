        "The trend of shopping is growing rapidly among people. Many people consider pleasure time while others say that it is the waste of time. So, in this essay I will discuss my both views and als give some suggestions.",
        "As the world gets a vast people\u2019s perception has changed a lot. Firstly, There are huge amount of  shopping malls to attract people especially women.However, they do enjoy shopping with their family and friends. Other than that many companies offers a variety of discounts on stores, credit cards which appeal young generation. So they will not do shopping just for themselves  but also for others. The vogue shopping has an impact great for consumers. Their sales are increasing quickly which may be also beneficial for employers.",
        "On the other hand people have less interest in other healthy leisure activities. Such as many gyms, sports club is mostly empty because they prefer to go shopping mall. Many years back people used to play games to stay healthy. Like tennis, cricket, badminton but now shopping trend has destroyed all these activities.In the same way they give less attention to their kids. Because they become Shopaholic. Kids are now under the care of maids. The training of kids is not going well due to lack of care.",
        "In concluding, I would say that everything should have limits. Shopping should be much as needs.We do not spend our whole spare time on shopping. We should adopt a healthy life by playing games and spend our precious time with our families."
