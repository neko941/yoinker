        "It is argued by some that printed newspapers and books might be declined in their popularity due to being out of date. This essay will elaborate on some reasons behind the viewpoint before forecasting the future of those physical communications from my perspective.",
        "To begin with, proponents have their points in believing that traditional media is obsolete. First, in today\u2019s digital era, there exists an increasing tendency of taking advantage of online platforms to collect information. It seems to be understandable due to the fact that to cope with the fast-paced of life, people might be reluctant to look for information physically. Instead, with some clicks of mouse, users can easily obtain a sheer volume of information on the Internet regardless of time and location. The ease of accessing to news or worldwide knowledge through online media therefore drives people to think that printed newspaper and books are out-dated. Second, there is no denying that modern devices offer us great chances to get the updated and latest news across the globe, compared to hardcopy versions of newspaper which carry limits on the level of updating breaking news. The irony is that none of people want to become a person left behind, so they opt for reading online newspapers rather than conventional counterparts to catch up with others",
        "However, despite the above mentioned arguments, I believe that newspapers and books somehow still secure their own place in contemporary society. The underlying reason could be that conventional media can be still considered as the primary sources of information and some mainly rely on them to obtain news. As a matter of fact, many tabloids appearing on the online platforms are to instil fear into people\u2019s mind, causing misunderstanding among society. Consequently, choosing to read printed newspapers and books which are imposed strict censorship by editorial offices is a safer option. Nevertheless, I bet that online newspapers and electronic books might be predominant in the foreseeable future, which reflects the nature of the cutting-edge world. They are highly likely to replace the role of printed ones owing to its flexibility and appeal. The experience of reading online news offers us favourable condition to enjoy vivid images and abundant video materials, opposed to the tediousness of newspapers and printed books. Therefore, the prevalence of digital platforms might keep going later",
        "In conclusion, the level of updating news and ability to access the news lead people to think that reading printed newspapers and books is out of date. Yet, I believe that traditional media still exists defying the change of time and people\u2019s lifestyle along with the dominance of online newspapers and digital books."
