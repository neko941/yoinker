        "It is certainly true that when searching for an occupation,  people usually take into account salary that they earn from job. Some consider that income is the top priority. In my point of view, I believe that money as a demeaning as an important factor, but other aspects also are considerable.   It is clearly undeniable that money or \u201cliving wage\u201d have an important impact on people\u2019s live. The reason for that is all of us also need money to cover the running costs of our lives on a regular basis. In particular, every single month we spend an amount of payment for daily food, housing, commuting, or some entertainments. Therefore, we cannot image the absence of it, people need to pay for their private needs or take care their family. That may be the reason why some people emphasize money when seeking a job.   In addition, I personally think that we still have necessary perspectives beside the importance of money. After graduating tertiary education, people continue to pursue their dream with formal qualifications in order to seek a suitable occupation. Money is no doubt one of essential expectation of workers who will be eligible to receive, but it is obvious that we still have other aspects such as job satisfaction and career prospects. We all hope to achieve work-life balance more than a job that  controls us and provides us with heavy workload although we earn high income in this job. Moreover, No one wants to be seen as a burden or being burden of someone else, especially under intensive pressure when working and thus people should promote their job satisfaction.   In conclusion, I strongly believe that people should consider other priorities beside the income from work in order to balance the scale of their life."
