Individuals, who are born in middle and lower classes of society, often put in more efforts in their studies because they do not want to live in their current conditions anymore, whereas many rich people lack the same type of motivation because they are less ambitious.

If people work hard, they will be recognized for their efforts, and it would improve their results in exams and boost their job prospects.
