        "The drastic power of atoms are flourishing by improvements. Despite the dangers, and risks, the utility of nuclear technology clearly outweighs any drawbacks. This, I feel, is a valid point, and there are two reasons for the said advantages.",
        "To embark on, the asserting of a nuclear plant is quite impressive to use these days, Yet, the possession of its technology is having more beneficial for two reasons: infinite energy source and environmental friendly. Firstly, Atom particles of a nuclear is colliding constantly to an infinitude. Producing endless energy,  Atomic power plant takes the lead in the context of renewable source of power. For example, the use of electricity, machines, and warfare equipment are fueled by this reactor and according to the World Health Organization (WHO), Neutron Factory is currently the most efficient power plant in history of mankind since the very first atomic bomb was blasted decades ago. Actually, only 3% of the world has operated this power plant and the rest 98% of them were coal, geothermal and solar energy.",
        "Secondly, waste products were disposed appropriately in accordance to the standard protocol and the government is ensuring the public safety of this hazardous material not to contaminate the environment. For instance, if the toxic fumes has dispersed rapidly into the air, then an automatic chemical spray is released to counteract  the deleterious compounds of the gas; Thereby, International Standard Organization (ISO) has granted certificates to the nation who operates a nuclear power plant.",
        "To recapitulate, the massive menace of a nuclear power is drastically affected by the modern society, Yet, I believe the notion that it has more positive impact than its drawback."
