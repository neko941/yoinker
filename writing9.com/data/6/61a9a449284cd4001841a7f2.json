        "It is often said that living in other country where you should speak language except for your mother language can cause not only practical problems but also serious social problems. I completely agree with this statement.",
        "First of all, it is possible that you feel lonely and become depressed. Because I believe good communication, speaking the same language, is very important for building good relationships because it is necessary to understand the person well. For instance, you may spend alone at home on holiday unless you have friends who live in same country. If you do that for a long time, you could get mental illnesses. However, the opportunity to hang out with those friends will be increased by speaking the country language.",
        "Moreover, when you face some troubles, it is difficult for you to tell your opinion or the situation correctly. To give an example, the stuff which you bought is broken can be exchange or refunded. In this case, you should tell the staff about problems of the product. Yet, if you cannot do that, you have to receive broken one. Therefore, the ability to tell situation like that is important not to be at a disadvantage.",
        "Having considered all the arguments above, it can be said that the serious social problems are caused as well as practical problems if you live in a country where you should speak foreign language. However, I believe learning language spoken in the country is helpful to make your life there better."
