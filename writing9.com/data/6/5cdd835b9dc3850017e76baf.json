        "In this era of technological advancement, although the print and electronic media is becoming a vital source of information for general public, yet people are having doubts about authenticity of news. People should trust the correspondents for their hard work as disinformation are generally from managerial levels and reporters should also be well educated and aware of their responsibilities to excel in their field.",
        "It is a well-known fact that journalism is not an easy field as they have to risk their lives and work hard to update their audience and readers about different situations, so we should acknowledge their work and boost their confidence by trusting them. As no one is flawless, so they can also make mistakes but these are not deliberate and margin of error should be given to them. Moreover most of errors are from content managers or owners, so this should not affect the credibility of a reporter. For instance, recently in Pakistan, a well-known newspaper published some news about a political party which later on proved false, on investigation the fault was of the proof reader, not the journalist.",
        "The correspondents should also take responsibility to win the trust of their followers by opting some qualities. Firstly they should have proper knowledge of their field, as some people are joining media without having adequate knowledge of this field and the result is overall bad image of whole community. Secondly, they should do research about every news before presenting to the people, as in this fast paced age, everyone wants real news, not breaking news. For instance, many surveys conducted in various media houses have shown that there is a remarkable rating difference between shows of professional anchors and nonprofessional ones.",
        "To conclude, currently many people are relying on media for informations despite of their reservations on their genuineness. But we should trust journalists for the hard work and efforts they made for  us but they should also have thorough knowledge of their field and circumstances. to win trust of people."
