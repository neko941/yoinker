        "Over the last few decades, the world has seen that it is extremely crucial to educate children. Some say that parents and teachers need punishment to teach their child.  In my opinion, it is agreed that punishment is necessary for adults to make their child more mature. This essay will firstly discuss the benefits of punishment then outline some ways they should do.",
        "One of the principal advantages of punishment is time-saving. This is because of the fact that when children make mistakes, parents have several ways to teach them, In this case, punishment is the most effective way which parents would have less time to train and talk to their son. Instead of making children to understand by theory, punishment help them keep it in mind more easier because they have the memories about wrong work.",
        "Moreover, another benefit is that it is convenient. According to Family News, more than 45% parents choose punishment as the way they teach their child about what should do and what should not do. This approach has a positive effect on children's mental attitudes towards their study. As a result, it prevents children from making mistakes which should widen their knowledge about life.",
        "There is a wide range of approach to punish children, except for hurting them. Parents should do way like taking children in a quite room and let they think about what they did or do not accept what they want to have. And then, introducing them about laws and raise their awareness of wrong things.",
        "To sum up, it is agreed that punishment is one of the best ways to educate the young, but we should avoid hitting them because it may destroy the bond."
