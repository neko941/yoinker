        "It is often believed that the technology advancement in the field of cell phones eliminates the social interaction. It makes the people physically less and digitally more social. I completely agree with the notion and will discuss the reason in the below paragraphs.",
        "To begin with, the smartphones nowadays are becoming more popular among each and every one. Every individual has a mobile phone whether a younger or elder one. Due to this device people are becoming less social. They use to do chats on social media platform like what's app, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat but they do not want to talk to the person sitting besides him. Let us take an example, during the past day, in the festive season, everyone used to visit their friends or family house. Now they only wish by sending the bulk of messages to each other. So it completely changes the society.",
        "Moreover, children are also busy to play the games on smartphones instead of playing the outdoor games with their friends. They are busy in surfing Netflix and Hotstar for their entertainment rather of spending the day with their mates. Moving further, even parents and grandparents used to go to temples or other religious places and also do interact with others before the devices era. Now, they can hear the prayers on cell phones and try to avoid going outside. So, it eradicates the social interaction among the individuals.",
        "Conclusively, mobile phones not only impact the social interaction among people, but also the precious time on them. They should not waste their precious moments on mobile phones instead should spend them with their families."
