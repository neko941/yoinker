        "In this present time, language barriers are playing a significant role in the whole world. In this global world not only children, but also many people are not able to speak and to learn different languages so that on the other hand schools should not force to learn another language. I partially agree with the given statement.",
        "To commence, there are languages important for students as well as different sectors. There are a plethora of benefits for children to learn foreign languages. Firstly, they can get better job opportunities and earn more money easily outside the country because  people are able to understand a different kinds of languages. Moreover, as people can easily communicate with others, they will not face any problems. For example, a survey was conducted by TOI-Times Of India, many students have migrated to another country due to their better future and job opportunity are better than their own countries, so they can easily earn more money.",
        "On the other hand, there are myriad  drawbacks to learning foreign languages. Schools and universities are not forced to learn foreign languages because children have forgotten their native language as well as culture. Whereas, other people cannot understand foreign languages. In addition, if students are learning a new languages in schools or universities during that time create a communication problem and make a new issue regarding languages. For example, many students are joining their private tuition for learning a new language on account of they do not create misunderstanding in schools.",
        "On a concluding note, there are some merit and demerit to learning a foreign language. Children can easily get a good jobs in other countries but they can defiantly forget their native language and culture."
