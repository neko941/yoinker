Thus, the desire of being popular at a young age has various benefits in their development.",
        "On the other hand, it has few dismal effects too, as it is well known that fame comes with great sacrifices, pressure and loneliness.  For instance, a study revealed that youngster who is famous are often suffering from depression and loneliness. Sadly, such diseases in the adolescent age leave a bad mark on their forthcoming life. Also, they do not get to live their life on their terms because to keep up with fame they have to opt for a certain lifestyle for their followers or promoters. Therefore, popularity at young years also responsible to bring sadness and totally eradicate the fruitful years of childhood.",
        "In a nutshell, with the help aforementioned statements, it is ostensible to say that being popular at an early age has more demerits than merits, as they are not strong enough its darker side, though it is easy in the contemporary, yet it is best for them to step in such world when they are old enough to handle its consequences."
