        "Different people has different perspectives concerning the way media treat celebrities.Some of them think privacy is equally needed by everybody while others think fame comes at a certain price and that is to sacrifice your privacy. From my point of view, the media mostly breaches the right of privacy. I strongly believe that media should refrain itself from violating privacy of celebrities. Privacy is equally necessary for everybody  and it is unethical to pry into personal matters of anyone.",
        "Firstly, whether they are famous or not, everybody has the right of privacy and these rights are protected by law in many countries. Just because of the fact that they are famous personalities people can\u2019t say that they don\u2019t have private lives. Everyone should have private lives as it\u2019s a psychological need and the right of privacy should be protected by laws. It\u2019s surprising that even today in some countries like Samoa, Afghanistan and Togo doesn\u2019t have the right of privacy.",
        "Secondly, In this technological age media has a huge power as it can reach almost all of us by using tools like television, newspapers, radio, magazines and as the most important one internet. Actually, this fact is very useful in our lives, but sometimes media take advantage of this huge power. Media exaggerates as far as possible while making news and it\u2019s called media hype. It is unacceptable to use such news for enhancing the ratings.The main purpose of the media should be making true news.",
        "On the other hand, supporters of the media think that celebrities don\u2019t have private lives in the public sphere. Furthermore they even think that if they don\u2019t go to places like famous restaurants they won\u2019t be seen on cameras so they can have some private space. This  idea isn\u2019t completely right. All people have the right of privacy and just because they are famous personalities, their private lives can\u2019t be restricted. Media should avoid invading celebrity's privacy."
