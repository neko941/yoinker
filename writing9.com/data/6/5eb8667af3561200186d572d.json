        "An increasing concern for many people around the is suffering health problems due to enormous consumption of fast food. It has been suggested that as a result of this, the government should impose a higher tax on this kind of foods. This essay agrees that higher level of tax should be paid by fast food companies.",
        "Generally speaking, there is a wide range of reasons why governments should impose a higher tax on fast food. The key argument in support of this idea is that increasing taxes would raise the prices and lower the consumption. Fast food companies would pass on these taxes to their customers in the form of higher prices and this would lead to people not being able to afford these foods because they are too expensive. If junk food becomes a luxury item, it will only be consumed rarely, which will be less harmful general public's health.  For example, the cost of organic food is really expensive for most people and that is why only a small percentage of people but it regularly.",
        "On the other hand, there are several arguments against this idea. Perhaps the strongest is that people are free to choose what they would like to eat and nobody wants the government to prescribe their diet by imposing higher taxation. Also, people who work full time don't have time to cook. If the prices of the fast food raise, they can't afford anymore because so called healthy foods are already expensive.",
        "In conclusion, junk food should be taxed at a higher rate because the fact that the increased cost reduces the amount of fast food people buy."
