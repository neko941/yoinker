        "Nowadays, technologies are being improved by scientists every year. So in the future, they are going to apply driverless vehicles with having only passengers like an auto-pilot car. The main idea of that is to remove any kind of transport from roads by reducing their quantities.",
        "Let\u2019s begin by looking at the advantages of driverless cars. It will make our world cleaner from emitting carbon dioxide gases, now it\u2019s one of the major and also global problems for our planet. Due to the fact, approximately  90 % of automobiles use fossil fuel and it\u2019s incredible to make all of them electric. Hence, reduction of them will give a significant impact to save from global warming. Another advantage is making no-risk for a driving car accident. Self-driving vehicles are implemented by Artificial Intelligence (AI), so they are safe for 99% because their every step is estimated precisely. For drivers, there are a number of reasons to get distracted such as lack of sleep and energy, looking at smartphones and so on.",
        "Turning to the other side of the argument, these changes would affect people negatively, owing to the fact that it occurs unemployment amongst numerous spheres like taxi, delivery and driving industries. The myriad of workers will lose their financial benefit and it may cause by a problem not only for people, but it will also consider the whole economy of a country.",
        "All things considered, driverless vehicles will be a crucial solution to alter our life for the next stage of development, which provides more convenient conditions for all. Consequently, advantages outweigh disadvantages and I think, that it\u2019s a sensible idea for the future."
