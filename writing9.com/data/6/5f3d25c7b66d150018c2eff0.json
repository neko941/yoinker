        "People have differing views with regard to the question of which subject is most crucial subject in school. In my opinion, both history and science-technology can be used together to give education with wider perspectives.",
        "On the other hand, world history goes back million years. A lot of society lived in the world during this process. All of them have their life experiences. With history lectures, student can learn many things from their life styles and experiences which brighten our paths. Furthermore, past is a process which constantly added on and never ending. For instance, providing that students able to interpret history they can have more stable and confident future. In this way, their perception level will increase significantly.",
        "On the other hand, I believe that science and technology have an essential role in our lives in the current century. Firstly, after the industrial revolution, technology made important progress. Then, a lot of machines are invented to make easy our life and, human life standard is soaring up.   Moreover, by learning science and technology pupils can understand these developments and they can invent new equipment. Another argument is with science and technology some disease can be solved by science. To give a clear example, cancer treatment can be accelerated by chemotherapy and this is thanks to science.",
        "In conclusion, while history as a school subject can give past experiment to student, technology and science give future development. In my view, history and science-technology should be given together to students for their improvement."
