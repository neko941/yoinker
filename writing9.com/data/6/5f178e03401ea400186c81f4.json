        "Many people believe that the pressing issues of environment can be curbed by raising the price of automobiles and fuel. This essay agrees with this viewpoint as it can lead to less pollution and traffic on the roads.",
        "Primarily, majority of the people are concerned about the heightened problem of environment, which has become so filthy due to manhandled practices. It is often seen that in every household people are having two or three cars, which not only lead to heavy traffic on roads but also put pressure on our surroundings as these motor vehicles emit poisonous gases. For example, in north America, on an average every young member of a family has a vehicle, which leads to increased level of carbon emission. Therefore, it has been decided by certain section of people to elevate the price of auto mobiles and petrol, to regulate the environmental conditions.",
        "Furthermore, the government could implement the theory of demand and supply inversely, by curbing the supply of vehicles and fuel, as the level of pollution has increased globally, which is responsible for global warming. Had the supply of these products controlled at an early stage, the demand would have been automatically reduced. This has become an alarming issue now, which needs to be regulated by the authorities.",
        "However, there are some people who are against this trend and do not want any increase in prices as they feel it would be an unnecessary financial burden on them. For instance, many people are already bearing the numerous monthly expenses and the rising prices will give an additional monetary load.",
        "To conclude, although, there are people who are against this idea of soaring prices, I agree that the authorities should elevate the prices to cut down the usage and demand, otherwise, the existence on the earth would be next to impossible."
