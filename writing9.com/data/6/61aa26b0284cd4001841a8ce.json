        "It is believed that females and males have different abilities including strengths and weaknesses.I completely agree with the opinion that women and  men should have specified careers in order to the gender distinction.",
        "That is to say, gender consensus claims that women do not have physical and mental requirements which are significant in order to participate in some activities.However, this attitude might come from a sexual stereotype that mentioned men\u2019s superiority.For instance, females are not allowed to join the Army in many countries.Whilst, in other societies women may be seen in the front line of war.Besides, females are not chosen in order to mine because of their physical properties .Added to this, in Islamic countries females cannot do various posts because of religious beliefs. Such point of view is restricted women much more in the community. For example, women cannot be a singer in many Islamic areas.",
        "Consequently,this notion has a masculine trend behind it.",
        "Furthermore, society does not accept men in some positions mainly believed as female work. Since customers are not willing to have been serviced by men in some professions which require more delicacy and careful consideration such as nursery and kindergarten.Moreover, they prefer to see a madam as a bridal hairdresser rather than a man.In addition, many company holders would rather admit males to the workplace in order to increase productivity.Ultimately, many reckon several professions appropriate for a certain gender.",
        "In conclusion, there are many jobs that are assigned to a specific gender. Men\u2019s attitude display that if female do some careers, it would lead to failure. Thus, certain posts are traditionally suitable for men. As they have believed not only are men hard-working,but they are also powerful and intelligent."
