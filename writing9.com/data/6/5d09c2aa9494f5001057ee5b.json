        "It is widely believed that in the design stage of a building, its function should be considered more important than how its exterior looks. Personally, I agree with this idea.",
        "On the one hand, there is no doubt that a magnificent outward appearance has many advantages. For example, apartments for rent, it is the outward appearance that attracts the customers attention. A person who gets a positive first impression with the exterior apperance is more likely to go into the building to rent or buy it. In addition, some buildings symbolizing the history of the city they are located in also need to be beautiful from the outside.",
        "On the other hand, it is obvious that the function is also of significance, if not, the most crucial factor to consider while building, as every construction needs to be safe and comfortable. For instance, a shopping mall has to possess a wide walkway and a good lighting system. Furthermore, each building has its own practical use, so architects have to design it with a view to satisfying the requirements of the building\u2019s users. A theatre, for example, is supposed to have a well-designed sound system and a specific type of hall so that everyone in the audience can conveniently enjoy movies or shows.",
        "In conclusion, although both factors are important, without a proper function-based design, the stunning external appearance of a building is of no use."
