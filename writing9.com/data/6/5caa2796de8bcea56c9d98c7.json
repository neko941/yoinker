        "Many argue that participating in video games is considered to be a loss of valuable time, therefore, it should be forbidden for kids to play them. I fully believe children should be banned from playing computer games. This essay will; firstly, examine how the continuous use of these games is detrimental to a child\u2019s optical health, secondly, discuss how their content may negatively impact children\u2019s fragile minds.",
        "To begin with, boys and girls should not play computer games as they have a harmful effect on their eyes. This is because, hours per day are spent fixated on a laptop screen playing these games, consequently, putting a strain on eyes and reducing their optical capacity. This can be exemplified by countless medical studies like the Childs Optical Health Society Research, which concluded that 50% of children who wear glasses spend at least one hour a day playing computer games. Overall, this may result in grave consequences such as, the child may require glasses.",
        "Another point is, computer games have an extremely negative influence on kids mentality. This is due to the fact that these games may contain inappropriate language, harmful imagery and concepts. Thus, leading to aggressive behaviour and thoughts. For example, Grand theft auto \u2013a famous law breaking aggressive video game- was found to be a common factor amongst 70% of juvenile offenders in the uk in 2018. Owing to the fragile nature of young minds, they may easily be swayed and influenced by these games.",
        "In conclusion, although there is much debate surrounding the topic of the youth and computer games, undoubtedly it is a unfavourable trend as it reduces optical health and promotes violence in some instances. In future, I hope video games are unavailable by law for children under 18."
