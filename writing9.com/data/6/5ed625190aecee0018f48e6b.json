        "Nowadays, due to the developed science the life expectancy has risen dramatically. Consequently, the question of who should take care of the elderly is a thorny issue. Some people hold the opinion that authorities are responsible for them. Others, on the contrary, maintain that only relatives should look after the senior members of the family. This essay examines this question from both points of view and then I will give my own perspective on the matter.",
        "The main reason why the majority of the community take the view that administration of the country should patronize people in ages is that citizens pay more than 10% of their wages to the pension budget. For example, in Canada employers deposit money for the future pension for their employees so retired workers are supported from both the state and the employer. As a result, retirees have enough money for living, include travelling and medicine. In this case the pension system works as a knock-on-effect caring about labours in advance.",
        "On the other hand, still a huge part of society argue that relatives should keep an eye on the aged family members. The main argument used that only close person can understand needs of retiree and caring about him with love. For instance, in Russia it is a tradition that seniors after retire come to live to their adult children. Therefore, government pay small pensions for elderly, but during their life Russians pay less than 6% to the pension system.",
        "In conclusion, the question of caring the aged people is a difficult one to answer definitively. However, based on the reasons analysed above, I believe that government should take care of elderly because during their adult life they paid more than 10% of their salary for future pension and in this case it is quite obvious to take this money back after retire for medical issues or for another needs."
