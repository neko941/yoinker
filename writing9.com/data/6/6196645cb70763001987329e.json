        "I hope this letter finds you well. It's been a while since our last road trip to Alaska. I am so excited to hear that you are interested in camping. Since it will be your first time for go camping, I want to share you some tips and tricks in order to organize a great trip!",
        "First of all, I believe that you would love a camping holiday, as there are a lot of activities for you and your families. For example, you can spend your time together for hiking around the campsite. Moreover, you can go cycling and enjoy the beautiful scenic view. However, there are also some possible drawbacks of sleeping in tents. For instance, you may lose your personal belonging if you leave it in the tent when you are away. Another example is that some areas are the home of wildlife, therefore all food should be kept in the storage to protect them from animals.",
        "Last but not least, if you are decided where to go, please let me know as soon as possible so that I could prepare to join your trip in this summer.",
