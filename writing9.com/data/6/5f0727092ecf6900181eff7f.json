        "People have different perspectives on whether single-sex schools or coed schools have more pros for students. While I accept that there are some advantages that can be seen in mixed education, I would argue that same-sex schools are likely to have more benefits for boys and girls.",
        "On the one hand, mixing students\u2019 gender brings respect for gender equality as well as promotion socialization for adolescents. First of all, students in integrated schools are likely deeply respect for gender equality and co-existence. It is due to the fact that mixed education gives a chance for both genders to understand each other difficulties and characteristics. Secondly, coed schools promote socialization in adolescents. Some people who enroll in single schools are awkward to socialize as well as interact with the opposite sex since they are not used to doing it. Conversely, coed student experience it several times, so it prepares for them not only communication skills but also building the foundation for their vocational and social future.",
        "On the other hand, it is possible to argue that single-sex schools bring more benefits to the student. Firstly, there is no doubt that same-sex schools bring a more specific curriculum for children. The teachers have more opportunities to provide techniques tailored toward individuals\u2019 needs and learning styles of their students. For example, the curriculum for girls can bring more some kinds of colorful stuff while some competitive activities can be added to boys\u2019 lessons to attract their attention. Secondly, the concentration on studying can be improved in specific-gender schools. It is undeniable that adolescents are often distracted from the opposite gender, hence, the early relationship might appear. It leads to deterioration of their performances in exams, and students, therefore, enrolling in single-sex education are likely to have more high grade than who do not.",
        "In conclusion, from the reasons mentioned above, I myself firmly believe that although integrated schools bring some considerable advantages for student, gender-specifec schools still role a best choice."
