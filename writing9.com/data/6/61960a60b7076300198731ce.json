        "Some people assume that schools should only teach the useful lessons like science, technology. While, others believe that university students should study their favorite subjects. This essay will discuss both these agruaments and the reason why I agree with the second idea.",
        "It is true that science, medicine, information technology are becoming the trend and extremely essensial in the future. In the digital age, all of us have technology innovations like smart phones, computers and even smart houses, so knowing their basic knowledge will made our life easiler and safetier. For example, if we study that the strange links on the websites porperly content toxic codes, we will not be able to click these links and be attacked by hackers. Additionally, because employers require the computer skills to the candidates, people who meet this need may have more oppotunities.",
        "Besides, I completely aprove the view that young people and students should practice their interesting subjests. The first reason is that many people actually do not find their future job yet, therefor the years in the university is neccesary time to striving new experiences and habits to know yourself. Secondly, there are some important abilities such as the communication , art or music skills which can create the vivid life, improve the social connect and utilize in other fields. For example, Da Vinci are famous for his pictures and he also have passion on mathatic, so he can cacullate exactly the scale in his notable paintings.",
        "To conclude, students in the advantage technology development ought to study subjects that will be useful in the future and they also have to the right to practice whatever they want."
