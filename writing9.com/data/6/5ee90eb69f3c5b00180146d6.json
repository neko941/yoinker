        "The issue of children becoming overweight is a growing concern for many parents. Therefore,  schools ought to increase sports and physical activity classes in order to curb this rapidly increasing problem of obesity in children. In my opinion, it is one of the most effective ways to encourage a child to adopt a healthy lifestyle and control body weight.",
        "Adding more sports classes in school curriculum will enable children to inculcate the habit of exercise. In other words, students will understand the benefits of daily exercise and eventually they might start liking it, which will motivate them to follow the same routine after school, too. For instance, it is evident the many eminent sports players used to play the same game in their childhood, due to which they started liking it.",
        "There are many other possible solutions to deal with this problem. Firstly, sedentary lifestyle of children needs to be changed. To do so, parents must encourage children to play outdoors instead of playing video games on mobile.  Secondly, fast food advertisement also needs to be controlled or banned altogether as fast food",
        "items play a major role in making children overweight and lazy. By putting a ban on advert, this can be controlled to some extent as advertisements attract a child to buy and eat those items.",
        "In conclusion, increasing sports classes in school will certainly help children in becoming fit and healthy. Also, their fast food eating habit and a sedentary lifestyle also needs to be changed to overcome this problem among children."
