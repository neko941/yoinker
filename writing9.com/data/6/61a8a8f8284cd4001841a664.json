        "For a lot of people there is quite often arise the same old question if big salary more significant than job satisfaction. I personally completely disagree with this idea and vote for satisfaction as main pros of work.",
        "First of all money without pleasure will cause negative feelings regarding job itself on somehow long distance. While for some people it\u2019s still possible to force themselves to go every morning to a place which they don\u2019t want to be and do what they don\u2019t want to be involved into, in most cases it won\u2019t last long. For instance, if one don\u2019t like what they are doing daily then in some time this activity will be naturally sabotaged by lazyness, decreased productivity, ans also often being late trying to delay or avoid unpleasant timespending. So high income may be attractive initially but connected with negative feelings will be pretty soon also recognized as something non-positive.",
        "Moreover it possible that there is already enough money available for living and person feeling themselthes careless about extra funding but thinking more about self-realisation. In this case it will be essential to look for some kind of activity which could self-satisfy and provide solid basement for enjoying life process. This way job may be counted as main hobby or exposed as one of type of art. For example millionaires and celebrities could practicing in paining but that will be for sure not a fast portrait but caligraphy or naturemorting. There may be more reasons than only money to do something and people like to do what they like in most situations.",
        "In summary, it\u2019s possible to find more reasons for daily activity than only straggling for resources required for food, clothes and roof above head. From this point of view good compensations for your time could looks like excelent mood and internal fulfillment so I completely disagree that coins more important than feelings."
