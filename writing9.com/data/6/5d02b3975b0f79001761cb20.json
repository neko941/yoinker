        "Now a day\u2019s it\u2019s becoming normal in western society to have no children, despite from western country, even though many couples even in Asian countries start planning to not have children\u2019s. Well\u2019 it all depends on the circumstances and their future planning\u2019s in their life. They might consider spending their precious period of time with each other\u2019s at the start.",
        "In my experience I know one of my colleague living in California, once he said\u2019 they don\u2019t have plans for children at this stage, they reason he quoted\u2019 he is not stable financially to manage his life with current income resources. So I guess it varies in different situations to decide for children\u2019s.",
        "In my opinion, it is significantly important to have children\u2019s to start your life in real manners. Firstly, our priorities will be changed, and we\u2019ll then actually know that\u2019 how our parents have spent their sleepless nights with us, to make us comfortable in our childhood. We\u2019ll be more determined and focused in professional life, to provide quality of life for our children\u2019s.",
        "I think having no children\u2019s will make the couple\u2019s life frustrated, after sometime when there will be no changes in life. Secondly it humans demand to always expect something different after a certain period of time. The home environment will be cherished with the children\u2019s and we will feel the happiness of life.",
        "Eventually, in my conclusions, it's mandatory to have children\u2019s in couple\u2019s life at least one. As well they should spend their maximum efforts to make them a good person in society to serve for their country. And everyone should take responsibility at least for the one children growth."
