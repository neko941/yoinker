        "It has been arguing that speaking is much more efficient compared to writing in all cases. From my point of view, while verbal expression is optimal to convey our ideas in a variety of situations, writing communication has its own strength.",
        "On the one hand, we have to learn to speak before we can write down our thought, so speaking is a good way to convey our ideas as well as our willpower to another. For example, a graduation ceremony may not be complete without an announcement from the principle. What is more, public speaking is now considered as an important attribute of leadership. The implication of this is that persons who are able to persuade other people in a group or a company by his word are more likely to be a good leader.",
        "In spite of the above arguments, there are situations in which a paper can work better than a speech. A case in point is the Holy Bible that is the book read most frequently in the world and there is no way of expression that can be more efficient. In addition, to instill detailed and complex information to the others, a speech seems to be less useful due to difficulties to remember exactly a great deal of details. By contrast, a paper allows us to recall any points whenever we need. As a result, in every conference, a speech always accompanies with a relevant document in order to help audiences to understand clearly all contents.",
        "In a word, speaking as well as writing are both beneficial for humans in communication."
