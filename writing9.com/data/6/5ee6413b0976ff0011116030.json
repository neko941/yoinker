        "It is undeniable fact that, in last three decades people own more cars than the other decades, but because of this many metropolises are now affected with transportation related problems. So, some people believe that government should enact some stricter laws for car ownership and run some campaigns to discourage people. I totally agree with the aforesaid statement.",
        "First and foremost, traffic jams are the burning issue of these days. Also, these cities are designed, many centuries ago, due to this the roads  narrow and areas are denser, so the government could not rebuild border roads in those areas and cities. If the government builds new wider roads, but they do not match the pace of increasing cars per land. Moreover, businesses are affected by losses because of delaying delivery services. More traffic congestion not only in curing noise problems, but also in curing air pollution.",
        "The solutions for this situation are not so simple, to discourage people from their own, government should impose higher taxes for carbon emission. Furthermore, laymen should use car-pooling, to share his or her taxi with another citizen, owing to this the rate of traffic would reduce to half.",
        "In addition to the above, government should encourage citizens to use public transportation instead of private vehicles. If people use public transportation, then government should earn money, because of this they can use this money to improve the condition of roads. Also, government should advertise the advantages of bicycle, because of this, not only reduce influx, but also the health of citizens will improve.",
        "To conclude, the government should enact some stricter laws for car ownership and travel so, people can understand these problems are not as small as they think. When they pay fines, then they will understand the value of public transportation."
