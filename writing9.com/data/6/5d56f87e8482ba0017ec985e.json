        "It is argued that these days many individuals are in competition with the youngster for the same post in a department. The main problem associated with this cause is increased unemployment among adolescent and the most viable solution is early retirement for aged people.",
        "The principal problem associated with this is it leaves many youngsters jobless. Many old people are experienced enough to get appointed for any post because the employers prefer to appoint a person with an enormous experience rather than inducting a na\u00efve with no experience who has to start from scratch. The result of this often leads to the staggering number of youngsters deprived of a blue-collar job. For example, a survey conducted on job advertisements by the California University scholars found that 70% of the posts require 5-10 years\u2019 experience for a well-paid job due to which approximately half of the young people remain jobless.",
        "To tackle this problem the government should reduce the retirement age for the employees and provide them old-age benefits such as medical and monthly stipend. In other words, this plan could ensure old aged about their future security and they can spend their rest of the life with contentment, thus they do not have to rush for the job to make both ends meet. As a result, this will leave enough room for the young people in the job market and eventually it will reduce unemployment among youth. For example, a similar initiative in Japan resulted in a 52% decrease in competition among more and less experienced persons.",
        "To conclude, many people strive with the youngsters to secure the same place in the job market which raises the evil of joblessness in adolescents in the society; however, it can be addressed through the government reforms on retirement plan about the old staff."
