        "In this competitive era,social interaction has become very vital.But, everyone is busy with their own hectic schedule so they have no time to interact with society members.That is why usually masses do not interact with their neighbourhood and thought that this community is not good for them.This essay intends to delve into reasons and solutions to circumvent this moot issue.",
        "To start with,there are a plethora of reasons why people do not communicate with their nearby residents.First and foremost,today society becomes materialistic so people are always busy with their own businesses and jobs and they have no time to speak with their neighbourhood as well as spend time with them.Secondly,folks often do not like their colleagues as they are always thought that someone does not earn more money than others.There is a jealousy factor among them.They are also not allowed their children to spend time with their community members.They are thought that community members do not guide them on the right path.For example,if their children learn any bad habit they always blame their neighbours that our child must learn bad deed from their children.",
        "Additionally,there are some solutions to deal with this situation.It is the responsibility of the head of the village or any city to organise few society functions from time to time and encourage all family members to join it.In this way,people get a chance to interact with each other and know about each others point of view.Moreover,people can also invite their neighbours to dinner in their free time so they came to know about each other and it is essential to interreact with people because they are sharing their walls and in any emergency neighbours are the first person who is available for their help.",
        "To encapsulate,masses have no time to communicate with their near ones because they are busy in their own jobs,although,society members can motivate them through organising social events  to interact with each other"
