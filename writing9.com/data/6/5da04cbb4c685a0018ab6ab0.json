        "It is true that these days the majority of tourists visiting museums and historical tourist attractions are foreigners, not the local ones. This situation, in my view, seems to stem both from marketing policies and poor appealing of some showplaces, there are some possible approaches to rectify the situation.",
        "It appears that there are two primary grounds for this trend. First, travel agencies have mostly concentrated on foreign people than locals so that they can make more profit. For example, plenty of Iranians are bombarded everyday with SMSs which contain a wide range of abroad travel offers. The main reason behind this is that travelling to a foreign country is associated with various needed services such as booking the hotel, flight and so forth, all of which are provided by travel agencies, leading to more revenue for them. Second, most of tourists would like to visit tourist attractions that they have not visited earlier. A person, for instance, who has visited the national museum, prefers to travel to a foreign country, like France, to see new ones.",
        "Turing to possible solutions, the first remedy can be advertising local showplaces to encourage inhabitants to visit these places. Simply put, the more people are aware of local museums and showplaces, the more these places will be visited by them. To illustrate, I had never visited Sultania Dom, a historic building located in the North-West of my country, Iran, until I motivated by a glamorous documentary about this on the national TV. In addition, if authorities made tourist attractions more appealing by employing different arts, local individuals will probably visit these places more than once only. Take a museum having a live music in its background as an example; more people will highly likely attend this place because of its versatile function.",
        "In conclusion, it is clear that there are several reasons behind the discussed trend and, this situation can be ameliorated through promoting tourist attractions by local media and implementing other arts to make the unwelcomed showplaces more desirable."
