However, these days fewer and fewer people appreciate art and turn their focus to science, technology, and business. Why do you think that is? What could be done to encourage more people to take an interest in the arts?",

        "Art is one of the most vital contributing factors to promote all cultures worldwide. Even so, today, an overwhelming number of people are paying attention to medical, IT, and commerce streams instead of appreciating art. I think this is happening because people would seek more job opportunities in such fields. Interest can be developed among people only if governments allocated funds to promote artisan's work and also art is made a compulsory subject in the school curriculum.",
        "Irrefutable, many people are losing interest in art. This is because art is no longer as important as science, technology, and business in terms of job prospects. In other words, if people get involved in such domains, then it will be easier for them to attain high remuneration along with lucrative perks in multinational corporations and research centers. Nonetheless, it is unlikely to make both ends meet via artisan's work since they are not in demand and are less useful. Production of robotic machines, for example, in both scientific breakthroughs and trade market not only creating jobs for millions of employees but also helping to make more money compared to music and other forms of art.",
        "If governments of any nation spent money on building art galleries and organizing cultural events at tourist spots, then more eyeballs can be grabbed across the globe. Rajasthan, for instance, in India is known for its sculptures and antique masterpieces of art in the world, which has become tourist attractions for local people as well as foreign travellers. Secondly, art ought to be incorporated in the school timetable regardless of the age group of students. In other words, school-going students should be encouraged to attend art classes at free of cost so that they get attracted to it, resulting in giving them a chance to get connected with their culture and history.",
        "In conclusion, although technology, business, and science help people to earn their livelihood, I believe that the paramount importance of artwork should never be underrated. Thus, cultural identity can be saved from being disappeared if art is promoted at the international level through social programs and educational institutes."
