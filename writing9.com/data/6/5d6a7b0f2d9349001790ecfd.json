        "It is believed by some that art is an imperative subject for children in school, but others believed it is wastage of time. In my opinion, children must learn art in school because it will help to boost their creativity and confidence, but it will not on the cost of other subject.",
        "While it is believed by some that investing school hours in arts is a waste of time. Arts is only one aspect of school training and some children may not like it and they are more interested in sports and other hobbies. Take, for instance, compelling a soccer fan to learn singing will prove to be a counterproductive, it will not only loss of opportunity to become a player but also will not excel as a singer. Moreover, arts are not a  viable career option. There are less job opportunities in the sector of arts than science, technology and business. Thus, they think that children should more focus on other important subject, instead of wasting time on arts subject.",
        "on the other hand, others believed that learning arts will enhance creativity and imagination among the children. it seems line no-brainer, but arts allow kids to express themselves better than science and mathematics. For instance, in arts a child asks to recite a monologue in six different ways, draw a painting from his imagination, or compose a new rhythm to enhance piece of music. As a result, creativity and imagination naturally come to him, it will help him now and in the future. Moreover, arts will improve confidence in children. while mastering a subject help student to build confidence, there is something special about participating in arts. Such as, to come up on stage for signing, will help him to come outside his comfort zone.",
        "To Conclude, while arts certainly help a student to develop creativity and confidence, it will be taught alongside with other subject, School curriculum should offer a balance of subject."
