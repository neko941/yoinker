        "Schooling is an important phase in every child's life and plays a vital role in their overall development. While, some people think that study practical knowledge in school is very important for their future hunt for jobs, others think academic education helps them make their base strong.",
        "Indeed, the overall structure of the building matters, but a sturdy foundation is what holds the building strong. There is no iota of doubt that academic study is essential for the beginning years of school to secure the future in this challenging world. Moreover, having the ground knowledge of the prime subjects supporting a child for his practical skills. Furthermore, a powerful schooling culture not only bring discipline in children's life, but also shape their thinking ability.",
        "However, we should understand that not all the students are academically oriented. It is prime to encourage such children and provide them practical knowledge in order to prepare them to earn their living. For example, my son, who is good at singing and his school arrange a talent show annually to promote the talent of  such children. Moreover, this is school's responsibility to give an early start so that they can excel in their field and have much time to explore more options. Furthermore, school should support vocational training like web designing, singing, dancing, interior designing etc.",
        "To conclude, in my opinion, education should be an adequate blend of academic and vocational education. This is the reason, why American curriculum promotes hands on activities with academic studies to make the children Allrounder. Through a better mix of life skills, teaching and vocational training programs, school can produce job- ready individuals."
