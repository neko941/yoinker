        "It is widely believed that in modern society, the life of ordinary people has changed significantly due to the contribution of TV. T totally agree with this assumption since it provided a lot of information about the community.",
        "To begin with, the TV set is a primary source of entertainment, and individuals can enjoy watching movies and stories without leaving the comfort zone of their home. For example, instead of going to cinemas for watching films, people can simply buy an online package and can watch movies as many as they like. In addition, the programs shown are effective information which provides the knowledge for people. This allows people to enhance their way of living according to the latest trends in society. Besides, people can improve their language skills by watching foreign movies and news channels such as English and French. Another positive advantage is that students can obtain encouragement and motivation through competition shows. Therefore, the TV set is a hub of knowledge.",
        "Moreover, when families watch TV together, it boosts the bonding between members of the family. Due to overloaded tasks in company or school, people have not quality time for their family. Thus, enjoying movies through TV is a way of connecting people more closely. People also can prepare different food items when people watch TV together. In this way, people get ample time to spend together and also are increased their awareness of different cultures around the globe.",
        "To sum up, the TV set is a useful device due to creating a lot of information and knowledge for people. In this way, it has improved the quality of life and boosted the bonding among family members."
