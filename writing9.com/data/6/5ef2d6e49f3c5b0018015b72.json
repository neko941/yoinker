        "It is believed that living in a big city is becoming more and more difficult nowadays. This essay will state some difficulties caused by a modern life and suggest some solution to tackle those problems.",
        "To move to a big city would be easy to find a job and make their life better than rural areas. Consequently, the city\u2019s environment becomes extremely contaminated. Indeed, there are millions vehicles commute on the road everyday; and traffic jam appears in big city on a regular basis a day. Besides, factories are releasing a large amount of greenhouse gases which may destroy terribly atmosphere. To take the edge off this problem, Government should encourage residents to use public transportations such as bus, subway, coach, and other similar things. In addition, government should launch a zero-tolerance policy on the factory which releases the greenhouse gases or water contamination in a city; and they will have to be punished by paying enormous money if they pollute the environment.",
        "The second problem is the increase of cost of living. Undoubtedly, citizens have to handle many mandatory expenses such as housing, food, utility bills, and other similar things. To mitigate this issue, government might reduce the tax on daily products or allocate money to the poor. Some subsidies such as reducing education fee, scholarship for poor\u2019s children might help them feel better whose is being stressful about living in a urban.",
        "To sum up, there are some problems brought by living in a big city, but we can solve by adapting those mentioned solutions."
