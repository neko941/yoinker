        "It is an undeniable fact that with the advancement in the mobile technology, people tend to write an email or a text rather than a letter. Some people believe that writing letters could disappear completely in the near future. I, however, do not agree with this stance as letter writing is needed in many official settings as well as it works as a caring gesture.",
        "Firstly, letters are still being used in many official settings where usage of such documents can not be ignored. It is essential in many organisations for formal documentation. For example, letters are still being used in the electricity department of India for different purposes like for new connections, complaints, and suggestions. This department keeps such letters as an evidence for future reference. Moreover, such letters need signatures from different people which might not be possible in the case of texts from electronic gadgets.",
        "Secondly, hand written letters for friends and family shows an emotional gesture which in the case of a text or an email, with the help of mobile devices, cannot be shown. In the era of technology, people receive texts and emails every day or every moment through electronic devices, but when they get a hand written letter, it shows an extra effort taken by the writer. This becomes a gesture of care, respect and importance, and people feel special. In addition, people use letters on special occasions like new year, birthdays and valentines days.",
        "In conclusion, although in the fast pace technological century emails or texts by mobiles or computers are super quick and have become part of daily lives, letters still have their importance in some government departments and in the personal lives of people."
