        "Many today argue that companies and grocery stores have the capabilities to reduce the number of packaging for their products. However, others opine that it is the responsibility of the consumers not to patronize products that are enclosed in a lot of packaging.",
        "Companies have the responsibility to reduce the extent of packaging for their products. They choose the designs and should select the ones that reduces the amount of unnecessary waste product. In addition, companies have the control over the materials they used for wrapping their merchandise and should choose materials that can be recycled and reused to help with the waste management projects of the society. For instance, companies can use jars made out of glass so they can be reused multiple times. Thus, packaging mostly relies on how the company manufactures and designs their commodities.",
        "On the other hand, consumers have the option to choose what product to buy. They can purchase those which they think have little to a decent amount of packaging and stay away from those that have excessive wrappings. Nowadays, some options are also provided to the customers where they can bring their own containers when purchasing groceries. For example, they can bring their own containers for meats, vegetables, and fruits to the supermarket instead of using plastic bags. Hence, purchasing items which they think are packed excessively depends on the customers.",
        "In conclusion, I believe that manufacturers and supermarkets are still responsible in reducing the amount packaging due to the fact that it is part of their product presentation and consumers have a minor effect on how the product is designed and packaged."
