        "Development of the medical care system led to finding the ways of living longer and increasing the life expectancy. Despite  the growing population has detrimental effects on our environment, I believe that people will consume natural resources in a wide and appropriate way. In my opinion, the results of the contemporary medicine are one of the breakthrough of humanity, and it has more merits than faults.",
        "A great benefit of developed medicine is that it helps people to keep healthy and prevent deadly  diseases. Also advanced technologies in medicine solved  problems of disabled people, and it gave them  new opportunities to work and be equal with people. Report of United Nations claims that the number of older people in the world, especially in Germany, France, Japan, the USA consists fifteen percent of the population. It\u2019s the significant index of good medical care system. I think that a vast mass of older people and their presence positively impact  on our  lives, since they always share with experiences and helps to nurturing of our generation.",
        "On the other hand, the world\u2019s human population has reached 7.8 billion people and destructive impact on the earth. The climate change and starvation are relevant problems of today. For example, in the South Africa two percent of people are died ever per day due to the hunger, and Australia have suffered deforestation recently which was caused by global warming. However, I reckon that countries will able to overcome problems associated with global warming and nutrition.",
        "Advanced medical care system affords to people to  live longer  and increase lifespan. Despite the influence on humanity is paradoxically, it has a menace effect on our earth. To sum up, I think that improved medicine is more advantageous than disadvantageous."
