        "In the present, people are living in a modern lifestyle and upgrade with a new generation of new trends. That our new youth has believed the history his not important to live in that current time. Also, in the past, many situations were created but young people have not accepted those things. If asked to support, I practically believe that statement and will be elaborated further.",
        "Generally, our youth are most of the information that they do not trust to work in the future because they have not aware and it also believes in the present situation. Moreover, in the past, all mankind has an unexpected experience that wok in the future. For instance, the student had to study in their life but sometimes they have to feel it is worthy. Furthermore, in school life they had to study the basic knowledge they have to study in the future also its not worthy of them. Thus, past learning is more important to new people.",
        "On the other hand, sometimes they are right about the past to think to not value in the future; However, past learning is worthy for present people. Additionally, the current generation believes in change with new trends and life-style. For example, In the past time, people are communicating with the latter and birds but in recent times young people accept the new technology that is batter for communication. So, the past is not perfect for today\u2019s humans.",
        "To conclude, most of the people are not accept history but in some cases, they have to believe and some other type of they can not trust in past learning because they habited to the new orientation. In my opinion, both situations are important these days."
