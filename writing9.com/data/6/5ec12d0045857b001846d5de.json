        "It is a common belief that teachers educate academic and moral due to attituate of students get well, albeit other belief supports only academic courses should be tough. In my perspective, social and academic ethic knowledge should be given in the schools.",
        "In the digital age, many people believe that not only general intelligence is not adequate for the youth, also social and moral conscious is necessary to rise up them. Thus, in the primary and elemantary schools, both of them should be included in the academic calender. When the children feel responsibility to the society, and be aware of their duty in this circle, they would be more kind, relaxed, tolerant and helpfull. For instance, in my town, all school kids must pass a life skill lesson. Its contents are about how to act an old person kind or how to help disabled individuals. That is to say, they start to realize wrong and right among human, they can observe how importance all these volunteer projects in order to change the community.",
        "On the other hand, education in the college, should engage only positive and social science, such as maths, biology, physic. Meanwhile, to teach, behave others well is not include in the contents. However, if the young people were successful at all course, they would not be happy and satisfied without a nice communication with others. For example, the patients where an university hospital have not preferred seeing a good qualified doctor who is arrogant and brad since two years. The hospital managers solved the reason and the doctor warned with an ultimatom to be nice.",
        "In conclusion, a person who is qualified and educated, however having not communication skills with others in a right way can not be accepted by the society. To be successful in the modern life, to have a moral and well-behaviour should be learned in the learning hubs."
