Some sociologists claim that parents and other members of society often set a bad example.\nDiscuss the causes and some effects of widespread drug use by young people in modern day society. Make any recommendations you feel are necessary to help fight youth drug abuse.",

        "Drugs nowadays are ubiquitous. However, the decline of age when teenagers start experimenting with legal as well as illegal drugs is blamed on inappropriate examples set by parents and other society members. As with any social issue, there are various causes and effects of such behaviour. Fortunately, some actions can be taken to ameliorate the problem.",
        "The issue of drug abuse among school students seems to have two main causes. Firstly, all the youth are curious about the world and new experiences. If they hear the stories how others felt after taking a particular substance, they will be keen to experience such a state themselves. For instance, heroin might cause hallucinations, which many find appealing due to being able to escape from the real world. Another reason why many teenagers take drugs is boredom. In some social circles the young have no opportunities to pursue their hobbies. Combining that with the pleasurable effects of some chemical substances results in taking those legal and illegal drugs as often as possible.",
        "Unfortunately, this has serious consequences. In the majority of cases, drug abuse leads to addiction. At this point drugs would be the highest priority for a young person. Hence, many of them might drop out of school, or even become thefts to get money for they favourite substance. Not to mention a potential health issues in heavy drug users. This is because most ingested of inhaled substances after being absorbed to the blood stream pass through the liver, where they are metabolised. Many drugs or their metabolites are toxic to the liver and other organs. Therefore, abusing drugs might be a cause of acute organ failure or even death.",
        "By examining the causes of this worrying trend some recommendations can be made. In the case of all problems it is better to prevent rather than treat. Thus, education about substance abuse ought to be mandatory in every school in addition to a wide offer of extracurricular activities for students, so that they can develop their interests instead of turning to drugs, which is often caused by boredom.",
        "To conclude, curiosity and lack of hobbies bring many young to experiment with drugs, which bears serious social and health consequences. The prevention by lessons on drug abuse problem and engaging students in after-school activities, in my opinion, would be the most effective method to tackle the problem."

    "submitter": "With the recent increase in migrati, the believe that the countries hosting mixed natiality populatis are not ly more intriguing but also develop faster is gaining support. Although I firmly agree with the latter, in my opini the opposite is true about the former.  In multinatial countries the diversity of cultures is disappearing. In other words, when moving to live in a foreing country, many adapt to the way of living in their new country while not cultivating their own traditis anymore. For instance, the majority of migrants from Africa changed the way they dress when they had arrived in Italy. Furthermore, some native residents take foreign traditis as their own, such as celebrating Diwali (a Hindu holiday) in some part of the UK. Therefore, despite the popural believe, multinatial society does not make the country more interesting as the cultural diversity dies out in the lg term.  Ccerning the pace of development of those countries,  the other hand, this type of the society increases it significantly. This is due to the fact that ccentrating experts in a particular topic, who are coming from a plethora of different natis, allows to share their various experiences and knowledge to achieve the comm goal much faster. Taking the United States as an example, in every public instituti, including universities, it is possible to meet individuals from every country in the world, which resulted in the fact that the US became the fastest developing country in terms of technology.  To cclude, countries which are home to the variety of natialities are not necessary more interesting than those inhabited by a single nati. However, certainly, a wide range of experiences brought by members of various cultures might ctribute to faster developments of those countries.",
