        "Nowadays we are living in a society based on consuming. In many developed nations, shopping is not only about purchasing daily necessities but is also seen as a form of amusement. Some people hold the opinion that consumerism to relax is a positive trend, whereas, others have conflicting views. I personally feel that this is a negative development as people indulge in impulsive shopping after getting swayed by commercials or window displays.",
        "The main reason people buy items they do not really need is because of the influence marketing campaigns have on them. We are constantly receiving messages telling us that if we buy a certain product we will be more happier or attractive. In many ways, these companies trick us into buying their products, which are a sheer waste of money. For example, one of my mates bought an expensive bag after being tempted by a catchy discount offer using credit cards which she really does not need.",
        "In addition, shopping should be for fulfilling our necessity, not for our personal pleasure. However, instead of splurging on items we do not require, the money can be well utilized by investing in savings. Purchasing things that we do not need is a habit that makes one imprudent.  For instance, most of my friends who spend their weekends\u2019 shopping only discuss their purchases, whereas those who use their time more wisely are often much more interesting and successful people.",
        "In conclusion, shopping and entertainment is not a good trend because instead of buying things which are an influence advertisements we should invest our time and money in more productive activities and investment plans."
