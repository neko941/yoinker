        "Knowledge is obtained from the book not from college or university. However, some individuals opine that a university degree is necessary to become a successful person. Others opine that  studying at university does not acquire any practical knowledge. I discuss both the perspective and I believe that nothing is gained from the university study.",
        "Many people believe that to become success in life, a person should gain a university study. First of all, there are many career courses at the university. These courses offer high package salary jobs such as aviation, software development, medical, and many more field which is in high demand in the market. Secondly, many government jobs require a university degree. To exemplify, in India, UPSC, banking job, and other government sectors. To fill the application in this department need a university study. If a person has study according to their term then he/she could eligible for the examination.",
        "Other individuals think that a university degree does not require to achieve  success in their life. The predominant reason behind that some people have interested in sports, arts like music, dance and acting. All these fields do not need any university degree. It only needs dedication, determination, and passion to become an actor, a sports person and others. Next, a business minded person has a good idea of starting their business. Some businessman does not have a university degree still they have a success in their life.  To illustrate my view, Elon Musk is one of the richest people in the world. He started my business from PayPal to SpaceX. He does not have to study. Although, he had some vision to do and achieve something great in life.",
        "My opinion is that a person should have a goal and aim in their life. If they dedicated to their goal then any degree and qualification could not stop them to become a successful person. For example, my software developer and web developer do not have any college degree yet they get  tremendous success such as Bill Gates. He develops Microsoft window on their own without any university degree.",
        "To conclude, a university degree is the one reason many people succeed through this and others  have passion to become successful."
