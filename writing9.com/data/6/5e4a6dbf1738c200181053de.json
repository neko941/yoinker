        "It is definitely true that the consumption of sugary drinks has dramatically increased in recent years. The properties found in such drinks are responsible for this, and various actions can be taken to deal with this situation.",
        "One of the major reasons why manufacturers make sugar-sweetened beverages is due to their highly addictive ingredients - sugar and caffeine - which are prevalent in the majority of such drinks. Based on recent scientific research, these substances can elevate energy levels as well as enhance mood, which are both very effective for people who do not have time to cook nutritious meals for themselves. Consequently, more and more customers, especially children, choose carbonated drinks as their instant energy boosters. Another reason for the popularity of such beverages is that they are becoming more readily available. It takes customers only a few minutes to purchase a carbonated drink from a supermarket, a store, or a vending machine. This kind of drink is so ubiquitous that there is little incentive for sweet-toothed people to give up their favorite drinks in the long term.",
        "Several measures can be implemented to counter this problem. One of these is to impose higher taxes on unhealthy drinks with a high sugar content so that they become unaffordable and less appealing to customers. An additional solution would be to reduce the vast amount of advertising for high-sugar beverages that mostly target children. Educational campaigns should also be run in schools and companies to raise awareness about the health risks associated with the excessive consumption of such drinks.",
        "In conclusion, a lot of factors have contributed to the trend towards increased consumption of sugary drinks. In turn, and due to their negative impact, several approaches must be taken to mitigate the consequences."
