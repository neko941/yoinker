        "In society nowadays, smartphones are seen everywhere. People use smartphones for convenience and other advantages, but we still cannot underestimate the disadvantages of smartphones. In this essay, I will point out the advantages and disadvantages of smartphones.",
        "On the one hand, the benefits of smartphones are unlistable. Firstly, the convenience of smartphones is  one of the main reasons why people use smartphones. It is true that the smartphone makes it possible to do any type of work anywhere. For example, a person just simply makes a little tap and things are purchased on websites, documents are sent and a call was made. Furthermore, smartphones can strengthen family bonding. Nowadays, young people have the tendency to go abroad to start up. This can lead to homesick and their parents can feel lonely. Smartphones allow people to make calls and see and talk to their families in remote areas. For example, instead of feeling depressed and lonely in a foreign country, young people can see their families through smartphones.",
        "On the other hand, the dark side of smartphones is a big problem for the community. It is true that in the modern society, social interaction is decreasing. Some young people are feeling lonely in the busy society and this can lead to anxiety. According to Japanese experts, boys who look at screens of phones and TVs are more likely to have autism spectrum disorder than children who rarely watch them. Moreover, the electromagnetic radiation will be high because of the heavy internet usage and might lead to health problems such as a brain tumor and skin cancer.",
        "In conclusion, smartphones have both pros and cons. Smartphones can be maake our life easier, but it can also lead to health problems. It is crucial that we use it in a beneficial way and not abuse it or it can lead to bad consequences."
