Another reason is they are too much used to of technology, whenever they have leisure time instead of doing any strength task they indulge themselves in different electronic gadgets which causes many problems to them such as eye problem and over-weight. The Cambridge university research shows that an individual spend 8 to 10 hours daily using a mobile phone which causes spondylitis  and eye fluctuation problems. The reason is they have no activity related to physical strength. People should know the real value of physical work.",
        "However the situation is still not out of our hand, We should encourage people to spend their free time on health task instead of wasting in other activities. Government should do campaign regarding to health, organized free yoga classes and motivate them towards body strength. This is the only way we can decrease weight of an individual and increase their physical fitness.",
