However, these days fewer and fewer people appreciate art and turn their focus to science, technology and business. Why do you think that it?  What could be done to encourage more people to take interest in the arts?",

        "In recent times, experts have found that fewer artists are evolving , compared to  50 years ago. This mainly because no longer this  do people  earn  a huge sum out of it.  Therefore, if anyone wants reverse this situation, the government  should find remedies for the same.",
        "One of the main reasons why many people do not consider art as  a profession, this is because  they could not earn  a sufficient amount of income  to manage  both their personal and professional   requirements. Take pot making as an example,  this was a profit making job  a  long back ago; however, the  only a few remaining in this field as they could  not meet their  both ends.  Since there are many latest technologies and advancements  which do not find  art is no longer significant  to human life, eventually, art has been neglected by  the present generation.",
        "Even though some problems affect this field dramatically,  I, personally, believe that by taking certain steps and strategies these  can be effectively tackled. One possible method here is , the government has to introduce  some new  initiatives  to overcome difficulties of  this industry: train  how to incorporate  modern technologies  in arts to attract more customers towards it, how to make profit out of it, and give expert advice whoever show interest to start their career in  arts or art related field. Computer education, for instance,  can be provided for artists to enhance their performance and  find  a better market for their products. Eventually, they would able to enter the global economy by the support of the government.",
        "By way of conclusion,  it is true that  most of artists are encountering serious threats  as many opt to  join science related jobs over  artistic works,  but this can be tackled significantly by the authorities proper measures."
