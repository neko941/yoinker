        "Now a day usage of resources such as petroleum and drinking water is  drastic",
        "Increasing in usage and it is very dangerous. In this essay I would like to express what can be its cause and what can be done to overcome it.",
        "Firstly, This resource is very important in our day to day life. As a high growth of population and increase in means of transport such as cars, bus, bikes, etc. also increasing at a higher rate. It's been used in the vast majority and it is concern for our world and its survival. Oil and fresh water is a hot cake topic and peoples use them without and concern and waste them without even thinking twice. For example, in Dubai every house have 4 to 5 cars in a family, which is not even needed, it is a car for per person and which also cost in use of more petroleum instead of using  one car and everyone can travel together which vice versa effect our environment due to air pollution and increase in global warming.",
        "Secondly, Freshwater makes up a very small fraction of all water on the planet. While nearly 70 percent of the world is covered by water, only 2.5 percent of it is fresh. The rest is  ocean-based and many peoples misuse water like there is no tomorrow. For instance, while doing brush  some peoples leave water tap open and they misuse water, and not only that peoples use water for car wash, which they do at home instead of using less water, they water they tend to use a lot amount of water.  To reduce and overcome this issues there should be seminar at every work place as well as educational institutions to provide knowledge to everyone regarding its benefits and what can happen if we didn't stop wasting it unnecessary. Even government should take few steps to provide knowledge of peoples and encourage them to use more of Eco friendly fuel and reduce waste of water.",
        "To summarize, In a study,  Singapore and few other countries use recycled water and it should in encourage in other countries. We all should value the resources and should use them at a limited rate  as they are very scarce and if we don't take steps soon enough, then there might be a day when there will be no more oil or fresh water to drink."
