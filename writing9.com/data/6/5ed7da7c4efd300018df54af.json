        "Today, workers have the opportunity to work remotely due to advances in Information Technology and transportation. This essay will argue that the advantages of this outweigh the drawbacks. It will be first demonstrated that people, in general, feel better when they can work more comfortably and that this ability can reduce costs for both employer and employee, followed by an analysis of how the primary disadvantage, namely unemployment by job transfer, is not valid.",
        "A great part of work today can be carried out anywhere on earth as long as there is a stable Internet connection. That is to say that people can improve their work just by staying in places where they can concentrate better. A recent study carried out by the research company Gartner revealed that companies prefer to keep their employees working from home and close to their family. Working out of the office also helps to reduce costs. When a person works from home, he or she can wear inexpensive and more comfortable clothes. During the COVID-19 pandemic that has been plaguing the world, for instance, the costs related to food, clothing, and transportation for workers decreased dramatically.",
        "Some authorities contend that remote work hurts the economy. Part of the work that could be done domestically is transferred to other countries with lower salaries. For instance, many call-center services from countries such as the United States were moved to India, where spoken English is adequate and salaries are just a fraction of what they would be in the original country.",
        "On balance, the development of modern communication and transportation technologies led to better work conditions and significant cost reductions. This vastly outweighs the weak argument of increased unemployment due to the transfer of jobs."
