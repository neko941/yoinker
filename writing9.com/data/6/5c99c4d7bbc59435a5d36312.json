        "The argument over whether learning at home or at school is better for children has not been settled yet. Whereas home education offers better protection with individual learning and opportunities for families to bond, institutes or early child learning have a superior range of material and human resources. Ultimately, I think such experience is best for children. There are several advantages for children who learn at home.",
        "Firstly, they can spend more time with their parents and siblings. Many social problems are associated with families not spending enough quality time together. Teaching children at home also provides them with an individualized learning environment. Instruction is custom designed and moves at the child\u2019s own pace and in accordance with his or her individual learning style.",
        "Finally, home schooling protects children from bullies and others who might be a bad influence. On the other hand, going to other the environment also offers advantages for children. Schools encourage children to socialize with their peers and learn how to cope with gossip, bullying and peer pressure. In addition, children will receive better tuition across a range of disciplines, teachers who are trained in special subjects. What is more, one can have better access to physical resources such as sports equipment, musical instruments and library books.",
        "I believe that children are better off in such environment. Although family time and individual learning are important, the range of expertise and resources that faculty offer cannot be matched in the home. Sending children to other environments may present difficult social situations, but so too does the real world and children must learn to navigate these on their own."
