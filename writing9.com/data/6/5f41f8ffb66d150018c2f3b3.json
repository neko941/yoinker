        "It is true that the rate of obesity has been gradually increasing over the last few years. There are many reasons for this trend and also several solutions that should be taken to address the concern.",
        "There are compelling reasons why an increasing number of people are overweight. Firstly, people tend to consume more convenience food, which can be made in a short period of time these days. it is especially suitable for busy ones. Furthermore, it contains high levels of fat and cholesterols that can lead to obesity. Secondly, people may actually become lazier. Nowadays, with the advent of technological advancements, it is unessential to do a large amount of domestic tasks. Dishwashers or robotic vacuums, for example, partially results in lack of daily physical exercise, which is necessary for a healthy lifestyle.",
        "Some measures can be applied to solve this issue. Firstly, the governments should have strict control over the consumption of fast food by raising taxes imposed on such products. As a result, people will gradually turn their back on fast food and prefer more vegetables and nutritious foods. Secondly, schools and offices, which usually have the highest level of obesity, should apply collective exercises for students and staffs. This can create a healthy habit, particularly for individuals who work around the clock. Thirdly, the local authorities should take responsibility for organizing sports contests. Such activities will make a competitive environment and encourage amateur sportsmen to take exercise on a daily basis and to win the game they participate in.",
        "In conclusion, it is a fact that the rate of obesity is increasing. However, there are still approaches to prevent this from going further."
