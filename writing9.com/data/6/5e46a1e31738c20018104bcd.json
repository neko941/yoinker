        "I am writing to let you know that I am very content with the collection of books the library offers to read. It almost covers a wide range of genres from romance, mystery, politics, motivational, history, mythology to literature, academics and puzzle solving to enhance brain activities. Due to this, a lot of users are attracted towards your library.",
        "However, according to me, a marginalized amount of users did not prefer to continue using the library. This could be due to the lack of basic services like water filter and the overall presentation of the library. Therefore, users borrow the books and opt for reading at their own house as opposed to staying back at the library.",
        "I strongly suggest you to provide good and clean siting arrangements along with more appealing yet sober ambience. Even having a coffee machine installed in the premise would be a gimmick to gain user's attention. An additional advice would be to have the library open and accessible 24x7.",
        "I am grateful to all the services you offer, however, if you could rework on the library's look and feel, it would not only add to my contentment but also attract public attention.",
