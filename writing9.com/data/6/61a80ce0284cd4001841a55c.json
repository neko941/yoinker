        "n the past six months, Beth has increased her salary by nearly \u00a310,000. She has gradually negotiated her way from full-time office hours to a permanent remote-working contract. Her day-to-day opportunities have swelled. Compared to the start of the year, she has struck a better work-life balance. And she\u2019s done it with practically zero haggling or demands.",
        "Instead, her career upgrade has been achieved by swiftly changing jobs. \u201cWhenever I\u2019ve felt as though the role hasn\u2019t been exactly as promised, I\u2019ve looked for the next opportunity,\u201d explains Beth. \u201cIf it\u2019s something that\u2019s closer to my ideal work set-up, a company that looks appealing, then I apply.\u201d",
        "Based in Yorkshire, UK, Beth is soon to begin her third account-manager role this year. She says she\u2019s only been able to finally command a fair wage and flexible working by adopting this job-seeking mindset. \u201cUnfortunately, my experience is that I\u2019ll only receive a pay rise if I go to my boss with another job offer,\u201d adds Beth. \u201cMy end goal has always been remote working. It felt unachievable \u2013 until I found my new role.\u201d",
        "Since the start of the pandemic, swathes of workers across industries have left their jobs \u2013 and millions more are contemplating quitting, too. It\u2019s helping to cause a worldwide hiring crisis. However, it\u2019s not just recent vacancies companies are struggling to fill. As many global economies are growing, businesses are struggling to keep up as they expand. The demand for talent is, therefore, skyrocketing. It\u2019s created a sellers\u2019 market: workers have more leverage than ever, and many can afford to cherry pick a role that aligns more with their values and desires.",
        "Rather than begin searching for a new position when they\u2019re unhappy or burned out \u2013 typically years into a role \u2013 some workers are opting to seek a better opportunity from day one. This mindset is a kind of \u2018Great Flirtation\u2019 with new jobs: a constantly wandering eye to other openings, regardless of how long a worker has been in a role, and how content they are in their current job.",
        "In a labour market that favours workers, is constantly flirting with other openings the right approach to help workers stay happy, get into better positions \u2013 or even achieve more in their career?",
        "\u2018Irrational, aimless wandering\u2019",
        "For decades, the prevailing narrative has been to stay in a role for as long as possible, build r\u00e9sum\u00e9 clout and make a lasting contribution to an organisation.",
        "Prematurely switching roles was stigmatised as \u2018job hopping\u2019 \u2013 not just by bosses, but also wider society. In 1974, American industrial psychologist Edwin Ghiselli likened it to vagrancy, coining the term \u2018Hobo Syndrome\u2019 to describe workers who frequently changed roles. His approach essentially re-framed the complexities of frequent quitting to irrational, aimless wandering \u2013 driven by internal impulses absent from \u201corganised or logical thought\u201d.",
        "Workers can take advantage of the current labour shortage and secure their dream role \u2013 Simon Wingate",
        "In this framework, employers held power over employees, which kept them in their roles. \u201cThe idea was if the employer takes care of you, you do the same and stick with them,\u201d explains Mark Bolino, director of management and international business at the University of Oklahoma, US.",
        "The global recession of the 1980s shook loose some of this thinking. As companies had to cut costs, they laid off workers, says Bolino, whose research has focused on employees\u2019 dedication to their organisations and why they quit. Instead of employers expecting workers to stay in roles indefinitely, he says \u201cthe relationship subsequently became more transactional: \u2018if we have layoffs, we have them. If you find a better job opportunity, we understand\u2019.\u201d",
        "Rather than climbing a career ladder with one company, then, the onus fell to the employee to forge their own path. Yet, \u2018sticking\u2019 at a job for the long-term was ingrained. According to data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, American workers\u2019 median job tenure steadily rose from 3.5 years in the 1980s to 4.4 years in the 2000s, before slightly dipping at the end of the past decade.",
        "Looking for the next opportunity has, typically, been a reactive process. Often, it\u2019s to the employee\u2019s detriment: waiting until frustration, a lack of progression or workplace conflict kicks in before bailing.",
        "But the pandemic seems to have changed this thinking; as workers report long stretches of stress and introspection, many are re-evaluating their lives and careers \u2013 and are more open to making moves. Workers have begun looking for jobs that better match the work set-ups they want \u2013 particularly the option for remote- and flexible work. \u201cIn August, we found that the number of applications for jobs with remote working outpaced the number of vacancies offering a hybrid work set-up,\u201d says Simon Wingate, managing director at UK recruitment firm Reed.",
        "However, job adverts have continued in their droves. Wingate says 120,000 vacancies were added to Reed in the first 10 days of November, meaning it\u2019s on track to have its highest number of monthly postings since 2008. A higher number of vacancies, coupled with an increase in employers offering better options to fill those roles, has created an embarrassment of riches for new job options. \u201cWorkers can take advantage of the current labour shortage and secure their dream role,\u201d adds Wingate.",
        "Furthermore, employees can seek job opportunities, even if they\u2019re not necessarily itching to leave their company immediately, and leverage the hot job market to their advantage. This is particularly the case as companies create remote-first roles, opening access to thousands of new roles for millions of workers once geographically excluded. \u201cThe power is currently in the workforce\u2019s hands, meaning they can make more demands \u2013 including a higher wage, more perks and flexible working arrangements,\u201d says Wingate."
