        "There is a lot of dispute about trade role in developing society. In my view, I think that I agree that businessmen should take responsibilities in society.",
        "Economic growth activities are very important for a country. If companies make a lot of money, they pay more taxes for government revenue. The authorities can use these taxes to spend on building facilities including schools, hospitals, road,\u2026 Therefore, people get advantages from field taxes and have wealthier life. When businesses make salary can expand so it can provide more jobs for nearby residents and contribute to decrease the unemployment rate in the country. Not only businesses make property, but also play an important role in social responsibilities. Businesses must not harm the environment when developing work activities. There are a lot of macro problems which are relevant to businesses including global warming from factory emissions, responsible disposal of waste,... In the Paris agreement on climate change,the governments of each nation on the world agree that people should reduce the amount of factory emissions in production activities. The most important element to make this agreement successful is business role. Corporations are also responsible for disposing of waste. Businesses should improve the awareness of environmental protection. Firms have to recycle and use waste treatment methods to protect the environment. Furthermore, businesses which make profits should put wage back into the community through charity and financial scholarships. There are many charity activities which were conducted by businesses such as Microsoft and Vinamilk. These charities contributed to develop society and help many people overcome obstacles."
