Moreover, he started misbehaving with him and, on the top of this, he stopped the bus in the middle of the highway.",
        "In additions, when other passengers took initiative to resolve the matter, then he was not ready to understand the nuances of the condition. He had stopped the bus for more than an hour without any information given to the traveller and, when he had realised that departure will be late, then all of sudden he started driving at very fast speed just cover the distance.",
