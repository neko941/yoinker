        "Education is an essential part in the growth of a human being.It has always been a highly debatable issue that whether government should fund for the education of students or it should be taken care by an individual.I somewhat agree that education from kindergarten through university should be paid for by the administration.",
        "Some people in any country are financially capable and can afford for the study of their kids till post graduation.However, some people are also below the poverty line and cannot pay for their basic schooling and higher studies.Therefore, if authorities do not contribute in teaching of these students either by providing scholarships or free education then, this will lead many problems.Firstly, it will rise illiteracy rate.Secondly, due to lack of education, crime rate will increase.Finally, it will affect the economy of the country as many people will not be able to contribute to it.",
        "The Administration is taking high steps in my country to give free basic school education, uniform and midday meal to every student.This way it helps kids whose parents are financially incapable. Moreover, authorities are also assisting talented students to complete graduation and post graduation by providing scholarships.However, only free schooling is provided by the authorities.Government do not fund for the graduation and post graduation of students.In my view, government should provide free education from preschool through college to the unfortunate ones only.Lucky ones, who can afford education by themselves should not be given free education.",
        "To conclude, I believe that education is the right of every human being.Therefore, It should be provided by the authorities to the ones who are not capable to get by their own."
