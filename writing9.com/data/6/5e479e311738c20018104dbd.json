        "In  recent  years  it  has  become  far  more  normal  for  people  to  live  alone, particularly  in  large  cities  in  the  developed  world.  In  my  opinion,  this  trend could  have  both  positive  and  negative  consequences  in  equal  measure. The  rise  in  one-person  households  can  be  seen  as  positive  for  both personal  and  broader  economic  reasons.  On  an  individual  level,  people who  choose  to  live  alone  may  become  more  independent  and  self-reliant than  those  who  live  with  family  members.  A  young  adult  who  lives  alone, for  example,  will  need  to  learn  to  cook,  clean,  pay  bills  and  manage  his or  her  budget,  all  of  which  are  valuable  life  skills;  an  increase  in  the number  of  such  individuals  can  certainly  be  seen  as  a  positive development.  From  an  economic  perspective,  the  trend  towards  living alone  will  result  in  greater  demand  for  housing.  This  is  likely  to  benefit  the construction  industry,  estate  agents  and  a  whole  host  of  other  companies that  rely  on  homeowners  to  buy  their  products  or  services. However,  the  personal  and  economic  arguments  given  above  can  be considered  from  the  opposite  angle.  Firstly,  rather  than  the  positive feeling  of  increased  independence,  people  who  live  alone  may experience  feelings  of  loneliness,  isolation  and  worry.  They  miss  out  on the  emotional  support  and  daily  conversation  that  family  or  flatmates  can provide,  and  they  must  bear  the  weight  of  all  household  bills  and responsibilities;  in  this  sense,  perhaps  the  trend  towards  living  alone  is  a negative  one.  Secondly,  from  the  financial  point  of  view,  a  rise  in  demand for  housing  is  likely  to  push  up  property  prices  and  rents.  While  this  may benefit  some  businesses,  the  general  population,  including  those  who live  alone,  will  be  faced  with  rising  living  costs. In  conclusion,  the  increase  in  one-person  households  will  have  both beneficial  and  detrimental  effects  on  individuals  and  on  the  economy."
