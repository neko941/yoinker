        "Education is building block or rather foundation for the students to become successful in life. There has been a paradigm shift in decisions  of choosing the universities, now a days students prefer to study abroad due to its various reaping benefits. but on the contrary, they have the detrimental effects. Personally, I see eye to eye with the central idea.",
        "On one hand, Supporters believe that there  evidences significantly proving supremacy of the foreign courses. With plethora of  advance researches & more practical approach towards imparting knowledge which native university lacks which makes foreign university their top choice. There is proven study done by Howard University that reflects 80% increase of international students in foreign countries all over the world. Secondly, international degree holders are preferred by top organisations around the world evidently, due to their adaptability, communication skills & practical & latest  knowhow of business world. For example, researches done by universities like Oxford, Yale & Howard are extensively adopted by top business organisations to improve employee best practices & policies.",
        "On the other hand, due to change in the preference of choosing foreign universities native universities are loosing their importance as well as  business which in return leading to brain drain. For instance a student studying from  aboard would prefer to work & settle in abroad. Certainly, which has the detrimental effect on respective country\u2019s economy because first they spend on education & once they start working in foreign country they spend for their in foreign land. So foreign countries have win win situation but not good for native\u2019s country.",
        "To summarize, as there are two sides of the coin, studying abroad has that too, albeit for the students it can be fruitful. However, the value of education system in their respective country is decreasing. I think Government should rework & reform the education system in such way that it stand par with best Universities ."
