So, it is one kind genetic characteristics which make his personality as like an introvert.",
        "On the second hand, society, family, friends are the important terms that could help someone\u2019s to improve his personality. People could be changed his behavior by the influence of social environment. Older citizen of the society can help the younger to build their personality while the family can play some role to change the personality of the family members. For example, one of my friends always face trouble while he wants to talk with unknown person. But our friend circle understands about this matter and we try to help him to remove his shyness. We always encourage him as he could remove this characteristic and develop his personality. Now he becomes more confident to talk with new people. Since he could not face the unknown person, now he can give the presentation in front of unknown audiences.",

But society, friends, family environment could be act as a major role in the development of an individual\u2019s personality. It can be suggested that no matters what are the genetic characteristics, people can develop his personality by the other experiences of his life."
