        "Skills gained through practice and knowledge acquired from books are two things that go hand in hand in learning. Hence I partially disagree that formal qualifications entirely fall in value in the forthcoming future for they are the main foundation of any practical sphere.",
        "On the one hand, practical skills are of much importance for workers to perform their duties and tasks both efficiently and effectively. There are certain things which can only be obtained by means of years\u2019 of experience.  For example, dressmakers and hairdressers gain valuable skills thereby training for many years. Interestingly, some of the widely recognized faces, like Bill Gates and Jek Ma have no any formal education, yet they are doing wonders in the world.",
        "On the other hand, being qualified can be a matter of life and death in some professions.  Theory can be even more critical in the job market than expertise of any kind, form and sort. For instance, but for diplomas and degrees, professionals, such as doctors and teachers would not be capable of performing and fulfilling their work. Moreover, without the basic skills like mathematics and arithmetic or writing and reading, workers can not function at a professional level. One striking example is accounting. Not knowing the foundations of numbers, they may find themselves hopeless in the workplace or even redundant.",
        "To summarize, theoretical knowledge and practically-gained skills are closely connected with each other. Even though more emphasis is put on experience in the job market today, it would be a big mistake to ignore formal qualifications for they are the basis of any profession."
