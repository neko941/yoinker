        "Pollution has become a huge problem for the world recently. Although some people attributed this issue to an urban life, others, however, believe that the environmental pollution is due to advanced modern technologies. I completely agree with the assertion that urbanization is the primary factor that causes environmental issues. My essay will first examine why the overpopulation causes the demand for fuel, and explain why I feel that factories can emit certain pollutants.",
        "One of the main causes of the environmental pollution which arises out of urban countries is that in these nations there is a growing demand for fuel. This is mainly because of the increasing number of inhabitants that in turn expand the requirement for transport and airline tickets. People start buying more cars and travelling a lot, so it means that the aircrafts and vehicles emit more chemical pollutants. Atmospheric and chemistry, pollution are the biggest problems which many countries are struggling with, because these trends can induce an acid rain. Perhaps the best example of it would be a survey that was held in 2015, and which indicated that in China, a person changes his cars three every three years. This argument has demonstrated, I believe, that car and aircrafts are one of the trends that may have an adversarial influence on the environment.",
        "Another negative factor that can come from urbanization is the carbon emissions, as there are an abundance of factories. At present, oil manufacturers significantly pollute the air, and by doing this, these factories may cause the global warming. This will affect on the world temperature, that will probably have a far-reaching impact on the environment, because many plants, trees and animals will die. It was recently declared by the BBC, for instance, that during the lock down of the pandemic of carnivorous the carbon emissions were sharply decreased from 13 up to 7 percent,",
        "as most manufacturers were suspended. As a result, carbon emissions can not only have a detrimental effect on the environment, but also can initiate the global warming.",
        "In conclusion, the overpopulation of people and the carbon emissions from factories are the main trends which cause the environmental pollution from urban nations, and therefore I agree that urbanization is a source of pollution."
