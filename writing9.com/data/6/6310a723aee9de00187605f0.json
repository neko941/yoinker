        "As the economy is advancing by leaps and bounds, the attitude people adopt towards dress code outstanding or comfortable clothes when staff go to work has undergone a noticeable and far-reading transformation. Under this circumstance an absolute consensus is hardly reached as to whether bosses do not pay attention to the dress instead of concerned about work performance. From my part, although the way people dress should be seen as irrelevant in many work contexts, I do believe that decent clothes still exist for good reason in certain professions.",
        "To begin with, those who are against wearing clothes that do not interfere with their work suppose that employers have relaxed dress attire to create a comfortable working environment for employees, make it easier for them to choose their work clothes and increase work productivity. Therefore, the staff work will not be constrained by dress code which is the workplace corporations have not enacted laws. In addition, companies paid for solving problems in their work rather than paying them to dress well for corporate fashion. For instance,  an office worker spends most of the time at a computer in a closed cubicle whatever they wear casual so it does not change the level of productivity.",
        "By contrast, the companies need employees have shown the feature of the brands such as bankers, doctors, sales hotel receptionists or fashionista is wearing professional uniforms to express respect for the work. Besides, the first impression their customers when they see sales force dress politely which they will appreciate. For example, employees need to sign contracts or serve customers then they have to wear semi-casual to observe clients.",
        "To conclude, I am convinced that sales wear beautiful clothes are good reason for working instead of  comfortable attires when going to work. From this point, professionalism in dress could help enhance the recognition brand and compete with the opponent."
