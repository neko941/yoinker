        "One of the rising tendency nowadays is that elders accounting for a higher percentage, on the contrary to the lowers figures for youngsters in many countries. From my perspective, I believe that this trend has more negative effects that could cause healthcare problems and economic stagnation.",
        "In terms of healthcare, the primary issues confronting countries with a large proportion of older adults would be the cost of providing the Public Health Service. The more people in the older group, the more healthcare problems authorities have to deal with. Therefore, governments have to impose spending cuts or raise taxes on income in order to provide funding for increasing health care. In countries like the USA and UK, elderly individuals also take out private health insurance as they are afraid that welfare states are inadequate to guarantee good health care when they are old.",
        "From the perspective of the economy, an aging population can also be understood as the shrinking number of people in working age and labour shortage. The national economy always depends on the stabilize workforce that increasing its GDP year by year. Insufficient working labour could be a threat that creates social-economic problems and economic stagnation. Nowadays, in many developed countries with aging populations has enacted policies to attract youngsters from other countries studying and working in their countries. On the other hand, developing countries also encourage their citizens to get married earlier. A good illustration is Vietnam, which has recently implemented a policy that brings more interest to adults marrying before the age of 30 and give birth to two children.",
        "In conclusion, I reiterate my strong view that an aging population creates severe problems to the national healthcare system and economy."
