        "The relative success of different country is usually defined in economic terms. I think it is not the only thing to asses a country. In my opinion, there are another important things such as education and good environment.",
        "Firstly, i want to say that standard of education, health, and individual human rights certainly be considered when measuring a country\u2019s status. A good education system is important for the development of any nation. With great education in schools, colleges, and universities, they can produce the best quality of future generations of workers. Healthcare provision is also an indicator of the standard of living within a country, this can be measured by looking at average life expectancy rates and availability of medical services.",
        "Secondly, the good environment can plays important role. Any country cannot consider it self at top if it lacks in healthier citizens and has unsafe environment to live in. For example, if the environment has a lot of trashes in any places, this can become a disease to many people, not only in their own country but can affect to another country. Moreover, if the government do not take steps to migitate crime in the country and it keeps people in fear. So i think, all these factors highly count while measuring country\u2019s success.",
        "In conclusion, The economic growth reflects country\u2019s prosperity, but the other factors such as education and food environment should also be considered. But i would agrue that the standard of a country\u2019s education system is the best measure of its success."
