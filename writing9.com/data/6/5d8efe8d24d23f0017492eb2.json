        "As compared to the bygone decades, many tourist locations and museums are visited by people from other nations instead of natives. There are multiple reasons associated with this trend.This essay intends to discuss  about the main causes of this issue and  suggests certain remedies in order to attract    the local area to visit  museums and adorable  destinations.",
        "To begin with, there are certain factors behind the issue of people from the local area are not visited museums and local   fascinating  places. Firstly,  either unaware of the importance of  a particular place or they want to travel into long distances. To go into detail, people are least bothered about the crucial history of their places. Besides, they  may not have interested visit the local  areas .So they are always looking at the fares places instead of the nearest  cites. For instance, India is enriched with a plethora of historical places and heritages,   however, people love to go to western countries for enjoyment during their holidays.Therefore, they can have new experiences.",
        "Nevertheless, there are myriads of solutions can be implemented by governing authorities as to  get locals in it. To be specific, the paramount factor  is that should be free of cost. So that  people from from low economic background also have the chance to go there.  Secondly,    local government can conduct awareness programs,especially school children. As   a result of these campaigns facilitate  improved the knowledge of people about their places. To cite an example, a survey report from a popular magazine reveals that In China local tourist  places are completely free for their local people.",
        "To conclude, what is apparent is that, local authority and people work shoulder to shoulder to escalate the number of     local visitors by providing free entry and   arrange educational programmes for  the public about the crucial factors of their museums and attractive  places.",
        "The Government  has  to take certain initiative  such as free entry pass and awareness campaigns and so on."
