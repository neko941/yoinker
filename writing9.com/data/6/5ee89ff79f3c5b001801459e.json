        "Educational systems vary significantly across the world, forcing some students to specialize when they reach 15,whereas others encourage a wider range of learning. While both systems had the same unique advantages, I would argue that school students should acquire a broad education",
        "On the one hand, there are two main reasons why in some educational systems in many countries around the globe, students tend to be trained in their specialized courses/subjects. One reason is that if students concentrate on some particular subjects at the age of 15, then they will be able to cover a lot of ground. For instance, if students at this age study maths and sciences only, they will be able to adopt some theories of the mathematical and scientific lessons to practical applications and they will not have the distractions of studying arts or languages. Another reason is that they will have a good grasp of their chosen areas of study. As nowadays, the job market is increasingly becoming more and more intensive competitive, therefore, applicants who are well-equipped with their endless knowledge and infinite understanding in a certain key fields often chase for top jobs, enabling them to progress rapidly in their chosen professions. In addition, this system will improve their job prospects when they leave school and they will be able to live independently on their own income",
        "On the other hand, i favour a system in which pupils study a wide range of subjects throughout their years at school. I would argue that this system is better for two important reasons. Firstly, a broad education is a preparation for life. Schools must encourage youngsters beyond the age of 15 to be interested in all aspects of life, by exposing them to subjects such as history or philosophy, and also the onus is on schools to incorporate relevant subjects into the curriculum so that it can boost the Young's creativity and their cognitive development. Furthermore, studying a number of subjects until they leave school, then pupils will have the chance to broaden their horizons and to make the most of their critical thinking and imagination. They may start to learn how to express themselves through some alternative outlet such as painting or writing, taking up a musical instrument or singing in a choir at school",
        "In conclusion, although concentrating on distinctive subjects is the fundamental priciple of teaching in some educational system all over the world and it is beneficial in some ways, I believe that studying a wide range of subjects prepares young people countless opportunity to develop in their lives"
