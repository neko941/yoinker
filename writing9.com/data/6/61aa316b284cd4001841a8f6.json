        "Many individuals are of the belief that music brings people together regardless of their age and culture.I totally agree with this statement  as I believe that music is something which makes everyone happy and helps unwind. It is a good way of relaxing and feeling good about life. This essay will further justify my views on the same.",
        "To start with, in the earlier times when technology was not so advanced, people used to listen to country/regional music. But, over the past decades it is gaining momentum and is accessible with the growth of  the internet, corporate culture and globalization. We can download songs we like and enjoy the same on our mobile phones. Music helps us to understand different cultures. For instance, the famous Korean song Gagnum Style; the song is in a korean language, still it became the most popular song among people across the world. Although the lyrics were not understood by many of us but the beats and the rhythm was so good, it was liked by all even among the sports players, celebrities and youngsters.",
        "Also, music is something which is liked by humans of different age-groups. Older people like to listen to country music or songs from the 60s and 70s, younger people these days have their favourite band or genre. Moreover in weddings, concerts and festivals, everyone will dance and enjoy the beats together on songs played or sung without any age barrier.  These days the popularity of music shows is also growing. For example, famous prime time shows like X Factor and Indian Idol where all family members from children, parents and grandparents enjoy the performance altogether.",
        "In conclusion, we need music in every phase of life. Music makes everyone cheerful and brings different nations together regardless of the age."
