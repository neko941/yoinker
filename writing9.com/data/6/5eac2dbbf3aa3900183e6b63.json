        "In this time, many countries are offering scholarships to the students that would like to continue their study abroad. However, they choose those students based on many criteria such as high grades, age and English language level. There are scholarships for graduate and postgraduate pupils, and mostly the students prefer to study in developed English speaking countries like the United States and the United Kingdom. In this article, I will discuss the pros and cons of studying abroad.",
        "Studying abroad has a lot of advantages, one of the important facts that we need to identify is that nations generally send the students abroad to study the majors that they need the most in their country. For instance, if a country has a shortage in the number of physicians, they will send students to study degrees related to the medical field.",
        "In addition to this, studying abroad will help the student to master a new language besides their mother tongue. Without exception there are massive benefits of learning another language, for instance, they can reach and understand more information in this new language, which will help them to extend their knowledge. Besides this, learning a new language will help them to communicate with more people easily. Linked to this idea, studying abroad will help the students to explore new cultures and meet people with different backgrounds, which will help them to become more open to supporting positive changes in their own communities.",
        "Despite the benefits of studying abroad, there are some disadvantages that we need to point out. The first one is that some graduate students decide to immigrate to the country they study in, which prevents their country from the benefits of their knowledge and skills. Furthermore, they could melt completely into the new culture and forget their original. The last point is that the student who studied abroad will learn scientific terms in the second language, which could cause some difficulties when they return to their country and communicate with people who don\u2019t speak that language.",
        "In conclusion, I am in the opinion that countries should continue to send students to study abroad. However, those students have to be excellent and extraordinary. Furthermore, I recommend that the scholarships should be in the majors that the country needs the most."
