        "It is an undeniable fact that people have always a dream about  their ideal homes. It is argued that city councils have little control on  designs of buildings; therefore, owners have  power to choose the best designs of their infrastructures. In my opinion, I think that deciding  structure of buildings is done by owners has more benefits like innovations in buildings and the sense of satisfaction compared to the drawbacks of it.",
        "Admittedly, there are certain basic disadvantages of this trend. Firstly, unique and special designs of any infrastructure often are vulnerable to natural calamities. What I mean, their quality of standards compromises  over the design of any structure. So, chances of destruction of some buildings are higher than the normal ones. It raises a question of safety of people who live there. Secondly, the race of buildings better homes than neighbours has negative consequences on the society. This trend might lead society to show off. Consequently, it may create envy between individuals.",
        "Nevertheless, despite the disadvantages above, I believe freedom of deciding designs of buildings has crucial benefits. First and foremost, this approach stimulates the creativity in folks regarding different concepts of the their buildings. In other words, people have the desire to make their houses beautiful and attractive. Hence, it will augment the reputation of cities and localities. For instance, Burj Khalifa, world tallest building. It is one of the seven wonders of the world, which increases fame of Dubai all over the world. Another is, a sense of satisfaction by making own ideal houses or infrastructure. If individuals can have rights to choose the design of the buildings, then people would have a sense of belonging there. As a result, they can feel proud of themselves by living in their desired homes.",

        "In conclusion, although freedom of designs of buildings has some cons, which should be overlooked by the pros that bring. Thus, I consider that it would be beneficial if individuals choose  design of their houses."
