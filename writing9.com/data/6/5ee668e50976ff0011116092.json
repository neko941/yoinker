        "A globalization has created a trend of learning the different languages among the people in order to enhance their personality. The question on whether they need to reside in the country to learn its regional language or not has always been argued. There are valid explanations for either side, however in my own perspective, it\u2019s not necessary to live in the nation to learn its language in spite of being an enriching experience.",
        "To begin with, the act of migration from one to another country in a hope of better future prospects influences migrants to learn the foreign language. In fact, residing among the native speakers help them to understand, speak and read it easily and quickly. Moreover, knowing about the culture and tradition of the nation further helps them to learn their language. Additionally, the people have to communicate fluently in order to flourish and prosper in their jobs. In some countries, individual have to pass the language test such as English and German to apply for admission at the university or permanent residency application. Therefore, all these scenarios help an individual learn the second language efficiently by living among their communities.",
        "On the other hand, the advancement of modern technology and digitization has launched various online or offline applications and video lectures through which one can learn any language. In addition to it, there are numerous online translators and news channels which can enhance their teaching process. These days, various schools have introduced different languages in their curriculum so that students can learn them as their hobby or for their future career growth.",
        "To recapitulate, I opine that a person can still learn the second language without living in its country of origin, however the fluency and accuracy can be achieved by residing in the region where it is most spoken."
