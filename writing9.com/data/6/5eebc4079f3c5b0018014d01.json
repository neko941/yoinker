        "Choosing the right education for kids is a great concern for many parents.In today's era with developments happening all over the world a number of schools are now open for the kids.It is a very difficult task for many parents for where they can enrol their child.Many top international schools are now open, but people still have a regressive mindset regarding boys and girls studying together in a class.My essay will highlight certain points about mixed classroom.",
        "An institute is a place where children come and gel well with their peers.This not only helps for their social interaction, but helps the child to know about the ways boys have to treat girls and how girls have to treat boys.Both the boys and girls get to know about each other's physical growth,mental health and how do they have to behave socially when they are out in public.",
        "But many parents are still against the idea of educating boys and girls together.They think that girls should be taught in a girls academy so that the girl remains safe and can focus on her studies.On the other hand, some parents think that boys should be taught at the boys' institute as they will ill treat the girls.",
        "According to my opinion there shouldn't be any discrimination about teaching males and females in the same university.They should be taught together so that they can be more comfortable with the opposite gender.This helps in peer interaction and cooperative learning amongst them.Because in the future if the female is made to work with a male colleague, she might know how to maintain a certain distance and she would also know about good and bad touch.The boys would also know that they cannot ill treat women in any sense."
