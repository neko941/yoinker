Luckily, I have found another flat in the same building, but they have given me the lease agreement in the Punjabi language which I have to get translated before signing it. Although I tried to find a translator nearby, I couldn't find any.",
        "As we both studied all our classes together, it came to my mind that you had taken punjabi language as your optional course in the school, and you were pretty good in that. Now, it is really important for me to sign this agreement today itself so that I can move in to the other house by tomorrow. Before that, it's a must to get it translated so that I can understand all the terms and condition written in that document.",

If you are in this region only then please come to my house when you get some time, or else let me know and I will come to your place in the evening.",
