        "It is irrefutable that art plays a pivotal role in overall development of a child. Some people opine that art is a crucial subject and it should be taught at schools. While others opine that learning art is a waste of time. I do not agree with this argument. Through this essay I will cast light to highlight the importance of the arts.",
        "On the one side, there are different fields in the arts like music, drawing, acting and others. Nowadays arts becoming an essential factor in our day to day life. Children's focus and patience will get improved if they learn the art subjects. Kids need some relaxation after spending time on curriculum subjects. Thus, they can spend it on learning the music or dance or others. For example, many people have the stage fear. Kids who have the arts knowledge they will definitely perform the stage shows and it helps them to get rid of it.",
        "On the other side, some people assert that learnig arts like music, dance need lot of time. If children spend the same amount of time for learning the Science or maths then they can get a good score, which helps them to get admission into better colleges for their higher studies. They will also believe that artists are struggling to survive in their life. For instance, artist spend lot of time to sell his paints.",
        "To put in a nutshell, having discussed the argument and counter arguments. Learning art needs a lot of time but it improves the child dedication and sportive nature. I will recommend all schools have the art classes and encourage students to participate in those classes."
