        "Dear Sir,",
        "I am writing this letter regarding the noise pollution from the newly opened restaurant on the campus, especially during night hours. All the students are studying at that time and the loud music from that cafeteria is uneasy for everyone in the hostel.",
        "Nightlife in the university campus was very calm and stable before the opening of this restaurant and everyone was able to study peacefully. The bad thing is the location is very near to the student hostel and the sounds of bikes and cars of people coming to the restaurant make it worse. Most of the scholars leave the evening hours for the study purpose but the distraction from this is not allowing people to concentrate on their course.",
        "I would like to request you on behalf of all the students of the hostel to take some actions on them. We would suggest minimizing the sound level from the food court can act as an effective solution and the parking should be only for the university residency persons.",
        "I hope you will understand our concerns and take some actions immediately.",
