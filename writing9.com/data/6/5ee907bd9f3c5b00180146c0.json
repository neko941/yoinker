        "Nowadays, a question about gifts is quite difficult, because people tend to argue what exactly is the most suitable for adolescents as a present.  For now, there is the most doubtful side is money.",
        "On the one hand, a plethora of people opine that financial handout is the best way to surprise any teenager. Indeed, that may give a young person the sense of independence. Moreover, they might learn how to deal with their own income, and that will have a positive impact in their future. For instance, one research took place a few years ago and that revealed that the teenagers who were given money as a gift were able to deal with finances better in comparison with others.",
        "On the other hand, there is a strong view that youth should not receive such gifts as money. That might have an extremely alarming outcome, because they may spend it recklessly. Furthermore, young children may get used to it and start to demand such presents in the future. For example, the majority of wealthy parents why were presenting financial gifts to their offsprings, noticed that their children stopped to appreciate other presents. As a result, society may face the number of spoiled people.",
        "Personally, I believe that choice in gifts depends on a teenager. If he or she is respectful and wise young person, then it is completely acceptable so support them with some financial presents. However, spoiled youngsters should not get money. The decision has to be made carefully.",
        "In conclusion, money may trigger feelings of self-support and awareness of finance importance, but it has some downsides such as the irresponsible attitude of teenagers in regard to money."
