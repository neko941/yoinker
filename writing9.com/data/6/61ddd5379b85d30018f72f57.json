        "Some people are of the notion that nowadays, women are becoming more like men. Others, however, oppose such view that is they assume men are becoming more like women. From my perspective, women and men are not on the same wavelength, and as such, they should not become like each other, but if I should decide one of those, I am afraid that the former one is more likely to happen. One of the issues in this argumentation is the matter of job opportunities and incomes.",
        "To begin with, women are exceptionally good at so many things and tend to fill in very well wherever they go, and for that reason, they tend to perform exceptionally well in their various professions. Nevertheless, giving them the same profession and chances as their male counterparts in the same field means they do not have the same chance or salary. In explaining the reason mentioned above, most women leave gaps that usually need to be filled temporarily at various workplaces due to maternity leave. Organizations and companies are put under a great deal of stress as a result of this situation. For instance, in the case of a female surgeon who is on maternity leave, the hospital will be forced to hire a replacement for the short term due to the resulting void in her position. Additionally, most women experience the common health issues associated with women, and as a result, they sometimes miss work, which negatively impacts their productivity and job performance."
