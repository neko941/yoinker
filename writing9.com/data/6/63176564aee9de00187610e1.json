        "Many people use distance-learning programs to study at home and it peaked after the Covid-19 pandemic causing everyone to stay at home. The way it differs from regular classroom programs is that a person is not obliged to attend a lecture in a classroom located either in school, college or university. Although this is highly debatable whether debatable either distance-learning programs are actually beneficial, we will look into the positives and negatives of these programs.",
        "Firstly, focus on the advantages it offers. It makes it possible to attend any lecture in any part of the world a person is attending, all thanks to advancements in digital technology. Then it makes classroom lectures more interactive through online presentations and if any person misses any lecture, he or she could be able to rewatch the missed lecture. Another advantage of this mentioned in line is that recorded lectures could be rewatched at any given time if some concepts were not cleared while attending the live lecture. It also helps tutors residing in different places to give a lecture to students at the given time making it easy for students as well as the tutor. There is a negligible cost of infrastructure while conducting hence making these programs a cheaper alternative to a regular classroom program.",
        "Now for the disadvantages, it is general fact that people tend to lose their focus on online classes due to needless notifications that pop up on their devices. Furthermore, most of the time students to the teacher ratio is not controlled hence ease of understanding any topic is difficult. Most   organisations still don't accept students for  their recruitment process who pass out from distance-learning curriculum compared to the regular curriculum.",
        "Hence, taking the positives and negatives into the consideration we can easily judge that its advantages surpass its disadvantages. Although, some remedies can be made to streamline the distance-learning program such as controlling the student-teacher ratio and standardising it in different organisations. It is the new generation of education and through some changes mentioned, many future students could possibly reap the fruits of this curriculum."
