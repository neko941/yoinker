        "The table illustrates data about the number of people travelling through the British airports, Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted, over a period of six-years between 1998 and 2003.",
        "Overall, what stands out from the data is that the Gatwick airport and the Stansted showed only upward trends in the passenger traffic, whereas the Heathrow saw both increasing and decreasing trends in the given period. Another interesting point is that the Gatwik airport served more visitors at the start and at the end of the period.",
        "Looking at the detail, as regards to the Heathrow airport, the number of visitors in 1998 was 27.2 million, and then the traffic increased gradually reaching 48.2 million by the end of 2000, which is highest in the year 2000 among all the airports mentioned. Following this, over the next two years, the airport recorded a significant decline in the visitors  reaching 33.2 million in 2002. Finally, it increased rapidly to reach 45.6 million at the end. If we look at the Stansted airport the trend was similar to the Heathrow until 2001 where it was used by 47.3 million people. At this point, despite having a growth of over 25 million in the starting four years, it remained unchanged at 47.3 million for two years till the end.",
        "By contrast, the Gatwick airport recorded 36.5 million passengers in 1998 and attracted more visitors gradually till 2002, but this was followed by a rapid growth of passenger traffic in 2003 from 51.1 million to 69.3 million in one year."
