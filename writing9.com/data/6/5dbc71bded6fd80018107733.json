        "People have different opinion on spending money for space excavations. However, there are many benefits of this. Firstly, this study would find solutions for some of the problems of mankind. Moreover, long term survival of the human race significantly depends  on finding another planet to move off  from  the planet earth; therefore, space explorations are  inevitable. Similarly, humans have benefited from these since a long back ago. Take digital imaging techniques as an example, which were originally developed by NASA to study pictures of the moon, later on this technique used  in diagnostic purpose.",
        "However, others think that it would be better  if tax payers  money spent on much pressing issues: development of hospitals, educational institutions, and public infrastructures.  Many think that it requires only fraction of the money that squandering on this research.Similarly, most of the countries investing in this with the view of getting military dominance, rather than  for humans\u2019 benefits. So, it is  a worrying situation that, there is a possibility of using satellite to spy on each other, it might have long term repercussion.",
        "People are differed regarding owning a gun. There are many people believe that there should be gun laws for the peaceful  society.",
        "Firstly, if any mentally ill person carries   a licensed gun, can be posed threat to the society and many argue that a peaceful society cannot be achieved as long as  members of the community own these deadly weapons. Free gun ownership is  an outdated system at the time when the common people are more at risk.",
        "Despite the above argument, others think that, people should be allowed  to have  their own gun as they can protect themselves with this. There is no guarantee that these restrictions or hard rules against owning  guns can be fruitful as there are more numbers of  people die from motor accidents.  However, no one argues  to ban driving."
