        "We live in an age when the personal lives of celebrities including their meals, family and friends are increasingly being scrutinized by newspapers and magazines that make us always see their images in private situations. From my point of view, the intervention of media in the individual lives of people is not suitable in several cases.",
        "First of all, it is worth considering that magazines often feature stories about celebrities\u2019 living which are neither informative nor useful for viewers. Moreover, some news which are deliberately written incorrectly for personal benefits put famous people in many troubles and they do not even know why. To give a clear example, in 2016, Hoai Lam was one of the hottest young singers in Vietnam and of course, his individual information is always sought-after by the press. Many of them are not only unimportant news but also make him feels uncomfortable and pressured. As a result, he gave up his career when he was at the peak and he had to do many unstable jobs for his family.\tConsequently, journalists should make sure that they write about the facts only, not rumours and fake news and especially personal information.",
        "Another point worth noting is that interventing too deeply in the lives of stars will cause some unnecessary misunderstandings. For instance, appearance on the media benefits the stars by giving free publicity to them and helping their careers, however, if the press features deeply about famous personalities, audiences may think that celebrities have paid for such news to attract more attention. These misconceptions cause great unhappiness to the people concerned.",
        "In conclusion, magazines and newspapers should focus on the necessary news about famous people and avoid giving kind of private information too much."
