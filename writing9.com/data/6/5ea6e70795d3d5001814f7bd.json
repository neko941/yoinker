Therefore, it is essential for parents to keep support children not only in material but also for giving some recommendations.",
        "Besides, various studies have shown that emotional support is the most desired form of help that every adult requires and only a few of them obtain an abundance of this support. In addition, when parents give some temperamental support, they also can teach some values, moral messages, and believes that can be a helpful lifetime. Moreover, they also can give appropriate aspects to make sure that the fellow can live peaceful and happy. For instance, my parents always invest their time to discuss something when we are ingesting. Hence, at the stage of confusion, parents, as a partner, also can grant some moral support for their descents.",
