        "It is considered by some people that all company decisions should be taken by one person, whereas others hold the view that workers should take a part in the process of making decision. While only one person\u2019s opinion and view can make conflicts in company, I strongly believe that employees\u2019 thoughts should be considered as well.",
        "On the one hand, making conclusions including employees\u2019 role takes a lot of time which can destroy the productivity of the company. Managers are the people who can do it by themselves as it is part of their responsibility. They can solve any problems as fast as possible. For example, there are many types of managers in one company such as PR manager, media manager and others. Thus, these people can make preferences including all prospects of entire corporation. In addition, managers always include other people\u2019s ideas and thoughts.",
        "On the other hand, making an agreement by alone is found difficult for many. Employees\u2019 ideas and decisions can make it possible despite the hardships. For example, online surveying platforms are used to consider many people\u2019s opinions by making graphical analyses. In addition, it may help to company to develop other categories and characteristics by including workers\u2019 decisions. Because all people are different by themselves, and they may have more creative and effective ideas than their managers.",
        "All things considered, managers can make agreements without wasting time and efforts, although the time taken by including workers in decision \u2013 making operation, resultant and effective decisions are better than quick conclusions."
