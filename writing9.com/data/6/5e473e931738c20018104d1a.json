        "Some people believe that we should not help people in other countries as long as there are problems in our own society. I disagree with the above statement because I believe that we should try to help as many people as possible.",
        "On the one hand, I accept that it is important to help our neighbours and fellow citizens. In most communities there are people who are impoverished or disadvantaged in some way. It is possible to find homeless people even in the wealthiest of cities, and for those who are concerned about the problem, there are usually opportunities to volunteer time or give money to support these people. In the UK, people can help in a variety of ways, from donating clothing to serving free food in a soup kitchen. As the problems are on our doorstep, and there are obvious ways to help, I can understand why some people feel that we should prioritise local charity.",
        "At the same time, I believe that we have an obligation to help those who live beyond our national borders. In some countries the problems that people face is much more serious than those in our own communities, and it is often even easier to help. When children are dying from curable diseases in African countries, governments and individuals in richer countries can save lives simply by paying for vaccines that already exist. A small donation to an international charity might have a much greater impact than helping in our local area.",
        "In conclusion, it is true that we cannot help everyone, but in my opinion,national boundaries should not stop us from helping those who are in need."
