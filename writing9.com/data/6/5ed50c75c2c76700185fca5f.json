        "In my opinion it totally depends on the country and society situation. At some time period country needs to use its staff as much as possible. It includes situations like being in a war, civil crisis, critical economic state and etc. In this case, some people who are about to retire may be able to continue helping the government.",
        "But in usual situations, retiring in a definite age can have advantages for society. After age 60 people basically do not feel as strong as before and they may be involved with various health problems. So it would be helpful for them to be forced to retire, although they love their job and enjoy it. It's for their own good.",
        "I'd say there is a certain time for everything. A person needs to spend his golden years after thirty or forty years of working. Not to keep working even though he himself likes it.",
        "On the other  hand, this forced retirement will give the unemployed youth a chance. Those who are looking for a job and they need it to make a living. So if people aren't forced to retire at a particular age and intend to continue working, some young people may not find a job till age 30 or even more. And it can influence their marriage and country population. So forced retirement will give them the opportunity to have a proper job and also the country needs fresh staff who have the energy and motivation to serve their country.",
        "In conclusion, as I said it genuinely depends on the country situation, whether the forced retirement is good or no. If country is short on staff the people's retirement might be deferred and elderly and young people work next to each other. But in a groovy situation young people have the priority to have a career."
