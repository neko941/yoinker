        "It is true that social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter have become increasingly popular among people of different age groups.However,some people are concerned that they can exert negative influence on humanity as a whole.While i accept that they do have several disadvantages,i believe there are more benefits than drawbacks.",
        "On the one hand,it is understandable why people argue that social media sites have adverse effect on people.The primary reason is that individuals can easily become addicted to these applications and tend to spend too much time on them.A recent study in China found that people aged from 20 to 35 spend approximately 6.5 hours on social media applications each day on average.As a result,this would not only affect their study and work but also does damage to their health both physically and mentally.For example,teenagers may become overly dependent on online communication,which is poor substitute for interactions in real life and therefore alienate themselves from friends and families.",
        "On the other hand,i contend that the advantages of those social media sites deserve more praise.First and foremost,applications such as Facebook and Instagram now serve as the most convenient and effective tools for people to acquire information about current events.For instance,during this Covid-19 crisis,Weibo,which is the Chinese version of Facebook,has been voted the most useful channel by Chinese when it comes to obtaining both domestic and international news.Another benefit is that social media sites provide individuals access to a more colorful and diverse world.There are many influencers who specialize in different kinds of fields and they share high-quality content of various categories for free such as make-up tutorials,food recipe and useful tips on language learning.Consequently,we can learn a wide range of knowledge in an extremely convenient way.",
        "In conclusion,although social media platforms do have some downsides,it seems to me that their disadvantages are outweighed by their advantages."
