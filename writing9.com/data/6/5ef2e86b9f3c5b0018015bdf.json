        "Today, in many countries , there are not enough students who decide to study science subjects. This problem occurs due to some reasons, and it can bring several negative impacts for society.",
        "There are several evident reasons why fewer students are choosing science as their main major compared with economics or business subjects. Firstly, these subjects are usually more difficult and demanding, which requires students to put much attempt into their study. For example, those who are doing courses in Biology often had to conduct a huge number of experiments and complete numerous assignments and projects. This prevents these students from having a free time for themselves.  Secondly, it is not easy to have fine jobs in science fields because of there are fewer career opportunities available for science graduates. Furthermore, Athough occupations in science fields tend to have a tempting income, leaners are less likely to decide to major in these subjects beacause these jobs requires a high level and much effort of employees. Instead, students nowsaday tend to choose other majors such as hospitality management or economics, which allows them to find jobs more easily.",
        "A shortage of science learners can result some adverse effects. The first problem is that when fewer students studying in science majors, there would have a serious lack of employees working in these fields. This would cause the technological developments to be slow, which also prevents the improvements of human\u2019s life quality. For instance, it would be difficult for humans to produce and develop newer smartphones with better functions.  Additionally, If students no longer chose science as their major, there would have difficulties for science universities or colleges. It can be explained by that these schools no longer have student tuitions, which could leads universities in the science fields to face with closure.",
        "In conclusion, the shortage of learners in science majors is caused by some factors, and this problems might consequence some serious affects on society."
