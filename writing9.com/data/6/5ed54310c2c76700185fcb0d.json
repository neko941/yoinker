        "In early life, people have nothing in their mind and all the things they do are just learning. This is especially true for schoolchildren who spend almost time per day learning things. The impact  of adults is significant for their intelligence and also their social skills. Two main sources of this impact are the kids' teachers and parents, and in my opinion, teachers have more influence on schoolchildren than their parents do.",
        "In class, children are influenced by many other people. This is one of the most important impacts on their cognitive development. And teachers also play a very important role in orientating such development. Because they can directly influence the kids, interact with them the whole day and tell them how to think and what to do.. An immature mind of a child is so easy to be affected by the surrounding environment. It is just like a white paper being painted by colours, some just hear and follow all the things their teachers said.",
        "About parents, even though they are the most important pieces of a child's life, but their impact on them would not be as big as a teacher. Firstly, for schoolchildren, the amount of time they spend with their parents is a bit limited since they have to go to school and stay there the whole day from the early morning to the late night. Their remaining time at home, which is already constrained, is then used for many things from personal hygiene, homework, for entertaining. Hence, there is not much time left to talk to their parents Moreover, parental intervention is not always helpful. \rThe fact that two people regularly and sometimes, simultaneously tell them how to live would make them feel boring. Because of that, many  children have a tendency not to listen to their parents but rather strangers.",
        "In conclusion , even though parents have a big impact on schoolchildren's intelligence and their social development, the role of teachers in this case is more significant."
