        "In all nations of the earth, use of internet has made information readily available to humans through the use of electronic gadgets, mostly without charge. Though there are many benefits such as, a reduction in the cost of purchasing books and a growth in business, however, there are also some disadvantages.",
        "Firstly, one major benefit of the use of the internet is that it saves cost of purchasing too many books. In other words, because of easy access to most information online, people tend not to spend much to buy books in order to get the necessary knowledge . For example, a student in the university would spend less to subscribe for a data using his/her phone and use it to get virtually all he/she would have gotten  from various textbooks. Secondly, the use of web enhances business, not only for individuals but also for industries and government, because through WWW, most companies and organisations make their businesses known to the world, and this in turn aids immigration and growth in economy.",
        "On the other hand, there are several demerits of cyberspace including, criminal activities like fraud. It has been noted that many people use this avenue to dupe their fellow humans, and some people now depend solely on this to make a living. Take for instance, in many nations, there are these group of individuals known as \u201cYahoo boys\", whom virtually use their knowledge of the net to scam and dupe others. Furthermore, there are lots of misinformation on the net. This is because many people want to become recognized thereby creating apps that are not genuine in order to attract readers who are not well informed.",
        "In conclusion, though there are some benefits of cyberspace, frauds and misinformation are important drawbacks and should always be considered."
