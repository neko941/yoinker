        "As my current work is focusing on improvement in the company that has already been running for years, for my future master\u2019s lesson, I intend to focus studying on how to help Start-up companies or Small and Medium Enterprises that have just run their businesses either with their owned capital or with investment from foreign countries, allocate their capital effectively and efficiently. I am inspired by people around me who have just built their businesses, but have to close their business due to financial problems, especially in this pandemic. Therefore, I need to improve my knowledge in finance. At the same time, I would like to take part in realizing one of the sustainable development goals of the United Nations about decent work and economic growth that aimed to encourage the formalization and growth of Small and Medium Enterprises, including through access to financial services. I would like to start from my motherland, Indonesia.",
        "I choose Cornivus University of Budapest because it is recognized by the Institute of Chartered Financial Analysts (CFA) and the core modules offered include \u2018Investments\u2019 and \u2018Applied Business Valuation\u2019 that will strengthen my skills. In addition, I am already excited as it has a financial laboratory that is equipped with Bloomberg and Reuters terminals to support my study. On the other hand, Budapest University of Technology and Economics is also one of the universities that I would like to study in since it is accredited by CFA Institute and Global Association of Risk Professionals (GARP). Similar to Cornivus University, Budapest University offers \u2018Investments\u2019 and \u2018Valuation of Enterprises\u2019 compulsory modules to enhance my knowledge.",
        "One challenge that I may face while studying abroad is language, but I am eager to learn both English and Hungarian language to support my study in Hungary. Upon gaining master's degree, I plan to work in the government, particularly in the Ministry of Investment, to implement what I have learnt for economic growth in Indonesia. As one of the emerging market economics of the world, my home country has been received lots of investment. Hungary is one of the key partners for Indonesia as the investment reached US$ 1.5 billion in 2020.",
        "I really hope to be accepted in your master degree program. It will be such a privilege to experience finance education in Hungary. Please accept my deepest appreciation and gratitude for you further assessment and consideration."
