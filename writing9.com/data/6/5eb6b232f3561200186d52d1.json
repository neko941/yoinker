        "Nowadays, almost all the big cities are facing problems of traffic jam. Major metropolitan suffer from traffic congestion problems due to various reasons mentioned in the essay below and the solution for the same have been discussed.",
        "To start with, one main cause of traffic problem is due to people not using public transport. In today's world, every individual family has their own vehicle be it two or four wheeler and they use their own vehicle to commute as it is not time bond and can be used as per their convenience, this has caused major traffic issues in the city. One possible solution to resolve this issue is to use public transport as much as possible to avoid unnecessary jams, this will be ultimately helpful in reducing environmental pollution as well.",
        "",
        "A particular cause of concern for traffic congestion can be increased population in large cities. People from rural areas come to the cities for  a better standard of living leading to over population and which in turn leads to over crowded congested roads. Another reason is the development of infrastructure in the city and the narrow roads are also the main reason which causes traffic. For Example, new construction of metro train routes in Mumbai has caused the narrowing of roads eventually leading to traffic problems.To tackle with this issue government body should take an prompt action to develop the city in the non- working hours may be in the night time. thus,hence,because of",
        "",
        "In conclusion, the traffic jam problems in urban areas could be avoided by taking collective measures by each and every citizen of the country along with the government. People should try to use public transport as much as possible and simultaneously administrative bodies should develop the infrastructure in the wee hours when there is a lesser crowd on the roads to avoid inconvenience due to traffic."
