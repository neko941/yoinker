        "The ability to create things is considered as a part of the art and it helps the child to build his or her intellectual capabilities. Creativity has a wide range, it can be a craft work, painting, drawings so on and so forth. These things increase the imagination power and enhance their cognitive skills. Every child has some talent but need to sharpen their skills by practice so that can perform well. Along with it they can even pursue this as a career in future too. For example, recent researches proves that those children who do practice in art would perform better in all aspects of life.",
        "Moreover, this is a tool that can be used as anxiety, stress management additionally we can identify emotional disturbances through painting, drawing and different sort of imagination. Every person either children or adult is facing difficulties and hardships in their life that might raise mental health problems such as stress, anxiety, depression and other phobias. By using these skills, we can rule out the problem areas as well as help in controlling increasing issues.
