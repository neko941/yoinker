        "Unquestionably, every coin has two sides so are the people. Some folks prefer comfort and some go for a healthy lifestyle therefore, using cars or bikes in the city has become a topic of debate among  people. This essay will compare and contrast both the opinion along with my opinion which is in the favour of using bicycles rather than cars in the city more precisely for less distance. will also discuss a sensible conclusion.",
        "Initiating with the point, that travelling by car in the city is better , firstly it is time-saving for example if someone is going to drop their children to school will take less time.Secondly , if whether is inappropriate for example it rains heavily , then it would be the best decision to go by car.In fact, people don't have to worry about carrying their stuff like a stroller  or returning from grocery shopping .As a result , travelling by car make life easy and more comfortable.",
        "On other hand , Some who held another view say that  using cars for less distance makes us lazy . I personally believe that if we are going for less distance ,for example , park or library we should use bicycles instead of cars. Additionally, riding a bicycle keeps one healthy and fit .Moreover it does not produce  harmful smoke like cars which makes it environment friendly. On the other hand , people don't have to worry about parking or gas which makes bicycles more cost-effective.",
        "To conclude, I would like to say that, People should use bicycles instead of cars for less distance . however, it will depend upon the mindset of people and their personal choice."
