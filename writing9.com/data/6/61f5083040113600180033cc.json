        "There is no denying the fact that the main purpose of homework is arguable. The question is some people believe that school children have not given homework, in another ,side there is some people think the homework plays an important role in the education of children. In this essay , I am going o discuss both views and give my opinion .",
        "While it is a commonly held belief that  homework should not give to children by their teachers. the first reason is the students always under an enormous amount of study pressure from school and stile have to spend more time a home do homework for next day , that mean the student spend less quality time with their family , as well as outdoor activities . the second reason that most subjects these days focus on the theory which leads to the learners being less likely to get exposed to particle experience as what happened in past in Saudi Arabia which the those who study physics and chemistry have to deal with a lot of theory without doing many of experiment.",
        "There is also argued that homework should give to students because is important for children education. Those who believe that first because they think the homework support what the teacher gives during class, doing the assignment at home could significantly help the learner remember formula as math and chemistry,secondly the homework in high school is not only exercise , but there could also be group assignments or research , by doing this the student improve their skills and get some new skills as solving problems.",
        "In my opinion, I consider that the homework should be given to the learner to complete the education prosses but the teacher must do not forget the other needs for children life"
