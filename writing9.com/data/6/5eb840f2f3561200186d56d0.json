        "There has been a considerable increment in a motor car uses in the UK since it was first introduced in 1888. Negatively, this enormous car uses lead to elevate the pollution in the atmosphere resulting in global warming; hence global rules should be enforced to curb such future calamities; I agree with the application of laws.",
        "After the introduction of a piston engine, they were bearing more car companies who are making a different type of cars with distinct features and price range. This competition between automobile makers leads to reasonable rates of cars; hence more individuals can afford to buy. For instance, there was only a ford company that was made the first car, but in 2000 there are more than 15 automobile makers are available in the UK. Consequently, more and more personnel are taking benefit of such innovation to save time for their daily works.",

This could be created air pollution and raise the earth\u2019s temperature, which leads to the melting of glaciers resulting in an apocalypse. For a proactive approach, local government or international bodies should take measures to tackle atmospheric devastation. Alternate use of renewable energy sources like solar or wind energy can help to alleviate earth temperature. For example, the government should promote the sales of electric vehicles by providing subsidy, which can help for excellent penetration in the market and make them aware of the advantages of it.",
