        "Some people believe that a person's success in adult growth is a result of  upbringing they received. However i do not quite agree with this view, in my view person achievement is much more the result of hard task and perseverance.",
        "Upbringing is ultimate, just because it is used to grow up a child well, but it is not sure they will be successful in  future. Parents are a teacher and guides of a child, but some children grow up without their parents or against the principles they set for themselves. They spend their life without the involvement of parents and success in their life. Quite a few people learn how to spend life without parents. There are a lot of examples of wall street wealthy businessman, they were orphans and earned success from scratch.",
        "Hard work, skills and Perseverance lead you toward success. Most of the people got success in their life just because of their skills and work devotion. They learn from experience or situations. They have the ability  to learn from their own mistakes. Life choices also play a crucial role in shaping the success of individuals, for instance friends and company we kept playing an important role in success of one's life.",
        "To conclude, no matter a child is born with silver spoon in their mouth or having a wealthy parents, It is the result of  hard work and skills to make them successful in their life, however there is a lot of examples of success stories who got success without their parents. Ultimately upbringing is important, but this is not only factor to make a successful life of a person."
