        "Nowadays, the number of crimes have been increasing  at an alarming rate. There are some people who think that placing  the police force on the public space   could be the most feasible method to counteract the problem. However, I, personally, believe that installing more cameras on roads   and educating the youngsters about the consequences of unlawful acts may lower the incidences.  This essay shall support my view in coming paragraphs.",
        "Firstly, surveillance cameras can identify  convicts when they are in act. This would provide  sufficient evidence to punish the criminal  and safe guard the society. For example, it has been noticed that in many metro cities, the  violence rate has been reducing significantly after installing CCTV in the various parts of the cities. This initiative often deterrents  people from doing ill-legal activities. When the feeling of being observed, could prevent one from committing or engaging unlawful acts.",
        "Secondly, instead  of using force to control and maintain social security, the younger generation could be educated how to behave responsibily in society  rather participating any crime. Since they are in the phase of learning, they would easily  taught about the legal system  and various panishments of the country. This can begin from the early childhood education  by including  legal matters  in the school curriculum, for instance, civic lessons and legal studies. Slowly and gradually, the students, who will be citizens of tomorrow, will grow as an law abiding individual. This scenario far much beneficial than deploying police on road.",
        "In conclusion, people have a different opinion on deploying police in public areas can limit the number of crimes in the society; however, I , strongly consider close monitoring of people\u2019s  behaviour and eairly  legal education to the youngsters could bring a positive outcome."
