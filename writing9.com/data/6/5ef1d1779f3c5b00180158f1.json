        "Experts throughout both the developing and developed world have debated whether video surveillance in public places has decreased the crime rate or merely reduced the privacy enjoyed by the common citizen.In my opinion benefits of installing security cameras overweight the issues related to privacy.In this essay I will try to lay light on the benefits of surveillance over the absence of security camera.",
        "In a study conducted by the university of Toronto, installation of surveillance camera reduces the crimes by 80%, a significant number. This fact alone is strong enough to realize the importance of having security cameras. The latest use of state of the art cameras in contact tracing of COVID-19 patient proved the potential of technology to curb the pandemic.If we extrapolate the reduction of crime rate to a state and the whole country and its use in containing a disease one can see the long term benefits.",
        "The biggest hurdle in surveillance is the cost of the installation. Installation of cameras requires a huge amount of tax payers money which will create burden of the economy also invasion of privacy  is a hot topic nowadays as governments are introducing new laws to control the social media. It is easy to recognise that the decrease in crime rate is good for the economy and benefit will overshadow the cost, also privacy laws are very tight nowadays with time laws will be more clear and fair.",
        "In conclusion, It is quite evident that installation of security camera and increasing surveillance is better of a society.Cost of installation and privacy are few hurdles which can be handled by the collective effort of government and civil society."
