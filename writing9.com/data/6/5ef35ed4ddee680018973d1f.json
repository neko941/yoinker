        "Nowadays, musicians and famous actors earn a large amount of money, but in spite of that their lives are often characterized by negative feelings which lead them to conduct an unhappy existence.",
        "First of all, in my opinion, being a famous person is not as easy as we might think because film stars and music celebrities are often exposed to several critics by people who follow them.",
        "Additionally, VIPs have also to deal with the lack of privacy as they are always under control by the public. This aspect may be seriously stressful for some famous celebrities and  in my opinion, this can be seen in the high rate of divorces that is constantly being recorded amongst the most famous ones.",
        "Moreover, film stars and music celebrities have to deal with daily busy lives since they are always involved in public events and therefore they often have not enough time to care about themselves and about their loved ones.",
        "All of these features which characterize celebrities\u2019 daily lives can be hard to accept and not all the actors and musicians might have enough mental strength to face all these burdens.",
        "Therefore they often choose to take the easiest but most dangerous way to get relief. In other words, they often decide to assume heavy drugs and large amounts of alcohol in order to solve their problems. Michael Jackson and Amy Winehouse are some clear examples.",
        "To sum up, I believe that even if celebrities own a large amount of money and seem the luckiest people in the world to the public\u2019s eyes, they cannot buy happiness and additionally they often have to deal with serious conditions that can threaten their mental and physical health."
