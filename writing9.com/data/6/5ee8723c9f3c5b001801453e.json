        "Compared to life as it was 100 years ago, many people argue that it has greatly improved and people said that it is better to live in the current life rather than in the past. I agree with this idea to great extent, but i also believe that there are many aspects of the life were better in the past.",
        "Firstly, i want to say that people are much enjoyed in the present. There are a lot of improvement that brings benefit to them such as the advent of modern technology, the development facilities, and many more. For example, with the help of internet, the society is now able to connect with one another easily, regardless of the location or time differences, also the internet makes people work easily and faster. Moreover, facilities has improved in such a way too, espicially in health and education. With the improvement of health facilities, death ratio is remarkably low and because of the improvement of education, we can see many people has higher education level that brings a lot of profit.",
        "Although, regarding the past, people probably had a peaceful life. At the time, the proportion of crimes was significantly low. Now compared to the past, there are much bigger crimes because people can commit crimes through the social media such as cyber bullying, hacking, and others. On the other hand, the quality of water and air has decreased over the years because of pollution. Many species of birds and animals have disappeared from the planet due to human activity.",
        "To conclude, life has greatly improved as human race has made better progress in most aspects of the life over 100 years in the last 100 years. However, the same advancements have also adversely affected our life and planet in the form of pollution, contamination, and global warming. People need to ensure that new technologies benefit the planet as well, so that we will have an even better world after 100 years."
