        "These days, the overuse of national resources has become a major crisis around the world. This huge concern requires immediate solutions to control this over-consumption before it runs out of all resources. Because if this happens, all countries will face it and the lives of all people will change.",
        "First of all, it should be said that the reasons for exploiting these land resources are their consumption in countries. The economies of many countries are completely dependent on these resources. It can be said that more developed countries with stronger economies need these resources more ,  due to the dependence of the economy on these industries and the problem of lack of these resources is more serious in them. The signs of these sources are quite clear in people's lives. Use of oil, fuel, gas, electricity, etc.",
        "However, there are some effective measures which ease the problem of over-consuming earth\u2019s resources. First of all, using non-renewable Energies such as sun and wind instead of these sources is an important solution. For example in many countries, electricity is generated from wind. Reducing demand for resources can also be an easy way to control this crisis. For example, if the price of hybrid cars is affordable, people will turn to these cars and the demand for gasoline will decrease. In fact, finding alternative sources and products is one of the best solutions.",
        "As a result, it should be said that these resources have always been in high demand in all countries due to the needs of different economies and industries. Using alternative resources and products and instilling the right culture of saving among people can prevent many bad things in the world."
