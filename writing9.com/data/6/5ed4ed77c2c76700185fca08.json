        "Nowadays, a huge number of people make a decision to emigrate other countries, all of which have own defined believes and behaviors. It is generally claimed that foreigners should respect local customs. I totally agree with adopting a new culture for newcomers even if they do not agree with them. In this essay will discuss why following new region\u2019s culture is reasonable for emigrants.",
        "Today, most open countries in the world for immigrants are overwhelmingly composed of emigrant\u2019s different mindsets and languages which this issue becomes the main concern for newcomers due to communication challenges in the host country. Therefore, people who settle in host societies require to accustom their culture and find out how can communicate with other people through collaborative language. It is not a secret that if foreigners acclimatize native environment will be able to experience pleasant new friendships to share their joy and happiness. As an illustration, when international students who are English spoken in China need to go local shopping, they do not know how to convince the sellers to discount unless with their Chines friend. Then, communication would be powerful mean of living more convenient as local people.",
        "In addition to above mentioned benefit, it is a well known fact that understanding and respecting new country\u2019s rules avoid encountering with probable difficulties, namely smoking in public places, taking a taxi in particular station and so on. Seeing or experiencing strange behaviors which are not socially acceptable have likelihood that make local people angry and frustrated. For example, chewing gum is banned in Singapore, whereas it in normal act in other countries. So foreigners have to act within the law like native individuals.",
        "According to the facts outlined above when someone chooses to live in other societies should try to follow new traditions which in turn facilitates blending into the host society."
