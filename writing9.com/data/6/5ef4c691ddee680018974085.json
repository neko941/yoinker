        "Some people believe that we should support people in other countries while in our own society has a range of certain issues. I disagree with this opinion because I believe that we should focus on problems in our communities and societies.",
        "The possibilities to support everyone around the world are seemingly impossible because everybody has their own issues, in order to help everyone that you need to resolve their own problems respectively, perhaps ten issues, hundred issues or even a thousand different issues. Furthermore, the distinction between culture, language, distance, behavioral society, especially personal ability and so on, in which that might cause you the significant challenges even it seems slightly unrealistic. For example, an  American doctor, he is unlikely to be able to treat a person who got Covid-19 in Viet Nam by their own ability instead of another  Vietnamese person by sending them to the local specialized hospital.",
        "Apart from the practical concerns expressed above, I also believe that it would be far more realistic when we are likely to help people in our communities and particularly in our possibility. It is mostly because, we might understand clear-cut problems of those people who we are going to support, what they need to help, and how can we help them significantly and productively. In this way, we may not facing the barriers about  language, culture and that is also necessary to everyone in our country. With the same concrete example has mentioned above, I am surely that Vietnamese patients who will get much better by treatment process of Vietnamese doctors rather than an  American expert or any other foreigner doctor.",
        "In conclusion, we are willing to support everyone around the world, However it would be far more both necessary and practical  when we help people in our neighbours and citizens."
