        "In this modern era, we have a variety of means of transport  including a car, bus, bicycle and many more , especially to travel in cities. Anyhow some people think cars are the best and others think bicycles are the better mode of transportation in high-tech cities. Perhaps, both the vehicles have their own advantages. In this essay, I am going to explain them.",
        "Firstly, in the field of automobiles manufacturing many advanced technologies are being adopted which have made  4-wheelers more comfortable and easier to drive in towns. To exemplify, the auto gear technology made driving easy and also the new artificial intelligence-controlled cars have made 4 wheeler journey safer and cosy. Furthermore, these automobiles have another advantage of travelling with friends and family and also enjoying the music.",
        "On the other hand, bicycles are healthier ways of motion because individuals can burn calories by peddling the cycles which is most important among the cosmopolitan citizens who have a sedentary lifestyle. To illustrate, many people in the town areas are suffering from Diabetes or Hypertension which are commonly caused due to inactive lifestyles. Moreover, we can avoid air pollution caused by burning fuels and make the environment healthy as,thickly populated urban regions are more prone to this environmental hazard.",
        "To conclude, by taking everything into consideration, both the modes of movement have their own benefit and  individual opinions to like or dislike any of them. Urban dwellers opt for any of these, based on their economical stability and type of job."
