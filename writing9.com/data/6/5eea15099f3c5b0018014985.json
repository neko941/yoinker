        "In the future people might resort to neighbouring planets, thus it is crucially important to foster interplanetary exploration.People should explore new territories in order to extract the resources, however; the Earth should not be abandoned.",
        "It is thought, that people should preserve the contemporary biosphere on the planet Earth as it will be more effective to restructure the society than to settle on an entirely uninhabitable planet.The advocates of this idea state that it will more viable to ameliorate the effects of human life on Earth, than to terraform the neighbouring planet. Policymakers are considered to enforce laws to decrease the carbon emissions and to conserve the environment for it to be inhabitable.",
        "On the other hand,  it is more pragmatic for space explorations to be funded sufficiently due to the fact that it might contribute to contemporary society. In other words, by the time people start exploring planets with abundant mineral resources, the materials should be transferred back to Earth in order for the society to prosper. The colonisation of the planets  is underpinned by the past. If it were not for the great geographical discoveries, the fabric of society and general technological level would be disturbingly lower compared to modernity. Under no circumstance, the  pursuit to explore new planets should be impaired, instead they are to be facilitated as it will favor the development of social,material and technological aspects of people.",
        "To sum up, in the forthcoming centuries livelihood should resettle from earth onto other planets. I concur, with the fact that people should explore new planets in order to salvage resources from there. Not only, the contemporary issues on Earth should not be exacerbated in favor of settling on a new planet, but also they should be ameliorated since it will be less expensive than permanently establishing a civilization on new planets such as Mars."
