        "It is undoubtedly that with the rapid development of modern technology, people are given the opportunities to approach and exchange information. Despite those benefits, some people argue that the technology is danger to our societies. While I accept this point of view, I still believe that the advantages are outweigh the negative issues it brought us in today's digital age.",
        "On the one hand, there are some reasons why some people consider that the development of technology has a negative impact on our society. Firstly, modern technology helps fake news easily spread quickly, causing problems affecting society. With just one smart device connected to the network, anyone can distribute and receive information without a choice, whether it's right or wrong. For example, many UK 5G network stations have been burned by citizens, due to fake information circulating on social media that those stations were sources of corona virus infection. Secondly, frequently visiting unknown websites can put users at higher risk of network attacks. Frauds can access and steal personal information for malicious purposes.",
        "On the other hand, the development of technology has changed our lives for the better. Apparently, attributed to technology, we are able to keep ourselves update with the current affairs all around the world because it makes a great contribution to search for a wide range of information. Now, instead of having to search for information in books or read every newspaper, with just a few taps on electronic devices, we can find what we need. Moreover, technology has already transformed the way people work in a variety fields. It enables telecommuting and teleconferencing, whereby people can work from home and participate in online meetings. Especially during the corona virus outbreak, the fact that people stay home and use technology applications to study and work has helped reduce the spread of the virus in the community.",
        "In conclude, the harm that technology brings is inevitable by the duality of everything. However, we can absolutely control its drawbacks and use technology in the most beneficial way."
