        "Opinions differ regarding whether those  who are physically fit are the only  ones who succeed in sports .However, believe that a positive mental attitude is required for succeeding in sports.In this essay I will discuss both perspectives .I believe that both-physical fitness and mental attitude are needed  for success in sports.",
        "Physical fitness is important when an individual joins  the sports career. This applies with outdoor games like football, baseball or basketball.These types of sports require  strength and physical  fit.With this regard, having these qualifications   are big factors to win the games. For instance, football games have a lot of contact with their opponents .If a player is not physically strong the chance  of being injured will most likely happen. This is not good for the player and even the teams .Accidental injuries sometimes can be life threatening. Furthermore, in   a sports career there are coaches and trainers. Their function  is to help  players to build their strength and stamina in order to win every competition.Therefore, being physically fit is very important in order to succeed in  a sports career.",
        "Talking about good mental behavior , this qualification is equally important as physical fitness when playing any kind of games  in order to reach the pinnacles of success. In team sports ,players will be dealing with their co players and their leader . It can be stressful because pressures cannot be  avoided even in  the same team. If any conflicts  are  not resolved by group teams , their good relationship might be weakened . Apart from being weakened ,they might also lose their interest to achieve their goal which is to become  successful in  the sports profession.However, with the good mental behavior of sports players such as discipline they will succeed in their future. Their positive attitude will also open many opportunities .",
        "In conclusion, being physically fit and in good spirits  play a pivotal role in becoming a successful sports player."
