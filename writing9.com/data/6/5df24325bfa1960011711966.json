        "Food and drinks proven systematically by scientists that bring detrimental effects on humans' health have aroused people's discussion whether it should be banned selling in stores. This essay will elaborate the argument and share my viewpoint.",
        "Advocates for stopping selling the poisonous products may argue that the availability of these things would case fatal disease to human beings. However, a harmful product is identified mostly based on its ingredients. In fact, several factors are advisable to not be added in any stages of making and preserving foods and drinks, which play an integral part in determining product's consumable levels. Therefore, instead of prohibiting any type of foods or drinks, the government should be imposing laws on manufacturing procedures included preliminary stages in farming and planting. For instance, banning using growth factors in breeding poultry by which customers would have a healthier meal by buying this quality raw chicken or duck meat.",
        "On the other hand, there has been many information based-evidence that certain products only bring negative consequences if used frequently. Hence, it is more essential to raise public awareness in attaching foods and drinks' ingredients and usage recommendation. As a result, each individual will be able to have a freedom of choice in choosing daily meals with a wide range of options with comprehensive information on each product.",
        "In conclusion, I strongly believe that any type foods and drinks significantly considered hazardous to people\u2019s health by experts should not be permitted to sell  if any banned element was added as well as no detailed ingredient was given."
