        "There is a diverse range of reaction about the victory in games. While some people are of the viewpoint that this rely on physical skills, others opined that it can be determined by other essential factors such as talents and mental skills. This essay will discuss both sides and my notion would be stated.",

        "In conclusion, physical abilities like strength and speed plays an important role in the success of a sport. However, in my reaction, despite all of the physical attributes that some people have, Talents and mental skills are what most athletes needs for them to excel at the mental side of the game.  These athletes are \u2018mentally tough\u2019 and this is just as important, if not more so, than their physical abilities."
