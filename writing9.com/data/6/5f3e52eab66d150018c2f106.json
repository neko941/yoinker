        "Many people believe that a prosperous career is most attributed to higher education, while some others argue that students should start a job after school. I agree that there are some benefits to working as soon as school is finished, but I  would argue that it is better to attend university or college.",
        "On the one hand, entering the labor market straight after school can be beneficial for some reasons. Firstly, working can be an effective way of accumulating skills. After years of studying at school, what students need to know afterward is how they could adequately respond to things befalling them, and the key to that problem is social skills, such as communication, problem-solving, and adaptability skills, which could be acquired nowhere better than in a corporate setting. For example, when serving customers from different backgrounds at a restaurant, school students as a newcomer may have to learn the way of bringing these buyers a sense of satisfaction through observation and practical work rather than from a textbook. Secondly, people opt for landing a job straight after finishing school can make earnings that allow them to cover their basic needs, and this behavior can reduce the financial burden on their parents. In addition to that, by working from an early stage, these people can save up a considerable amount of money for their prospective objectives. Finally, school students tend to be confused about their career paths; starting to work early, therefore, may provide them with some gap time to experience and seriously consider their choice of profession.",
        "On the other hand, I believe that university or college education is always the right choice for all school students. The first benefit is that higher education will furnish students with the fundamentals, which could be applied to whatever industry they will choose after graduation. Due to the insufficiency in such proper knowledge, they will be unable to sift through the sea of information and become directionless at a certain point. Moreover, it would be impossible to pursue by oneself in specific professional regions whose example can be those who want to become doctors will not achieve that goal without relevant qualifications offered by a specialized university. Another benefit is that education at a university or college can ensure more graduates' job prospects. In such an increasingly cutthroat job market, an applicant needs to make himself or herself outstanding, among others; therefore, an excellent academic background from a prestigious university and a solid grasp of knowledge can be a competitive advantage.",
        "In conclusion, starting a job straight after school can have some benefits, but I believe that attending university or college is the shortest way to a successful career."
