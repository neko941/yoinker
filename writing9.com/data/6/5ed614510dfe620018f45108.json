        "Dear Rakesh,",
        "I hope you are doing well. I am sorry, since I moved to Canada I lost touch with you. But, recently I met your sister Anita at a party and got to know about your new job. She said, that you have joined one of the leading software companies in Toronto, as senior software developer. I am so happy for your success and excited to meet you.",
        "Since you have moved in two months back, I think you must be looking for some  decorative furnishings for your house. I know you have a big family and if just in case you are looking for a dining table, please feel free to contact me. Actually, I am getting married in next three months, so I need to shift my belongings to Ottawa.  Moreover, after marriage, I will be staying with my husband in Ottawa. Although, I will try to shift maximum items, but still it is very difficult for me to carry this delicate dining table.",
        "Last year, there was a huge exhibition of furniture. It was a basically organised by an Indian couple. During, that exhibition, I got fascinated by this elegant and exquisite piece of art. It's not like just any ordinary furniture, but a stunning piece of work. The workmanship done has been inspired by Mughal Dynasty, I am sure you will definitely like to buy this remarkable work.",
        "If you are comfortable, we can meet on 27th March, which is basically a Saturday. You can come along with your family and take a look, then further make your decision. As far as, I know that you have always been very influenced by ancient culture and lifestyle. Therefore, this could be the most quintessential artefact for your house.",
        "So, please do visit once and then we can plan accordingly how to move this to your place safely. Take care and write back soon.",
        "Best Regards,",
