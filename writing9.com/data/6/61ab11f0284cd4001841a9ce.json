        "source for external things they had is either their surroundings or newspaper. As a result, they were",
        "unable to change their typical parenting mentality following the skills.",
        "Another reason in this regard is the educational system. The practices which used to occur in the past",
        "times to gain primary knowledge or even higher education was quite different from today. To",
        "elaborate, The teachers previously were allowed to punish or beat a kid for their hazardous",
        "behaviour or exceptionable acts. This attitude of tutors vanishes in the present time because it is",
        "considered as a violent or unpleasant step for children. Resulting, kids of today are not fearful of",
        "their educators which provide them a higher level of freedom.",
        "On the contrary, this may not be so always, because the proportion of variability seems higher. As per",
        "one article published in 2019, out of 100% only 5% of parents had little high concern towards their",
        "children which make them stricter.",
        "To conclude, although there are certain studies that contradict the phenomena of children having",
        "more freedom today. My view on this is optimistic because of evolving civilization along with",
