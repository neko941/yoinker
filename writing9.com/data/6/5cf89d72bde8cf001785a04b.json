        "Insomnia is becoming a problem, especially for city dwellers. The number of people who experience lack of sleep is increasing in many countries all over the world. This essay will explain some reasons for that problem and possible impacts on people who are exposed to it themselves and to others.",
        "The primary question is why people sleep less? First, it is because most workers have to meet deadlines every single day. For instance, a manager who has just arrived in London after having a twelve hour flight from Jakarta has to prepare a presentation to meet his client in the next morning. If it happens almost every week, it will ruin his sleep schedule. Second, they have to deal with their family right after they get back home. For example, a working mom has to take care of her baby after office hours so she will not feel as if she is a bad mom. Thus, those obligations make people feel nervous and hard for them to directly go to bed even after they have finished their duties at the office.",
        "Then, what kind of negative impacts can insomnia have on people and those around them? There are several unpleasant things that can happen. First and foremost, in an individual scale, it can cause a serious health issue, namely severe insomnia. Having an irregular sleep schedule can ruin our biological clock and it can responsible for hormonal changes in the long run. Furthermore, lack of sleep can have a negative effect on both our personal and professional life as well. I am certain that there is nobody who likes to interact with a grumpy person all day long.",
        "To conclude, I believe people experience insomnia mainly because of work deadlines. Hence, it causes so many drawbacks on both personal and professional level."
