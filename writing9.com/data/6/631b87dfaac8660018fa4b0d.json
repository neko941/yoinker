        "Across all countries worldwide, the major problems that are raised are increasing traffic jam and pollution. Many people think that increasing the price of petrol will help in solving these problems. I somehow agree with the statement, but, there are others factors that can help reducing traffic and pollution which we will elaborate further in the essay.",
        "By augmenting the price of petrol could be definitely be one factor to reduce densed traffic and pollution. Consequently, People will be discouraged to take their own car and would favour public transport such as bus and trams. But, there are other options to reduce traffic jam and pollution as well ,for example, the government can give some facilities such as provide electric scooters at a reduced price so that people can use it to come on the tram station or to move in town without taking their cars. Also, another option to reduce pollution could be to  encourage people to buy electrical cars at a much cheaper price.",
        "Similarly, in China, the government has put free bicycles stations in many areas to encourage people to cycle which is a good exercise to keep fit and healthy. Furthermore, we have observed that during the pandemic of covid-19, people has been working from home which has massively reduced air pollution and traffic jam. Companies should encourage people to work from home twice to thrice a week. Moreover, other alternative could be to  provide more trams in different regions so that people can stop using their own transport. Perhaps if the authorities provide some extra bonuses such as when people provide their bus or train tickets, they can get a reduction of tax on their salary.",
        "In conclusion, increasing the price of petrol is not the only driver to reduce pollution and traffic. There are different measures that should be taken by authorities and they should provide more facilities and encouragement to people."
