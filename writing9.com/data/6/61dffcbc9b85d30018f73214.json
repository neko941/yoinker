        "I worked for Indofood CBP Sukses Makmur Tbk as an Internal Auditor after graduation. Many aspects in manufacturing business cycles have been audited, such as finance, compliance and process. This job has sharpened my analytical thinking, problem-solving, and data processing skills since I have to ensure if there is still room for improvement. One of my biggest contributions to the company was when I saw a significant rise in the overtime pay in the financial statement. Then, I observed and found that the amount calculated by payroll officers was bigger compared to the government regulation in Indonesia. As a result, the company\u2019s growth shown in the financial statement looked smaller than it should be. After that, I decided to give a comprehensive recommendation so that efficiency can be achieved, and profits in the financial statement reflect the actual situation.",
        "As my current work is focusing on improvement in the company that has already been running for years, for my future Master\u2019s Degree program, I intend to focus studying on how to help Start-up companies or Small and Medium Enterprises, that have just run their businesses either with their owned capital or with investment from foreign countries, allocate their capital effectively and efficiently. I am inspired by people around me who have just built their businesses but have to close their businesses due to financial problems, especially in this pandemic. Therefore, I found it important to improve my knowledge of finance. At the same time, I would like to take part in realizing one of the sustainable development goals of the United Nations about decent work and economic growth that aim to encourage the formalization and growth of Small and Medium Enterprises, including through access to financial services. I would like to start from my motherland, Indonesia, as one of the emerging market economies that has been received lots of investment. Hungary is one of the key partners for Indonesia as the investment reached US$ 1.5 billion in 2020.",
        "I choose Cornivus University of Budapest because it is recognized by the Institute of Chartered Financial Analysts (CFA), and the core modules offered include \u2018Investments\u2019 and \u2018Applied Business Valuation\u2019 that will strengthen my skills. In addition, I am already excited as it has a financial laboratory that is equipped with Bloomberg and Reuters terminals to support my study. On the other hand, Budapest University of Technology and Economics is also one of the universities that I would like to study in since it is accredited by CFA Institute and Global Association of Risk Professionals (GARP). Similar to Cornivus University, Budapest University offers \u2018Investments\u2019 and \u2018Valuation of Enterprises\u2019 compulsory modules to enhance my knowledge.",
        "One of the challenges that I may face while studying abroad is language, but I am eager to learn both English and Hungarian language to support my study in Hungary. Upon gaining a Master\u2019s Degree, I plan to work in the government, particularly in the Ministry of Investment, to implement what I have learnt for economic growth in Indonesia.",
        "Lastly, I highly wish to be accepted due to my strong interest in finance. It will be such a privilege to experience finance education in Hungary. Please, accept my deepest appreciation and gratitude for your further assessment and consideration."
