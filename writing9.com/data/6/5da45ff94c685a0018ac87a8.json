        "Some people believe friends with the same viewpoint on different types of topics are better than the ones that can argue with them.",
        "Friends having the same opinion and hobbies are good types of friendship because they can discuss many things that type of friendship will go a long way because they have something to argue with the same opinion. If your friend has the same particular problem as you do, he can help you to find the solution faster. Such a friend always supports you and takes your side. She will be there for you in any situation.",
        "On the other hand, having an equal views on same things this type friendship some time considers as boring because they agree on all issues and problems there is no point in discussion or arguments. If your friend disagrees for anything you can discuss both views and end up with compromise, but strong disagreement can often lead to a heated argument or even ruin your friendship.",
        "In my assessment, friends should not agree on everything. I think this kind of friendship is boring and it is not likely to last for long. However, friends with the same opinion as yours will definitely support your point of view in the discussion and that is amazing thing in the friendship.",
        "In conclusion, I would like to say it is good to have different views on the same topics or problems but you should be loyal with your opinion. Everyone should appreciate their friendship and shouldn\u2019t let stupid arguments ruin it."
