        "I am writing to inform you regarding improper bus service in my city from last two weeks. Being more precise, the buses are not arriving on time at any place for the whole day. Sometimes it used to arrive early than regular time.",
        "I work in lively and my home is in LaSalle Sudbury. I am using your bus service because, there are no other economically affordable way of travel to lively. I must be at my job by 9:30 am but, Whenever the bus is delay from my home, I used to miss 9: o\u2019clock bus from the transit and once I missed, need to wait for the two hours. Due this I am being late at my job every day which is affecting the office workflow.",
        "What I suggest is that install GPS tracking system on for each bus so that person can track the bus schedules and position. Other way is that schedule more buses with half hour interval instead of 2 hours. I hope you will consider my problem as yours and will do something to solve it.",
        "Waiting for your positive response to this public issue.",
        "Thank you,",
