        "There are many students who stay with their parents while studying in a university, while others go away to live alone as their educational institutes are located far away from their hometown. This essay will discuss the merits and demerits of both situations in the following paragraphs.",
        "The main benefit of living with family for college students is that they are Bnancially secure. This is because they do not have to worry about paying the house rent and other expenses. This helps them to focus on their studies. However, the major downside of staying with parents is the extra pressure of family members to perform in exams. This is due to the fact that the constant supervision of parents makes students nervous and this can affect the performance of students.",
        "When students live far away from home where their colleges are located, it helps them to learn how to manage their life. This is because they are required to work along with their studies to finance their education. Exposure to this kind of lifestyle teaches students an important lesson about managing life. On the other hand, there are chances of students joining the company of a notorious group. To make the matter worse, some students start taking drugs because drug addicts in these groups encourage others to take drugs and this habit can spoil their whole life.",
        "In conclusion, while living with a family students have financial security, but they have to face stress for good performance. Living away from home teaches students an important lesson on how to manage their life, however, they have to be cautious while making friends at a new place."
