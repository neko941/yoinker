        "No country has yet achieved full gender equality and women across the world continue to suffer from discrimination and unequal rights and opportunities.",
        "In this, the situation is generally worse in developing countries where harmful patriarchal traditions, including child marriage and female genital mutilation, remain the norm. Globally, one in four girls does not attend secondary school and one in five girls is married before her 18th birthday. Child marriage robs girls of a bright future and brings a high risk of death and injury related to pregnancy and childbirth. In most developing countries, a woman's ability to determine the number and spacing of her children is limited or non-existent.",
        "however, even in many high-income countries, women often get paid less than men for the same jobs, face gender-based discrimination and violence, and suffer from cruel attitudes and sexist policies that restrict their autonomy over their own bodies.",
        "Besides, empowering women is the most effective way to reduce fertility rates and achieve a sustainable population size that respects the limits of Earth's carrying capacity. The total of years a woman has been spent in education is usually inversely correlated with the figure of children she will bear in her lifetime.",
        "Project Drawdown, which compares the effectiveness of different measures to curb climate change, has shown that educating girls and securing women's voluntary right to high-quality family planning together could reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide by 103 Georgetown, making this the statistic one most powerful solution to climate change.",
        "Achieving gender equality will make the world a healthier, happier place and is crucial to making lasting environmental progress."
