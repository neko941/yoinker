        "Some people believe that oversea travellers should be charged higher than local residents for cultural heritages. I completely disagree with this idea .",
        "On the one hand, if the government increasingly raises ticket prices for tourists, the number of tourists would be decreased. In fact, Tourism significantly contributes to the economy of the host country, hence the authorities should consider when the figures of tourists decline, It is because it would be badly be affected on the country\u2019s economy. It would also demonstrate that the owner country lacks in fascinating from foreign visitors. For example, a well-known ancient village in Da Nang city, it is called Hoi An had been published a regulation about increasing price tickets for foreign visitors. Consequently, the local government has been received a wide range of criticizing from both local residents and travellers, because the figures of tourists booked to travel to Da Nang had been apparently went-down, which also directly affected the spreading of the traditional culture to the other countries.",
        "At the same time, I believe that It would be unfair for foreign visitors when they have to pay more money for cultural public facilities than inhabitants. In many countries, the governments are trying to generate a friendly multicultural environment where people might share, interact or advertise their culture to other countries such as an international cultural festival which is annually organized in a presenter agrarian. If the authorities increase the money of foreign visitors, it will lead to dissatisfaction and even discrimination. Therefore, This might cause the unexpected situations and negative effects on the owner country.",
        "In conclusion, visitors and local residents should pay the same price for heritage places, increasing ticket prices for tourists not only affects on tourism income but also decreases the attraction of travelling from overseas."
