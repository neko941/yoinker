        "It is thought by some people that devising an alternative tongue is a best way to improve global language. Despite there are several pros associated with a novel tongue, there are amply drawbacks. The essay will demonstrate firstly the cons of this statement, following by the merits of it.",
        "First of all, there is no need to invent an additional tongue for global communication. The main reason is that there are also varieties of international languages which are used for communication. However this, the main dominant language is English. It means that in the modern world, all of the international business meetings, formal conferences are regularly held in English, as well as, it is utilized as a typical language between humans. For example, most of the governments prefer to speak in English while connected with each other. Furthermore, due to being a necessary langue, it is a pretty effective way in the technology, the science, as well as, the work life. This is to say that the people can information about cutting edge appliances or novel studies, with the help of the English. Also, it is clear that in the materials on such subjects are in English because of being easy to access and to understand. For instance, according to the survey, almost all of people can understand perfectly and exactly English rather than other ones. For this reason, they do not need to invent a new language.",
        "On the other hand, although there some demerits despite this, it has merit. The greatest advantage is preventing the damage to other language which may disappear. This means that English caused other tongues to disappear because of being dominant. That is why, in such situation need to devise an alternative To English. Esperanto is a prime example of this which is used to prevent the damage and communicates with others.",
        "In conclusion, I completely believe that it is time consuming, because there is no need a new language in the contemporary world. Although there are some benefits such as protecting mother language, also it has amply demerits such as there are several international tongues."
