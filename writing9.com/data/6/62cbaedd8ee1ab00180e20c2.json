Others claim that only voluntary decision to do sport helps people to be fit, but compulsory physical education embarrasses and turns away students who don't like sport.Give your opinion and support it with relevant examples.",

        "Human health establishes on many factors which include regular exercise. Some people think that sport should be set in a part of the school\u2019s syllabus to prevent children from becoming overweight, while other people hold a view on doing sport should be a voluntary activity or it may change children\u2019s minds about doing sports. As far as I am concerned, I agree with suitable exercise courses need to be imported into school life.",
        "It is an appropriate moment to train children to have  regular exercise habits in their childhood. No matter what age   people are, a balanced diet and sports both are necessary for the human body. To impede diseases or illnesses in children\u2019s bodies, enough training can stronger the defence ability of children. Correctly sports courses in school allow students to obtain positive knowledge of exercise and build consistent sports habits, so that they not only can stay healthy, on the other ,hand they can have an interest in different kinds of sports.",
        "Although not all people have good performance or interest in doing sports, it still makes a chance for people to make connections with each other. On the sports field, much more discussion and action appear in student interactions during the game than in the classroom, so students are easier to make close relationships with classmates and friends. Exercise lessons should flexible so that students would not be tired of trying sports. Due to lots of people being passive in doing workouts, educational establishments can enhance people\u2019s willingness on it.",
        "In conclusion, people should take care of their own bodies carefully, regular workouts can bring lots of benefits to our life. I totally accept students not only learn academic knowledge from school but also suitable exercises."
