        "The authority should support discipline education with more money rather than other fields for developing the community. I agree with the point below.",
        "First of all, learning subjects teach offspring not only mental and psychological thinking, but also to be realistic in their life, while literature confuses heir's mood. And also, not only scion, but also adults lose their position in their life if they do not learn humanitarians. Besides, without education, the population do not have any abilities such as ordinary thinking, even some of them can understand incorrectly. For example, if someone does not have any ideas about art, she or he is aware of the world that is lower than the public who learned skill. Furthermore, the knowing techniques may lead to society's slow increase in all of the sides. So these subjects learning is essential for everybody.",
        "Secondly, information learning is related to  technologies. And also, this education helps modern adapting and increasing from scientific ways. Nowadays, children have more science knowledge than adults so youngsters think like old people. Moreover, science fields are also important and more separable than other subjects such as art. Because art is more useful than I mentioned subject above.",
        "However, even though important sides of the system, some people are not fond of these subjects for learning.",
        "The state should require money in learning education subjects rather than other subjects to support the country. I agree with this view because in my opinion, knowing these subjects can improve logical thinking and  increase the world view."
