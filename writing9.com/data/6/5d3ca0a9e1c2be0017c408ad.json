        "With availbity of various choices, purchasing a product has become more challenging for consumers. While some choose to buy indigenous manufacture goods, others are more tempted towards foreign imported. In my opinion, former brings many benefits since it is affordable and supports local businessman.",
        "One of the primary reasons, I believe, of buying local items is its affordability. Since expenditures ranging from custom duty and transportation to distribution are not incurs to produce it, customers saves a lot of money. For example, Dabar\u2019s 1 kg protein, an Indian pharmaceutical company, costs around 5 dollars, whereas healthkart, an American based, cost $10 for the same quantity and quality. Moreover, it also uplifts local businesses and prospers native dwellers. They could expend their vendors and this would to aids in developing an economically strong nation.",
        "On the other hand, the quality plays a key role that propels masses to buy imported goods. With the advancement in the technology, many renowned companies use modern machines which eventually enhance the quality. Such flawless production attracts the buyers globally. For instance, many youngsters prefer to wear Nike shoes, the USA famous brand, over Indian Bata shoes as they fascinated by its attractive look and great comfort. Moreover, some products are patent and only found in specific area which left no choice but import. Alaskan salmon omega-3 tablets are the great example which only access through a few online traders.",
        "In conclusion, although people may vary in their opinion, I believe buying native goods brings more benefits as it is cheaper and aids local business."

    "submitter": "Advanced technology has changed the way people communicate. Nowadays, many of them prefer texting over talking  phes since the former enable multiple ctacts at the same time, and furthermore it aids to remember essential talks. This trend brings both advantages and disadvantages. The primary reas why people use texting to communicate than talking is it saves time. Due to a hectic work schedule, they did not get adequate time to individually ctact their family and friends through calling. Text messages,  the other hand, allow to multiple cversati at the same time. Another reas is easy to remember imperative details in the written form . Phe talks can be arduous to recall especially for elderly groups when they have to multiple work to do. For example, a reminder text message about an important meeting helps an employee to be  time. The major disadvantage of this practice is social isolati. As people more indulge in the virtual media, face to face interacti decreases. This not hampers the emotial development of an individual but also shrinks their social circle. Moreover, it affects their linguistic skills. Since mobile phes have preinstalled dictiary and auto correcti softwares, they put less affords in remembering spellings this in turn distorts writing and speaking skills.  In cclusi, although communicati via texting has some minor advantages, I believe it brings more disadvantage such as social isolati and degradati of a language.",
