        "Nowadays some people put less value on saving the diversity of languages. These people claim that it is hard to deal with a broad spectrum of languages. This essay will argue why the preservation of languages is entirely necessary despite some potential troubles.",
        "Since language has been a connection tool from the beginning, some individuals find it hard to encounter a wide range of languages all over the world. This diversity makes it difficult to expand one\u2019s business globally. For example, the first step to attract new clients is to be able to communicate with them in a mutual language. Otherwise, you rarely succeed to have a constructive negotiation. These people also consider it troublesome to be unfamiliar with the destination language when they want to travel abroad. Because they are afraid of the lack of ability to understand the local language to be well guided and accomplish their adventure. These few instances have bolstered existing fears and troubles in people to encounter other languages.",
        "Despite the minor difficulties associated with the variety of languages, the idea of not caring about disappearing languages is preposterous. Indeed, languages are the cultural heritages that are globally worthwhile. We can figure out many facts about our ancestors\u2019 lives by focusing on languages. In this regard, each language can be considered as the cultural identity of a nation that deserved total preservation. Meanwhile, surviving all the languages all over the world helps different nations and cultures in different regions. It is what makes our travels more adventurous and makes the world beautiful.",
        "This essay argued why preventing languages from disappearing globally is entirely important and the idea of letting them die out is a flawed notion."
