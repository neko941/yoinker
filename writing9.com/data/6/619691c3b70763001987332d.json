        "The matter of whether or not different jobs should have the same length of vacation brings great concern to the public. In this article, I will discuss the reasons why I can\u2019t entirely agree with this view.",
        "On the one hand, some types of jobs cannot be given vacation like ordinary industry. Specifically, public service professions such as doctors, firefighters, and transportation employees require people to work 7/24. My aunt's experience serves as a typical example. She and her husband are both railway station staff. They have not celebrated the Spring Festival together in 6 years. She told me that the best situation is to have the opportunity to eat a takeaway together when the train meets. These basic service staffs provide us with convenience, just like a candle burning itself to give us light.",
        "On the other hand, some work is so hard that these employees must take more rest time. Movie cameraman can be taken as an example. It is normal for them to work 15 hours a day, so many people choose to take a week off after a week of work. In addition, In addition, if these workers do not have enough rest, accidents may happen, such as a car accident due to lack of rest of the car driver. In this sense, tiring work deserves longer rest periods.",
        "To sum up, I think the length of the vacation should be decided according to the specific situation of the work."
