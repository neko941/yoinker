        "Over the past decade, lessons were used to educate on class with numerous of alumis. However, at the present time with the improvement of technologi for teaching, a lots of people believe that they do not have to participate in amphitheater anymore. From my point of view, I partly disagree that people think learning through digital platforms is better than attending in class for some reasons below.",
        "To begin with, reciving knowledge from professor who teaching in classroom is still classic and effective method to study in university. When joining class student can collect plenty of experience from the lectures of the professor. For example, alumis can ask as many questions as they want to have a deep feeling about the lesson. As a result, learners can mastery the lesson and enrich their store house of knowledge.",
        "By contrast, Studying on digital platforms also have its benefits. Learners can be more active in learning, they can study anywhere and anytime they want. Moreover, there is a multitude of courses on the Internet, therefore learners can repeat the lesson to get to know more about it or they can contact online teachers or through educational platforms for more details with just one click. For instance, students no need to move from house to school anymore, at a new age they just need to open their technological devices to attend online classes through some applications used for learning. Hence, online studying is no longer cumbersome but also more convenient, some colleges even uses this technique to teach in cases when schools must be closed.",
        "In conclusion, learning on the Internet and participating in studying rooms in school are equally good and effective for students. Even so, I believe that online education will be useful and become the best choice for people whose house is far from school or unable to move out of their place of residence"
