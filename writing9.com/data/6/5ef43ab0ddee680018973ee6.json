        "These days, the debate that gun usage is suggested to be prohibited as it is the root cause of high crime rate and violence has been in question. Although this suggestion is plausible to some extent, gun ownership should be allowed for the sake of inhabitants.",
        "On the one hand, two rational reasons are cited why the use of guns ought to be imposed a ban. The first one is that once owning a gun becomes more accessible, terrorists and thieves may highly engage in illegal activities. For example, some metropolises in the USA, such as Detroit or Stockton have been reported to have hundreds of cases related to using guns to rob citizen\u2019s belongings or murder yearly, which is an existing thorny problem for authorities. Futhermore, if the allowance of carrying guns still persisted , there would be a great chance to increase the rate of juvenile delinquency. This means that the easier the youth possess a gun, the more possible teenagers solve conflicts by shooting and violence.",
        "On the other hand, under no circumstances should gun ownership be forbidden in the society. One reason is that in order to restrain dangerous crimes or tackle emergent situations, the police are encouraged to use guns. For instance, the police have a tendency to shoot murderous convict\u2019s calves so as to deprive their capability of fighting back. Additionally, there is likelihood that dwellers would be able to defend themselves against thieves. This means that a robber could think twice before breaking into a house whose owner possesses a gun, leading to the fact that people could protect their properties without the assistance of the police.",
        "In conclusion, although the suggested policy of banning guns to decrease criminal incidents and violence are identified by a host of reasons, people ought to be allowed to carry guns under any circumstances."
