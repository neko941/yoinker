        "It is righty said that powerful companies help to built the strong and develop countries . After the globalization various companies around the world have done wonders in the market and they are able to make huge profits. Some experts argue that these companies should take the responsibility for physical and social upliftment of the society . I am partially agree with the statement. It is correctly said that it should be responsibility of government for the glorification of the society but today Giant companies also taking part in it like Microsoft , Reliance , Apple , Google, JWS sports etc.",
        "Today multinational building NOG, welfare foundation , Sport academy , Schools , colleges , hospital more over they are organizing blood donation camps also. By doing these noble work, these giants are adverting their brands , helping the government to empower the society & also provide better life to the talented people of their country by sponsoring them For example Reliance which is one of the leading company in India . They built non profitable organization . , hospitals , schools , IPL team. By this they are showing their presence in the country and also publicizing their products like JIO , mobiles. This not only end here , by doings all these stuffs they are also showing their power in the country , due to which many foreign invertors and companies are investing in Reliance .",
        "But there is another face of the coin also. These companies will do good deeds when they will get good returns from  it  otherwise they will do nothing. It is correctly said by the elders that if anyone is doing something for someone, the same is expecting in return. Basically to make society better , upgrading the sports all these are the responsibility of the government of the country. Government also taking lot of steps to promote the sports , opening the blood donation camps , government hospitals etc because at last they are the tax taker. Even now state government also started promoting the sports like Orissa is now sponsoring Hockey for next 10 years.",
        "In the nutshell , I would like to emphasize on the mixed role of the state and corporates for the wellness and prosperity of the general public."
