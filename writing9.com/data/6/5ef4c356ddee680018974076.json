        "While the importance of handwriting is undeniable for many years, many people are against this view and argue that putting emphasize on this ability is not necessary anymore. From my perspective, although we are living in the era of digitalization, handwriting is one of those irreplaceable essential skills which cannot be ignored easily for numerous reason and some of the will be cover in this essay.",
        "First of all, it should be said that the process of writing by hand is not just a physical activity done through the fingers, Rather as a multidimensional task, it involves the coordination between the mind and the motor action, as well as focusing on a specific topic which is writening. Thus, one of the obvious advantage of taking note by hand in the matter of young pupils is that will contribute into a better overall performance. For illustration, it had proven by some researcher that children who have .. handwriting, can academically perform better as the result of concentration development and at the same time encouragement of the motor function of their brain. Therefore they are able to manuscript faster.",
        "Moreover, in spite of beneficial effects of writing by hand, poor manuscript can cause low self-esteem and lack of confidence, eve in their future life. In fact, many job position still required some degree of note-taking by hand and if people fail in this qualification, they will lose their chance of promotion, later. for instance, having a genuine idea in front of company staff, while the presented manuscript is in low quality, will interrupt the nature of that concept.",
        "In conclusion, writing by hand, as a multidimensional activity which include the coordination of eyes, brain, and fingers in the role of its principal contributor elements, can offer many advantages that typing through computer cannot. better academic performance, faster action in expressing words, and also greater job opportunities in the future are just some of its benefits which have mentioned above."
