        "It is argued that it is integral for government to law entirely advertisement because it is not helpful and even cause a great deal of damage. In my opinion, I completely disagree with this view",
        "There are several compelling reasons why I disagree with the idea that the society would merit from a law on almost kinds of commercials. The first rationale can be that advertisement create a huge array of chances job. Thanks the boom of technology and commercials, a large variety of employees have a well paid job, leading to promote significantly worker\u2019s living standard and employee\u2019s living quality. Take Viet Nam as a telling example, the advertising industry needs approximately 10000 workers every year. Thus, It plays a vital role in reducing substantially unemployed rates. Furthermore,  Advertorial spreads contributed significantly   an enormous amount of money to the national budget. Hence, central authorities would lose a tremendous amount of tax from advertising entrepreneurs if national leaders did not offer a business license for these companies",
        "I advocate the idea that commercials bring a rich diversity of perks without causing any harm. Firstly, promotions provide a great amount of knowledge and detailed information about new products. As a result, It helps to improve considerably knowledge new merchandise, leading to making intelligent decisions when customers prepare to buy a new goods. In addition, commercials could easily approach to customers by the proliferation of technology. Because it garners a great deal of publicity, contributing to popularising new merchandise or even popularising custom and traditional country with international friends.",
        "In conclusion, I totally disagree with the above view. Because, I believe that advertisement brings a plethora of positive sides and government should not impose a stringent ban on all types of commercials"
