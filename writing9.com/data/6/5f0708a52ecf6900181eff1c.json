        "Studying online is becoming increasingly popular almost the students. Nowadays, students prefer to e-education than face to face education. This essay will discuss every year students are more interesting to online education than formal education and what universities can do get them back to class.",
        "To start with, students choose to distance-learning rather than to visit class because, e- education gives some advantages. For instance, visiting to class has some requirements, like school uniform, and this requirement sometimes can be uncomfortable for pupils. Furthermore, the lecture has been caught up by students whenever they go to school, but an e-education gives option for reiteranting lesson. Hence, pupils when doing homework, they can check to their doubt on online systems.",
        "However, distance- learning has disadvantages. According to Aristotele , Humans are social animals. \u0131 agree with his opinion, people always need to communicate with others. Also, school is the best social area for meeting new people and sharing to memories, but an e-education may not supply this opportunity. The university should improve their campus opportunities for attracting to students.. For example, they should work out the spring festival or development of the their lab. And also, they provide to scholarship for whom wants to have education in abroad.",
        "To conclude, students prefer an e-learning  rather than the back to classes in this age. It has advantages and disadvantages. This education system depends on the Internet and technology. In additionally, the university  should do activities and  give chance for impressing to pupils study on campus."
