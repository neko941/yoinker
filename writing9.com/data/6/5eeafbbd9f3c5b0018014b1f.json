        "The high school curriculum must include charity service mandatorily is what many people think. I totally agree with the above ideology as this would be very helpful for the population who cannot afford basic facilities and it would also cultivate the habit of giving and helping others in children.",
        "Community service is as a boon for people who are poor. There are so many families in the world who live below the poverty line and can not afford basic necessities of life. The charity work done by the students would be very helpful for them. At times, though the child wants to help poor people, but does not know where to start. Hence by including it in school curriculum it would give all the students a chance to help others.",
        "These also develops an important quality of helping and giving others from what they have. It also teaches them to value what they have. When a child visits or sees the way needy people live he or she realizes that they have many more facilities then them and develops a feeling of contentment in  them. It also, inspires them to see life in a positive way. For example, by teaching poor students, or distributing gifts helps develop a habit of sharing with others from what we have.Today there are so many organizations and leaders who have taken initiative to help the needy people. Hence the values which they get in their early age helps them in their future.",
        "To conclude, the unpaid services must be a part of high school as it teaches students to help, share, and care for others and also makes it easy for the needy population to get some facilities."
