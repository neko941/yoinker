        "It is widely believed that people\u2019s age would be a problem for some countries in near future as the older population will outnumber the younger one. I personally think that this would have numerous negative impacts on the society and I will explain why in this essay.",
        "To begin with, a country\u2019s economy is hugely dependent to young people as they are ambitious and determined to achieve goals and make noticeable changes not only in their personal life, but also in the society which they live in so as to be well-known and counted on in their professional field. Examples can be seen in entrepreneurs\u2019 average age and how they have positively affected the job market and consequently brought enormous amount of money in their own country\u2019s economic cycle. Furthermore, technology and people\u2019s age have a close-knit relationship as it is them who develop almost every technical device and are extraordinarily good at solving any problem by technology. However, as a result of the increase in a population\u2019s age, the whole country might fall behind others in terms of technical improvements which is of great importance in this modern era. For instance, most of under-developed countries are those which have lost their young members due to the inability of providing them with the amenities they need. Finally, as people grow older, they require constant medical care which in turn leaves the government with no choice, but to allocate more budget to the healthcare system. A significant amount of money that can and must be spent on everyone\u2019s welfare is wasted on an issue which nobody can guarantee has a happy ending.",
        "While it may be correct that having older people in each community brings along wisdom and more carefully-made decisions. It still appears to be the case, however, that any country would significantly benefit from a younger population.",
        "To conclude, an old population will hinder the economy, slow down technology\u2019s development and waste a country\u2019s money on less important issues whereas, a younger one can be a great help in developing the society in every aspect possible. This is not to say that, a country can\u2019t benefit from the older population as well, but it appears to be the case very frequently."
