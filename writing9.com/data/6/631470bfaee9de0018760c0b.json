        "There is a saying that some people are born to be a leader while some people think leadership can be learned. This essay will discuss both views and shows my own opinion.",
        "Some people have the gift of leadership because of their genes and heredity. The gene decided people's traits. People have various personalities, and most are born  them with. We can see children who share similar backgrounds, for instance, they still have different characters. So as leaders, we can see some people are born to be a leadership. When they were young, they were very active in school and want to be monitors and leaders, while others are quiet and like to be alone. Furthermore, self-confidence drives them to become leaders, and self-confidence plays a key role to become a leadership. Because leaders need to have the confidence to eliminate all kinds of doubts. As a result, some people do have the talent to be a leadership.",
        "On the other hand, leadership is a skill that can be learned. The first way to master captainship in practising. Management needs to practise because experience is important to it. The more experienced people are, the stronger their captainship will be, and they will become good leaders.There are many people who have no talent for captainship, but they still become successful leaders through hard journeys. Also, we can learn the knowledge of administration and practise it. Nowadays, an increasing number of people choose to attend management courses. It can give them more guidance, and make them overcome the obstacles in management.",
        "To sum up, although, some people do have a talent for administration, we can still learn it the day after tomorrow."
