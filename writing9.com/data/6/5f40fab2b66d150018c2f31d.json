        "Education makes children leran something what is wrong and correct, and this is important to study in their childhood stage.  Some people think that it is necessary to give  a punishment to help them to learn the distinction.  I agree with this notion.  In this essay, I will discuss why punishment is important to makes child to learn and what kind of punishment is suitable to teach a child to develop thier good behaviour.",
        "How to educate our children is the most popular topic in the parents group, and some punishment is essence.  It is because when someone as a child, they do not know what is good or bad things, they just a piece of white paper in their mind.  So that is why the importance to teach the child in an early age.  And punishment is help them to define the matter and do not do it again.  For example, if a parent punish their children after they did the wrong things, this can make them know the thing what they did is not correct, and they will not do it again because of they will think of the end if they do something bad.",
        "However, there have many varied way to punish, so we need to take the right action.  In other words, if parents take the over action to punish, it may cause some negative effects.  For instance,  if parents hit their child for the punish way, this may cause the child is more likely to create to violent personality traits.  So we must take the correct punishment.  The best example is parent can talk to them, and tell them the result if they do the wrong things, if they do it again , and than the action will be upgrade.  This time parents can not allow they do the favourate thing, such as watching TV or play games until they understanding the reason.",
        "In conclusion, I strongly believe that punishment can help child to realize what things is correct or not by parents can talk with them and not allow they do the favourate things.  However, parents should not take the significant punishment because of the side effect."
