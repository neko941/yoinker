        "It is commonly believed that your priority in job should be focusing on your performance rather than spend your time in order to establish friendships with your colleagues. Personally, I assume that people can hardly perform in solitude, and it is crucial for us to maintain good relations with our co-workers.",
        "To commence with, there are several compelling reasons why we need relationship-centric organizations. In detail, warm relationships in company are top drivers of job satisfaction and employee engagement. Once there are positive social interactions between peers, productivity will be improved and prosocial behaviors like collaboration occur. Furthermore, employee interactions lead to better teamwork among co-workers and People who get closer to their colleagues perform better than their solitary peers.Therefore, companies benefit from productive workforce.",
        "Having said this, psychologists have illustrated that interpersonal relations at job have positive effects on employees as people spend most of their time at work and it is essential for their mental health to forge friendships in the office. Indeed, a significant factor to workplace stress is lack of social bonds between employees. Long term exposure to irritable behavior in the office cause several psychiatric disorders. As a result, people need to feel connected and supported by their peers. Moreover, individuals need to be on good terms with their colleagues because connecting with other people is considered as a basic human need.",
        "In conclusion, it seems to me that as human beings and with the need of communication, it is essential for us to create a friendly atmosphere at the workplace."
