I would like you to tell that not to worry about the issue and I want you to take proper care of your health as you are suffering from asthma. I want to let you know that for every problem there will be a solution which we can deal with if we think better.",
        "Even I have faced the same problem with my team leader. Although, I am the one who used to perform well at work, my boss used to question me for everything. Initially, I thought the problem will get solved, but as days passing it became problematic and I used to feel very bad which led me into so many problems, where I cannot perform well at my work. I have also got many health related issues and later one of my colleague who is a well-wisher suggested me with some solution which helped me to overcome the problem.",
        "Firstly, I want you to be in a good mood and then speak with your team leader that you need his time, may be like after office hours. Then offer him a coffee and then you let him know about the interest and passion that you are having towards work. Make him clearly understood the problem that you are having and tell him that you would like to have a good and smooth relationship with him and other colleagues. Furthermore, make him know that you want a friendly atmosphere at your workplace by which you can excel at your work.",
