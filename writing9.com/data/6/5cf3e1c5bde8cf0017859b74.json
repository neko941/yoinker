        "It is true that some commentators argue that providing citizens with a better educational system is more effective to treat criminals rather than imprisonment, which is the prevalent conducted punishment in most countries. Nevertheless, I disagree with this point of view as I believe these two approaches have their own distinctive advantages and should each play an integral role in tackling crime.",
        "On the one hand, prison is an ideal way of dealing with offenders. Firstly, those who commit crime should learn that unlawful actions provoke negative consequences. To illustrate, serving a prison sentence for several years probably acts as a deterrent. Criminals know they would confront the loss of freedom, social isolation or separation with their beloved ones. Secondly, it is undeniable that when offenders are in jail, they can not be a danger to society, which enables civils to walk on streets or relax at home more safely.",
        "On the other hand, I consider the education owns a complementary role to play. In schools, students should study some laws which affect their lives. Being armed with the understanding of the law, school pupils are likely to become law-abiding citizens and avoid situations which may involve them in being victims. For instance, youngsters should study such important laws as driving and road safety. Moreover, educational programs for prisoners should aim to provide prisoners with skills and qualifications to find jobs after they are released.",
        "In conclusion, I believe that custodial sentences are such an essential weapon in the fight against crime, yet I disagree that providing better education alone is a more effective solution to reduce the crime rate."
