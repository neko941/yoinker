        "Some are of the viewpoint that there is not enough a household misuse to be recycled, and the main responsibilities of authority is not only increasing recycling but also introduces the law on recycling. I think, to a large extent, this case makes people more recycle more of their house waste and I also believe that discipline about recycling is also important. My opinion is justified further.",
        "One of the concert reason for this situation is that the best way to deal with the environmental issue is creating a law. To elaborate this, if the law about recycling is passed, it would make people think before throwing the thing into dustbin. Moreover, heavy fines on that person, who try to break this law. Thus, people know about this heavy fine of not recycling things, they would make sure that all recyclable products are in the correct bins.",
        "Besides the law, the schooling is a long term way to increase the recycling. Environmental and waste issues are put into the study, so that the student can know more about this issue. In addition, authority should produce some TV shows or seminar to show the people how to recycle the waste.",
        "On the other hand, there are some people argue that the enforcement of law may cause people to resent them and react by sticking even more firmly with their ways of disposing of waste. However, most individuals seem to do nothing unless they are required to. Therefore, the government makes recycling household waste a common task in a country. So, all the people must do that.",
        "To sum up, bath, laws and education are necessary to encourage household to do recycling. While, laws are enforced, education can turn them into public willingness. Personally, I believe that there will be more and more ordinary can be recycled if the government constraints on both laws as well as teaching."
