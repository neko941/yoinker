        "Poverty is a thing that nobody is happy about. Many countries have people living below poverty line and they keep trying various approaches to deal with poverty and try to reduce overall poverty rate. This essay should discuss the factors accounting for world poverty and several ways to alleviate the situation.",
        "The first important factor behind poverty is illiteracy. Literate people can find jobs easily and they have a wide range of jobs available to work, whereas the areas in which people have low literacy rates, chances of getting a job or earning money are much lower and can lead a person to live in poverty due to illiteracy.  Secondly, birth rate can impact widely in world poverty, because if the birth rate is very high in a country, that will eventually provide a route to less per capita income than before and reduced numbers of jobs available as well.  These are the two main factors affecting the living standard and causing the world poverty.",
        "As the notion says that every country come up with discrete ideas to deal with poverty issues. The government plays a big role in this matter as they can bestow free education up to certain grade and subsidized fees for further education. Moreover, the authority can also try to spread awareness to use various contraceptive methods to reduce the childbirth percentage. Adding to that, not only ministry, but locals can also help the indigent by taking their study expenses to their head. For instance, in India, the government has come up with free education for the underprivileged until the age of 15. Additionally, my father has recently taken responsibility for the education of a child of penniless family. A country can also take some measures like delayed marriages, medical facilities, incentives, and legislative actions to reduce the birth rate. This way, the needy could be helped a lot.",
        "To be concise, I pen down, saying that everyone should try to be a helping hand for the penniless and the governments should also be considerate in helping poor people to make the world a better place."
