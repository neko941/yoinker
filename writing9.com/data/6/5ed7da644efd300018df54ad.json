        "Many forms of learning are currently used with students. While some individuals consider private learning is beneficial to the recipients, others believe that one-to-many learning is more constructive. This essay will describe why one-on-one lessons are very valuable for the students, but why also group lessons provide more advantages for the whole class.",
        "With the current lockdown situation, private learning became essential in every household. Almost all the students experienced the one-on-one learning with their parents or elder siblings. Many advantages raise from this way, first the student receives all the attention and explanation for himself, second he is comfortable in his own environment and will assimilate all the given information more easily. Eventually private learning will encourage students to focus and understand all given information in a smooth approach. But is it enough for the learner to practice the whole learning experience?",
        "Learning is not only about receiving and understanding new information, it also includes students\u2019 interaction and practice in a large community. Group lessons will give students the opportunity to share ideas together and benefit from each other\u2019s experience, moreover it improves social and communication skills for all attendees, hence increase each person\u2019s self-confidence and self-esteem which will improve the decision making process for them. In the future, these skills will benefit future workers in the real life experience, especially in an effective work environment.",
        "Finally, in order to give students a full learning practice, I think it\u2019s very important to attend one-on-one learning once in a while, but certainly group study benefits will outweigh private learning ones and will be more beneficiary for them in their future life and work decision making process."
