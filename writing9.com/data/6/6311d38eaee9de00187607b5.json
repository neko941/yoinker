        "Nowadays , technology become an online platform to do shopping without going there and also any kind of things we can purchase so it impacts  local shops and one day , it will close in the country I do not agree with the statement.",
        "The first and foremost reason is that a number of people believe that the best way to do shopping , we should go there , due to checking the quality of products there , for example , currently , most things are available at cheap prices but they have no used amazing materials  , consequently , it will get worse after some time.",
        "Moreover , sometimes we get other products , when we ordered online , owing to the temptation of bucks , such as during a COVID it increased rapidly , therefore it encourages the public to do fraud , as a result, we lost our hard-earned capital. Furthermore , we cannot purchase groceries online , due to if it turns out to be bad , we do not use it , for instance, whenever we go to the grocery store then we check the time after we purchase it so it will not get worse.",
        "On the other hand , a plethora person gives order on online application, therefore it encourages them to do more spread business rather than in the past , for instance , last year , thousands of people change their mindset and forward shop to  online. Secondly , due to the service , everyone attracts by them , which the public cannot get from local shopkeepers, such as home delivery is far more famous rather than others.",
        "In Conclusion , both are important for us , due to the reason , we cannot buy some products online , at that time , we must go there , where it is available."
