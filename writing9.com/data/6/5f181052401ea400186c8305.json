        "International corporations establish their branches all over the world to find raw resources and new markets to maximise the profit generated. Under globalisation, cross-continental trade and travel become more affordable and accessible to people all around the world, leading to the increase in long distance travelling. However, not only do the globalised lifestyle provide convenience and efficiency to communicate with foreign people, but also post adverse impacts on environment.",
        "Firstly, the increase in traffic volume of airplanes degrade the air quality of the environment. Tickets for flights to different destinations, especially long-distance flights, becomes more affordable to the general public. More people want to go for an overseas vacation with family members and friends, leading to a rocket-rise demand of air travelling. Meanwhile, the carbon dioxide emitted by the planes pollutes the natural environment by increasing the carbon footprints of passengers.  Besides, establishing foreign branches in other nations by the cross-national big companies increase the demand of goods transportation.  Consequently, the emission of greenhouse gases by passenger flights and cargo aircrafts further deteriorate the air quality and greenhouse effects.",
        "Moreover, with regards to the searching raw materials and developing new markets overseas, the production and distribution process may worsen the ecological environment. The ever-increasing demand of new products lead to mass production of international brands, some old-fashioned products are sent to landfills within a short period of time. The factories of multinational corporations which situate in developing countries release polluted waste water into the local water system, contaminating the rivers or seas. Also, they will illegally cut the trees in the forest on a large scale, destroying the living environment of natural inhabitants there. The international entrepreneurs will not face any punishments because the legal systems in underdeveloped countries such as Indonesia and India are not well-developed. The international corporations make use of the loopholes and grey areas in the law to do illegal production process that may eventually lead to deforestation and clean water scarcity.",
        "In conclusion, the damage brought to the natural environment is invertible and long-lasting. Big corporations should bear the social responsibility so that the resources can be sustained. The next generation can still have sufficient resources to produce what they need."
