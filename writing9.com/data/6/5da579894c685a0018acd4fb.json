        "Families accompany an individual who goes to a foreign country for a job has more merits over its demerits.",
        "The main obvious benefit is that the family relationship becomes weak by distance. It means that couples often end up in divorce as they cannot live separately for a long duration. Take an Indian newspaper, for example, a recent report from Times of India on Kerla states that women end up in divorce while they are working as a nurse in another country such as Dubai as the husband cannot stay alone in his native place for too long duration. As a result, when families are together abroad, there is no effect on family bondings.",
        "Another pro point is that children, especially those\u00a0who are young, can get the\u00a0love of both parents.\u00a0If we deprive them\u00a0from an affection\u00a0of one\u00a0parent, then it can cause some mental effect on their mind. For instance, a recent report from the Ministry\u00a0of Home Affairs on the mental health of young people shows that adolescent who stay away from one of parents has a psychological\u00a0effect on his mind on a certain\u00a0point of time in their life. Therefore, it is better to stay together and\u00a0parents\u00a0should consider their family first\u00a0rather\u00a0than earning more.",
        "To conclude, families staying together have\u00a0more pros than cons because the relation remain stronger among them and also daughters and sons get attention of both parents. Given that an individual who wants to go abroad for business or work should always consider taking family together."
