        "Many human beings believe that it is critical to keep your home and workplace neat, and everything should be systematized and placed in the right spots. I totally agree with this opinion, because neatness can influence your mood and the organized place of work might help in the processes of work.",
        "The main reason why tidiness is essential is that it can affect people's behavior and mood. Various events and accidents may change an individual condition, but you will feel appeasement and relaxation if you have a comfortable and tidy house. The friends and visitors your home will also have a favorable impression if they see how many efforts and diligence were put into tidying up the house. According to a recent survey, people with a positive attitude have more chances to be successful in their work and life. Furthermore, a tidy house is more simple to support in cleanness than a dirty one so that it can save more time, which could be spent with your necessity and family.",
        "Also, the order at your workplace can assist you to be more effective and productive. When things and instruments are placed in order employee will spend less time searching them. Moreover, if tools are on the floor, workers can stumble and get an injury or a wound. Further, many companies have a system of fines, and a worker can be punished if implementations are not in order.",
        "In conclusion, I believe that it is essential to keep most things organized and in the correct place because the organization makes it easy to find them."
