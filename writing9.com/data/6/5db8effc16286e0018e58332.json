        "The number of crimes committed by young people have been on the increasing trend lately. Furthermore, it has been said in some research articles that, it is in fact the people who are responsible for the upbringing of their children that neglect to teach the nececassary skills that their children must learn. Personally, I agree with this statement for the reasons mentioned below.",
        "Firstly, parents do not spend enough time at home with their children which leads to less emotional bonding with their child.  In other words, parents these days focus more on running behind money and leave their kids alone at home with no one to show love and care. One of my uncle's child for example, was left alone at home most of the times as both of his parents were working. To no one's surprise, the child used to play violent video games all day long and this took a huge turn in his life as a grown-up as he committed a serious crime recently, and is in jail as a result. That is why, the supervision, love and care is extremely important for a person from a very early stage in his/her life.",
        "Secondly, teachers fail to teach certain important human traits in school and purely focus on the syllabus materials. To be more specific, teachers these days are more inclined towards finishing up their subject materials than disciplining their students if they happen to  misbehave in class with their friends or with other teachers. My 7 year old son, for example, had been constantly bullying another student in his class in front of his class teacher for a long time, and this matter did not get to my ears until the affected student himself complained to me that he was bullied my own own son. If this is was brought up to my attention by the teacher early on, then this unfortunate situation could have been clearly avoided.",
        "In conclusion, I strongly believe that it is the duty of both the parents and the teachers to mold a child into a good samaritarian. Failing to spend time at home with their children on the parents side and focusing only on teaching subjects on the teachers side are two main reasons for a child to lack emotional and social learning."
