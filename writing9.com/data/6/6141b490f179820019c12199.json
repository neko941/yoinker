        "Traditional newspapers are still considered to be the main model for people to read news instead of modern platforms. In my point of view, I strongly oppose this idea because of several reasons.",
        "To begin with, reading the news online brings audiences more convenient experiences. It can be explained that readers are allowed to update the news regardless of time and places due to the enhancement of technology. For example, when the MetGala 2021-one of fashion\u2019s biggest and starriest event- rolled out its carpet in New York on 14th September, the fashion community in Vietnam was informed immediately after each celebrity showed off their looks through prestigious online magazines. Compared with the conventional newspaper, which usually takes at least a week for the designing, printing and publishing process, fashion-aholics have to wait for the local publication house for reserving out-of-date data.",
        "Moreover, the benefits of online sources surpass the old-style reading habits in environment conservation. The vast amount of papers consumed in printing news was made from wood. Cutting trees for making papers not only significantly affects the disappearance of plants but also the air pollution because of the toxic chemical from the production process. Hence, printed news is one of the contributors of wastage of natural resources.  Moreover, the prints on the newspaper might include poison, which can be harmed for users by finger touching.",
        "In conclusion, it is difficult to deny that newspaper holds an important role in extending information, I believe that online news are becoming comfortably and eco-friendly by the aforementioned reasons,"
