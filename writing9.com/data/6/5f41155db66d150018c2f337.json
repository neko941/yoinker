        "Food is of the essence of life. In recent times, the public has shown to dispose majority of foodstuff purchased from outlets and stores.  In my opinion, i believe that nutritional products are disposed due to an increase in salary as well as a cut in farm stock by the government. However, public awareness has been sort to be a possible solution.",
        "There are two significant factors responsible for the rise in wastage. The most important is the rising income of the population. Reasons being that, in developed countries, workers are paid more wages due to a stable economy and this has led to purchase of wants not needs which has caused waste. For instance, in the past, a family can earn $50 per month, but at present families are earning $2000. Therefore, such family can buy so many groceries which can result to meal wastage. Secondly, due to advancement in technology, this has led to an increase in foodstuff as well as a reduction in price rate. Commodities such as vegetables, fruits and so on are purchased.",
        "To tackle these issues, a form of the public awareness programme is advised. Because, people have to be enlightened of various ways to discarding meals and its demerits. The government should subsidise any advert that will promote awareness of the situation.",
        "This will spread the word to all and cut down food wastage. To illustrate further, a television show, Awkward spoke about waste, especially different meals and this",
        "Programme caused individuals to talk about this. Considering the above, increment",
        "Of knowledge aid to curb waste.",
        "In conclusion, the society discards meal remains as a result of financial capability and subsidised produce. However, with awareness campaigns done this will resolve the issue"
