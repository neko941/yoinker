        "Over the last fifty years, the wildlife population across the globe has reduced by half which has been evidenced by the recent studies. Wildlife is a vital element of the world for a balanced ecosystem. This essay will discuss the methods that can help in protecting the",
        "wildlife around the world.",
        "Firstly, countries should impose stricter rules and regulations against hunting and killing of wild animals. Wild animals are mainly killed for their fur, skin and tusks by poachers, which is sold in the black market for huge sums of money. Implementation of stringent laws against the killing of wild animals could help in reducing such incidents. For example, in my country, India, killing wild animals is considered to be a criminal case and one can be tried in the court, the verdict of which is extensive fines and imprisonment for more than a year. Additionally, governments should implement laws against deforestation, as destroying the natural habitat of animals have an adverse effect on the life span.",
        "Secondly, spreading awareness amongst ourselves is another method which could help in preventing the decline of wild animals. With the advancement in media and advertisements, governments must run campaigns educating people on the importance of wild animals for a balanced ecosystem.  For example, my community organizes periodic seminars on world environmental issues, in which the preservation of wildlife is discussed extensively. Social media such as Facebook and Twitter can be used as a tool to spread such information and messages to educate mass populations on the importance of preserving the wildlife.",
        "In conclusion, just as humans, wild animals form an integral part of the ecosystem and it is our responsibility to ensure these animals are left unhurt and to implement measures such as strict laws and spreading awareness to preserve their lives."
