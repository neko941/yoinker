        "Since the dawn of civilization, people have not yet decided whether money or a sense of fulfilment in the working environment is of greater essence. Thus, there is many a person insisting that the former is far more vital. Being in a dilemma about these two quite crucial aspects of life, I intend to discuss the issue and, finally, state my overall position.",
        "Firstly, I would like to shed light on how essential and beneficial the amount of earned money is. Perhaps, those considering salary the top priority , have some drastic reasons- medical, for example. Here it goes clear why one needs money and the outcome is unlikely to be negative. Another key motivation to think money is superior to contentment might be psychological issues. To be more precise, even in movies one can see children who had financial problems in their family, and as adults, they do anything they are asked simply in order to gain what they lacked in childhood- fund. Rising crime rates probably stem from likewise issues.",
        "On the other hand, by no means should job contentment be neglected now that it helps gain control over one's psychological state and work/life balance alike, and there are many appreciating it. Earning money, yet feeling unsatisfied, however, usually brings about the absence of harmony in a person's life as well as some mental diseases; and in such a situation, try as they might, one cannot get rid of stress or depression. Consider, for instance, a man, who loves his job and does it with pleasure and ease; then another one whose desire is nothing but cash, whereas he possesses no liking for his profession whatsoever. The former may work hard having no oppression, and receive incentives, such as money rewards or increments. The latter man, notwithstanding his hard work, gets tidal waves of tension, and probably earns as much money as a target-related and a satisfied man.",
        "In the long run, coming from all above-discussed, I am all-out ajar with an idea that money is more important. People counting so should contemplate and think of the consequences of both aspects, and this way, they can probably comprehend the sense of job satisfaction."
