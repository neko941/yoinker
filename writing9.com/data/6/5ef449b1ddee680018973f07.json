        "Resolving environmental issues  become  the matter of grave cocern among countries.It is often debated that wheather environmental concerns should be tackled by individual nations or joint global efforts are needed.I shall put a light on both ways and then try to reach on an opinion.",
        "Individuales who suggests that environmental issuses shoul be cured globally believed that collaborated actions of all world could be more effective and long lasting.To elucidate,if all rule and regulations for carbon emission and uses of non-renewable sources are imposed worldwidely than it would become a compulsion for every nation to follow these stringent laws;consequently, there will be surely decrease in the contamination of natural resources. Moreover, joint efforts by all authorities could make some international sachemes to deter environmental pollution such as decreasing air transport and water transport , to conserve air and water from contamination.",
        "On the other hand, a part of society argue that it should be onus of a nation to save its environment. They condems that only goverment cand educate and aware its citizens about the environmental issues and could solve these problems with in the country. For example, in developing nations such as India, alot of awareness is needed for conservation of natural resources like water and air. which could be achieved by the efforts of indiviuals and authorities, in such cases international firms could not help much. Thus, awareness and education related to environmental concerns can be provided by national efforts.",
        "In conclusion, after looking at both the aspects. I ,personally,  opine that environment is a global issue nowadays, it could be resolved only by the joint  efforts of national goverments and international socities. Hence, they should work hand in hand for the conservation of environment."
