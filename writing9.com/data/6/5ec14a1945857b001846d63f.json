        "Many divergent views exist on the importance of healthy diet. A great number of people, including myself are of the opinion that eating wholesome vegetarians is a balanced diet and has a distinct advantageous over meat-containing diets. In the following paragraphs, I will provide the rationale for my viewpoints as well as proffer justification for my own opinion.",
        "The primary reason upon which my belief is based that eating vegetables diet could be easy to digest. It goes without saying that vegetables such as broccoli, tomatoes, and potatoes are known to be nutritious foods and do not become cause for stomach problem. Unsurprisingly, a 2019 social experiment conducted by a group of researchers from the University of Toronto, Canada found that plant source of food like apple, leaves, carrots, and wheat are rich in fiber complex carbohydrates, magnesium, folic acid, vitamin C, and vitamin E. These foods prevent stomach ulcers, which is less common among vegetarians, and keep them healthy",
        "Not only does this eating habit lead to reduce the chances of stomach problems, but it also a source of high-protein. It stands to reasons that more and more veggie diets in the form of cottage cheese, and nuts give us all the essential proteins for our body. My university course mate, Ben, is a shining example of this, Ben, who was from a very poor family in a small village. He could not afford a lot of luxurious food such as meat, and fish, but even then he was much healthier than all of us. It was all because he develops himself as a vegetarian.",
        "To sum up, I hold to the opinion that eating vegetables has a range of benefits, and I would like to say that everyone should be a vegetarian instead of consuming meat to live a healthy, long life."
