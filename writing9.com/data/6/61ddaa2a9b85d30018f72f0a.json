From my point of view, I  totally agree with the given statement above and try to give my reasons on the given question.",
        "Most of our folks pointed to the  essential nature of this art in the history of humanity , which has been accompanying it as a powerful instrument to spread some tragedy or emotional being of warriors  in battle.Moreover , some talents  presented  and it in front of the  king and spread that event to all the ordinary population by only playing with a few sentences. As a ,result until  ,present we can be  aware of some details and share them with our next generation only by looking back on that tragic moments and listening again and again",
        "According to the scientists we do not have to forget the influence of creations like that to coordinate  as one nation and be respectful to other neighbours of state. Furthermore, it aids others to  be aware of the country and attracts a handful of tourists with a range of coloured backgrounds. For instance , when an athlete wins the world championship everyone  gives honour to the hero\u2019s  anthem by standing up , which uplifts the status of his own land.",
        "In conclusion, I would like to say that the role of music lies in the deep inside of its power to be able to spread history , to raise true  patriotic followers and to increase the role of the nation."
