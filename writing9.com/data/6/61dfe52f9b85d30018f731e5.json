I agree with this statement and this essay will analyze this issue using examples from our society to demonstrate points and support arguments.",

As well as it should not be forgotten that, children learn to socialize  through these activities, one of the best qualities to be improved in their lives. For instance, open-air games learn them how to respect each other, share, and care. Moreover, It is undeniable that these activities enhance their self-confidence, by allowing them to trust themselves. To exemplify, when a child wants to climb a tree first of all he or she might have enough courage to do that. In such cases they believe themselves and do it. Therefore, it is very clear that, open activities extremely help to develop children's skills.",

However, playing video games could affect them in both negative and positive ways. Therefore, adults should be responsible for their kids and should help them to improve their skills."
