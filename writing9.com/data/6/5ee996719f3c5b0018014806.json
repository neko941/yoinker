        "The development of technologies and the growth of world economy have allowed people to produce a remarkable amount of food. However, it is true that numerous people all over the world are still suffering from the hunger. This essay will briefly explain why this situation has happened and provide some suggestions to deal with this.",
        "One of the primary reasons for this is that significantly high rate of the unemployment and the underemployment in the low-income countries and particular rural areas. As this state has lasted for a long period, a considerable number of people all over the world cannot afford to purchase the adequate amount of food. To cope with this problem, authorities should implement well-designed protection rules, especially for employment environments.",
        "Another reason is an insufficient amount of the investment. Many developed countries and world organizations have supported financially to address the world hunger problem over the last few decades. However, their support has tended to focus on some developing countries and it is not enough to cover up extremely poor countries\u2019 or isolated rural areas\u2019 hunger issues. Therefore, developed countries\u2019 governments and world organizations should approach this serious problem more detail and invest more in extremely poor areas that have not received the adequate support.",
        "In conclusion, it is clear that a substantial number of people all over the world still suffered from the hunger problem. However, if authorities introduce well-organized regulations related to this issue and invest more money, the serious world hunger problem will be alleviated."
