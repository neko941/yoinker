        "Admission fees are often argued that it should be charged for entering museum and art galleries. There are both pros and cons when museums and art galleries charge admission fees, while museums and art galleries, which do not charge admission fees, are another one option for people.",
        "First of all, there are pros and cons of museums and art galleries that people have to pay admission fees for entering. For benefits that attraction will receive are such as museums and art galleries can use money from admission fees to repair buildings or clean location, they can buy or rent new pictures to show for more attraction people. While there are some drawbacks for charging admission fees to enter museums and art galleries. For example, there are a few people to visit or there are not new group to travel.",
        "In the other hand, museums and art galleries, which visitors need not to pay admission fees to travel, have both advantages and disadvantages also. There are pros such as there are new traveller to travel, or people vary as a result of the number of people trend to grow up. Not only there are many pros, but also cons, for instance, the museum and art gallery that do not charge admission fees may not have enough budget to repair buildings or items.",
        "Overall, it can be seen that there are both pros and cons of museum and art gallery that people have paid for entering. While museum and art gallery that people need not to pay for entering have both benefits and drawbacks. If we need visitors to visit the museums and art galleries, should find the solution that people pay less money while museums and art galleries still receive money from travellers."
