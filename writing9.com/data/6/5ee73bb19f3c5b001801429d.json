        "In the era of digitization or globalization, the world is easily accessible through internet at sitting anywhere of the globe where getting study materials are not worthy. It is thought published study materials will be wiped out as online materials are offered at free of cost. I completely agree that printed copies of books are no longer needed to further study.",
        "Firstly, online is incorporated a wide range of study resources that are easily accessible without payment (most of the cases). Among those resources, we can find out relevant materials and store them for future use on hard drive or google drive. On contrast, printed materials occupy huge space in our room as well as cut our pocket to buy them. Secondly, sometimes, we spend lots of time to find a specific book or specific topic in a particular book while searching option may give us easy solution of this problem. Google or Yahoo search engine, for instance, can find any topic within a nanosecond if anyone includes that information to the web world.",
        "Another point to consider is that mobility may move people to read digitized books or newspaper. To be more precise, when people get time to read, they just access the materials through smart cell phone or laptop computer in PDF (Portable Document Format) version or any other online version. For example, when people stuck on traffic jam, it kills our lots of valuable time but online books give us a way to utilize the time properly. Finally, in the past, people used to buy a single newspaper to read because it cut money. But right now, everyone accesses plenty of newspaper through online at free of cost.",
        "To sum up, printed study resources will be no longer use when online materials offer lots of benefits. I believe traditional resources will be replaced by online materials soon. Personally, I think digitized materials are more beneficial to use and read."
