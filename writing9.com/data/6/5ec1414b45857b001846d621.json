        "In order to benefit the state of the mind, some people suggest solving word riddles or reading books during free time. Another popular thought is that it is paramount to reserve this time for relaxation of the mind. This essay will discuss both viewpoints and explain why I believe that it is better to stay mentally active.",
        "Occupying the brain with different tasks helps to keep it sharp and focused even at old age. Leisure time activities do not strain one's thought process as there is no pressure in solving riddles or reading for relaxation. At the same time, this activity helps to prevent or postpone age-related brain diseases. One extensive research on Alzheimer's disease, for instance, compared patients who kept the high intensity of intellectual activity throughout their lives and those who did not. The former group showed the symptoms of the disease much later in life and they were less severe.",
        "It is also true that after hard intense periods of hard mental work a period of relaxation is beneficial. Similarly to muscles that become sore after exercising, the brain gets tired after hard mental activities. Periods of low mental output help to recharge it or the breakdown can occur. For example, many office workers in Japan take this to the extreme as in the pursuit of mind relaxation they resort to heavy drinking after work hours. This gives them so needed abstinence from thoughts about their jobs that they cannot achieve by milder methods anymore.",
        "In conclusion, letting the mind to relax during leisure time helps it to recharge, but puzzles and reading can keep it healthy in the long run. Therefore, in my opinion, it is better to use leisure time for resting the brain by exercising it."
