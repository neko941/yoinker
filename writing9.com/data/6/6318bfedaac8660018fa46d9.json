        "People come from different communities and traditions, also they have a different traditional looks and various choices to wear attires.In a society, it is always argued by some people, that it is easy to predict about a person's culture and character from his attire. I completely disagree with this statement. In my point of view, we can know only basic information about a person's culture, whereas we cannot judge his attitude deeply by his outfits.",
        "Firstly, in many places or countries, people prefer to wear their traditional appearances, from which we can know basic things, such as from which community is belonging, where he lives. For example, a lady wearing a burkha and covered full body, whom we can assume that she comes from a Muslim community, but we cannot know more than that about her.Moreover, nowadays, people wear western clothes, such as T-Shirts, Jeans and formal clothes in workplaces. hence, it is difficult to know about persons' origins from their outfits.",
        "Secondly, people create an image of a person from his or her outfits, which leads us in the wrong direction. To illustrate, Oxford university  surveyed  people and revealed that the assumption of a person's character made from his clothes is 98 percentage wrong. Furthermore, we can judge a class of person, if wear branded clothes, but it is not possible to predict that he is a good or bad person. For instance, at a railway station, a person wearing formal tidy clothes is looking smart, which  does not mean that he is a good or rich person ,though he can be theaf. Thus, it is impossible to know a person deeply from his outfits without having a conversation with him.",
        "To conclude, traditional clothes are identity of  culture, which describes the basic introduction of a person, but this cannot predict person's character. I opine that, society should stop imagine a person from his attires without having words with him."
