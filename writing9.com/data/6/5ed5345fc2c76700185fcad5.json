        "Whether to wait or not until the age of 30 for doing marriage of having a child is a controversial issue. Some belief, marrying at 30 and having the child after that has many negative consequences on peoples' lives. I, however, think it is a positive development as couples are mature enough to understand each other and being financially stable.",
        "",
        "Being mature enough is the predominant reason why I think doing marriage at the age of 30 is a positive trend. This is because, staying whole life with a partner cannot be judged by just spending 6 months or 1 year, and marriage is the biggest responsibility for both of them, which requires to bear each other tantrum and need to sacrifice many things to live happily. Hence, teenagers tend to have a mutual understanding between them. for example, a recent survey conducted by marriage bureau reported that having married under the age of 28, 60% of couples got divorced due to a lack of understanding between both partners. This has resulted in ruining their career, particularly girls, as they have to compromise many things if they want to get married again.",
        "",
        "Being financially stable and having good prospects is another imperative cause to consider that 30 age is perfect for marriage. To elucidate, living in the 21st century, it is difficult to have a good job and maintain monetary status. Moreover, providing education to the child from the prestigious school or university requires a large amount of funds. Hence, many people seem to give first priority to their career. For instance, the news by Times of India on April 2019 revealed that having well settled with the job, the majority of teenagers opted to take marriage responsibility when they reach at thirty and this has resulted in not only being able to provide a good education to their child from the renowned school but also living their life happily and smoothly.",
        "",
        "In conclusion, although some consider doing marriage and having children later is a negative trend, I believe it is a positive development as reaching at the age of thirty allow couples to be understandable mutually and to have a monetary status which is crucial to continue happy married life."
