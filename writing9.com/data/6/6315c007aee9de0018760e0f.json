        "Two points of view on computers\u2019 impact on people\u2019s lives are easily understandable. On the one side, due to technology, there have been enormous advances in communications and many other fields of human achievements. Computers help us make routine operations more accessible and quicker, help to save our time, providing an opportunity to make operations or work distantly. Conversely, without understanding how to deal with new instruments, there is a high probability of getting problems instead of advantages.",
        "Computers have significantly changed how most people in the developed world live. Questions of security, critical approach to recognising accurate and fake information, studying, safely finding professional and personal contacts, and others demand users constantly improve their skills. Incredibly important to keep technology and life balance pattern. It is widely used in most countries now. Be responsible not only for themselves but also for children and our parents in this context. We must ensure every generation has access to both nowadays opportunities and responsibilities.",
        "However, asserting that the responsible and wise approach is a disadvantage would be incorrect. It gives each person the additional fields to improve themself, to expand the horizons of one\u2019s possibilities. By practising this approach, every person can feel more protected and confident, have more control over their life and at the same time use all the advantages of modern technologies in general and computers in particular.",
        "There are no instruments in the world which are good or bad. Human responsibility is the turning point of the result of interaction with any of them."
