        "There are those who have the belief teachers at school should not give home assignments to students, while other think that homework is an essential way to improve young people education. In the following paragraphs both views of this topic will be discussed in detail before the conclusion is reached.",
        "On the one side of the argument, there are a variety of reasons why school should not give home study tasks to student. The main reason to consider is that if student have no homework to do, they will have more free time to do other activities. For example, playing sports, drawing, and playing computer game which can reduce seriousness from class at school. Moreover, a further aspect of this argument is that some activities especially playing sports can increase happiness, improve social skill and good relationship with their friends.",
        "On the other hand, some opponents may argue that homework is a crucial way to improve education skills. One of the obvious reasons is that doing homework after class which help student to review lessons. In addition, the high scores are taken by do a lot of assignments. For instance, if student need to good at math, they should to frequently practice solve math equations. Furthermore, homework is increased good relationship with their family because parents or siblings can teach young people to solve the difficult assignment.",
        "Having considered both sides of the argument, it seems to me that both views of the argument have their merits. However, on balance I personally believe that young people should allocate time to do homework and do other activities equally. Doing so can improve education skills and decrease stress in the present and in the future life."
