        "An increasing number of people participate in many high-risk sports although they know clearly about these sports' danger. In this essay, I'm going to examine some of the main reasons why people engage in such sports and suggest ways how to reduce these risks.",
        "One of the reason is that they get the thrill out of them. Sometimes people challenge their abilities and potentials and then feel a sense of satisfaction when they encounter with fears. For example, Bungee Jumping is one of the dangerous sport but they want to know how they feel when jumping from high level. In addition, if they overcome dangerous experience, they will gain more confident and courage in their daily life. Another reason of pursuing this type of sports is that there is a lot of fame and money involved in them. To elaborate further, they will get more public attention by doing stunts on motorcycle and jumping from high building. Besides, they are well-known among people and business man are invited to endorse their products. In this way, they will make money from playing risky sports.",
        "On the other hand, there are many steps to reduce of this threatening accident. Firstly, these sports should be play under a strict supervision. In fact, they should wear safety equipments and follow the safety rule and regulations. Secondly, an athlete or people who must train a sufficient training under a license trainer before taking part in these activities. These can help them to restrict dangerous results which can happen during their activities.",
        "To conclude, although many people are liked to participate in adventure sports, they should take a proper training and follow safety precautions so that they can limit dangerous accidents."
