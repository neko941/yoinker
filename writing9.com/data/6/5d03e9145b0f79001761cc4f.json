        "Nowadays, sports holds a fascination on an individual life because of the national honour they gain on participation in the World Cup or Olympics. For an individual, training is expensive, so they depend upon external funding assistance to achieve the desired result. Some people are of the opinion that the country should support financially to national players, while others advocate that private institutions should financially help the sports players. It is essential to admit that both views have their benefits. In this essay, I will discuss both possible reasons that support each aspect, and what advantages they bring to society.",
        "On the one hand, many think that the government should give private training to the players. In other words, the fund them so the athletes could be ready for world competitions. Since they are representing the country, the government must support financially and motivate them. For example, in developed countries, the government couch the player by the professional trainers, also arrange the essential equipment and sports area so the participants could practice.",
        "On the other hand, those in favour that NGOs funding is that it would reduce the burden on the government. Moreover, the businesses are profit driven so they would provide the best coaching and facilities to their team. The reason they would support the team is that they want to make use of their market influence to promote their products or service. So, they also get something back by doing so.",
        "So in my opinion, the government could fund equally to all the sports and encourage the young adult to showcase their talent in the world competition, and the players own responsibility towards the nation. But by private sector funding, these players are more interested in earning money, and companies do not give equal opportunities to all the sports.",
        "To conclude, national teams and players are standing for the nation should be financially supported by the government."
