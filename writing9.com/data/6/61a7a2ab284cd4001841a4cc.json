        "These days, there are many successful people around us, such as famous actors, top athletes, and great scientists. Some people say that individuals who earn a lot of money are the most successful. Others argue that money isn\u2019t the main criterion for judging success. What they think is people who contribute to society, such as instructors or scientists, are the people who are living a successful life. In this essay, I will discuss both sides of the argument in detail and provide evidence as to why I think people who contribute to society are more successful.",
        "On the one hand, wealth allows an individual to enjoy their life to the fullest and can be seen as living a successful life. It is an irrefutable fact that loaded individuals can afford a higher quality of life. They can afford the possessions and lifestyle they desire and also have the free time to enjoy their leisure. For example, extremely wealthy people go on a space tour, while for others, it remains a dream of their lifetime. Unlike the past, the society\u2019s attitude towards money has changed, as they now realise that money is an indispensable part of their life and consider money directly proportional to the level of satisfaction a person enjoys. Therefore, this financial freedom can be viewed as a direct definition of success.",
        "However, others feel that the social value, which came from learning, can hardly be bought with money. In this society where we are living together, the services and contributions of many workers, including teachers and scientists are considered invaluable and can hardly be measured in terms of money. For example, teachers are doing research, transmitting knowledge and creating the base of the success of any person in the society. Similarly, scientists benefit our society by innovations like vaccine inventions. Therefore, the level of success they enjoy should be placed above the rich.",
        "After analysing both these views in detail, it is clear that one should recognise the efforts of people who can earn exorbitant amounts of money."
