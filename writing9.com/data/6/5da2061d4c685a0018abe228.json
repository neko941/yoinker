        "There is no clear definition of what a \u201cpoor country\u201d is. The common understanding is that a country is poor if the majority of its people do not have a certain minimum living standard. Wikipedia lists a number of more quantitative criteria, ranging from low average income, or a low Gross National Income per capita, to a low Human-Development-Index [44]. This is not to say that material wealth would be the most important or the only factor to optimize. Yet, it constitutes a rough approximation for the well-being of the people. Poverty is usually also not distributed equally in the country: Certain ethnic, religious, or social groups might be particularly advantaged or disadvantaged. As Hans Rosling points out in an informative and entertaining talk about country statistics [130], the population in poor countries is usually affected very unequally by poverty.",
        "The common assumption under any definition of \u201cpoor country\u201d is that Japan, North America, Australia, New Zealand, Western Europe, and Israel are considered \u201cnot poor\u201d. This essay will refer to these countries as \u201crich\u201d. It will refer to Western Europe, North America, Australia and New Zealand as \u201cthe West\u201d. African countries and South-Asian countries are usually considered \u201cpoor\u201d. This text, in particular, is inspired by my trips to Senegal, Morocco, South America, and India. Therefore, it mainly focuses on these regions as \u201cpoor\u201d. I do not know in how far my thoughts transfer to other countries. Also, not all countries are equally poor. Some developing countries have a higher GDP than developed countries. Furthermore, some countries are behind on some accounts, but way ahead on others. Cuba, e.g., has a lower child mortality rate than the US [130]. Therefore, this text will discuss potential reasons for poverty without claiming that they would apply equally to all poor countries.",
        "There is considerable dispute about the right term for \u201cpoor countries\u201d. The word \u201cpoor\u201d has a very negative connotation. Furthermore, \u201cpoor countries\u201d are not necessarily poor: They often have vast natural resources. On the other hand, terms such as \u201cdeveloping\u201d or \u201cindustrializing\u201d are very positive. They imply that the country would actually be moving out of poverty. Unfortunately, this is not always the case. I have therefore opted for the term \u201cless economically developed country\u201d, or \u201cLED"
