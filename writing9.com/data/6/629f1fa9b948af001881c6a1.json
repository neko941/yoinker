        "There is an ongoing perception that the power that motivates people to succeed in our world comes from the desire for wealth and status. I personally agree with this idea, because as I shall explain, we do live in a material world, and comfort and happiness usually come from financial security.",
        "Firstly the word status should be examined. For some people, status means popularity, for others comfort, and there are those who would argue that their status comes from a set of skills that help them do their job. Nevertheless, I would argue that status is always connected to money. If you want to work in a particular field you have to acquire a certain amount of knowledge (a degree). If you want to own a house or a car, you have to make the money for it. Money is an essential part of modern society, and even non-profit organizations need funding to do their good work.",
        "Secondly, wealth can be inherited, yet statistically speaking it is more often than a person works for their money. It is society's moving force, due to the fact that it can buy comfort, security, medical care, and experience. Probably even happiness to some extent, and it comes from hard work. Children are made aware of this when the concept of achieving goals is introduced to them. \u201cYou have to work hard for your dreams.\u201d And in this world, our world, dreams are material.",
        "Although I do not think that money, wealth and status should be put in the first place, I do realize that they are a tool for a better future, and could be a means of help for those in need. How would a doctor treat a patient if the hospital lacks the finance for the medicine needed?"
