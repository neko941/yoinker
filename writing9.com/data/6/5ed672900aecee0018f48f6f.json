        "These days, in the market of globalization, it is crucial to take developing nations together so that they can prosper and boost their economic strength. There are some individuals, who believe this can be achieved through financial support by international organizations. While, others contend that practical aid and counselling is essential for these countries. This essay will discuss both the arguments and provide my  opinion on it.",
        "On one hand, there are some developing nations that need financial aid from international bodies. This is because, these countries are already struggling from staggering economy and poor infrastructure. Some countries, for example, Nepal and Pakistan, where people are suffering from crisis, such as unemployement and bad health infrastructure. If these countries are not funded by bodies such as International Monetary fund, it would have devastating effect on their citizens and will deter the situation of the country. Therefore, it is paramount that countries, who are already suffering through aforementioned crisis need financial help from international organizations to improve their living standards.",
        "On the other hand, there are those developing countries, which are doing well in the areas mentioned before such as health and infrastructure. These countries require practical aid and advise from the observing international organizations. For instance, countries like India and China, although, they are considered as developing nations; they contribute not only domestic level but on international level as well- through the help of international bodies that provide them concessions on import and export from developed countries. As a result, these countries prosper well on the latter mentioned support from international organizations.",
        "In conclusion, although some countries, whose financial infrastructure is not strong enough and therefore, need monetary support from international organization. There are also other developing nations which require practical aid and advise in order to boost their economic standards further. In my opinion, both form of support is essential, depending on the circumstances of the developing country."
