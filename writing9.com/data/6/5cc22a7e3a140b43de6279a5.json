        "There is much debate regarding who should cater to a toddler while their mother and father are at work. A portion of people believe that direct family members should be responsible, whereas, others believe that nurseries offer the most adequate care. This essay will discuss both these views, followed by a reasoned conclusion.",
        "On the one hand, day care employees are often well trained to execute their jobs efficiently. In addition to this, since they are being paid, they are constantly attentive to childrens needs. However, they may be insufficient in terms of an emotional connection and support. This is because, the child is not accustomed to them, as well as, they are not very keen on forming deep bonds. Furthermore, child care centre's are open during certain times, often the same times as typical 9-5 jobs, therefore, they are very accessible and reliable. For example, my father found great help in dropping my brother and I at a nursery while he was busy, they took great care of us, but he had to cut his time short because they closed at 3 pm sharp, and his work ended at 4.",
        "On the other hand, the trust that exists between a kid and his grandparent is unmatched. This set up comes as a relief for the mother as she trusts that her kids are in safe, familair hands. Moreover, a grandmother, for instance, would be very well aware of the childs schedule and important things such as, allergies. These are imperative points that a supervisor at a daycare centre might miss out on. On the contrary, a neglible disadvantage is that, elderly people often forget about small details and always fall asleep. Hence, that might pose a direct threat on a youngsters well being. To illustrate, my grandfather always took care of my sister and would always nap during her bathroom time, in turn, my parents would return to find that she wet herself.",
        "In conclusion, although there is much debate surrounding this topic , I believe youngsters should be cater'd to by their bloodline. This is a safer and more trustworthy set up."
