        "The bar chart demonstrates the output of  research regarding using coffee and tea as well as drinking habits in five Australian urban areas.",
        "In general, as it can be seen from the chart, it is obvious that in almost all cities going to a caf\u00e9 for drinking a cup of tea or coffee is the most popular way of using such drinking and buying instant coffee and fresh coffee are followed by going to a caf\u00e9, respectively. In addition, there is only one exception which is related to Adelaide city in where they prefer buying instant coffee over the two other ways.",
        "In terms of the people whose choice was fresh coffee, as it is clear, the amount of the was the lowest among all five cities. By way of illustration, the lowest amount was related to Adelaide and Brisbane with just under 35%. Moreover, in terms of buying instant coffee by city residents, the range of this action was from nearly 45% to roughly 55%. At last, the proportion about going out for drinking coffee or tea was between around 50% and 64%.",
        "Additionally, the usage behaviours of coffee and tea were almost similar in two cities including Sydney and Melbourne. Furthermore, this behaviour was roughly alike between Brisbane and Adelaide; however, there was a noticeable difference which was related to the first priority of these two city\u2019s residents. Last but not least, there was no substantial similarity between Hobart proportion of using coffee or tea and any cities\u2019 usage behaviour."
