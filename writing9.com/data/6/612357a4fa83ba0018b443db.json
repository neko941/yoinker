        "How do we find happiness? It has always been a huge question for the humanity. Some people believe that it relies upon the responsibility of individuals, whereas others support that, it is affected by other factors. This essay intends to discuss both arguments and I will give my own point of view.",
        "Firstly, there are differents ways to find happiness. Some people think that it is a feeling you must choose in order to enjoy it. For instance, whether someone is focused only on the noteworthies moments of his life, then everythings which has happened , will appear as if it was for the best. Indeed, even if someone has experienced pain, some people support that it is just a tiny time to suffer, then something better will come. Then, everyone has is own description of this, but often, it is defined as the feeling of being full. But, beeing full is also subjective because you can see somebody with nothing materials but so many richess inside him such as experiences, meeting, adventures... For this reason, beeing happy is just habbits to have. Trying to see every little things which happens during your dayly routine such as the sunrise on the morning, the smile of a pedestrian and others.",
        "On the other hand, some communities believe that being happy is up to exterior factors such as money or high statue in society. As they believe that, their own description of this, is directly linked to the others. Obviously, having many money, makes events easier. For example, buying whatsoever is possible., but quick pleasure does not make people beaming because that is just material, while happiness is finding peace inside your heart, not on the outside with your appearence. Finding who you are is being able to be independant and detached from others views.",
        "To conclude, I believe that everyone needs to find itself before ask for more things such as objecst, love , important job or rewarness. Finding a good confort such as happiness is a tricky balance to find between how you are feeling in your own body, with your soul and with others relations. At the end, finding peace is the same thing, it comes whe you start to be a sighted person ."
