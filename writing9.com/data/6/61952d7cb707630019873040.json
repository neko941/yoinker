        "Dear Kiran,",
        "I hope this letter finds you in radiant health and the best of spirits. It has been so long since we were in touch but I have never forgotten all nostalgic moments. You have asked me about the CELTA course which I did last year. It is a certificate course of one month and I am suggesting you also  do it.",
        "CELTA stands for \u2018Certificate in Teaching English to speakers of other languages. The main eligibility to enrol in this program is the age and that must be at least 20 years. It is a one month course which makes the person eligible to teach the English language  anywhere in the world.",
        "The one month CELTA was the best thing that ever happened to me. The training was delivered by certified trainers, brought out the best professor in me. The entire program was filled with various elements such as learning, fun, enjoyment and activities. It not only helps me to enhance my teaching skills but also develops myself as a better person, better individual.",
        "After doing this diploma, I got many offers from different countries like, USA, Dubai and Turkey. I am currently working as an English Teacher in Cambridge school, Model Town, Jalandhar. My salary is very lucrative. I am totally satisfied with my white-collar job. Without CELTA, I would not have been able to make such a position for myself.",
        "I hope I have satisfied your curiosity about this course. in case you are interested and you want to get more information please go through the official website.",
