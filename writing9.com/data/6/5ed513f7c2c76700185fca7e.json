        "The outstanding literacy of a leaner is usually contributed by several factors. Some people assume that the educator has been playing a decisive role in the academy performance of a schoolchild, while others assert that it is made up on one's attitude. The idea of both sides with my own opinion together will be further discussed and elaborated in this essay.",
        "To begin with, the lecturers have capacity to provide both knowledge and supportive environment with specific instructions are based on individual. For instance, many schools offer extra aides such as after tutoring or consultation for undergratuates who are behind the learning schedcule that allows them to catch up or accomplish their assignment in time. As we know that every pupil is different with varied interest, the perceptiveness of the teacher that enables students to attain the high quality teching as well as dicovering their talent. Consequently, it is undoubted that the mentors have strong influence on the academic level of a mentee.",
        "On the contrary, those stand on the opposite of the view above may counter that without an intention to learn, the novice still can fail to understand no matter how effective and good of an instructor is. To illustrate, a clever and attentive trainee can familiarized with the subject or the skill by self-study without any guidance and supervision from tutors. Zig Ziglar was quoted as saying that '' it is your attitude, more than your aptitude, that will determine your altitude.'' Therefore, the incentive of tutees is equally important and essential for success in education; meanwhile, obtaining a better mentoring experience.",
        "In conclusion, the two sides of viewpoint arguing the key point on academic achievement of a student and both have strong suppoters. However, after analyising both sides of statement, it is crystal clear to me that the significance of having willingness to study outweighs the assistance from a schoolteacher. Moreover, it is also pivotal for scholars to realize that more efforts you have dedicated, that more opportunities will get in future."
