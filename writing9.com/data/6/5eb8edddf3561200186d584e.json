        "Today there is an argument between some people that it is better to give home education to children than going to institute. I consider giving school education is more important and in the following paragraphs I intend to delve into the advantages and disadvantages of both.",
        "Now a day as the technology increases and the mode of teaching also differs from the past, that is once we can see only black boards and chalk, but now we can see smart classrooms even from lower primary to graduation courses. This change will help the adolescent to improve his physical as well as mental growth. Group study always helps to achieve more in their life, because they study a lot from others students even a teacher or parent could not explain in the classroom or house.  In institution we can find different kinds of children who come from different family backgrounds and culture.  This will help the teenager to mould his character by mingling with others, for example, they fight with each other after some time they understood the value of relationship, and they share food, thereby understand the value of sharing like this in many areas they improve along with their friends.",
        "On the other hand, if a child is giving home education it will terribly affect his mental growth. Apart from being bright he/she become more selfish and they do not understand the value of friendship and relation. Home environment is good in some areas, for example, they get more concentration, as there is only one or two child the tutor or parent can give more attention and take care of them.  Also the invention of certain online applications like Google classroom, zoom, webinar also helps children to study at home because in this platform they can meet teachers and clear their doubts online.",
        "I personally believe getting school training is far better than home because in school we can find many people who come from various backgrounds and we can learn many things from their life which helps  us to be a man."
