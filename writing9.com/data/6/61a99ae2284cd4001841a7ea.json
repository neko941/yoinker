        "It is thought that the more developing a place is, the more difficult situations it will need to deal with. This essay will elaborate more on the hindrances that might result from the fast pace of the industrialization of metropolises and the possible solutions to them.",
        "First of all, the very consequence that can be aware of is the damage to the environment. For instance, the amount of smoke from factories given off to the air has caused severe harm to the ozone layers. This detrimental effects on the atmosphere have also triggered climate change to happen faster and more unpredictably. In addition, waste discharged from industrial zones has contaminated water sources, contributing to the shortage of fresh water all over the world. A variety of logging companies are in charge of the devastation of thousands of trees due to their overexploitation. As a sequence, erosion takes place. Therefore, the nature has been suffering from these actions for quite a long period. This leads to the second negative impact on humans\u2019 health. Breathing in the polluted air and drinking from the poisonous water source are worsening people\u2019s health day by day and causing them to be prone to dangerous and exotic illnesses. In big cities, more and more cases of food poisoning are reported.",
        "There a wide range of measurements for the bad reactions of the surrounding habitat. To tackle with the air pollution, manufacturers should consider environmental friendly input materials. For example, instead of using fossil fuel, renewable resources should be considered. Moreover, it is crucial to apply an appropriate treatment for sewage before it is released to any rivers. What is more important is the recovery of forests. Regulations on logging should be enacted to minimise the adverse influence on the ecology. Besides, if the plantation is well implemented, both the atmosphere and underground water will be purified. This, at the same time, helps improve health conditions of all beings. Hence, only by keeping the environment clean will the growth be sustainable.",
        "In conclusion, the development in every aspect is essential. However, proper approaches should be applied so that the unfavourable consequences are minimized."
