        "Now-a-days, technology has been increased so powerfully that we can do many things at a short time and also do not need numerous people. But, due to advanced technology, people actually lose their job. Computers, however, do not equal to human. They make also mistake in their job. So, even computer is responsible for depriving job of human, still there are some limitations on excessive use of computers.",
        "First of all, We know that some jobs do not exist because of the invention of computers. For example, bank cashier, who do check-in or checkout, or lost due to installed ATM booth. People can check their accounts, receive money, transfer money without helping of bank cashier. Moreover, using online bank account system, people do not need to go outside. They can enjoy all services even they stay at home. Another task is lost that is receptions and helper of library because all things are computerized. People can check all information about book in computer, it is not necessary more people keep all records in notebook by writing.",
        "Even computer is replaced by human, computer are not equal to human. They have also limitations when everything is computerized. For example, Due to ATM both, we feel that it makes our life easy. But it cannot work if your credit card is stolen. Computer cannot automatically renew your information. In this case, you have to need human's help. This similar problems occur in the library. Moreover, many older people do not know how to use computer. In this situation, computers fail to meet customer demand.",
        "In conclusion, computers are a blessing to our generations, but it is not a wise choice to depend on these technology too much that we forget the human's skill. We know that some job like sculpture are not replaced by computer. So, we have to appreciate about the human's hard work"
