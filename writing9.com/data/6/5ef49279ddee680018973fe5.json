        "In recent years, the question of whether the environment has an impact on human characteristics or not, raising many public controversies. Although many people will have different characteristics, the experiences that we gain in our life still influence them.",
        "The environment that we live in indeed has an essential part. First, the place we live in shapes who we are and how we behave. For example, the child with many siblings tends to be more outgoing while the only child tends to be selfish. Second, parenting - perhaps not surprisingly - played a role and affected how kids develop over time. For example, children with a good education tend to be good and successful people than ones who do not have enough conditions.",
        "Nevertheless, there are many pieces of evidence which prove that human personalities are distinct. First, the people who live together still maintain individual core values in integration. Saying that two children are living with a drunk father, one saw that and tried to study to be better; others become addicted to alcohol. Second, we are born with unalike personalities. Some are extrovert, likely to go out and talk with friends; others are introvert, likely to stay at home, read a book and listen to music.",
        "In conclusion, whether or not our built surroundings can affect core personality variables is still an open question. Regardless of the answer, we only live once, so be the best version of you."
