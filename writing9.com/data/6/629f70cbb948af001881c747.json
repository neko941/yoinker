        "Various buildings contain stories for curious people. On this account, a plethora of people have a tendency to be aware of the history of their living place. Fear of gosts and curiosity are the main reasons why people try to understand about the history of course there are some ways through which they can gather information about the past history of their houses.",
        "To begin with, fear of gosts is a conspicuous reason lead people to start searching a bout past events. This is because , some people have their own believes for instance, if they hear a strange voice late at night, they will be doubtful about the existance of gosts. While some people might live in a old houses alone, they feel more fear of even amall noises and as a result they go for searching about the past landlords of their home. In addition, being curious is a crucial factor why people start finding information about history. Needless to say that having information about the architecture history or the concept design of the builder, people prefer to gather data rather than having no information. For instance, an owner of a magnificent edifice in a garden will be asked about the time when it was erracted or the steps of design , so he would rather be informative thus, so-called person will become curious about the history.",
        "Obviously, there are a plethora of ways to gain information about a house but two of them stand out .Firstly, asking neighbours living near that buildings specially elder ones as older people have been living for years in a place, so they can be a perfect source of information to be asked. Another way is to search for building history in municipality. To clarify, as this place is responsible for buildings in cities, this source is a reliable one to search. For instance, an owner of an old house in Shiraz was from another city named Tabriz, so he was curious about the architect of his building, so by going to municipality he could understand about the architect.",
        "To conclude, being curious as well as  fear of gosts are two reasons evoke people to search about their buildings, also individuals can gain information by asking their neighbours or by going to municipality in which numerous information can be gathered related to their houses."
