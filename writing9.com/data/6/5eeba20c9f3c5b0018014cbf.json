        "It's suggested that self-study more effective than working with supervisors. Others state that teachers are the best mentor and their knowledge, techniques will enable us to learn material quickly. In the following essay I will discuss both sides of learning.",
        "Self-learning develops human intelligence in various fields to advance. Learning by doing is an approach, which has long lasting and undeniable benefits. People in favour of self-study think that when people learn by themselves, it becomes more unique and hence the brain catches it more effectively. However, When a person tries to learn new material, he doesn't feel tension and stress on the contrary, it helps to master quickly. For example, it has a negative side as most of people have an inflated sense of our own intelligence, which causes issues when they try to study alone. Thus, self-learning can provide knowledge, however its have their drawbacks.",
        "Studying with a professor helps us to stay focused and avoid distractions, which are two things that people today often struggle with. A supervisor can help the students by correcting their mistakes and also providing feedback. Teachers are knowingly afforded complex materials as it improves thinking and wit. For instance, One third of the students entered the institute due to lecturer training, as this gives more chances to engage and the student would have effective learning in minimal time span. In fact, Teachers are the best source for obtaining quality, knowledge and professionals in their sphere.",
        "To Conclude, I strongly believe that studying with an educator is better than studying by themselves.",
        "It gives us feedback by side of the instructor and solve problems in the process of studying."
