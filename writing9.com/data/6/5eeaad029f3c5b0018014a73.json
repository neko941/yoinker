        "Competition is not something about winning and losing, it's more about taking part in it. The generation is getting more competitive day by day, not only that, but in order to prove themselves better, they don't realize the good that lies within them. It's been often said that children are the best imitators, who eventually turns out the future of any nation. From my perspective, I believe that children should be taught how to adjust themselves rather than to compete in order to become a responsible youth of a country.",
        "In school, the children are often encouraged to participate in various competitions, not to prove themselves better than others, but to let them learn, how to cooperate themselves in different situations. But as said,children are blessed with the best grasping skills, such competition often leads to lose confidence and morals in themselves on losing and more empowered when winning. And sometimes balancing out in such mental and emotional scenario, is never too easy, even for their parents.",
        "To bring the best of a child, we should often teach them how to balance out themselves or to be flexible in any kind of situation. Planting such manners in a child at an early age, leads them to beautiful journey of how to behave with others and to get involved when working in a team. That being said, those adults treated in  such a way usually becomes successful youths into future.",
        "In a nutshell, though competition is a part of growth, it should never be treated as the goal. Instead, bringing the best out of them, and letting them learn how to cooperate, will always lead to a better future for themselves and the nation."
