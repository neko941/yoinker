        "This essay is about the consumer goods and how it becomes an essential part in professional and general life. In this essay we will argue about the both elements, to what extent we are agreed of disagreeing.",
        "In other worlds, life has completely changed since last two decades, such as we got many facilities in technologies like transportation, mobile phones, internet, tablets and many more products in our lives. Moreover, it reduces the distance between the families through the electronic devices, as in the old ages, we use to have a landline phone and letter facility to communicate with our loved ones. But now we have multiple media for communication likewise internet is the most popular medium for voice and video calling, despite from this, we could use different computer and mobile application for chit chat and text messaging with anyone around the globe. Hence, now a day\u2019s we don't depend on anyone in the middle to initiate our calling session for a specific limited time as it was in the past when there were no further technology mediums like internet and mobile calling. Particularly todays life is more luxuriant with many facilities.  Apart from the advantages it has also a negative impact on our lives, for example, in families while sitting together in group of peoples, they mostly don\u2019t talk to each other, we could observe them\u2019 mostly they are busy in their own mobile and other gadgets instead of talking to each other.",
        "In conclusion, I would say that, somehow i, am agreeing, the consumer goods have its own benefits and some side effects on everyone\u2019s life, it just depends on the usage. In uses it has a lot more options to get benefit from it, especially internet\u2019 its now a significant part of everyone's routine. However, reading as a regular daytime activity should be swapped for something which allows the child to develop other skills."
