        "Universities and schools are the place where most of our students spend their time, so, they have such an important role in their lives not just in their studies but in their inactive lifestyle. Thus it is really important to support them with more training exercises and let them know what consequences has an inactive lifestyle.",
        "To commence with, we must be more conscious about the need to foster a more sport-minded culture that encourages children to be physically active, in order to reduce the risk of diseases. Moreover, it has a huge impact on our emotional problems, our anxiety, depression or physical image issues will decrease.",
        "Obviously, training without good eating habits is not enough, we need to equilibrate it. As a result, it will keep us in shape and raise the quality of life.",
        "To continue, our lifestyles have changed a lot, probably due to the technological era. Some argue that has a negative impact and others that is a helpful tool as referring to sports. Most of our students spend their time using social media and playing video games which may lead to a lack of exercise. But, the Internet also is very useful while keeping us updated with the latest news about sport research, training programs or healthy food at our fingertips.",
        "Furthermore, parents and friends are shown to have the biggest impact on children's activity levels and reducing inactivity rather than overload our children with training activities might be more effective.",
        "To conclude, physical inactivity is associated with a range of outcomes from obesity to low self-esteem, and universities, schools, friends and family have a huge role in encouraging students to change that so, according to me, students need to be compelled to do sports alone and in groups, minimum three times per week."
