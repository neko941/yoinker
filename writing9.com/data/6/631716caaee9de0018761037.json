        "Television programs offer various contents that has been consumed by kids. There is opinions that the television program does not benefit the children viewers. I agree with this opinion and this essay will explain the why the kids could not get value from the television program",
        "Firstly, the television business relies on the rating shares. It means, the television companies create programs that satisfy majority of people. This is the major consideration for them regardless it suitable for children or not. For example, in my country, most adult people loved horror things and this topic was adapted into television programs. This kind of program is not delivering positive impact for younger kids. Furthermore, it can bring traumatic experiences and bad memories for children.",
        "In addition, television programs have an addiction effect. Some children might think that the program is enjoyable and entertaining. Once the children feel that, it is hard to stop watching as they is still learning about managing priorities in life. The children can lose their time for study and do other beneficial thing like exercise and socializing with other people. For instance, I have a niece that spend majority of her time watching television. It causes her have difficulties in cope with schools subject. She often get bad scores in the exam because she does not study in her free time.",
        "As conclusion, I agree that television program not giving positive impact for children due to the appropriate contents. Beside of that, the addiction effect cause children lost their time for other activities that benefit he or her life."
