        "The contemporary world seems to be benefiting those people who acquire only practical abilities as they are required much. High demand for those practical people is causing a view that job candidates do not have to have any diploma qualifications. However, while some say that theoretical knowledge is not as important as practical one, I argue that formal degree is much needed for two reasons.",
        "Some people argue that job applicants who have enough previous experience are the best candidates to get a job and they do not need a high qualification. Firstly, gaining a theoretical knowledge at universities is costly. For this reason, candidate workforces tend to prefer to spend that much money on learning a necessary skill at vocational schools rather than pay double for education first and for practice the next. Secondly, for those people, learning theoretical skills is time consuming since at authentic workplaces no one asks for the theories forcefully. As a result, school leavers decide not to fritter away their time, but instead they invest their time and energy in sharpening themselves practically.",
        "While I concede that self-development in workforce makes the person sharp, the future job requirements will unlikely demand no formal qualifications. To illustrate, future job market will be more demanding in terms of both theoretical as well as practical skills. In case the person with only practical skills lacks in decision making, other workers who have diploma degrees will substitute him/her with their better knowledge. Consequently, that person can lose his position in the workplace as he cannot stand a highly competitive workforce. Therefore, not to be overtaken by highly qualified personnel, they should overthink about their qualifications before entering the workforce.",
        "To conclude, although there are some people who predict that future workforce will not necessitate any university degree because practical knowledge is enough, I believe that in order to stand stable in their jobs they should also learn theoretical skills."
