        "Dear Sir or Madam,",
        "I am writing this letter to give my testimony for the short cooking course of making Punjabi curries, which I finished from your school last month.",
        "First and foremost, the thing which I liked the most was the duration and practicality of the course. Although, there were many dishes to prepare and learn for, curriculum was extensive enough to cover all. In addition to that, I enjoyed learning new ways to prepare same curries from other team members and learnt to give personalised touch of making dishes spicy.",
        "Ever since I finished the training of cooking, I moved to Europe for a new job. Here I need to cook my food everyday due to my dietary restrictions, but fortunately, because of what I learned from the course, I enjoyed cooking every single day. I tried to make different sweet and spicy curries every alternate day to take my tiffin to the office. I spend 45 minutes of time for cooking daily.",
        "As I enjoy eating Indian sweets, I would like your school to organize similar short program of training for preparing sweets. In particular, those sweets which are been made from chick piece flour, sugar and condensed milk. I cannot wait to see my self making sweets like Rasagulla and Gulab jamun.",
        "I recommend this course to all cooking enthusiast and look forward to learning new items in future.",
        "Yours faithfully,",
        "Mr. Manan Trivedi."
