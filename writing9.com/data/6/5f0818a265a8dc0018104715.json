        "In modern society, the number of people trying to find a balance between their work and life has been on significant increase, especially during the last few years. There are some underlying reasons for this and some feasible solutions would be analyzed to address the problem in this essay below.",
        "On the one hand, there are several reasons why people cant not balance between work and life. First of all, due to the increasingly busy life, people have to spend more time at work to cope with the needs and targets of the company. For example, many employees have to work more than 10 hours per day and then they can only spend a couple of hours with their family in the evening. As a result, the physical and emotional gaps between family members. Furthermore, when they come home, they must also take responsibility for taking care of their children and doing housework. For instance, they have to look after their offspring, washing clothes, or preparing meals. Thus, they do not have enough time for relaxing or playing some entertaining activities, which leads to gain their stress considerably.",
        "On the other hand, we can have some solution for this issue. Firstly, individuals must set up their own timetable, including their pastime also, and follow it. Not only do this strategy advocate employees working efficiently in order to fulfill their goal, but also enjoy more rest time. Secondly, parents should wake up early to take care of their families. After a hard-working day, they returned to their home and if they put down their phones, they will have more time to play and talk with their family members.",
        "In conclusion, I have presented several factors as well as tried to put forward some plausible measures to mitigate the problem in the above-mentioned arguments."
