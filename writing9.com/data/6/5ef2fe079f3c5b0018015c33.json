        "In recent years, it could be easily observed all around the world that traditional customs have been progressively vanished in the daily life of modern families. There are a variety of reasons behind this tendency, and in my firm conviction, there must be also actions which school and parent should take to keep the tradition alive for next generations.",
        "Chief among these reasons is the globalization. In this current flat world, with explosion of communication media and social networks, lifestyle is cloned from country to country. Consequently, each society\u2019s uniqueness and specialties are being lost more and more. For example, it is now extremely hard to see a youngster in downtown wearing traditional clothes, but full of people in jean or hip-hop style \u2013 which can be found in any city of the world. Another tangible reason is the lack of traditional custom\u2019s practice in family. Today\u2019s parents work harder than previous generations, both breadwinner and homemaker \u2013 who is traditionally the mother. They therefore cannot have enough time to, for example, make traditional dishes or organize traditional events to their children. There is no doubt that their children, as a result, will not be able to do it for their next generation. This fact, unfortunately makes traditional customs faded more increasingly.",
        "While the mentioned reasons are inevitable along with societal evolution, there are also easy and practical actions that older generations can take to keep the liveliness of traditional customs. Firstly in school, teachers should encourage students to show their proudness of cultural uniqueness and identity whenever possible. Some simple rules, for example, in Vietnam, which require girl students wearing \u201cao dai\u201d on every Monday, can create greater positive impacts on youth\u2019s thoughts of tradition. In addition, parents must pay more time with their children at home at special cultural moment. Participating in such events would make a profound and peaceful experience for children who are in consequence happy to inherit to next generations.",
        "In conclusion, even though it could be hard due to various reasons, but parent and school should always try to make all possible efforts in their ability to keep traditional customs flows through generations."
