        "In today\u2019s society, it is true that the Internet has a huge influence on communication of human. People could not deny the benefit of the Internet in keeping in touch with each other. I believe that it is a also has a negative impact to human on social life.",
        "There are a host of reasons to support the idea that such top-notch equipment allowed people to connect with each other easily. Firstly, the relationship between family members is more close-knit when they are living far from each other. To this case, just through skype application that enables parents to see and communicate with their children regardless of time and distance. Secondly, it could build-up the interaction between teachers and students. As case in point, during the coronavirus pandemic, it is impossible for students to go to school, the Internet allows youngsters to grasp the knowledge from teachers. Besides, it is also a chance for international companies to connect with each other to lucrative money. For example, they do not have to come to the destination of the companies, just through the Internet they could exchange the products all over the world.",
        "Nevertheless, I believe that such cutting-edge also has a negative effect to human-being. Some people spend almost a time on social media such as YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, then they forget others relationship as family friends and other acquaintances. This leads to isolate themselves with imagination. Besides, many adults are addicted by computer games, therefore they ignore the work, study and do not want to spend time to talk with anyone.",
        "In summary, the Internet is such an intelligent mean for people to keep in touch with each other. I agree that it has varieties bad impacts on relationships among people."
