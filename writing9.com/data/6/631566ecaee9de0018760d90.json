        "My name is Aman Malik, and I enrolled for your course on north-indian food. It was one of the best decisions of my life because such a wide variety of dishes were taught in the seven days program. Also, I really enjoyed the practical session where it was also shown that how the use of spices can make a big difference in the taste.",
        "Earlier, I used to order food from outside, but ever since I completed the course, I am cooking my dinner daily and feel really proud to eat delicious self-cooked food. Moreover, I received so much applause from my friends when I invited them over dinner, and the credit goes to your course.",
        "When I told my friends about your school, some of them also wanted to join the course. They are, however, looking for a program which teaches south-indian recipes. It would be great if your could curate and offer a course on similar lines as many of my friends would be surely joining it.",
