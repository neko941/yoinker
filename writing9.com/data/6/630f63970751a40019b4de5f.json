        "With the development of technology, films can be presented by more and more devices. Some people just argued that there is no need to go cinema, since we can have the same experience by watching it on tablets or on phones. In my opinion, though more and more people choose to watch movies on their phones, it still cannot replace the status of cinemas.",
        "Most people enjoy seeing films on phones because it\u2019s very convenient  since they can play a movie wherever they are and whatever they are doing, such as on the commute to work. What\u2019s more, the cost of films on portable devices is generally more affordable than that of cinema. These people believe that the choices on several online platforms are adequate to catch up with the latest films.",
        "However, other people argue that cinema is the best place to enjoy a film for several reasons: Firstly, the atmosphere built by a big screen and Dubi sound in a cinema makes the audience feel like they\u2019re in that film, and sometimes the feelings haunt for a long time after they leave the cinema. Secondly, Many premieres and new commings only can be watched in the cinema. Thirdly, Going to the cinema and enjoying a film with friends is a great way to network, as the connection can be largely strengthened by discussing the plots and sharing feelings.",
        "Overall, watching movies on phones or pads is convenient, but the cinema is also an important place for people to get a quality experience and cannot be replaced by the former."
