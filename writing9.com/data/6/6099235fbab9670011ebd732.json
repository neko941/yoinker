        "In this day and age, more and more contemporary attention has been placed on the opinion that the crime rate rising has led to a phenomenon that plenty of people are afraid of going out because of the declining safety of their communities. Many people think that only a handful of solutions should be adopted, while others, myself included, believe that in combating crimes, people should come up with more measures.",
        "Some people hold the first view for several reasons. Firstly, the media impacts on their psychology negatively and causes fear. To be more detailed, they are bombarded with many pessimistic stories and news related to crime daily such as robbery or even homicide. Therefore, despite some solutions are given, they know that no positive experience would happen. Another belief is that nothing can reduce the crime rate since crime originates from seemingly unsolvable problems of society. For example, the lack of money and employment which exit in every country cause more people to commit offence to survive.",
        "In contrast, many people and I think that more actions should be taken to avoid being victims of crime. The reason is that with more measures, people will feel safer when crime prevention is highly encouraged. In fact, although not all of solutions can perform well, the more actions taken, the more value they bring since detecting and capturing criminals can be thoroughly done. As a result, there is no opportunity to execute illegal acts. Besides, we also believe that there are still several measures which are absolutely effective in combating crime. Take self-defense as an example, educating and spreading it have long term effect to help increase populations\u2019 awareness of crime and protect themselves.",
        "In conclusion, there is a widely held view that only few activities can be done but I would argue that to prevent crime, more solutions need to be taken."
