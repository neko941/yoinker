Before society has a trend to follow the traditional customs in the upcoming generation now it is completely change. To illustrate this, currently people giving priority for the education. If men or women they have the right for literacy. Before some kind of caste or religion they not allow girls to study. Now the situation change everybody keen to go school to get well eduaction and knowledge. This makes the increase in age of people to get married. moreover, now people are willing to take their own decision about their marriage without the over rule of any chancellor.",
