Before society has a trend to follow the traditional customs in the upcoming generation now it is completely change. To illustrate this, currently people giving priority for the education.

Now the situation change everybody keen to go school to get well eduaction and knowledge. This makes the increase in age of people to get married. moreover, now people are willing to take their own decision about their marriage without the over rule of any chancellor.",
        "On the other hand, this changes may affects some results in society. primarily, the rights of both gender become equal. Right now, ladies also have a voice to stand up their decisions.
