        "The role of arts in its all reflected forms is undeniable in modern society as it expresses the emotions and struggles of the society it exists within, and inspires society to cope and even overcome. Art has not lost its importance even nowadays because it fills life with meaning and getting acquainted with it from a young age develops creativity and the ability of self-expression.",
        "Although people live in times when life flows at a tremendous speed, they seek  an opportunity to visit galleries, theatres or listen to concerts. Why they do so? The answer is quite simple: Art is a way of expressing and translating feelings, generate empathy, know and feel the new so it takes them out of everyday routine. It reduces the daily stress, makes people forget about their problems and acts as a source of stimulus to live. Citizens of St. Petersburg spend most of their leisure time in Hermitage after heavy working day which proves the idea I have mentioned above. They are so polite and with high moral values living in a city with a low level of crime and being close to art is one of the reasons explaining this situation.",
        "So children should have the opportunities to get closer to Art in their childhood and being a part of the school curriculum is critical as it helps learners to develop creative problem-solving skills. This encourages self-expression and creativity and can build confidence as well as a sense of individual identity. Studying through the arts can present difficult concepts visually, making them easier to understand. According to many authoritative kinds of research school graduates who were taught Art in school managed to gain success and find their place in life twice easily as the ones who were not. The formers have higher levels of civic engagement and social tolerance.",
        "We can conclude that Art is a reflection of how an individual sees the world makes him/her think deeply about any subject. That\u2019s why it is important in any century, art is what makes us think outside the box, brings us comfort and anguish, art will always have a place in the world because it is what motivates us to live."
