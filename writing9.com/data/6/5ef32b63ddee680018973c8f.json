        "Latterly, the popularity of travelling has been ever-increasing growth in many parts around the world. It is undeniable that a huge stream of revenues is generated from tourism industry. However, a school of thought holds that travelling abroad is indifference between local people and foreign visitors due, no small part, to cultural diversity. I personally disagree with this view.",
        "It is understandable why some people think that international creates isolation more than integration. Their argument is that local people expects foreigners to follow there customs and traditions, whereas tourists are often foreign to local social etiquette, and thus the likelihood of them doing some actions offensive local residents is very high. Nevertheless, I believe that this reasoning is not sound. As tour guides have becoming more and more common to provide tourists better understanding of local cultures, foreigners would be easily refrained from behaving irreverent.",
        "In addition to the advantages of tourist agencies offering to their clients, I believe the prevalence of travelling overseas would be of direct benefit not only to the host countries but also to the local people. With regard to the host countries, the influx of tourists could translate to an increase in state budget, as these foreign tourists would surely employ local services such as accommodation and transportation. This, more or less, contributes to the economic growth of the host countries. Moreover, since the job market has become competitive these days, international tourism plays a crucial role in creating job opportunities for local residents, especially those living in remote but well-known destinations. It could be said that a lower rate of unemployment can been seen in these areas if tourism is developed.",
        "In conclusion, although some people may believe that international tourism could potentially have drawbacks regarding people from different nations and cultures, I am still of the opinion that this is just an overly grim view ,and that international tourism would do more good than harm."
