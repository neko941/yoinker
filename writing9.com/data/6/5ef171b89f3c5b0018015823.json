        "Youth has an expectation of a living long-lasting life in a comparison to an older generation because of some concrete reasons that people cannot avoid. Let us dig deeper in order to understand the pros and cons of this situation and, which we will discuss in the following essay.",
        "To begin with, the young generation has a different set of demands: enjoy life at fullest without taking care of a financial and, work dedicated towards their target goals. They do not consider the death or illness, while working for their goals since their plans do not consider a thought of life. Moreover, in order to get the desired results they work day and night just to get what they have dreamt of. Hence, for dedication and concentration, they do exercise along with healthy eating just to stay fit.",
        "Apart from this, while working for their goals they forget what life is all about and, an essence of a family. They do not enjoy the moments of life then afterwards they have multiple of regrets. However, some people try to isolate themselves from life due to depression of an unsuccessful soul. I believe, which is not good for them and their family; they need to speak up about their problems to their loved ones.",
        "In conclusion, having considered the both sides of a coin, I believe if people are taking their failure in a positive ways, then surely the youth will live longer than the old generation. Since old people did not have the resources and constant amount of help, which nowadays people have and using it with effectively as well as efficiently in order achieve the goals."
