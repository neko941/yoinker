        "The upbringing of a child has always been a contentious issue and there are various ideologies and practises carried out by parents to teach their children about life skills. Nowadays, parents lend a certain amount of sum every month or week to children or teenagers so that they would manage their daily expenses. This, however has some merits and demerits of it, and in this essay, we shall discuss them further.",
        "Firstly, there are several benefits of such practice, for instance, it teaches them to be organised and practical, for instance, a child would learn how to handle their monthly or daily expenses within a limited budget. Moreover, children learn to be observant and patience, for things they purchase and which  is necessary. Additionally, he/she may also learn to value and acknowledge money. As a result, the child tends to be more disciplined and stern.",
        "On the contrary, there are two sides to a coin, and thus there are some drawbacks to such method, for example, some children may learn the opposite of what was meant to be. Furthermore, teenagers are more energetic and spontaneous about their decision, and thus would eventually buy something unnecessary or baseless. However, these setbacks can be resolved through parent involvement.",
        "To summarize, certainly the merits outweigh the demerits, and therefore, in my view, there is no harm in carrying out such methods, and it rather should be encouraged. Nevertheless, children are bound to make mistakes, but in-time those problems could be rectified."
