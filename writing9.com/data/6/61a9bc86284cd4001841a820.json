        "Machines are devices that perform like it was designed and complete assigned tasks. With the development of technologies, machines can do more and more work for humans. A natural deduction is that people will have more leisure time, but it is not as granted as it seems. Throughout history, it\u2019s less likely that people will have more spare time.",
        "At home, some machines are tools that help people with better work, and they refine the quality. For example, electric ovens free people from controlling the temperature. However, it is just because they are easier to work with that make they are used more often and occupied more time of people. Thus we can see that not all machines save people time.",
        "At work, the application of machines is not likely to shorten the labouring time. To be specific, enterprises hire people to run their business, and they are keen to make full use of the employees. It\u2019s more likely for them to fire some people to save the cost rather than give them free time. The use of machines will save time on tackling some problems, but we won\u2019t have more time off overall.",
        "On the other hand, we have to admit that most machines improve productivity, but we have to consider the growing demand when calculating idle hours. The requirement for more and better products always push the improvement of productivity, and machines are made for that. Thus productivity will always be occupied to optimize efficiency.",
        "In conclusion, it\u2019s less likely to have more time to do whatever we want despite machines being applied."
