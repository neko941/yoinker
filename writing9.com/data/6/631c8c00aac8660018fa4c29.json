        "Recently,the death rate of youths have increased markedly in our society. Accidents involving use of cars have contributed massively to casualties involving the adolescents and the governing body of the state has decided on placing a ban on use of motor bikes by people of this age group. I strongly agree with this notion and reasons to buttress my point will be discussed in paragraphs below.",
        "To begin with, younger ones are experiencing high rate of accidents along path ways while using okada. This is attributed to careless driving practices expressed while speeding through highways.For illustration, a study conducted in June 2020, showed that 70-80% of adolescents drive at a speed rate of 260km/hr.With this, there is elevated risk of running into the lanes of vehicle users thus resulting in vehicle-bike crash and consequent death. Furthermore, good number of the youths drive more at night with no illumination.Hence, their view gets obstructed which inturn leads them to bump into stationary objects such as trees and electric poles.",
        "On the other hand, the role of motor cycle as a means of transportation amongst individuals  below the age of 24 are numerous. First, they are small sized when compared to vehicles thus could be used to navigate through narrow routes since most of our roads are untarred. For example, the akoka city in Ibadan has mainly untarred pathways and delivery to this area is by use of bikes. In addition, the juveniles have the eagerness to deliver errands urgently and with use of helmets and speed of bikes,these issues are quickly attended to.",
        "In Conclusion, rate of crashes on the highways are high mostly with use of cars.The leaders believe that stopping the youths from using motorcycles will contribute significantly in reducing the this occurrence and I strongly agree to this. However, there are still some benefits of motorcycle usage amongst this age group."
