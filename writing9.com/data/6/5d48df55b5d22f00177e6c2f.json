        "In the modern world, people tend to have less kids than they used to, which will cause a skew towards higher ages in the population in coming years. While it may be a sign of positive developments, I believe the change itself is a negative phenomenon.",
        "From what I can understand, the fact that the population in some countries are getting older demonstrates two main changes. Firstly, reduce in the number of births, and secondly, the life expectancy increase. Although the first can be interpreted in various ways, the latter can definitely be taken as a symptom of positive evolution. For instance, several measures have been taken to make sure that not every disease can lead to death. The development in medical area alone shows how helpful these improvements are.",
        "Nevertheless, I would argue that dealing with an aged population is sure not a preferred choice for any government. Higher proportion of old people simply means on one hand, fewer work force and less contribution to GDP, and on the other hand, raising pension and health insurance costs. To put it in a nutshell, countries will earn less and will have to spend more. Not mentioning the geopolitical risks of such a change. For example, just imagine a country involved in a war, which already lacks young soldiers willing to fight in the field and at the same time should hold on to its industries and keep the economy up.",
        "In conclusion, although it is beneficial to try and extend the life expectancy, I think aged populations can cause many problems and today\u2019s trend in this area doesn\u2019t look promising."
