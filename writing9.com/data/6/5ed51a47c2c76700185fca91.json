        "Recently, many countries are exporting food products to other nations, while their own citizens are in need of it. Some people argue that selling food products to other countries should be minimized. I totally agree that the government should cut down the food exportation level to provide food to the poor people and to boost our the economy.",
        "There are several reasons why food should not be exported if there is a shortage in the local country. One of the main reasons is to provide food to the citizens who cannot able to afford it. Every country has their own poverty level and there will be thousands of people starving for a meal every day. The government should take actions to give those excess food products, which are exported, to the poor, which are to be exported. For instance, India exports rice to developed countries, while so many local children and adults are in need of it. If those rice products are given to the poor citizens, it will help them to lead a healthy life without hunger.",
        "The other reason is to enhance our economy by selling those food items internally. The local farmers who are in need of money sell their farmed food products to developed nations to get a high income. Since, the prize price for those food products is high in those countries. This results in domestic inflation of prize prices for those food items because of scarcity, which produces negative effects to our economy. For example, many farmers in India exported onions to nearby nations, when there was only less number an insufficient amount of onions to buy in their own country. Thus, the price of onions increased massively, which inturnin turn affected India\u2019s economy.",
        "In conclusion, after analyzing the benefits of cutting down the exportation of food; in my opinion, it is essential that the government to look after their own citizens rather than trading it. I believe it assists their country\u2019s economy to grow and to help the poor people, who are in need of food."
