        "In recent decades, the quantity of children with obesity has drastically increased. While some people claim that the authority is liable for the infants' obesity, others believe that adolescents' overweight is parent's responsibility. In my opinion, the latter approach appears more liable for adolescents.",
        "On the one hand, it is clear that the ministry  should take a responsibility of children obesity. Firstly, these days more and more children rely on fast-food or pre-prepared meals, which contain too much fat, salt and sugar. To be more specific, these Foods are attractive to infants because they are cheap to buy and very easy to prepare. As a result, an unhealthy food can cause various problems such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease, cancer and overweight etc. For instance, a paper published by Dr Robert Watson, a world renowned specialist, reveals that the reason for infants' obesity is that more than 58% of children are eating fast-food in schools.",
        "On the other hand, parents should care about the weight of their infants. First and foremost, the philosophy about everything begins from home, it make sense that environment of home reflect to children habit. For example, mostly the overweight children have uncontrolled eating habit by their parents, so children prefer consuming unhealthy food without knowing the dire effects to their body. Secondly, parents are really busy with working, so they cannot manage well about their children meal as they just provide soke money to their children for having a lunch. Moreover, children choose to lead a sedentary lifestyle. In particular, in their leisure time, they watch television or go online as well as play video game instead of doing outdoor activities.",
        "To sum up, both the ministry and parents can play an indispensable role in preventing children obesity. The authority should regulate the food industry and parents should serve healthy home cooked meal and encourage to play outdoor sports."
