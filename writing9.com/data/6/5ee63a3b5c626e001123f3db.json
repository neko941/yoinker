        "In the last decades, in the majority of western countries, drug is used with any limits. From my point of view, this is a huge problem because it involves not only older people, who are mature and conscious about what they do, but particularly teenagers.",
        "In this essay, I will explain from my personal point of view what are the reasons and how  can we solve this issue.",
        "First and foremost, drug is one of the main problematic among people. In different countries drug is legalized, for example, in California, in the Netherlands and Spain. Over there, people can use the drug without any problems and they can cultivate it in their own house. However, in the rest of the world, people can't use it and this involves consuming it secretly. Due to this, since people are 13 years old they consume the drug. They do it only because that means to be \"a cool guy\". They don't use it because they want, but order to be accepted to their groups of friends. In my personal knowledge, I think that people without personality consume the drug because they can't say no if someone propose to them to smoke it.",
        "Moreover, this involves in particular younger because they can receive a lot of money. The drugs cost a lot, and people who sell it earns a lot of dollars. In fact, young people decide to invest their time to sell the drug and for that this is a work.",
        "In my own opinion, the only way to stop the traffic of drugs is to stop to cultivate it. I know that is a hard work because in every part of the worlds the drug is cultivate illegal. But if the Government wants to impose it, it can do.",
        "Furthermore, another good reason to blocked it is to put a high tax to whom abuse of it or sell it.",
        "To conclude, the drug is bad for our health and we have to eliminate it. I am very against to the traffic of drugs because I think is a bad influence. The only things that the Government has to do is to block with high taxes."
