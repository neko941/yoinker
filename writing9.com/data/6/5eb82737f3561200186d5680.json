        "Some people claim that teenagers should take part in society services and it should be mandatory for high school programmes. I agree with this idea. Firstly, I will explain this idea how beneficial to students to experience in business life and secondly I will explore what is the positive sides of this suggestion for teenagers' mental development.",
        "",
        "One the one hand, to work for charity for teenagers can be useful for both society and themselves. Teens can be experienced and this situation might help them when they graduate from schools because many employers seek for a qualified person when they need an employee. Furthermore, students can be informed about different kinds of occupations as they work for people in a wide range of jobs. In this way, they can learn some things about their career aims and interests before going to university, they can determine what to do in the future.",
        "One the other hand, working for community can improve their personalities, such as a sense of responsibility. When students can have more responsibilities, they must enforce themselves to manage their time and organize their lives between studies and work. Moreover, they can learn empathising with other people. For instance, a student who works for elderly people will understand older people's issue more. Also, this work might help them socialize with other people because when they work for the society they are exposed to meet other people.",
        "In conclusion, whereas I think that it is not right to enforce anyone to do something, there are a lot of advantages of working in high schools for both community and students . Therefore I agree with the idea of unpaid community services should be obligated in high schools."
