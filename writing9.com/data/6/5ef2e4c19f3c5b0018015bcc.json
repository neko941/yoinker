        "It is true to say that crime rate in big cities is generally higher than that in the countryside. This is mainly due to several factors that possibly widen the gap in the future. Thus, in this essay, I would like to suggest some viable preventions as follow.",
        "In the first place, there are two primary reasons why crime rate in cities is of a higher place. Firstly, due to the overpopulation as seen in urban areas recently, unemployment rates are rocketing. Hence, people have no other choices but to choose low-paid jobs or manual labours. As a result, they become easily dissatisfied with their negligible incomes, subsequently, jealousy with those who are more fortunate arises. This will directly push a kind person to do harm to others wealthier individuals with the aim of stealing or even more serious, murdering. Secondly, metropolises have a wide range of internships to offer, but they are usually unpaid works. Therefore, graduates and juveniles struggle to cover the living costs. This is one of the key motives for committing crimes among youngsters explaining why crime rate is increasingly higher.",
        "On the other hand, some preventive measures can be implemented to reduce this growing rate. Obviously, early proper educational programmes are indispensable in guiding people, especially children and juveniles, to go on the ethical and moral track. Next, it is advisable to impose stricter punishments on the culprits, acting as deterrents discouraging would-be culprits and others from offending. Finally, the government should take more responsibilities in securing a higher living standard for its poorer citizens, providing more job opportunities as well as access to basic necessities.",
        "To conclude, it can be seen that crime level in urban areas is more serious than that of its counterpart. Nevertheless, several responses can be imposed to alleviate the pressing problem."
