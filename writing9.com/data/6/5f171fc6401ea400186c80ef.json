        "over the past few decades, there has been a significant increase in the amount of population around the world. There is not doubt that this has been caused by meddical technology advanced and aging society. Therefore, In my opinion, humanity is the hugest issue that human being need to be deal with.",
        "One of the main causes for the risen in the levels of population has been medical and treatment development. For instance, in the past, people who suffered from plague, there was no medication and vaccination be invented so they couldn't get treatment immedialy. Nowadays however, vaccination is gevien compulsory and therefore some of disease can be prevented. Consequently, people can have longer expentency and have better environment to dwell. Furthermore, many people have higher education than before, so  they have have the concept of contraception. According Taiwan research showed that the amount of total fertility rate in Taiwan has dropped rapidly from 4.0 to 1.218 which is the lowest in the  world  over the past 50 years. In other words, people hvae gain knowledge of contraception and tend to have less children at present time.",
        "Nerverthelss, althought overpopulation has been a major concern, I am conviunced that humanity would be the great promble in the society as a whole. A case in a point, thanks to medical improvement, people have longer life and therefore leading to aging society in many parts of the world. Subsequently, they are less likelt to be cared and supported. Another contributing factor is inequality, For instance, citizens who live in undeveloping countries , they are unable to afford the cost of medical care also live in a  poor sanitary environment, on the other hand, wealth countries have better medical resources.",
        "In conclusion, I totally agree that overpopulation can lead to many nagative impact on the society which is the great issue interms of human nature. Therefore, government should introduce related legislation and provide welfare, this phenomenon can be alleviated."
