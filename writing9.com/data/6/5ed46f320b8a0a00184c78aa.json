        "Some people argue that, it's necessary that study the international news as one of the school subjects in the secondary schools. Also, others believe that studying the international news is a waste of time in the school. Therefore, I believe that, students should study the international news as a subject. Because it has many pros and this essay will explain my viewpoints in detail and reach to a conclusion.",
        "Firstly, it can be said that, international news provides a wide range of knowledge to the students. This is because, it gives about the global news and always has updated news while children will able to get more practical knowledge rather than the theory knowledge. This is purely known as a practical subject and not describe about the theories. Moreover, this subject open ups to the variety of occupations in the fields of Politics, Global Economy, International Business, Media and Education and Many More. In addition to this, as a secondary student will able to gain the wide range of knowledge in the different fields. Unlike the theoretical subjects, students allow to think with the  independent mind and the question mind. further, students will able to think with rational, perspective mind and this will help to sort out day to day problems. For example, when the students study this international news for the first time, they can discover the information via online, printed books , school library and more. It is true that, it is easy to study this subject since, students can collect many information from different sources. Moreover, this subject is convenient and reliable subject to study.",
        "However, the higher authority must be added such, international news as one of the school subjects along with the other subjects.Then, children will have the opportunity to study this subject as well as the other theory subjects.",
        "Finally to conclude this, it can be said that, the education authorities must be aware to add this international news as one of the school subjects. Because, it provides the variety of knowledge and experiences for the students and I believe that, studying this subject provides so many benefits to the students and in the meantime studying such of subject is not a waste of time for the students."
