        "The communication plays a vital role in an individual's life. It is believed that oral communication is more impressive than penned one. I completely disagree with the above concept. Further I will give supporting arguments on this topic.",
        "To begin with, drafted conservation is more advantageous than the verbal. The majority of people depend on penning conversation on a professional level. For instance, most of the associations are demanding joining letters from their employees written by hand or email form instead of verbal statements.",
        "In addition, sometime  didn't get you, he might be failing to recognise when someone delivering verbally. Whereas the drafted conversation is a secure way to send information. To illustrate, it can be seen that in some documents or letters there are terms and conditions for the candidate who will sign the documents after reading that instructions. All these documents are in written form because of they're just wanting that information provided in the paper is conveyed to candidate effectively. Furthermore, in oral conversation we might be facing difficulties in pronunciation, despite the penned does not have such limitations.",
        "To conclude, interaction is an essential part of society. There are so many ways to interact or present instructions or knowledge to the society. Predominantly, verbal delivery is an informal process, however the formal mode of interaction would always be in written."
