        "Since the beginning of the time people have been facing with a various range of problems such as natural diasters like floods , tsunamies.Mostly , it is immosible to prevent from them. Morever , there are more senarious that people have to deal with  for instance having a unsatisfying job or a relationship , shortage of money.The main difference is our statiouns could be changed by the desiciouns we made.",
        "Firstly ,many may think  that accepting and adapting the statiouns are the best behaviours what humans should perform when there are something aganist to them at first look.They believe this is the best way for living.On the other hand there are much more poeple including me believe this argument  human beings have the power of changing their lifes especially unpleasent ones.Forexample , \u0131f we look at the times when we gained our rights, we could clearly see that people had been working at unacceptable condititons.Then they fought for their rights by announcing their demands to the employers and they achieved to turn disadvantages into advantages.",
        "Secondly , a research is established by the experts who have been studying on the human attidutes.This research have showed  the main differences of accepting or fighting with a bad situation.They have found that if people start accepting the things which make them unsatisfield ,they beging to reduce their expectation of life time.",
        "In conclusion , we know that we live our live for once and it is all up to us to live a better life or an ordinary one .It depends on our behaviours."
