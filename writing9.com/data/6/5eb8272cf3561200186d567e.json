        "It is argued that rapidly increase in car ownership over the past thirty years has resulted in traffic jam in urban areas.  I think there are a number of ways to deal with this issue.",
        "",
        "Many big cities in the world have traffic problems, but these problems vary.  For example, It is reasonably easy to drive around my city after 09.00am and before 05.00pm. However, outside these hours, it takes two times more to reach your destination. In some other cities, traffic is congested at all times. Having so many cars in cities also lead to lack of car parking.",
        "",
        "One of the best approaches governments should can take in busy cities is encourage the of use public transport. This means that if more and more people use public traffic, there will be less traffic congestion. Moreover, public transport facilities must be well run and people must be able to afford them. Buses, trams and subways are good ways of transportation, and if they are cheap and reliable, people will use them. Another approach is to discourage people from entering the city centre by building car parks and shopping centres outside of the cities. Many cities around the world do this successfully and offer passenger bus transport into the centre, if they need it.",
        "",
        "At rush hours, government can also run a campaign to encourage people to be less dependent on their cars. Usually, many people use their cars for short journeys to go to the supermarkets or local school. There are unnecessary, but we automatically get in our cars without thinking.",
        "",
        "Clearly we all have a responsibility to look after our cities, but the biggest responsibility is on the governments. Governments can do a lot to improve the situation and part of what they should do involve encouraging individuals to consider alternatives to driving."
