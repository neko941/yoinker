        "At the present, there are more options for people to choose for their life compared to the past as the globalization has influenced for most people around the globe for more than a decade and people have more freedom than before. I strongly agree with the statement above and will describe through this essay.",
        "Firstly, due to the internet has occured for many years and impacted on the ways of people's living as the globalization has created and opened the world from a different country. Therefore, this event has made a person can see the other side of the world such as life's style, fashions, clothing and so on, so a certain citizen can imitate each other and will opt as they want to. For example, most of Asians change their hair colour to bright brown because they admire the the western superstar like Brad Pitch.",
        "Secondly, as people can communicate across the country and the internet has made them easily to meet, thus they can have international friends and more choices to chat with the best one. Moreover, these groups would not find it difficult to find a new boyfriend or girlfriend. For instance, my friend got married with foreigner as they have met for years through online application.",
        "However, too many options can harm some people because a scammer can embeded by many ways such as by the internet like online dating. To conclude, it is a good thing to have more choices for an individual who want to be as their desire than the previous decades that there was not any selections for people to pursue their dream."
