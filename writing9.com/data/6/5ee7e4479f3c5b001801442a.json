        "It's a bitter truth that many people try to immigrate to another country every year for a variety of reasons; Now this migration can be forced or optional, but the common denominator of all of them is getting better and living a brighter future. I need to point out that many conditions play a role in a person's asylum, such as belief and belief, poverty, oppression, political and social conditions, natural conditions, etc., which have been one of the most important reasons for many people in the world to seek refuge during these years.",
        "Unfortunately, every year many people are forced to emigrate to other countries and become refugees due to very sad reasons, and the number of these people is increasing every year; The point to consider in this regard is that most of these people are migrating and taking refuge from developing countries and the Third World, but in some cases and for years, immigrants from developed and modern countries of the world have reasons such as political issues. They are forced to emigrate to a new place, as are some politicians, including former Tunisian President Mr Ben Ali.",
        "I must point out that immigration and asylum will certainly put a lot of pressure on the government and, most importantly, the people of the destination country, but on the other hand, many of these people may have abilities that can be very useful and effective for them.",
        "As a result, it seems that this type of migration and refuge in another place is often in favour of the destination territory",
        "and to the detriment of the country of origin, because the same refugees can develop economic growth and increase young population with the right government program. They will suffer irreparable setbacks and setbacks. There have been many examples of this from the past to the present, such as the shelter of the people of African countries to the United States and the people of Asian countries in Canada and Europe, while the fog of their own countries is getting worse every day."
