        "It is true that many sportsmen gain a considerable amount of payment compared to other significant occupations. There are differing views of whether it is fair or not. Personally, I believe that experts in sport deserve such a profit, as they make much effort to obtain those medals and trophy. However, to some extent, other jobs such as a doctor also should be granted a great measure of cash.",
        "To begin with, as on a regular basis, the authorities held several world championships, professionals from the morning until the night work out, trying to boost their body and skill, and making elaborate preparations. To be precise, they spend an exponential lot",
        "of time and power on those competitions so as to win the desired cup. Admittedly, it is complicated and exacting. For example, in events like a regatta, a muscular body is compulsory and required for competitors in order to control the boats and win the race, so not everyone can afford it. Obviously, i believe that this proves their labour.",
        "By stark contrast, however, people should take professions like doctor into account as well. Actually, this is by far more intricate than playing football or basketball. It goes without saying that various medical operations are performed with a great effort and concentration. Therefore, not only must doctors be focused on their job, but also they have to possess a proper and advanced education in order to treat people effectively, thus erudite doctors are extremely appreciated. For example, my uncle spent approximately 2 months on curing his right leg, because an appropriate doctor was not available in most of the areas. Meanwhile, when I along with my brother named Axmed went to sport centre, there were numerous professionals of swimming, cricket, and golf. Finally, If the balance between other work and sport is restored, individuals will not be likely to complain in terms of salary.",
        "In conclusion, even though excellent sportsmen attempt heavily to receive medals and enormous wealth, I strongly affirm my position that it is unfair not to equal other workers' earnings and maintain the balance. Thus, the authorities should also take their fund into consideration to escape society's rebellion."
