        "Some people believe that getting suggestions from old people is good because they are wiser as compared to younger people.  I agree with the statement and I will discuss the points in below paragraphs  to support my statement.",
        "To embark with, First of all Older people is wiser than the younger people and they have seen the up's and down's of life so they have more experience to handle the tough situations of life. To illustrate, Children always go and ask their parents about any problems they are facing related to their studies, career or any personal problem and the parents will always try to give them the best suggestion they can according to their experiences in life. Secondly, Our parents are always wanting good for their children and see them achieve everything in life and therefore they always guide them and help them to grow in life,however, people of same age, sometimes feel insecure from their peers and try to misguide them with wrong instruction, which can sometimes make them follow the wrong path in life.",
        "Moving further,  parents know how to live life in real challenges and handle critical situations in life so they are the right ones to ask for any help or suggestion.Moreover, parents will never misguide their children and always try to help their children to get the best in life.",
        "To conclude, Although we always go to our friends first for any help or suggestion we need in life but taking advice from your parents, grandparents or teachers is always a good idea as they have more life experiences than others."
