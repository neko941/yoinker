        "It is argued by some people that a higher tax should be implemented by government on junk food as it significantly renders citizents\u2019 health issue which they are dealing with nowadays. I firmly disagree with this opinion and believe that thriving an understanding and awareness of healthy lifestyle on people is much more fundamental than forcing them to pay more tax.",
        "First of all, I\u2019m inclined to believe that internal encouragement is more powerful than external enforcement to urge people for having balanced diet. Therefore, instead of imposing a higher tax so that people do not consume fast food exessively, it is better for government to instill a better undertanding and awareness of healthy life to the citizents. This can be done by activating healthcare centre in the community and holding a regular health consultation. These measured actions will most likely address this health issue among community since they possess ample knowledge related to a healthy diet.",
        "Secondly, to support people undertaking a healthy lifestyle, government and private-health organisations should provide more free-access aminities such as gym and sport centres for the citizents. As such, citizents cannot make an excuse that the availibility of public space for doing exercise is limited. Furthermore, government could also promote health behavior by hosting a monthly sport competition covering all sexes and ages so that people are triggered to do more health activities in their daily lives. For instance, officials could hold a youth competition in a village level as many youngsters can involve and maintain their physical health.",
        "In conclusion, I thought that the increasing price of fast food is not a long-last solution for health problem such as obesity. Conversely, the awareness coming from individual will perhaps be last for people\u2019s long lives."
