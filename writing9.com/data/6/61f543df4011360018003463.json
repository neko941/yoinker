        "Giving gifts to others has been becoming a trend among everyone. Therefore, few masses consider that giving presents as the best method to reveal the affection and care labour them but others argue that there are other ways also to show care so I will discuss both views along with my perspective.",
        "To begin with the first notion, by giving gifts , people can show their love and care about them as expensive presents good way to give importance to someone, they can think that they are important for them so they give us expensive gifts such as mobile phones , accessories in gold , cars and bikes . Additionally, when anybody gives gifts to someone then they can feel overwhelmed and precious. For example- in flowers , roses are more given to others as a present as they are the symbol of love in red colour.",
        "Furthermore with the second notion, instead of giving presents,  there are many other ways through that individuals can show their affection and care about them firstly everyone knows that no one gift is precious than gifting their time to others in difficult situations as well  giving money when they have need . For instance, in the epidemic of the corona, many people do not have money to take care of themselves so rich people should give money to them as showing their care towards others as well as utilised time with others in different activities.",
        "According to me, even though gifts play an indispensable role in a human's life  they should do other activities to show care about others such as spending time , playing games , studying together and many more through others can feel happy ."
