        "Noise pollution is increasingly available in modern society. While some people believe that several strict controls about noise should be implemented. Others believe it is free to make noise whenever they want.",
        "Firstly, several strict controls should be implemented to deal with noise. The first reason is that the loudness of the noise may lead to creating an unpleasant living environment for people surroundings. For example, one\u2019s daily life can be influenced by the noise; students\u2019 studying can be interrupted or employees cannot concentrate on working. As a result, noise pollution has ruined the peace of human\u2019s life. Moreover, the exposure to prolonged and excessive noise may cause a range of health problems ranging from stress, headache, hearing loss to insomnia. For example, the newborns and the elderly are those who are primarily vulnerable to sleeplessness in a mess of noise.",
        "Secondly, others believe that it is free to make noise whenever they want. The first reason is that individuals consider making noise as a type of recreational activities. Singing karaoke or holding a barbeque with loud live music are one of relaxing activities most people enjoy, leading to feeling less tensed and totally relieved. In addition, with the help of modern technology, noise can be elaborately solved not to influence the surroundings. Soundproof walls and windows can block up to ninety to ninety-five percent of noise coming through the windows, which helps people away from it. As a result, people can make noise without annoying the others and there is no need to keep quiet.",
        "In conclusion, while there are several reasons why the levels of noise should be limited, I believe people should have the right to make noise."
