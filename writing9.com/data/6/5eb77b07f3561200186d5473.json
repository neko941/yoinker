        "There are few people who believe that art is an important study for kids at school, but others believe that it is not worth the while and it is of no use. In this essay I would like to express my point of view with relevant examples.",
        "Firstly, education is very important in our life. Educational institute provides various courses such as math, science, social study, English and many more, but there are few institutes which provide art as study. I believe it is not waste of time, but instead it is very essential. It has both pros and cons. Craft is like a mirror which help students to express their feelings. For example, if a child wants to say something, but he is not good with words, but good at art then there profession speaks for them. The bottom line is this subject is not waste of moment table and it gives the value in kids learning. It also provide with peace of mind and it give comfort when you needed.",
        "Secondly, who believe it is not worth  learning, they think that there are more important accountable then this such as physics and science, in which, if student's spend more hour, then they can achieve great success and do many good things for the society to live. For instance, kids like the dependent on which they spend more time, but there is a chance that they might not like it in future.  I strongly agree that, study's other then art are very important in life, but we shouldn't neglect the value which provides to students with craft study.",
        "To summarize, as there is saying \"Education is the key to success\", it is students choice what they like to research because I believe they should select the subject in what they are more interested in, but as for the craft subject it should be taught in school as it give students to see world with big pitcher and open their mind and allow them to see further out of boundaries with their thoughts. It also provide knowledge and to express their feeling to the world as we got many great painters who are very popular for their art work and how they express what they are thinking and what knowledge they want to give to the world."
