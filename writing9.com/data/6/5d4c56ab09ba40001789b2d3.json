        "Human beings are always remain curious to know about history because it is only way to search how human life has progressed from past to present. But some thinkers have opposite views. Here, In this essay i will discuss both these views with my opinion.",
        "On the on hand, those who believe that learning from past is useless in the present life give some supportive views in favor.First is that life scenario has changed to a great extent. So, past knowledge is meaningless in Today's life. For example, To study of 13th century has no use because now we are living in 21st century and have different needs and demands that can't be fulfilled by reading of 13th century. Secondly, It is wise saying that we should forget to past to move forward so in this stiff competitive world, to reach to heights and to grow in future the  learn of  present is in demand. In addition to it, There are many subjects like science and mathematics that are far more useful  than history. Therefore, wasting time on history, it is far  better to study these subjects for for future inventions and developments.",
        "On the other hand, I acceded with them but everything has its own importance and same thing applies on history.  History give us clues how life develops from different stages and reach to the present. Moreover, from past it can be learned which mistakes our ancestors had done and what results they had faced. For Instance,  world war first and world war second. The knowledge of the reasons of these wars can be useful to avoid to third world war. Nobody can forget the destruction caused by atom bombs . It is massage for this generation how dangerous can be the use of atom bombs.",
        "In the conclusion, Though people believe  that learning past has no use in the today's life but we cant not neglect the benefits of past history because it only way to know how we reach in present"
