        "According to many societies of the nations , they have different thoughts regarding human education system. Still nowadays , many people prefer to get educate thier children in seperate schools for girls and boys with the prospective of secured future. However , many others believes that there are more benefits of Co-educational schooling in which boys and girls both studies in the same school. The facts of the thesis will be discussed with my own opinion in the following paragraphs.",
        "There are many schools made separate for boys and girls and many parents having some personal reasons are prefer to educate thier children in these schools. Some of them thinks it can help to secure thier child's furure. For example , several times relation between a boy and girl can distract both of them from their academics. Therefore , seperate schooling can be useful to do more focus on study by students. Also as similar as in the past , still today many natives have same reasonable thinking regarding education sector.",
        "On other hand , Co-educational system also have more merits for both boys and girls. It is widely help them to do better co-operate together and also both can grab the same opportunities by studying in one school. For instance , in many futuristic jobs , men and women work together. So children should learn to co-operate with each other from schools. Moreover , in a developing country co-education schooling led to finish the existence of inequality.",
        "To conclude , due to some reasons people decide to sent their children in seperate school but according to my opinion , sending boys and girls in the same school is more beneficial to learn how to co-operate as well as the issue of inequality can be solved."
