        "It is often argued that the government should prohibit to use of animals for scientific research, while some people believe that using animals for scientific researchers to learn human biology and health is a significant part of human life. In this essay, I will discuss both sides and provide possible solutions.",
        "On the one hand, species of animals help to  environmental food process because it is reliant on human existence. It is a crucial role in its society. People believe that the government should ban animals used in scientific research, Scientific researchers would considerable negative impact on animals' life. By hunting animals for scientific researchers. There are some detrimental effects that contribute to animals' life. The reason is animals are use for scientific researchers that various of new drugs for human consumption are firstly tested on animals and lead to animals long-term diseases or death. Furthermore,",
        "On the other hand, scientific research provide some benefits to human life. The reason is that, researches are used animals for testing on drugs and considers suitable for human consumption. It will help to detect on drugs are suitable or not. That way, it would help to survive lots of human lives. For instance, virus infections like covid, that used animals for testing on vaccines. Moreover,",
        "In my opinion, I believe that animals can be utilized by  scientific researchers if no other suitable option is available while the government should enforce the right method for animal rights.",
        "In conclusion, after a thorough analysis of the topic, the government should limit animal research for the protection of the environment. However immediate scientific research is beneficial to human lives."
