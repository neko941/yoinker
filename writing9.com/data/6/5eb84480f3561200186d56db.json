        "Do plants and animals are essential to the environment? Have you ever thought that the benefits of it makes less environmental problem? In my point of view, nature decides food chain to balance the environment to make it remain stable and I could not agree with it more.",
        "Nowadays, we are facing the environmental problem and it might affect health issues. The reason why we are facing with global warming, disaster and limit of resources is we destroy the surroundings. For instance, people cutting down the trees and build the hotel to gain more money from tourists, develop the road to make more tourist attractions and hunting extinct animals to make a decoration. All these things ruin the nature and ourselves by people who are selfish.",
        "Moreover, plants and animals can balance the environment by eating only when they hungry and they can build their home with eco-friendly equipment. For example, birds build their nests with grass and eat warm. What I want to explain is animals did not interrupt human lives because nature decide them to find their own food and balance it by food chain.",
        "On the other hand, it can be disadvantageous when we are near their home or forest. For example, it can be dangerous if we go camping near the forest while it is the season of big animal to breed.",
        "To conclude, if we can control the demand of plants and animals and human wants and needs in the equilibrium point, we can live together  and reduce all the pollution or any environmental problems and that is why I agree it."
