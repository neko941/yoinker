        "This apartment with its stunning views of the bay is something that I have wanted for a long time. Therefore, I will be renewing my lease with you but I have certain concerns about the building that I want to be addressed.For example, the building hasn\u2019t had basic plumbing and fire safety maintenance in almost a year. Additionally, there are cracks in the walls and soft spots in the flooring which needs to be urgently addressed. Also, I noticed there is significant water damage in the bedroom facing the balcony.",
        "Therefore, I would like these issues dealt with swiftly and in an organized manner,I look forward to seeing these changes.",
