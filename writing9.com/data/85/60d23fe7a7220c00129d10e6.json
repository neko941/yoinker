        "Dear Sir",
        "I am writing this letter to express my concern about the accommodation provided by the company. I have moved in with my family last month. I am thankful to you for a fully furnished flat with a spacious kitchen and balcony with an amazing city view. However, I am facing few issues in my apartment which requires your kind attention.",
        "Firstly, the Air conditioner has stopped working for 2 days. As it is summer, we are unable to tolerate the heat as we are staying on the 3rd floor. Secondly, the washing machine plug needs to be replaced as it is broken before we arrived. We have requested the apartment owner\u2019s multiple times to look at the issue but there was no proper response.",
        "I hope that you will address my problem by talking to the leasing office and help me in resolving the issue as soon as possible.",
        "I look forward to hearing from you.",
        "Yours sincerely"
