        "My name is Glenda Bay, and I am currently residing on 635 5th Street Chasewood Avenue.",
        "Recently, every time I drove home from work, I noticed that traffic was getting worse. Before it would only take me 30 minutes to arrive at my house, however now, it would take an hour or so. It is apparent that this is due to the increasing number of vehicles on the street, the majority of which are trucks of the factory down the road.",
        "To mitigate this problem, I was thinking about whether it is possible to ban these large vehicles from entering this part of town during rush hours. I think the factory can make an arrangement to reschedule their deliveries at any time of the day.",
        "If you have any questions or if there is any development about this, please feel free to contact me anytime at 070-1234-5678 or [email\u00a0protected] I am looking forward to hearing from you soon.",
        "Thank you.",
