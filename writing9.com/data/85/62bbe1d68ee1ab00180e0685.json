        "There is a common notion among the masses that there any lifestyle of people living abroad can be understood on the internet instead of visiting those countries as it furnishes information regarding the cultural background of the people of multifarious societies. I totally disagree with the statement. This essay will articulate the reasons in the forthcoming paragraphs.",
        "Firstly, the most conspicuous reason  why visiting different region play a significant role in order for comprehending the tradition of the community abroad is physical interaction. To elucidate, in order to know the way of living of the people across the globe it is very imperative to travel to those nations instead of getting information on the net. Hence, when a person visits a country personally he can get a better notion of understanding and respecting their day-to-day norms which are not available on the net. Moreover, exploring facts virtually will only give u a rough idea which is way too different in actual form. For instance,  a recent survey conducted by the Ministry of Tourism held that according to the general public,  going physically to various nations helps in perceiving the experience in an  effective and efficient manner.",
        "Furthermore, another significant reason is a lively experience. In other words, nothing can be more exciting and informative than physically travelling to other countries for apprehending the lifestyle of the individuals. As the information available on the internet is too limited, virtual data can only give a person a rough ideology but when the public visits that country actually the experience is more fascinating and worth knowing. For example, the info available sometimes is too vague than the reality apart from that, it only gives you a conception of the historical background which can be better known and cherished by going to another nation.",
        "To conclude, although there is no iota of doubt that the internet is flooded with  significant and comprehensive knowledge regarding every civilization yet in my popping into multiple nations can be more adventurous and more knowledgeable which is irreplaceable."
