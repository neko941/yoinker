        "Being tenant of your flat7, Park Avenue, I am writing this letter to request some changes in the rental agreement.",
        "For over three years, I have been renting this apartment with my friend Geet. However, Geet is moving out next month. She was offered a new job opportunity which she accepted. Therefore, she has to shift to a new city.",
        "Despite this change, I am unwilling to leave this place as it still suits me perfectly. Firstly, it is within a good walking distance of my university as well as its excellent condition. Secondly, this locale is in the heart of the city, consequently, I have never faced any issues regarding shopping, grocery stores, and restaurants.",
        "My difficulty is only rent, which although reasonable, is too high for me to afford to pay alone. I would like to ask your permission to find another flatmate who would share the cost with me. I hope you understand my situation and permit me to search for a new renter.",
        "I look forward to your quick response.",
        "Yours sincerely,",
