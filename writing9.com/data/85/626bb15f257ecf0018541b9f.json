        "Dear Sir,",
        "I write in the reference to your letter in which you asked about some recommendations for improving our local library.",
        "Firstly, the most interesting thing about it is probably its location because it is situated in the heart of the city that's why it is accessible to everyone without any hassle. Besides this, it contains all genres of books such as history, economics, science, technology, and so on that's why it suits all readers.",
        "However, there are still some sections that need some improvements. First of all, the visibility is extremely poor in some areas due to the poor lighting system. Moreover, there are only three computers which are not sufficient to fulfil the requirements of all readers at a time. Therefore, these need to be improved.",
        "I would like to recommend that management should install better lights not only at the entrance but also in all corners of the library as well as install at least 10 new computers to cater to the necessities of readers.",
        "I look forward to your consideration.",
        "Yours sincerely,",
