        "Although some persons go for one-on-one tutoring, others adopt a group lesson. In my opinion, I consider that group teaching help people learn faster and better.",
        "On the one hand, some people would rather learn in groups as group learning, foster communication and motivate one another to achieve greater success. In other words, these people believe that interacting with each other in group class is a catalyst in learning as it enhances their background knowledge in subjects they might be unfamiliar with. For example, my brother lagged behind in Mathematics before getting into college, but as soon as he started college classes, there were tremendous changes in his level of understanding in Mathematics which, according to him was as a result of sharing ideas with colleagues who knew better than him on that subject. In addition, company education promotes competition among peers, hence a positive impact in their determination to succeed.",
        "On the other hand, certain people go for person-to-person tutorial because of minimal distraction it possesses. To clarify, people with a short attention span or those who suffer from Attention Deficient Syndrome (ADH) experience difficulty in staying focused owing to the effect of noise pollution from classmates. These people easily get distracted by the sound of a voice note from any direction. To illustrate, studies have revealed that, 99 percent of people with such illness do better in learning or improve their academic performance by personal lecturing. Furthermore, face-to-face lecture is vital to stay focused throughout a period of learning in other to achieve outstanding success.",
        "In conclusion, while people may vary in their choices, I think individuals would stand a better chance to succeed in education if they interact and learn in groups."
