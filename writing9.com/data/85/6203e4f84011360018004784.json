        "I am writing this letter in connection with the new attire we have adapted. Since almost every employee is wearing this uniform for eight hours more or less every day, I believe it is in everyone's best interest to find it comfortable.",
        "first of all, the textile of the suits is so soft and beautiful that I could wear them anywhere I go. Also, the way it has been designed both for women and men impressed me a lot.",
        "Unfortunately, the size range is quite bothering. As we have over 200 staff in this firm, we have pretty different sizes and shapes. Having uniforms available in just to size is making some problems. Honestly, only 10% of employees could fit into them and the majority are very young either loose or tight suits which are really uncomfortable not only for me but also for most of my colleagues to work in.",
        "anyway, I would like to offer some suggestions to curb this issue. Firstly, the tailor could be asked to make suits in different sizes from extra small to extra large. The second recommendation is to personalize each attire for each worker if it is possible.",
        "this is all I would like to share with you. Thank you for taking the time to read this letter.",
