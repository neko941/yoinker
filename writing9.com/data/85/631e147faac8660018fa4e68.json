At the time of your performance , I was really mesmerised by your singing , notes in every song were perfect and up to the point . It was a pleasure to see performing you live. I never heard you singing old classical songs but in , the concert you sang a few of them too. And I became die heart fan of you.",
        "So I would like to request you if you can be my mentor as I am also good at singing and taking a few singing classes . With your mentorship , I can be more confident in singing and  a stage performance. I know that you are not from a family who has any musical background , so same as me but seeing you I feel motivated .",
        "Hoping for your favourable response.",
        "Yours sincerely,",
