To cite an example of why this disagreement, traditional books were printed in very different formats, such as pocket books, special edition books, etc. In the same way, people enjoyed the touch, the texture, even the smell of books. A recent study by the University of Havard reveals that individuals reading printed books enjoy deeper and get more sensations than those that read books on electronic devices. Also, there are many individuals which have lifetime hobbies to the collection of ancient and incredible books.",
