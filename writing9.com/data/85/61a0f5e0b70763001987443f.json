        "There can be various reasons for a language to be extinct. Some people believe that it would be better if there are fewer languages in the world so people will live a better life. In my point of view, it is a tragedy if a language dies out.",
        "Firstly, every language holds a piece of the past and culture as a medium. For instance, Oroqen people\u2019s language doesn\u2019t have text, and they inherit their story and knowledge through stories from word-of-mouth. Their language is part of the memoir which contains a part of how human beings were developed in such an area. The loss of a language is the damage of resources that we can gain experience from.",
        "Secondly, fewer languages will not lead to an easier life. For example, let\u2019s imagine a world with only one language. Different accents in different regions will result in a different custom of language using which will finally lead to several new languages. The obstacle of understanding a completely different accent will not be easier to overcome than understanding a new language. The idea of using the same language globally has already been dreamed of but failed in the end. So, it\u2019s impractical to attempt to achieve a single-language world.",
        "In conclusion, the dying of a language is a passing of cultural treasure and will not make our life easier. Also, saving these languages as we can is a serious task for us to save history. Both making them still alive and recording them to make a fossil are possible and practical efforts to save a language."
