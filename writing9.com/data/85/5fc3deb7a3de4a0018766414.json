        "Nowadays, many countries uplift  teens for  part-time jobs. The former statement has both pros and cons in the development of an adolescent. As a temporary job can degrade the student in academics, but on contrary, this also helps in understanding the value of money, to which I agree.",
        "In several parts of the world, students working in their left-out time after school or colleges are followed. This practice affects  their studies, hence a major disadvantage of working in the half-time. For instance, after attending 8 to 9 hours in school, the remaining time is spent working in an organization. As a consequence, causing the problem in  academics, as there is no time given for self-study or completing the homework.",
        "It is important to consider that, the temporary job also helps in the development of an economical mind. In addition to the earlier sentence, I completely agree that  the irregular work benefits the youth in understanding the importance of money. That is to say, once a teenaged starts working in their half-time and getting paid for there services, they tend to use money more wisely. For example, when a teen wants to buy something expensive, instead of asking cash from their parents, he will work hard to get that. This result in acknowledging the worth of a penny and a commodity.",
        "In conclusion, side-work can have both negative as well the positive aspects of a teenager. Although, as in my point of view, this kind of temporary jobs builds a better financial intellect."
