        "Dear Hotel Manager,",
        "I am Mr Ravi from Telus company who organised a meeting at your hotel on 2nd September and would like to provide feedback on the event. Firstly, the team was mesmerized by the hotel reception entry area with the spectacular furniture and mid-blowing water pond in the middle of the lobby.",
        "However, the entire team was not happy with the food with what they served. In addition, the vegan food itself was not even cooked properly,hence, most of the team members came out of the hotel with an empty stomach which is not at all expected. Furthermore, they did not feel like eating fresh food as they could not have any hot items on their plate.",
        "As you heard, I would strongly recommend you to replace the chef right away before it gets worse and provide some intensive training if required to conduct a few assessments to improve the food quality. It would be really good if you can focus more on vegan food preparations with a few additional options as most of the community members would like to have the same.",
        "I look forward to seeing the change to have  nice and the best food at your hotel.",
        "Best regards,",
        "Lakshmi."
