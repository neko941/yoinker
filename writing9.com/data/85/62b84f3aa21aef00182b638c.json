        "Dear Mrs Barrett,",
        "As I passed by your house, I saw the signage that you were looking for some assistance. In fact, I could be of help to you by removing the grass, cleaning your house and washing the dishes. Recently, I completed plumbing vocational studies so if there are any leaks in your kitchen or utility areas, I can repair them.",
        "You have been very instrumental in my successful scholarship grant by giving such great advice, so allow me to return the favour by supporting you for a couple of hours this coming summer. In addition, I would like myself to be productive rather than spending time bingeing on Netflix or playing computer games.",
        "I am available and I can start this next week Monday, however on Sundays I won't make it since I am also volunteering in the church ministries. I'm looking forward to seeing you and supporting you in the next coming days.",
        "Yours sincerely,",
