        "Issues related to violence at school have been frequently discussed these days. According to an article published in BBC News states that one out of four children is bullied by the other kids; consequently there is no doubt that bullying would have severe repercussions on the victims. In this essay, I will elaborate on the main cause of this behaviour before proposing two possible solutions to tackle this problem.",
        "There are many students, especially teenagers, who have a desire to be recognized as elite individuals. Therefore, sometimes it all happens that those youngsters force and frighten the friends that seem to be weak or isolated in order to boost their own self-esteem. Besides, due to peer pressure, as a member of a group or a gang, the young people have to take inappropriate action toward the victims. As a result, bullying becomes popular in every school.",
        "Nevertheless, to cope with this serious concern, it is a case that students, parents, and educators ought to work cooperatively. In particular, parents should be aware of their kids' conditions, having proper conversations with them to make sure whether they are suffering from any abuse or not. Moreover, teachers can engage with their pupils to notice unusual things that might happen, increasing group cohesion in the classroom to come up with a good strategy.",
        "All things considered, it seems to me that the desire to be appreciated and peer pressure could be the root of bullying. As a matter of fact, developing children's sense of belonging is of the utmost importance to prevent them from being abused. In addition, it is crucial for young individuals to overcome the bulliers in a long run by learning self-defence and how to stand up for themselves."
