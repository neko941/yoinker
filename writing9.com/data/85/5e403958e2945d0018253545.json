        "In recent times, the method of illustration of the news has been modified; the graphical representations are commonly seen in media. Many people believe that such form of news is more productive than only words. In my opinion, such practices are more useful to the readers and the photos along with text provides ease of readers to understand the information correctly.",
        "To begin with, the benefits of including pictures with the news stories provide accurate information and quick review of the story. Many times the editor of the article finds difficulties to illustrate the details of the incident venue, while the photograph of the spot conveys all that information to the reader. For instance, the horrible attack on the World Trade Centre can be illustrated for the reader with the help of photos along with words creates a great impact. Moreover, the readers can quickly get an idea of the article if the photos are presented in it. This practice makes TV shows and newspapers quite attractive to their viewers and readers.",
        "Furthermore, due to availability of colour news printing, many youngsters are attracted towards the newspapers. Although, in the past youth was not interested in reading a lengthy article, now they put interest in it to know about their favourite celebrities and sportsmen. For example, the sport news with stunning pictures of Sachin Tendulkar attracts the readers towards its article. Lastly, the practice of keeping words with picture breaks the monotonous tradition of journalism and revolutionize the whole field.",
        "In conclusion, the news stories containing pictures attracts more readers; which is good for both the readers and the news agencies. Such a development in one field brings huge positive impact on society."
