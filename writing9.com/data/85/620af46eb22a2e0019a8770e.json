        "Let me start by pointing out the main issue, which is the lack of responsibility when parking a car. I have seen numerous cars that are parked out of their lanes, and because of that, the other cars have to adjust, while trying to keep within the boundaries of their parking spots. In addition, there is a lot of trash being left in the parking lot, instead of being put in the garbage.",
        "With regards to the possible actions, consider doubling your attention when parking your car. Before turning off, take a look outside of your window to be sure that you placed your car correctly. To address the disposal of trash, I would suggest the installation of garbage bins at some spots in the area.",
        "Finally, I would like to propose a neighbour' s meeting next Friday at 19:30 in order to further discuss these issues and any other.",
        "I look forward to seeing you at the meeting.",
        "Yours sincerely,",
