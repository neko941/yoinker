        "On that day, we left room number 24 around 10 pm, after watching Batman, so I believe it was the last session and my husband and I were sitting on chairs M1 and M2. There was not anyone near us, as we were on the top of the room near the left wall.",
        "I would like to ask for your help to check the cameras for that day and do all the necessary to find and return the jacket for me. If that is not possible, I expect you to reimburse the amount of money the jacket is worth nowadays, because we trust that you should ensure the safety of the establishment.",
