        "In recent years environmental pollution has become a major issue concerning individuals all around the globe. Some are of the opinion that there is not much that could be done by normal citizens to sort out this problem. On the other hand, some believe that solving environmental problems starts with individuals. In this essay, I will be discussing both views and why in my opinion fixing environmental issues are a much bigger problem than ordinary people  could tackle.",
        "To begin with, the ones with the opinion that individuals can do so much to solve environmental problems based their argument on the fact that human beings and their practices are the cardinal reason for this matter.urbanization, destroying animal and plant habitat ,  fossil fuels , carbon emission. All of that has contributed to pollution. A recent study that was conducted in the UK showed that almost 60% of the world's pollution is because of wrong human practices.",
        "However, there is little that could be done by individuals to overcome this issue. On the contrary, there are plenty of things that governments could do to resolve this issue. firstly. doing an awareness campaign that educated people about environmental issues and how small things such as separating the trach could have a tremendous impact on our environment. Moreover, introducing penalties to industries that exceed the legal amount of carbon emission. Also increasing the petrol price and improving public transportations will decrease the number of people using vehicles. Therefore, carbon emissions that come from cars will be limited. For example, in 2018 the Swiss government raised the oil price which forced people to use other forms of transportation and this has led to a decrease in carbon dioxide emission .",
        "In conclusion, environmental issues are way too big of a problem to be solved by individuals alone, governments and citizens should join forces to overcome this major concern."
