        "I purchased a hp EliteBook touch laptop that is 18-inch wide with an intel i10 processor and 8 GB memory from one of your Chroma showrooms located on downside street in Michigan. To be specific, the purchase date was 18-06-2022 around 6.30 pm.",
        "Since I had my flight on the same day around 10.30 pm, I couldn't open the box and check for the items. After payment, I immediately collected my package and rushed to the airport to take my flight to India. On reaching home, I unpacked the kit and found that a few accessories like a charger and a LAN cable were not available.  This left me extremely disappointed as I wanted to utilise the device for my new upcoming projects.",
        "I will email you the bill copy and the picture of the items that were placed in the box. Please arrange to send these missing accessories by international registered post immediately to the address mentioned below.",
        "I hope to receive my goods at the earliest possible.",
