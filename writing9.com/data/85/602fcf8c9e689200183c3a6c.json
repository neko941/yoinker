        "The problem is that every day, a young man brings two large Dobermans to the park and allows them to run free, off the leash. Obviously, this is a potential danger to other people who use the park. Although I have not seen the dogs cause any injuries, they frequently frighten children there and cause concern to their parents. I have contacted the police, but they have not taken action, despite the fact that signs clearly state that dogs must be kept on leads.",
        "The man appears to be in his late 20s, average height and well built. He usually wears a black leather jacket and blue jeans. His dogs are about a meter high, black and brown and well-groomed.",
