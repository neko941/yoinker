        "Regular physical activity is  important for a healthy life. It is believed occasional exercise with a good diet is enough to stay healthy rather than spending a ton on fitness centre memberships. In my opinion, some amount of  daily activity  with a nutritious diet is sufficient for keeping fit.",
        "People, especially youngsters, want to get a six-pack body  rather than a fit one.  Subsequently, they join a gym and resort to various medications to achieve faster results. While they concentrate on short-term results , they forget how these chemicals  might affect their body. For example, we have heard the news of a gym instructor succumbing due to  the overuse of steroids. Moreover, these memberships are very expensive and  cannot be afforded by everyone.  Hence, it is important to train with proper knowledge than just following these fitness centres blindly.",
        "It is  more important to work towards a fit body than a good-looking one. Physical activities like jogging, swimming or dancing on a regular basis can help to break down calories. Also, small changes in our routine life like taking stairs instead of  a lift will burn down extra calories. . In addition,  a diet with a  balance of nutrients will add to overall health. Various studies have shown that a calorie deficit diet with regular exercise followed strictly will prolong life by 5yrs as compared to a sedentary lifestyle. Thus, a healthy lifestyle  constitutes regular activity  and proper nutrition.",
        "To conclude , fitness doesn't necessarily mean working out in a gym. Regular exercise with a balanced diet contributes to  healthy living."
