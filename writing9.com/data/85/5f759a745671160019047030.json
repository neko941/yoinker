        "It is often argued that travelling aboard is not necessarily for most people who like to discover global life because they can watch everything via multiple media. However, I completely agree with  the above opinion and shed some light on several reasons to prove my thought in this essay.",
        "Firstly, visiting  foreign countries is leisure activities spent a lot of money and time. For instance, if someone plans for a short holiday, she will find out the travel agent, comparing trips\u2019 cost, set a work-off with the manager or do numerous tasks like choosing the destination, buying  tickets, booking a hotel, etc. In other words, most individuals want to use money to buy joy without worrying about related problems. Therefore, some people are overwhelmed the preparation causing them to stay at home alternatively go abroad in short term.",
        "Secondly, in the spreading of a pandemic such as Covid-19 disease, the entertainment on the internet is the best solution aim to avoid infection. Only need a computer connected with wi-fi, people can easy to approach information about everyone\u2019s life around the world. For example, an international student living in the US can talk with his parent who lives in Vietnam every day through skype or messenger, and he also updates status on his Facebook in order his dad supervise his life.",
        "In conclusion, saving resources and limiting the drawback are the explanations for my view. I strongly believe that people can know what happened in everyplace although they are indirectly in there due to the development of technology."
