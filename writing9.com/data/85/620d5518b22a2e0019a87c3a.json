        "I am a regular reader of your magazine and I am writing you to draw your kind attention to the recent article published in your magazine in \u201cCurly Tales\u201d section regarding my town \u201cGoa\u201d. The article stated that the water activities have been shut down since last month and are misleading.",
        "To begin with, Goa is a place of adventures and ecstatic water sports. The activities like scuba diving, snorkeling is operational and were never suspended. The rejuvenating activities are a major tourist concern and the misinformation will lead to major economic loss to local people who runs their business on tourism.",
        "Hence, I would be grateful, if you could release an updated piece mentioning the correct details and apologizing to the public for providing false knowledge. As the book has enormous followers across the globe, the misinformation will get instilled amongst the masses overnight",
