        "Gender inequality has been one of the most debated topics. Recent researchers have inferred that the difference between the earnings of men and women is huge in the UK. Eventually, equal rights activists believe that the government ought to propose a solution for this  immediately. I agree that the gender pay gap should be eradicated as at work every employee is treated equally.",
        "To commence with, one of the prominent reasons behind making equal wages mandatory is that both men and women exercise the same job responsibilities irrespective of their gender. Hence, paying fewer wages to women as compared to men is an unjustifiable practice. Even though female employees outperform males they are still paid less. For instance, these days many managerial positions in MNCs in the UK are occupied by women and also get recognised for their good work. In such cases, paying them equal to men will encourage them to continue the same.",
        "Furthermore, women at work perform well compared to men. As a result, they have to be encouraged by giving them higher increments. For example, these days bigger companies like Microsoft prefer to hire women employees in order to promote gender equality and encourage them to work. It would promote equality if all are paid on the basis of the work they do rather than the gender. It is indeed an advantage to the companies if the top performer is encouraged.",
        "To conclude, salary, when paid based on the performance and the number of responsibilities undertaken will promote equality rather than paying based on  gender, as there will always be low performers among men. Paying women less than men for the same set of responsibilities is an injustice and has to be stopped immediately."
