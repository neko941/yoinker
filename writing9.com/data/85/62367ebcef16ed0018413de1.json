        "I am sharing Room 408 with my classmate Amy in the Hall of Residence. However, the behaviours of Amy have caused several serious troubles for me. First of all , she invites some friends to our room to have a party on a regular basis. They cause a lot of noise, drink beer and make mayhem until midnight, which is uninstalling and annoying. In addition, they eat my food without noticing me so many times, although I have told them not to do that. I am unable to stand that.",
        "I would be grateful if you could offer me a single  quiet room next semester. I take my studies so seriously as I would like to graduate with decent qualifications, which makes me more employable. If I live in this environment, I cannot sleep well at night, which is devastatingly harmful to my academic performance.",
