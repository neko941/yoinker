Its hustle and bustle are exactly what you were dreaming about when I saw you last. Plus, London offers plenty of accommodation options in which you'll select any type of room according to your necessity.",
        "As I know that you are in the field of business study, I'd recommend applying to Imperial College London, where I graduated from. It's one of the top colleges in the UK, and especially offers excellent opportunities in the business courses. What is more, a big advantage of Imperial is that it also arranges an annual placement program for the students.",
        "This university is highly competitive though. So, if you are extremely interested in it, you would better start working on your study skills straight away. Also, submit your application before Christmas. Don't forget about your reference letters. Please don't hesitate to write to me if you have any confusion about this.",
