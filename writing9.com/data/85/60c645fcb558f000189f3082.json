        "In today's world, computers are becoming very essential in everyone's day to day life. Some people think that computers should be introduced in the classrooms, and their programs used for direct teaching purposes. However, some people think that that dependence on computers in teaching may carry a certain degree of risk to students. I will explain my reasoning in this essay.",
        "Firstly, I think introducing computers in the classrooms can have so many advantages. For instance, students do not need to bring so many books in their backpacks. They can bring only their laptops to study all subjects. When I was in school we do not have  permission to bring the device to the school. So, we have to bring all subjects book and their notebooks. The whole backpacks weigh almost 6 to 7 kg. The advantages of having computers in the classrooms are that they can record the lecture and can have access to the lecture at any time. This will help students to take notes easier and help them to study.",
        "On the other hand, I think having computers in the classroom will have some risk to the students. In this modern world, students already have smart devices such as tablets, mobile phones etc. They spend most of their free time surfing on the internet. And , if we have computers in the classroom, this will force them to spend more time looking at the screen. This will have a certain risk to their mental as well as physical health. Seeing too much on the screen can affect your eyes in the long term. Also, in order to concentrate on the conversation in the lecture using the computer student need headphones, which can cause damage to their ears.",
        "In conclusion, I think having computers can have both positive and negative impacts on the students lives. The school should restrict students to spend less time on computers and spend more time reading the contents from the book. Because reading from the book will not have a negative effect on the student's eyes."
