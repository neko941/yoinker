        "you must be very excited about the meeting. How are all the trip preparation going? I've arranged everything you\u2019ll need here and I just wanted to let you know about all the details.",
        "well, first of all when you get off the plane you'll meet my assistant Josh who is in charge of picking you up. Then he'll drive you to the apartment I've rented from Airbnb for you. Moreover, I\u2019ll be meeting with you in the evening at a gourmet restaurant I've booked for us to be able to discuss a few details about the meeting and have a little fun together.",
        "The place you're staying in is a three-story apartment next to my condo. So don't worry if you are not familiar with the neighbourhood, I'll show you around if you want.",
        "Anyway, I've arranged the meeting to be the next afternoon after you arrived so you get to rest and unwind. Also, the meeting is being held in the office near our department and all the commuting is as easy as a piece of cake. What I wanted to mention is that you need to be super prepared as this meeting is one of the most crucial steps in your promotion process.",
        "Well, I have to get back to work now. If you need any more information don't hesitate to get in touch.",
