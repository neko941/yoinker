        "It is known that aviation is increasing these days and for that their costs are of much significance. It is considered that air fares have reduced noticeably over the last few years, which made travelling much more feasible. This essay will discuss the positive and negative perspectives on this change.",
        "There are many advantages of decline in the cost of flying. Most importantly, it has made trade between different countries more accessible, which would have certain positive impacts on the country's economy.  Import/export, for instance, is significantly affected by the airline tickets. Another positive aspect is, tourism would be more common in such a way that people would feel more comfortable to visit other countries by taking out short visit visas and get around. This would also benefit both, the host country and  the tourist.",
        "On the other there are also several  disadvantages which can not be neglected.  This trend, however, depicts a negative impact on the businesses of commercial airlines. Although, passengers feel comfortable with cheaper tickets, airline companies cannot earn in an amount the way they were before, which would ultimately affect their quality.  For example, recently due to drop in the rate of Dollar, certain air routes are handicapped to provide the quality travel to passengers due to dwindling business.  Another important disadvantage is that passenger turn out become so increased by this trend, which in turn proved troublesome for the travellers.  Lower costs will greatly affect passenger outcome and thus cause the delay of flights in  greatly busiest stations like Dubai, Manchester or Paris.",
        "In conclusion, air travel is totally cost effective. If there comes a certain change in the prices of flight tickets, there would be a huge impact on the accessibility for the voyagers as a result, this would lead to both positive and negative aspects. Whatever they are, either relating to business, tourism or alternatively heavy traffic problems, cost is affecting every prospect."
