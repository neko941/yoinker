        "It is believed by certain people that governments should restrain their funds for the amenities and well being of the host country only. However, I disagree with this statement. Nations must look at the broader picture and provide a helping hand to the underprivileged countries  because it is feasible to do so and helping others means we are helping ourselves.",
        "With the advancement of air travel technology and globalisation, it has become quicker to reach for support in corner of the world. For instance, In 2014, during the earthquake in the remote mountainous parts of Nepal, the USA military helicopters extended their support to rescue the community who were in dire need of help. Thus, as the world has become a global village, nations can collaborate and work with each other closely in the hour of need and in natural disasters, such as floods, hurricanes, droughts and famines.",
        "Furthermore, by facilitating others, we are actually helping ourselves in the long run. If an infectious disease is not combated on an emergency basis in the other regions of the world, it will soon spread to all over the earth. In 2014, Ebola, for instance, spread out very quickly in the various regions of Africa. If  the United Kingdom doctors and nurses have not reached on time, it would have spread to all the developed countries, because people are travelling to various continents on an almost daily basis. Therefore, by containing disease to one region, we are saving the whole of humanity.",
        "To conclude, although some people opine the financial resources should only be spent to improve the living conditions of the local nation, I firmly disagree with this opinion. After analyzing the situation thoroughly, I would suggest that privileged countries must support  developing nations. By helping humanity, we are creating a sense of harmony which is essential for the long term sustainable growth of the human race."
