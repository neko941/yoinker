        "It is a known fact that  many individuals embrace games in early childhood   and must have participated in one fitness activity such as soccer, swimming and others. However, it is worrisome that these people tend to neglect workouts as they grow into adulthood. This essay will explain the circumstances that led to the menace and the possible ways to improve the situation.",
        "One  of the first  reasons the grown-up deserted pastime is job demand. For example, most of age people are employed and need to brace up daily  with tight job schedules. They got so much on their table already working 9 to 5pm, hence they have little or no moment for training. Another problem that needs to be considered  is the financial burden that constantly battles the age group. For example, in Nigeria, the high inflation rate and cost of living require employees to combine two or more jobs to be able to feed their families. The pressures to meet up with daily family needs like food, electricity,  house rent and others are so overwhelming  to the extent that allocating space for the sport will be a waste of the moment.",
        "A possible solution to the problem would be  that the authority should make a policy that will compel employers of labour to  promote sporting activities among workers. For example, employee's game day should be encouraged as a quarterly  event and outstanding performance should  be adequately rewarded. One of the immediate practical solutions to the problem is that government should improve  minimum wages. For instance,  in Nigeria,  if the minimum salary is upscale from 5  to 12 dollars per hour, most workers will meet up bill payments easily, and also reduce stress and subsequently lead to more hours of fun.",
        "Lastly, keeping the body fit through drills is an important task that should be imbibed beyond  teenagehood. Therefore,  If all the approaches stated above are religiously followed there will be a promising trend in workout culture  across all age groups."
