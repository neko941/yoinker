        "As you know this park is the only source of entertainment for the dwellers and it is widely used to play different sports, do social gatherings and health-related activities like jogging. Also, it is a common place for elderly people to sit, share their feelings and pass their free time. Moreover, the park resides a large chain of trees which provide fresh air and oxygen to breathe so, it is good for health perspective.",
        "You are requested to put off the scheme of new construction of the apartments in this area. However, you may pursue it somewhere else for example at the back of the police station since that area has been left spare and not in use for many years.",
        "I look forward to hearing from you soon.",
