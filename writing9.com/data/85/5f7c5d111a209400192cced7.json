Actually, I had to refit the kitchen as my tenants who lived here earlier had done a lot of damage, besides, I recently got the time to fix the same. Although, the aforesaid task should have been completed by now, however, it is taking longer than anticipated, as one of the assigned workmen met with an accident earlier this week.",
        "Firstly, I am sincerely disheartened for the trouble this is causing to you and your family. I concur that continuous hammering can become unbearable. Nevertheless, I have asked the contractor to align some more people to expedite the aforementioned.",

This way, till the time you will be back from office, the task for the day will already be done hence, won\u2019t cause any further trouble.",
