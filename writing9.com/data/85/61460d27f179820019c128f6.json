        "The world we lived in today is literally evolved from a series of changes. There are lots of people who prefer to live themselves by doing similar things and running away from changes. Likewise, others tend to believe that there is much more potential by making different things in their life.",
        "Some people who are afraid of change might perceive that they are not comfortable with something new and they like to have a sense of security. It is also possible that new practices could ruin their routines as these are not certain in the way that they do in the past. For instance, some employees work in the same company and job without considering being hired in a new industry. This is because they are exceptionally familiar with their old job and everything is in their control.",
        "In contrast, other people are tremendously willing to alter everything in their life. They can be regarded as risk-takers and those are very likely to be tedious to do the same routines. In addition, they are fanatical about dynamic and more changeling life. They feel satisfied when they see something brand-new and exposed themselves to uncertainty. There are many renowned professionals who left their previous life and became successful in their life.",
        "In conclusion, trying contrasting things could be a good way for some people. It ultimately depends on individual perception. I am of the opinion that we should welcome new things if they will bring a better life for us. Otherwise, we should go with the things that we do normally."
