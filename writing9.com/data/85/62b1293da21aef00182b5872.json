        "The intent of this letter is to request  9 days' leave from 21-29th June, 2022 as I have my certificate exam scheduled for Project Management. I have already completed my 35 PDU hours for the Project which I need to submit in the first 5 days of the leaves, then my exam is scheduled after 4 days. However, during the leaves Rajeev has agreed to cover me and post the leaves I will be working on weekends to compensate plus there are 5 annual leaves that I already applied for in the Work management portal.",

Moreover, the experience would be a plus as we have Automation projects aligned in the next few months to cover.",
