        "Dear Manager,",
        "The purpose of my writing today is to lodge a complaint regarding an awful service of the lounge, where I resided for a couple of days while there was a foreign meet in that motel.",
        "I was allotted to stay at Royal Oaks Hotel in New Delhi for two days as I was supposed to attend a meeting of your organization.  It was a two-day meeting of all the Westerners from 3 countries, i.e., Australia, the US, and Canada.  It was primarily to launch a paramount gadget featuring the Apple Company iPhone.  The summit took place around lunchtime on both days.",
        "Woefully, the room, where I lived was gloomy with little ventilation and also the AC was not working properly with water leakage.  Furthermore, the washroom was untidy with the faucet handle broken.  Moreover, the bed was uncomfortable with the pillows very hard to lie down on.",
        "If I may, it is highly recommended to get the AC problem solved and also built-in some more ventilation in all the rooms of the inn.  Secondly, it will be better if you can repair the washroom so that other allies who use them will be more comfortable with the stay.  Thirdly, the beds can be changed for the better to make them feasible for the delegates.",
        "I am looking forward to seeing how my suggestions translate into prompt action from your side.  Your attention to this will be highly obliged.",
        "Thanks and Regards",
