        "Over the past decades, the world has evolved in many ways. Nowadays, a variety of products and things are being produced in order to attract people. Some people argue that they have a lot of choices compared to the past. I completely agree with this opinion, even though some people might have different aspects. This essay will seek to examine the complex issue.",
        "On the one hand, I would like to point out that there are various reasons to consider getting the advantages of having many choices. On top of everything, having freedom of choice in a country plays an important role in the democracy evolution of today's world. Moreover, since they have an enormous amount of choices, people can choose the best fit for them. Additionally, it will force companies to be more competitive with each other because they need to give the best shot in their products in order to be purchased by people. For example, more companies will do better promotions and prices to rise their product sale.",
        "On the other hand, I would like to express an equal view that there are several drawbacks to this issue. First of all, unselected products will be a huge waste of time and money if there are a lot of the same items in the market. As a result, a country may have to confront a financial breakdown in a worst-case scenario if there are more products that are neglected by customers. Lastly, in spite of the opportunity of choices between things are preferable, however, more people dispute that the quality of a thing is more important than its quantity. For instance, they prefer a wide range of stuff to choose but they do not want to get distracted by the nuance product in the same shared market.",
        "In conclusion, although we have some disadvantages and weaknesses, I passionately believe that there will have a good trend in the host country by provoking to improve the product's quality as well as quantity."
