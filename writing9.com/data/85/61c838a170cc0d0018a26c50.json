        "Dear Sir/Madam,",
        "I planned for a full-day meeting for my company at your hotel which took place on the 20th of December. I have received feedback from my colleagues who attended the meeting and I would like to share it with you.",
        "I am glad to inform you that the meeting attendees are happy with most of the services that you provided. They praised  the seating arrangement as well as the equipment set up in the room. The sound quality was crystal clear and the slides projected were very sharp. They are also grateful that two water dispensers were placed at the corners near the entrance, as they were easily accessible without the need to leave the room.",
        "However, I am sorry to convey that they expressed their dissatisfaction with the lunch prepared. The lunch menu included a seafood option and a vegetarian option. Those who had seafood lunch shared that the prawns were not fresh. A number of those who ordered the vegetarian meal found it salty too.",
        "As the freshness of the ingredients is really crucial in preparing meals, I would like to make a suggestion to use the fresh produce available. Please also kindly ensure that meals are seasoned well. I hope that my suggestions are acted upon to improve the quality of meals provided in your hotel.",
        "Yours faithfully,",
