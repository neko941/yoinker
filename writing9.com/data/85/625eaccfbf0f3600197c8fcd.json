        "Dear Sir,",
        "Hope my letter finds you well! I came across an article in today's magazine about a vacancy for the voluntary task at your museum. I would like to let you know that since I have been studying history as my major for this academic year, getting involved as a part of the museum would help me tremendously.",
        "Truthfully, I have an eye for detail and precision which makes the task at hand seamless. This skillset of mine makes me an outstanding candidate along with my up-to-date knowledge of history. Not only do I have computer skills but can also work well under tight timelines with the chiselled skill of decision making. On top of that, I also live close to your museum which would really make it easy for me to commute. So, if you choose to hire me for this voluntary position, I will work hard to add value to your team.",
        "I would be able to join immediately and can be at the job from 3:00 to 8:00 PM daily, execept on Sundays.",
