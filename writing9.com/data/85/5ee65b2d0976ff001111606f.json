        "It is very obvious that the government has a duty to ensure the sovereignty of its nation, the enhancement of defence allocation has increasingly seen as a trending topic to be discussed currently. Actually, this kind of thought has existed since the mid of the 20th century, the idea called \u201cMilitary Keynesianism\u201d which is an approach to accentuate the military power, and spend less on social benefits. I completely disagree with the statement, in my perspective the concept of \u201cMilitary Keynesianism\u201d could not be implemented in the 21st century, I presume that the aforementioned concept is not  relevant anymore due to the shifting behaviour of states, and it is not sustainable as well. This essay will demonstrate why the state should not spend more to military instruments, and why it should spend more to fund the social protection project instead.",
        "I highly believe that if the money utilizes to fund social programs, the impact will be equal and sustainable as well. For example, by prioritizing the social security, It gives the unfortunate people access to get an affordable education, healthcare and so on. In other words, social spending will lead to improve the productivity and capacity of its citizen, if the fertility and quality of its resident improved, it obviously will enhance the state\u2019s income as well on the next term. To conclude, the positive impacts of social spending will become more sustainable and equal compared to financing defence programs, because it will be enjoyed by the whole society.",
        "Other than that, I strongly believe that it is useless to spend much on armed forces in this current situation, I assume that the perception of \u201cMilitary Keynesianism\u201d is not relevant anymore in the present circumstances, even though the aforementioned  conception was very popular back in the 1900s. The proof that indicates the irrelevancy of the approach is the war that was once prevalent in the past, becoming rare today due to many multilateral agreements designed to uphold peace that strictly regulates about the conduct of armed conflict, for instance, the Geneva Conventions. Thereupon, it is useless for a country to spend much on armed forces it is not useful in the modern circumstances. Overall, it may be said that It is clearly better to finance the social programs that could enhance the productivity of a nation and boost the development of the state.",
        "To summarize, the world has shifted. In the modern era, war is not prevalent anymore to happen today. Thus, it is not beneficial if the government allocate much money to defence sectors. I highly recommend the government to prioritize the social security programs, if the citizen\u2019s needs already fulfilled, it will eventually make them become more productive. The enhancement of capacity of civilians will obviously lead to strengthening the economy of a country, and the positive impacts will be sustainable."
