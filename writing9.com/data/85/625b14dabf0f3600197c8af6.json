        "Dear Mr Smith,",
        "I'm writing in regards to provide the suggestions to improve our Car-Wash reception area, that requires immediate attention.",
        "There are several complaints I have received so far, but mainly involve the place being overcrowded which also leads to no sufficient seating capacity. Some people left feedback about empty drinking water tanks and not attending the calls timely.",
        "As we are dealing in a service-based industry, it is highly crucial we provide our customers with an ultimate experience. However, the current problems with reception are damaging our reputation overall, which have to be fixed ultimately.",
        "The first suggestion in order to improve the reception is to hire an additional employee who can take advance appointments and attend the calls timely. Therefore, people will know when to arrive. Please feel free to arrange extra water tanks and seats, so everyone can sit while waiting. Additionally, we need to remain in contact with nearby coffee shops, where customers can wait for their service to be completed.",
        "I'm hoping you would take all the necessary actions on the implementation of the suggestions provided to resolve the existing problems for our customers.",
        "Yours sincerely,",
