        "In this modern society, is it commonly seen that the developed high technology materials are being used to support the learners in The library?People have different views of this phenomenon,some argue that there are should be a place only for books, while others believe that advanced media resources are crucial for effective learning. I agree with the idea that advanced study materials bring benefits because of wider information and provide multi-learning strategies.",
        "It is true that advanced media learning contained Wider useful data for students seeking whatever information they require. This is mean that there is a range of knowledge has provided for learners, which  cannot be instituted by a book. For instance,videos are beneficial for studying  music,how to sing a song,where a place provides a variety of music genres to browse, which a book cannot support in singing. Moreover, using videos, in order to improve and develop listening and knowledge that are not exist in a book,such as Pod-cast or Ted-talk  videos have been widely used by the majority of the population across the world.",
        "Teaching by using modern media in terms of education is increasing across institutes.It is because the modern materials assist teachers to plan teaching strategies, which enhances their pupils learning development,besides just learning by reading books. Namely,DVDs, the study source that supported visioning and listening skills as it contains the speech and photo. For example,people who are learning foreign languages used DVDs that had contained in the lessons to practise their listening skills. In addition,it has been proven by a number of pupils that learning through videos is the most effective and efficient approach to improve all aspects of cognitive skills, as it not only boosting  knowledge by listening, but it is also enhancing overall skills.",
        "To summarize, Although some people thought that, The library should only be  a place for books.I strongly believe that the advanced study resources offered were dramatically beneficial as they provided a huge amount of knowledge and a variety of learning methods."
