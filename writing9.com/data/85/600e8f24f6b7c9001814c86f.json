        "Globally, imprisonment is considered a typical solution for the crime even though there are some opponents who say that creating an educational background for offenders will give worthy results. In my opinion, prisons have an irreplaceable role to control the crime rate, yet education should be also integrated effectively into the fight against crime.",
        "To begin with, prison is a criminal sentence that has a positive impact on society. It is apparent that imprisonment can be used to deter would-be criminals in society, and it warns those who have an intention to violate social order and local rules. As an illustration, if a citizen has to be sentenced to 2 years because of breaking traffic rules, it is unlikely that traffic drivers will dare to commit similar actions. Following this manner, depriving an offender\u2019s freedom enhances social order and safety for citizens. For instance, If 500 thieves are sentenced for a further year, there would be less than 500 would-be recidivists available in the city that year. Hence, prison is an indispensable punishment to decrease the number of crimes in society.",
        "However, it can not be denied that education plays a crucial role in rehabilitation, indirectly reducing the possibility of crime commitment. It is because education moralizes the offenders into serviceable people to the community. A justification is that offering an apprenticeship for lawbreakers in jails will help them to find a job after they are released. Consequently, they will be busy with their new jobs, and that is why it alleviates the rate of crimes. Thus, better education in the prison will be even more effective for the problem of crimes.",
        "To conclude, I believe that there is no dominant solution to another, but they are both fundamental methods of criminal concern. The combination of these two sapient treatments will resist the likelihood of committing crimes."
