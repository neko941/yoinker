        "self-study online is a wonderful method for studying other languages. Therefore I still believe that there are many methods to learn an exotic language that is more efficient .",
        "On the one hand, I agree that self-regulatory online is one of the modes for studying languages  ,especially contemporary world develop technology that people can easily access the internet to serve their education . Because   many documents, videos, books and so on are established in public that folk seem to search and find whatever they want for  studying on their own.For example , folk posted a variety of videos to guide how to speak properly with pronunciation or grammar which support  beginners . Moreover, companies introduce languages applicants for each language of the nation in the world leading to creating  convenience for learners  who have difficulty learning at  their places.",
        "On the other hand, I suppose there are so many ways to improve  foreign languages. according to scientists, when we study dialect we must study like a baby that population must communicate with each other by speaking and listening . that`s why people seem  more improved when they speak directly with people who matter in this language. furthermore, teachers or linguists would have a long time to research and understand the language and learners would be educated effectively .",
        "In conclusion, I agree individual studying another dialect through the internet brings  the many benefits to some extent, while I still believe that studying at school ,  language centre or native person is more beneficial"
