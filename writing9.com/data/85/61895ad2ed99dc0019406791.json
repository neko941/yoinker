        "Dear Ana,",
        "I hope you are all fun and frolic. Hope the temperature in Germany has risen. I have recently moved to a new house which is located near my university. Though the previous accommodation was satisfying it was far away from my college and I had to travel around 20 miles which was an arduous task.",
        "Besides, the reduced travel the new house also is recently constructed and well maintained. Unlike, the old house the new one is constructed recently and may not require frequent repairs. The pipelines and drainage systems are built with modern architecture , hence it is easy to maintain. Also, compared to the older house the new one has less rent. The House owner is a friendly person and has promised to receive the rent even in the mid of the month.",
        "The new house has a beautiful ambience. With the garden in the front and a lake on the other side, it has an amazing view. I also have a balcony with a lake view. I enjoy watching the sunset in the evenings from the gallery.",
        "Please do visit my house when you come to Paris on your study leave. Also, bring your professional camera along so that we can enjoy clicking the scenic beauty of my place. Goodbye for now and take care. Keep in touch.",
        "Warm regards,",
