        "Many individuals believe that disclosing information about criminals in newspapers and television has a bad impact. That's why  these forms of communication should be limited to media.  I totally agree with this statement which  I will describe the same in this essay.",
        "To begin with, there are many bad influences giving news on TV and other new channels. First of all, the government needs to take steps by making rules  to hide secret information regarding criminals. However, people can not enjoy their daily routine like the previous day when they hear about bad influences. For instance, if they saw the news regarding a criminal object then they may try to interrupt the police. Moreover, kids are quick learners. They may learn the activities of bad things once these are described on television. As they result, they may try to do illegal actions at home. In addition, this kind of information may alert  other criminals. Although, it is the duty of the police to protect the nation from crime without sharing information with the media because they collect news to share with the public. As a result, it may create violence. Even youth may try to adopt bad influences.",
        "On the other hand, sometimes it becomes necessary to share the important points related to crime. This will help the community to save themselves. For example, disclosed information regarding terrorism then people can save themselves and their other family members. Even sometimes a normal person can help authorities to catch the victim.",
        "To conclude, it is the duty of the media to share information with the general public but higher authorities need to make rules to ban news channels to disclose news related to crime and criminals. Only then it is possible to hide such kind of news which creates a disturbance in the general public."
