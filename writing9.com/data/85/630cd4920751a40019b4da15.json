        "I am writing this letter to inform you that the product delivered from your shop was not functioning properly. Because of that, I would like to return it and I want you to refund me a hundred percent.",
        "I recently ordered a Bluetooth mouse from your shop last week and regretfully discovered that the product was not functioning properly. When I open the delivery box, I found the item in bad shape. The plastic packaging was open, and the cover of the battery compartment was broken. I tried to test whether it is still usable. Although the red LED was lit, it is not functioning at all.",
        "I was really frustrated as I need that mouse very urgently to finish my design assignment which will be due at the beginning of next week. Despite the possibility that I could get a new product from you as a warranty claim, I had to buy a new mouse urgently from a shop near my home because of my urgency as I just mentioned. I will find a spare timeslot in the coming Friday afternoon to visit your shop and return your broken product and collect the refund from you.",
