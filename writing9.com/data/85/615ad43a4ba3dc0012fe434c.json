        "A good leader requires a lot of abilities - management, vision, decision, these abilities can lead those organizations to become successful. While there are those people who believe that leadership is for the elder, some people argue that people in new generation can be a leader too. In my opinion, I agree with the idea that young people can be directors who lead the company to succeed.",
        "To begin with, nowadays a lot of companies have a young director who makes a decision and has visions to compete with other federations. Moreover, there is a role model who has become successful already like Bitkub, for example, a company doing about cryptocurrency, which is regarded as a new generation of  digital currency. Their chief has a  great vision about these digital currencies and thinks about how to earn profit from them because it could be a new investment way apart from Stock Exchange Thailand, also known as SET. While the elder is afraid of cryptocurrency, young people stand on the opposite side because they think it can be a huge profit for them. This has bolstered the idea that a young chief, who has a great vision, can see what other people can not see.",
        "Although a young leader can do good work, there are many  projects which require some abilities that young people might not have such as experience, composure. Most of the senior engineer, who have responsibility about a construction project, is at least in middle-age because this kind of job is an involvement about life, so to reduce  risk as much as possible they have to apply a worker who expert in that case. Even though young citizens can do a great job equally, the owner still prefers to use a senior worker.",
        "Lastly, either young leader and older leader have their pros and cons, it depends on each person to use their skills to lead those establishments in the right way. I believe that young people can be  good leaders and they can do a great job if it is an area of work that they are experts with."
