        "Dear Michelle,",
        "I'm happy you can take care of my parrots while I'm on vacation next week. You can find my door key under the mattress on the patio, and, in case you are uncertain of anything, you can always call me at 1234-5678 or drop me a message.",
        "My parrots are Fischer\u2019s lovebirds. They need fresh water for drinking and body-washing. Grains and millets are to be filled every day. So, you can replenish their food and water in the morning or evening, depending on your free time. As for the bird cage cleaning, it would be great if you could do it once or twice out of the seven days. Just changing the sheet of paper underneath the cage would be enough.",
        "Everything in my house is available to you as you see fit. Just remember to close all windows, doors, and lights before you leave.",
        "Thanks a lot, and much appreciated!",
