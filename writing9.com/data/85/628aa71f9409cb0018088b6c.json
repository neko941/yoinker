It was like a mind-blowing performance. I can still feel that voice base and audience humming sounds during my deep sleep as well.",
        "I basically used to operate the keyboard only, nonetheless, during our last performance I was blessed to be at the drums as one of the drums experts could not able to turn up at our show. At the end of the show, we  played the keyboard and drums together which made us feel proud along with your sweet voice.",
