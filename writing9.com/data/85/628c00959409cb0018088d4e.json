        "I am writing to remind you that the refundable deposit due amount has still not  been received. Despite several emails and phone call failures, I decided to write this letter as a final reminder to get my hard-earned money back and I hope you will pay it back soon.",
        "As per the rental agreement, I had given 30 days prior notice time before vacating my  flat and moreover, I kept the flat very clean without any issues. In addition, during my stay, I have been selected expert cleaning service vendor as per the city guidelines though it was not at all required for my flat since it was constructed 100 years ago.",
        "Therefore, as I have done everything on time as per policy and I strongly believe that I am fully eligible to get back my refund money which I transferred to your bank account  online which may be useful as proof of advance payment. If you think that why should I pay advance money and I am ready to escalate further legal departments if I did not receive my money before the end of this week. Hence, consider this  a final follow up from my end . Please note that if there is any further delay and you may need to pay court-related expenses as well if the situation is out of  control.",
        "I look forward to hearing an update on the payment date of my deposit money.",
