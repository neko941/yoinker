I would like to book a function room that can fit around 30 people, and I want to have karaoke in the room because my friend loves singing. Secondly, I would like to book a singer for that night and the possibility of a girl can sing hip hop song that would be good. Thirdly, I need to order Asian and Western food for them even and must include some drinks.",
        "However, I would like to know what facilities your hotel could provide for us. Also, may I know your Chinese cuisine menu, as I know that you have a new Chinese restaurant opened in your hotel.",
