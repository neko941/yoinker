        "I am writing to let you know that my company offered me a job in the same city where you live. But they want me to move and stay there since my location is so far if I'll drive from here. So, they required me to shift into the apartment they provided as it is part of my benefit. However, I am furious about transferring to another place that I am not familiar with.",
        "Let me explain why I am not sure about the shifting,  first, I am not sure if I can adapt to the weather there since you have winter season and you know that I am not fun of cold and thick clothes although I enjoyed the snow in Korea the last vacation we had.  But I am not really confirmed that I can live there for a long time. Secondly, the transportation you have there is new to me, riding a train made me uncomfortable. Lastly, the common places that I need to visit.",
        "Although I am not confident to transfer there, I am thankful that you are living there. Maybe you can help me to give me tips about the weather and taking the trains. And give me a tour before I decide to accept the offer from my company.",
        "I will wait for your response. Thank you again.",
