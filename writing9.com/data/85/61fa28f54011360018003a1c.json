        "Technology is changing day by day which has a drastic impact on the living style of people. Even though remote tasks are becoming a trend nowadays,  I believe an office environment have more advantages as compared to working from home. I do not believe that the advantages of virtual duties outweigh the disadvantages. In the upcoming paragraphs, I will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of working remotely .",
        "First and foremost, the office climate employees get a chance to cope with others and learn teamwork, which is not possible at distance working. For example, if a newly hired person has some issue then he can ask immediately from the senior employee and get in-class training which is better than online training. So, I believe working together in one place not only enhance  productivity but also improve the quality of the job.",
        "Secondly, job from the room surroundings has a devastating impact on the discipline. For instance, a workplace going worker has a routine that he has to follow to reach the company on time, while the daily routine is totally disturbed if a person is remote. Moreover, commuting persons are more active, disciplined and well behaved as compared to house staying workers.",
        "In conclusion, I would like to say that, even though assignments from home gives a person a chance to spend more time with family,  it has a great impact on their performance and behaviour. As a result, the benefits of working from home do not outweigh the disadvantages."
