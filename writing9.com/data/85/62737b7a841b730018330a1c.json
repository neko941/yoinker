        "This letter is in response to information provided in the article from the national newspaper. The article claims that the first time calculation monument was invented in England but the information is not correct. The first monument was built in India and there are proofs of that as well.",
        "It is situated in Jaipur, Rajasthan, there are huge monuments that calculate time on the basis of the sun. Both the monuments look similar in the way they are built but work completely differently. The one situated in England works on the principle of water. With this, there is another monument located in New Delhi, India. It also works on the same approach.",
        "If the writer of this article or anyone from your team ever gets an opportunity to visit India, then I would like to provide a guided tour of the monuments situated here. And I would also like you to rectify the information provided in the article.",
