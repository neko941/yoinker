        "Education is an important part of all people's growth. Tuition gives us an understanding of how our world is working. While personal qualities and activity experience offer us the possibility of finding a job and doing work properly. At the moment, we can see the trend of directors searching for  specialists with a diploma than life experience and individual skills.",
        "Nowadays, some employers are finding that academic qualification is more considerable  than working practice and personality traits. In my point of view, the reason- patrons believe that if the person does not have a university diploma, then this human is uncultured and unintelligent, which usually is not true. For example, you can not be a doctor without medical education because you don't know how to work with patients or how to do operations. As well, the reason for the changing trend an be in the fact that a or of people are nominated for that job but only a few of them have an educational certificate.",
        "In my opinion, changing trend is a negative development because tuition is not always the index of high accomplishment. Individuals can gain the diploma because of cheating on exams or other several factors. Document of education is not always about self-motivated, clever students. Of course, there are some professions in which people can't exist without academic qualifications. For example, dentists or pilots. Although duty training is  evidence of how a person understands the working process.",
        "In the conclusion, human beings should be educated but, also, have soul experience and a person's strong side is a weighty factor. After all,  employers define what skills their workers should have."
