        "Young people make the decision to spend more free time doing volunteer community work, instead of playing computer games and watching movies on the smartphone. I deeply agree that this kind of activities can definitely help the youth collect many skills, knowledge and experiences, as well as ,communities can also be benefited.",
        "To begin with, local communities need to be aided by young people with energies and sharp minds. Through volunteer work by teenagers, neighbourhoods can do more positive effects on local residents. For instance, in the nursing home, young people can read books, talk about news and walk with the elderly, assist the disabled in pushing wheelchairs. Therefore, this kind of communities is more suitable to live for residents, including those young people and their family and neighbours.",
        "Additionally,  young people are able to avoid more temptations with negative effects when they work for local communities voluntarily. It is obvious that many juveniles prefer spending their leisure time on computers and smartphones without face to face interacting with others. This kind of behaviours may impair teenagers\u2019 psychological health, such as unsociability and indifference. When they grow up and earn a living, they may not able to suit society and to fulfil their potentials. In contrast, doing volunteer works for the neighbourhood will allow youngsters to confront different people and learning how to get along with them, to encounter different issues and gain knowledge and skills to address them.  As a result, It is a positive benefit for teenagers to do unpaid community works.",
        "In conclusion, Contributing effort for the community brings many advantages to young people and helps them to establish their goals in the future."
