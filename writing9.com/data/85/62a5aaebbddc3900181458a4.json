Many of the problems young people now experience, such as juvenile delinquency, arise from the fact that many married women now work and are not at home to care for their children.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?",

        "Nowadays, women are more empowered than twenty years ago. Due to the fact, that they occupy different job fields on a large scale. Therefore, People credit the prevalence of committing crimes among youngsters to their busy working mothers. I disagree with the previous statement. As I believe females can watch after their children and career as well.",
        "Many pieces of research prove that females are multitasked. Because they can manage many processes at the same time. For example, any housewife can cook, do laundry, and watch TV simultaneously. Subsequently, I can\u2019t see any opposition between being a working mother and raising productive good manner children. Besides, the majority of women who work had high education to find proper job opportunities, as a result, they know to raise their offspring on morals and principles.",
        "Conversely, high\u2013percent\u2013of crime countries are the countries where women are underestimated. As a piece of evidence, the level of rape, sexual harassment, and drug abuse is more prevalent in societies  like Egypt, India, and Pakistan, so on. Since these countries are known for having many unemployed women, it is no guarantee that housewife\u2019s children will be better individuals. On the other hand, many greats have admitted the reason for their success to their mother, regardless they are working or not. In addition, the source of all the beliefs and molars I had learned is my mother, although, she work for her whole life.",
        "In a conclusion, currently, women can have any job. It wasn\u00b4t like that back then. Many folks justify the argument of spreading the crime rate among minors to their overloaded mothers. I wouldn\u00b4t say, as I believe in women\u2019s capability of balancing between their careers and raising their offspring to be civilized individuals."
