        "Arguably, art is regarded as a relevant  asset  of communities since it represents  the non-verbal expression of the culture. Personally, I believe  Boys and Girls should  be trained in it. Albeit,  I do not advocate concentrating them solely in it to the detriment of other subjects. This  essay will shed light on both sides of the view  and provide anecdotal evidence to prove the arguments.",
        "On  the one hand, art teaches youngsters  to preserve the culture. In other words,  making offspring know about  art transmits  the communities value to the next generation. For instance, the recent research carried out by  UNESCO showcased the most efficient way to pass information from one generation to another was through earlier youngsters' instruction about the craft and wall paintings  and other sorts of creativities. As a result,  children were the guarantors of the continuation of the knowledge to the newcomers. Moreover, it is the overriding way to transmit acquaintance from one peer group to another.",
        "On the other hand,one subject focusing is detrimental to Boys and Girls. Because of the demand  in  global specialization, the heir should  not regard artistry as the unique way to solve  planet issues, other   disciplines like maths,  physics  and Chemistry  require attention.  In Spain, where  artistry is  considered as  its birth land,  a quarter of the population invest in it to exemplify. However, a significant number of locals are well-succeeded. Hence, the overwhelming majority of them have led astray due to a shortfall of investment.",
        "In conclusion, indeed,  artwork should be taught to children  in earlier stages of their careers so that  they  disseminate  as well as pass it to  another age group. Therefore I regard it as pivotal to the children and  it should be mixed with other relevant disciplines.  In addition,  I recommend the world-ruling power  allocates  art-related subjects in schools for  youngsters' better understanding."
