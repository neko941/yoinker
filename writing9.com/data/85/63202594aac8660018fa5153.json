        "Dear Sir or Madam,",
        "I am writing to register a complaint regarding a small accident that happened in your store. I would also provide suggestions on how such incidents can be avoided in the future.",
        "My name is Jai Vaswani and I stay on 70 Temperance Street, 200 metres away from your supermarket. This happened last Sunday evening when I had come over to buy groceries. I accidentally stepped over broken glass and got a minor cut on my right foot, since I was wearing thin slippers. According to the junior staff on duty that day, pickle jars fell down from the shelf and although the floor was cleaned well, most likely, few glass particles went unnoticed.",
        "I strongly believe that you should train the housekeeping staff to thoroughly clean the floor, especially when it involves glass and other hazardous substances. In addition to this, kindly improve the lighting as I found the entire store was not lit brightly. Fortunately, my two-year-old daughter did not step on it, else she would have been badly injured.",
        "Hope that you will take my complaint seriously and take steps to prevent such incidents going forward.",
        "Yours faithfully,",
