        "Since I have seen this, I have been so glad that eventually, I found an opportunity to get some practical experience in nursing outside my country. Moreover, I will also have a chance to meet and spend special time with a foreign family to observe closely and learn more about their culture, tradition and language.",
        "I think I am perfect a candidate for this job. I have done my bachelor's degree in nursing and have a vast experience of about 6 years in this field. In addition, I achieved the award of \"The best caretaker of the year\" last year from the National Health department because of my responsiveness and decent behaviour. Furthermore, I looked after more than 50 people including from 6-month-old babies to 60-year-old people.",
        "If I get this job I would love to pursue some international course in nursing or do a diploma along with it to grab more knowledge. Besides that, I will join a sports club in my leisure time to stay fit and healthy.",
        "I look forward to hearing from you soon.",
