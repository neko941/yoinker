        "Schools all over the world should make sure that students are being taught not only the theoretical knowledge to improve children's lives and careers, but also teach how to be better managers. With this in mind, it is often suggested that students should participate in managing schoolwork. In my ,opinion this is a brilliant idea for a couple of reasons that are mentioned below.",
        "First of all, when students take part in managing their school, they will become more experienced in organizing a specific structure. In other words, students will gain management abilities that will beneficial for their career prospects. Therefore they will become more confident about their potential and do better on tests and other competitive activities. Japanese education system involves students in doing school-related duties, such as cleaning the class after school. For this ,reason Japan has the brightest students among all other countries.",
        "Moreover, involving students in school management might help to maintain and even improve the school. School is considered to be the second home of children. For this reason, students will give more care about their own place of study and will try to do their best in order to make it better. Again, Japan, as an example, has one the cleanest and most organized schools in the world, owing to the management skills of Japanese students.",
        "In conclusion, children's involvement in managing school can be advantageous for both, student's life and the school, Since it will help students to learn valuable skills and improve the overall state of the school."
