        "I took the cab to go back home from work around half past five in the afternoon.  Initially, everything was running smoothly as usual. A few minutes later, I could see the driver drinking a beer and talking to someone on the phone. I asked him to stop drinking alcohol and he was very rude to me. I was afraid of an accident due to the hectic traffic downtown.",
        "I would like to register a formal complaint against such irresponsible behaviour. The plate number of the car was GA45286, and the date of the incident was on 28th February. This driver should be put under investigation: if he acted this way with me, who is to say that he has not behaved like this with other customers? Alternatively, you can relieve him of his job in order to ensure the safety of future passengers.",
        "I will be awaiting your response.",
