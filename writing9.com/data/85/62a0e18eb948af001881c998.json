Also,  these potholes get filled with water during the rainy season and furthermore create more problems for my family and people living in the locality.",
        "I request you to please look into this issue on an urgent basis as this is directly linked to the safety and wellbeing of residents. I would like to suggest a few ideas which would definitely improve the condition of this road. Firstly, the local staff of the council should do some patchwork on an urgent basis so that it restricts anyone from getting injured. Secondly, a tender should be opened for the  construction of the new road. Lastly, the quality of the construction needs to be reviewed by professional engineers and third party agencies.",
