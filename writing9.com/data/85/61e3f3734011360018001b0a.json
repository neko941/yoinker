        "Nowadays,individuals prefer eating their food item alone instead of eating it with their family.There are myriad reasons behind this like hectic schedule of human beings as well as the introduction of the modern equipment which separates the family members to have their leisure time together.I would like to explicate its destructive effects in the upcoming paragraphs.",
        "To commence with,the first and foremost claim is that in this modern era,every individual who is either young or old are busy in their day to day activities which leaves them less time to spend with their loved ones.In other words,they love eating their meals at their convenience.For, instance a household survey was conducted by hg company which shows that in a family of five, each one of the members is eating their food in their own room which they find comfortable and enjoyable.In addition to it,most of the youngsters, as well as middle-aged group people,middle-aged group people are habitual to the online digital platforms which are the one of the vital reason which separates the family to sit together and have their meals,as they are mostly engaged in watching their favourite TV programs which may not be played according to the preference of the other member.As a result,people usually tend to spend their eating time alone while watching their favourite entertainment program.",
        "As persons enjoy eating their meals alone,there are many negative features that cannot be neglected.Firstly,in most of the cases as parents are busy in their hectic schedule,thus family not having their meal together can develop wrong values among children's.As parents can give moral lessons to their kids which will help in developing a human being.For example in many cases when a youngster commits a crime then it is often said by the people that if their parents would have given them time then it wouldn't happen.Thus,these are some negative effects of not eating together in a family.",
        "In conclusion,I assert that is the negative trend which is been followed by the society neglecting its dangerous effects.There are a variety of reasons like people like to spend their time in their bedroom while watching their favourite tv shows.Ultimately it will develop some bad habits among them which need to be tackled by the elder members otherwise it would lead to the destruction of youth like there are chances that they are often involved in criminal activities.Since parents are not aware of their child's activities."
