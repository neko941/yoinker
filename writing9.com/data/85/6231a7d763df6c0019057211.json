        "Respected Madam,",
        "I'm writing to bring your notice to some problems I've been having at work and  219189 is my employee identification number. I began working here as a part-time employee on November 1st in order to obtain expertise in the magazine sector. I'm pursuing a degree in literature and wanted to gain some writing experience in order to pursue a career as an editor.",
        "I was delighted to be given the opportunity to help this publication in any manner I could. As a part-time employee, I frequently assume responsibility for the material and must obtain copies for review. However, I noticed that the office's xerox machine has been out of commission since last week, making it difficult to get copies on time. Furthermore, the food in the cafeteria is extremely unsanitary. I did advise the department to provide high-quality meals, but it had little effect, and they continued to do so. As a result, I made the decision to bring these issues to your attention.",
        "I'd like to request that you repair or replace the xerox machine, as well as take the required steps in terms of stringent supervision or audits to ensure that the employees are fed high-quality meals.",
        "I sincerely hope that you will be able to settle these difficulties as quickly as possible and to the satisfaction of all parties involved.",
        "Yours sincerely,",
