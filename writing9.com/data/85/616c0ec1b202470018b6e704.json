        "People have different views about the most crucial criteria of an excellent and convenient career .  Some people argue that salary is the main principle element of  occupation and the high income earned means a great post . Personally , I completely disagree with this opinion and believe that there are many main features of a post  that has to be considered .",
        "Firstly, there are several significant elements about choosing a suitable post more than an enormous salary . Safety remains one of the important things  for employees . Even if they getting a high salary , they  have to be protected from the danger existed especially in a difficult environment . For example , persons who work in construction companies may face  various risks which put their lives in danger , therefore, they will feel not secure and that is the reason why many workers avoid this sort of environment. Thus , safety is more important than big wages in some fields .",
        "Secondly , job satisfaction remains one of the major qualities of choosing a career. In other words , employees spend a significant amount of time working , hence, if they feel not passionate and interested in what they do in their employment , they will have negative emotions which can affect their achievement in their personal and professional life . Also , spending much time working without being satisfied can leads to some mental health problems which can be harmful to their health . For instance , many friends of mine have resigned from their work despite having a good wage because there was feel stressed and not satisfied with what they do . That is why job satisfaction is more valuable than salaries.",
        "In conclusion , although that getting an important income is the essential criterion of choosing an occupation , I believe that it is not enough  to be in balance and have a  good life and work  but environment and job satisfaction are more important too ."
