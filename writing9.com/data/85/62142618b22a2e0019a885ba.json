        "I am writing this letter in connection with a possibility to change departments in the company.",
        "Let me start by kindly asking if it would be possible to move me from the department of finances to  operations management. In such a department, there is currently an open position as tech lead of the science team that I would like to apply for.",
        "To begin with, I would like to point out that I am extremely glad to work for your company. However, I feel that in my current position I barely have challenges, so I feel comfortable with my tasks and obligations. As I am aiming for a managerial position, it would be favourable for me to work for different departments, as well.",
        "Finally, I believe that a change of departments would force me to learn about other projects of the group, as well as I would acquire different knowledge. Therefore, this new environment would be more motivational for me to work every day and the company would beneficiate from a motivated employee.",
        "I am looking forward to discussing this possibility in a possible meeting.",
        "Yours faithfully,",
