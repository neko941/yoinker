        "It has been suggested that complete freedom ought to offer to creative artists in order to allow them to present their original opinions in every method they want and artists\u2019 behaviours should not be restricted by the authorities and residents. Personally, I entirely agree with this opinion as this situation not only benefits for young learner\u2019s development but also contribute to people\u2019s understanding of cultural diversity.",
        "First of all, giving enough freedom is beneficial to the creation of every artist, which provides different thinking styles for children. This is because that paintings and drawings produced by drawers flexibly can not be judged by a universal standard. If students study those art products, they will be encouraged to express their opinions in different ways, which inspires them to think outside the box, thus engaging them to build creative thinking. As an illustration, most of the past pictures presented in art classes were created in  freedom. Young art learners are taught to think from different angles by appreciating those artworks, which contributes to young individuals\u2019 better performance in every area.",
        "Furthermore, artists who come from different nations create countless artworks which document their own national culture and traditions. Appreciating those artworks provides individuals with some chances to deepen their understanding of different thoughts and behaviours, which is a good way to raise a sense of awareness of cultural diversity for people around the world. For instance, a significant number of masterpieces, which derive from a free creation atmosphere, exhibiting in the Melbourne Museum present every national culture. Visiting this museum is an opportunity for Melbourne locals to understand cultural diversity.",
        "In conclusion, although people may vary in their opinions about whether thorough freedom should be given to art creators or not. I consider that offering a free creation environment for artists is a benefit for every person."
