        "Crime rate is on the surge around the globe today. In the viewpoint of certain people, minor offenders should not be put in prisons, instead should be engaged in social work as a part of their punishment, while others are of diverse opinion. However, in my view, not all misdeeds are equal and the criminals who aren't a danger to the society, should be given a chance to be rehabilitated. The below arguments will augment my standing.",
        "The main reason for me to advocate community work, for first time lawbreakers, is that not all culprits are born criminals and circumstances often encourage them to commit crimes. To cite an example, if an underprivileged kid steals food from a store, it is merely due to hunger and not because of any wrong intentions. Thus, such offenders deserve an opportunity to correct their mistakes, which can be done by involving them in tasks for the betterment of the nation such as planting trees, cleaning streets or collecting trash. Secondly, if these delinquents are kept in the jails, in the company of murderers or rapists, there are chances of them committing more heinous crimes, once they are released. For instance, a survey conducted in 2015 in the USA, depicted that 90% of juvenile crime doers, who were sentenced to prison, had a hand in the murders or similar acts after being released.",
        "On the other hand, the brutal offenders should be punished harshly to set examples for the society. To illustrate this, if a rapist is sentenced to death, it will instill a fear in the minds of the others, which is necessary to reduce wrongdoings in the nation.  Furthermore, it would not be safe to allow these culprits, to be free, for the sake of safety of common people. Hence, they should be put in the jail houses and efforts should be made to reconstruct their thinking.",
        "To conclude, the aim of the judicial system should be to maintain peace and not to solely punish the guilty. Therefore, in my opinion, the seriousness of the crime as well as the motive behind it should be considered, before deciding the punishment."
