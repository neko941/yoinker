        "As a positive trend for recent years, online learning provides fantastic options for the learners by removing the distances and borders between countries and continents and making it easy for distant people to participate in courses. In my point of view, despite the mentioned pros, they haven\u2019t taken over the lecture halls completely due to some reasons.",
        "On the one hand, with the advent of the internet and expanding it worldwide, talented people from developing countries who did not have the opportunity to apply for prestigious universities abroad  now can take advantage of joining online classes from experienced lecturers. In addition to this, adults who are employed in businesses can pass the courses in their free time as well. For example, in the past ten years, 80 per cent of high-ranked American universities offered quality online courses freely on platforms like Coursera, Khan Academy and Udemy.",
        "On the contrary, due to some drawbacks of online courses the lecture halls are still popular among a vast number of students. Attending these classes, the pupils take the advantage of having face-to-face debates and questions with their classmates as well as their professor. Furthermore, the space of lecture halls with a large number of attendants has a positive effect on mental motivation and engagement in the subject. For instance, some students learn better when they ask for explanations from their classmates rather than reading materials and listening to the online teacher.",
        "To summarize, although the emergence of online courses is a giant step for improving education, they can not take over the conventional halls. I believe the traditional classes have never been replaced by their online counterparts. Hence, it is better to take the advantage of these two precious types of education for different tastes and circumstances."
