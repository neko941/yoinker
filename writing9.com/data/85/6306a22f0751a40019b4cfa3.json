        "It is argued by some that the government should not promote and support culture through its funds while others assert that it could be beneficial if the government is willing to support cultural activities. This essay will discuss both perspectives and in my opinion, I believe that up to some extent government should spend a considerable amount on the promotion of culture but the main motive would be to contemplate other factors as well.",
        "There are people who think that culture should be supported by the government. The main reason is that it will create a sense of togetherness among people rather than living alone. Although it will not directly impact the economy, in doing so the population may participate in pressing cultural activities. In addition, it will help to maintain belongings and boost patriotism. For instance, the government of China spend more amount of money on diversified heritage. As a result, it will help people to participate in colossal functions and exhibitions and sense of togetherness.",
        "However, I agree with those who believe that the government should spend money on healthcare and education. This is due to it is the government\u2019s primary responsibility to accommodate the public with good healthcare functions and an education system. In order to become a well-settled population, it is indispensable for everyone should have extraordinary skills and expertise. To illustrate, the educated population can earn huge revenue and share their knowledge with others. Therefore, it is manifest that the economy of that country will rise.",
        "To conclude, the government should spend some amount on promoting cultural activities, I agree that it will be a significant effect on the country\u2019s economy if the government will spend on healthcare and education."
