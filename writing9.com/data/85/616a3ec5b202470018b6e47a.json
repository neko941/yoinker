        "Nowadays, some people argue , the life expectancy of many individuals is higher . So their retirement maturity from their job should also be increased . According to my opinion , I think that the people's age at which they retire from work should not be raised , I totally disagree with their argument",
        "First and foremost , humans after a certain age should not be able to work effectively . To illustrate , when a person gets old , its efficiency to do a job has been decreased and the younger population will be more effective in doing that jobs as compare to older ones . In addition , it leads to  unemployment . For instance , even though if the old man get to retire from their job , many seats are free for toddlers to join but if they do not retire , youngsters will not be able to get any post .",
        "However, nobody can beat the experience of oldsters . An elder people should have the opportunity to spend time with their family . To demonstrate , nevertheless, a person do hard work in most of their life and do not have enough time to spend with their love ones , they should have right , when they get older then they can be at home with family members . Moreover , they should have a chance to enjoy and collect good vibes in their heart . As they are totally indulged in their trial for whole day and night , they are tensed about their responsibilities , they have occasion to visit their friends and relatives and to be free from all responsibilities and tensions .",
        "In conclusion , although oldsters are not able to task in a perfect way as they did when they were young , they have some point in their growth to spend with their loved ones . I totally disagree with the people's opinion who thought that the youth of retirement should be increased ."
