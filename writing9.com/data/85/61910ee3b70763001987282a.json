        "Dear Stuart,",
        "It seems like ages we have not met each other and time indeed flies quickly. I am very sorry that I had not been in touch with you as I had been terribly busy. I hope this letter finds you in good health. I am writing this letter to you that I have joined RMA Myanmar as Human Resources Manager last two months ago.",
        "Among the facts that the reason why I decided to change the job was I would like to get multinational experiences before my age turns to 30s. Even though there have only two months here, I would say that it is absolutely fantastic and gets incredible experiences working at such a group of companies. By the way, I have to go to Thailand next quarter and will be there for three months in order to attend some training such as Organization Development and Leadership which are organized by the RMA Group.",
        "I wish we two can meet in Thailand and looking forward to seeing you soon.",
        "Yours sincerely,",
