        "The intent of this letter is to address the annoying sound coming out of the living room\u2019s floor of  flat 250 in  the Briarwood building. I moved to this place last May. Unfortunately, it seems like the wooden floor of my living room is detached from the ground in several parts, which leads to an unpleasant noise when we step on it. Last Sunday my downstairs\u2019 neighbour knocked on my door aggressively and announced that the sound is distracting her from studying for her finals. I can totally agree with her.",
        "This problem is getting worse as my dog walks around all day long and intensifies the noise for my neighbour. I would like to ask you to call a repairman to fix this issue as soon as possible so we can solve this inconvenience. I\u2019m home office by the end of this week and it\u2019s totally fine by me if you want to send a repairman during day time.",
        "I\u2019m looking forward to hearing from you to schedule handy man\u2019s visit.",
