        "It is undeniable that teaching young children to understand the difference between right and wrong is extremely crucial nowadays. Moreover, some people think that punishment is a great way to help children to learn and become better in the future. I strongly agree with this opinion and this essay will discuss it.",
        "On the one hand, it is essential to educate kids about right and wrong at an early age because of many reasons. To begin with, youngers might be good citizens in the future if they learn the difference between acceptable and unacceptable behaviours when they were small. Because at that time, they could do something wrong or make some mistakes, then their parents might give them some punishment that makes them never forget. For instance, if a kid steals money from his mom, he may receive punishment from his mom and dad such as doing more housework or not watching TV for one week. In addition, kids who be taught how to distinguish between bad and good actions can avoid committing a crime when they mature.",
        "On the other hand, there is  plenty of punishments that teachers and parents can use to guide their children to go on the right path in their lives. At first, adults can take kids' favourite things away if they do misconduct thing then explain to them why. As a result, younger might feel regrettable about what they did. Secondly, teachers can give time over to kids when they do not finish their homework or cheat in the exams. To give a clear example, teachers are able to ask students to stay in class one more hour after school to do homework.",
        "To sum up, giving punishment to youngers is particularly necessary to let them know the difference between right and wrong, hence, they would avoid risks in the future. Parents and teachers can discipline their kids in a host of different ways as long as they could help their sons and daughters   recognise their mistakes and change themselves in a better way."
