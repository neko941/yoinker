        "Furthermore, I have been trying to contact the branch seeking clarifications on this issue and was highly disappointed by the fact that no one could explain the reasons behind this delay and advise when I can finally receive it.",
        "Could you please review this matter at your earliest convenience and advise me how much longer I will have to wait for the cheque book to be delivered to me. Should you fail to address this within the next week, please be advised that I will launch a formal complaint to the head office.",
        "Yours sincerely,",
