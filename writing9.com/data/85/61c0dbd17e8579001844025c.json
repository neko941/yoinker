        "There is a debate whether a country that buys arts is a waste of resources while others proclaim that it should allocate its fiscal budget in different areas. I completely support the group that believes that countries should not be stoping purchasing arts. In this essay, I am going to illustrate why it is important for authorities to buy art.",
        "To begin with, the main reason why I believe that governments have to purchase arts is that arts consider as intangible assets. Therefore, it will never be a waste of money this is because assets can be liquidated easily. The relevant arts, for example, are considered  a national treasure and countries must preserve their history, heritage, and identity. Furthermore, these days arts could be used in the law of court as  proof for countries to draw their land border.",
        "On the other hand, another reason why I think that the government's official should support the idea of purchasing arts is that art attracts tourists. Therefore, tourism will boost the economy at large and will create jobs in the region. Thus, expanding a museum or preserving a historical area will lead to energizing the businesses around it. Moreover, protecting arts will enhance the country's image in front of the international communities because respect government that archive arts.The sustainable development goals (SDG), for instance, has considered arts as a historical heritage; therefore, if countries could not preserve them, the United Nation will give them an extra hand.",
        "In conclusion, I strongly believe that allocating a country's fiscal budget to arts is admirable behaviour and it will not be a waste of resources because it will protect the country's history and attract tourists."
