        "Due to increasing population, place for houses in cities, is quickly declining. In this condition, the only pragmatic solution is to build homes in the countryside. In the viewpoint of some people, preserving the county areas is prominent, hence homes shouldn't be constructed here. In my view, rural areas should be equally developed like urban areas and one should consider residing in this areas.",
        "Firstly, migration of people from metropolises to country side can aid the progress of the rural regions, as well as decrease the strain on the city's resources. To cite an example, as more and more folk relocates to cities, in search of employment and basic amenities, the burden on infrastructure facilities such as public transportation and roads increase. Reversely, if these people move to counties, there will be new opportunities for advancement for the natives. For instance, if a businessman decides to reside in the village area, sooner or later, he will create employment opportunities for the youth of the region.",
        "Secondly, inhabiting in the rural communities has several health benefits for an individual. For example, as the pollution here, is minimum, one can enjoy the fresh air, which can improve the heart rate and blood pressure of human body. In addition to this, the food in the farm localities, is sourced locally and therefore, free from preservatives. Not only, does this make the eatables nutritious, but also, aids the metabolism.",
        "To conclude, life in rural districts has a number of upsides, which makes it an excellent choice to consider. In my opinion, shifting to the countryside can enrich a person's mental as well as physical health, while crafting chances for the place to advance."
