        "People have several options for punishment. It is argued that the youngster must learn about various rights and incorrect at an early age. I strongly believe that consequences are significant to attain this activity. Thus, it is required for the teenager to think before acting. Accordingly, it will assist them in improving their existence in a successful manner.",
        "To begin with, nowadays the youngsters behave badly due to some bad associations from their school. At school, they tend to behave arbitrarily because they are not directly supervised by their parents. For example, boy students bully classmates who have a diverse range of skin colour. They have no respect for other people and they just do what they want. Secondly, most children in each family tend to adapt by stealing money from their parents' pockets. It keeps happening to parents who don't punish their offspring. The family's children don't know what the consequences of stealing other people's money are.",
        "On the other hand, parents should punish their children for what they did. At a young age, pupils are very rebellious. They do not have much education about what they are doing. If a teenager steals money from his parents at that time the parents have to punish their children. As a result, they can understand what they are doing. However, for the naughty pupils in school at that time the teacher had to give them punishment. For example, if a student was violently treated  someone about the colour of their skin. At that time the teacher made sure to teach what the side effect of violence was. Thereby, it will be more beneficial for the pupils at school and in the future.",
        "To summarize, I think that adolescents do not understand what is good and bad in their early years. Parents and teachers should be required to educate youngsters about the consequences of bad behaviour. And I believe that only mild punishments are appropriate for youngsters."
