        "Dear Mr John,",
        "I am writing this letter to request you to refund my deposit $1800, I paid as security while rending your apartment no. 23. near green land, Mississagua.On the 23rd of October, I called on your landline number and I was told that you are not intended to refund.",
        "When I signed the agreement it was clearly mentioned that the deposit would be refunded after completion of the rental period, which was one year, if the tenant will leave the apartment without any damage as it is when they rented. I vividly remember, there was nothing damaged in the apartment when I have left it.",
        "I believe that you will clearly check the agreement again of which I have already kept a spare copy. It's my humble request to refund my money. However, if we both are not able to sort out this issue, I have to take legal help for a fair solution.",
