My physical health was not good at that time and the doctor advised me some medical tests which showed that I was suffering from Dengue and needs complete bed rest for at least 15 days. I will produce the certificate given by health experts as a piece of evidence to show my condition.",
        "It will affect my scorecard. Therefore, It would be really commendable if you could permit me to appear in the test next week so that I am able to show my performance otherwise my whole year will be wasted.",
