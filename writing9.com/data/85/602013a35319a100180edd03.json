        "Dear Sir,",
        "I am writing to express my dissatisfaction with the sudden increment in my car insurance EMI payment per month.",
        "My name is Gaurav Jain, who purchased car insurance from your company recently. Yesterday only I received an email stating that from the next month onwards the insurance EMI will get increased by 590 reps, which is unfair to the customers and against the policy.",
        "As I already signed some papers before buying car insurance that until 3 years my monthly instalments will remain the same since I have opted for a fixed rate scheme rather than a flexible one. Therefore, I believe there should not be any rise in my monthly payment before 3 years.",
        "I would request you to please cross check the rules of the scheme because I will not be able to pay any additional charges and unfortunately I will be forced to terminate my 3 years bond with your firm. It would be highly appreciable if you can be fully transparent at the purchase time so that other customers will not face any such issues.",
        "I will be waiting for your prompt reply.",
        "Yours faithfully,",
