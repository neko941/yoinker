        "How have you been? How are your parents? It's been a long time since our last meeting. I've recently moved to Almaty. As you know, I had worked in Astana for 3 years, and that was my first job. Making a living as a web developer in the capital was tough, and I had to work like a dog to gain some experience. Usually, when I knock off at the end of the day, I was exhausted. Unfortunately, my previous workplace wasn't ready to pay more. So I made up my mind to land a job in Almaty. Luckily, I was offered a job in a startup.",
        "Almaty is a cosmopolitan city and the neighborhood where I work is buzzing with top-notch cafes and restaurants. I've already rented a flat that is not far from the office. My new apartment isn't as spacious as my flat in Astana, but the view from the bedroom window is tremendous.",
        "By the way, recently I bumped into our classmate Dinara who attended the same subjects at the university. She offered to meet and hang out. Would you like to join us? I would be really glad to meet. Let me know when you can visit me.",
