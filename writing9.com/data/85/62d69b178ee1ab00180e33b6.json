        "A section of society is of the opinion that offenders should be given the same punishments .However,others oppose that situations surrounding the offence should be taken into consideration before punishing an individual.I agree with the latter  because taking individual misconduct into account helps bring about fairness and transparency.This essay  will discuss both sides of  the  arguments as well as my stances in the subsequent paragraphs with examples.",
        "To begin with,one of the most   compelling reasons offenders should be given similar punishments is to serve as a deterrent to lawbreakers.If criminals are given equal punishment ,it prevents wrongdoers from committing  lawlessness.Therefore,reducing the atrocity rate in  society.For example,In Ghana ,the percentage of offences has reduced drastically as a result of punishers being given similar punishments.",
        "On the other hand ,some schools  of thought and I are of the view that  offenders should be punished based on the type of violation they committed  to ensure justice and transparency.An individual will steal a pen and the other will steal a car and if both are punished the same then it is unfair to the government.Hence punishers should be punished based on the severity of the misconduct for the law to be fair to all citizens.For instance,Mr Ekow committed  murder and was given life imprisonment.Conversely ,Issifu stole a cow and was given 2 years imprisonment.This ensures justice for the crime they committed",
        "In conclusion,some parts of the community opine that criminals should be punished equally to stop others from committing an atrocity whilst others and I concord that an individual should be  punished separately based on the severity of the offence to bring about transparency and impartiality."
