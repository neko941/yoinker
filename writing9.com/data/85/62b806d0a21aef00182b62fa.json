        "Dear Sir,",
        "I am writing this letter to put forward my concerns which I faced during my stay at Hotel Cera last week.",
        "As it was your company\u2019s annual marketing meeting, I was invited on behalf of the Tesla group chief and room number 15 was assigned to me to stay at the hotel. Honestly, I was annoyed to see the dreadful condition of my room as the washroom was not clean at all and both the towels and blanket supplied to me were having a very bad odour. Hence, hygiene was the major problem that I faced there.",
        "Thus, I would like to suggest to you that if it is possible, please supervise all the arrangements in person. Because a clean room with a good environment is not only good for members, but it can also increase your company\u2019s image amongst others. I hope you would consider my points before finalising the arrangements for upcoming meetings.",
        "Look forward to hearing from you soon.",
        "Yours faithfully,",
