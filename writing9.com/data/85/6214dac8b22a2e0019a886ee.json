        "Nowadays, machinery eases the process of tasks in the work environment to achieve  results accurately and efficiently.However,usage of machinery significantly increased from past decades in several industrial sectors,hospitals,police departments,communication industries. In the forthcoming paragraphs,  I shall discuss the feature developments of computers and their benefits for  society in a healthy and safe manner.",
