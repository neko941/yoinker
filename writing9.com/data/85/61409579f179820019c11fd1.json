        "There are different opinions about school subjects. Some people think that history is the most indispensable lesson, whereas others like me argue that science and technology are more essential these days rather than history.",
        "On the one hand, studying history give pupils imagination or outlook about their ancestor, culture and confliction between nations. In fact, with this subject, they become familiar with various events and difficulties that people faced in the past. Therefore, students could gain more experience to use in their life. For instance, the war between different countries triggers bad consequences on the population especially children so that students recognize that peace would be vital for each society. It is undeniable fact that all issues and their solution in the past are not the same as today's situation, hence, they will not be functional nowadays. Moreover, adolescents through history would learn about their rich culture and costumes which pass on from generation to generation in order to preserve them.",
        "On the other hand, countries for progress are demanded practical lessons because the world has changed. To keep abreast of the latest development pupils should focus on science and technology. In this way, they could acquire a better understanding of cutting-edge devices, nature and the human body. These subjects are more beneficial for children's future to have a good background when they go to university. for example, students studying more about technology might be interested to work on robots and it makes them creative to make a robot for household purposes as a result in help women in some housework. All in all, for having up to date knowledge these courses are essential as they contribute to broadening youngsters' horizons in order to boost their country later.",
        "In conclusion, I believe in recent times science and technology play an important role in students education life compare to history because they are more practical and contain new information."
