        "In this contemporary era, migration has become a crucial part for individuals and their parent's. Several groups of people are saying, families,should have to go with their children when they are going overseas for working while  some portion of the population is said there is a myriad of difficulties to live with blood relationship. I will discuss both positive and negative sites of a statement in my upcoming paragraphs.",
        "Firstly, moving for employment with their near and dears makes strong bounding. Moreover, individual travel with their closest ones they are not only feeling powerful but also fortifies their weakness which makes them dominant to live in a diverse culture.For example, recently researchers have found that who are leaving alone in other countries they are feeling homesickness as well as suffering from health problems because they are less aware of a work-life balance.Thus, depart with families can create beneficial opportunities for an individual because it makes them solemn on a job as well as in-country.",
        "On the other hand, travelling with wife and children can cause a financial burden in an individual as well.Furthermore, living in another state with someone's would cost for an arm and leg because the person will pay all expenses for housing such as bills, lease and groceries. Moreover individual can not rely on a particular job they will work hard to nourish their families. For instance, recently immigration has moved back some migrants who were not able to deposit their funds and has committed the crime for money. Therefore, the public's are distracting from their path and devastating name of their motherland.",
        "To put in a nutshell, we can be said that, the disadvantage is more rather than advantages so the public should have to take decision accordingly situation."
