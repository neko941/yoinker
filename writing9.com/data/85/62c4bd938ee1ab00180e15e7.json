        "The history of a building can surprisingly reveal much interesting information about it. Recently, it is undeniable that citizens have a quest for knowing the background stories of the places where they reside. In the following essay, the rationales behind this trend will be further scrutinized, and the methods by which people can gain such pieces of information will be thoroughly discovered.",
        "To begin with, there are various reasons that entice individuals to inquisitively search for the stories pertinent to the places they live in. The most important of which is the thought that their houses might be of a significant historical value. This is because if people discover that their residential buildings are historically valuable, they will consider investing in their houses and gain profits. Moreover, a category of people who are of the belief that superstitions exist curiously has the continuous query about the past stories of their homes. An eminent example of this is Upper Egypt where country dwellers hire specialists to dig their homes in order to look for specific mysterious items. Thus, what can be said is that there are a plethora of rationales why dwellers inquire about their homes' past.",
        "Furthermore, those who are interested can search mainly by two methods. first of all, by asking the senior citizens who resided in the neighbourhood for some time. Secondly, they can google their location and find out pieces of information, or search the local public library. For instance, a study commissioned by a group of sociologists, recently, has proposed that the majority of the public digital libraries are essentially occupied by people looking for information about their residential places or the places that they will buy. Therefore, in order that people can reliably find what they look for, they can ask pensioners or google their addresses.",
        "In conclusion, after this essay has manifested the above-mentioned points, it can be reiterated that when people look forward to knowing the past details of their houses, they might discover interesting stuff within their homes, whether these past stories are of  historical significance or imply scary evidence. Finally, it is concluded that elderly people who originally resided in these places can be of  great help; however, researchers might rely on electronic libraries to reach their goals."
