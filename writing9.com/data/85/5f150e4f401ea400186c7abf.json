        "For the past decades, it is obvious that television is thought to be the cause of many people's lazinesses and antisocial tendencies. In some specific extent I agree with this statement, but I still believe that there are many benefits which should be taken into consideration.",
        "First and foremost, the appearance of television brings manifold advantages to human's daily life. For instance, thanks to watching TV everyday we are able to update the hottest and corrected news while we are just staying at home or working in the office. Furthermore, television is an immensely wonderful way for producers to illustrate and spread their work, in other word, this is not only a good method for us to broaden our horizons but also a motivational feature for creators to brush up on their skills as well. Thus, we have no ability to charge TV as an awful invention.",
        "However every coin has its two sides, we cannot deny that many people are avoiding socialising and become more and more inactive and this tendency is absolutely a result of imbalanced schedule and uncontrollable action of a person who is addicted to watching TV. For example, instead of going out or hanging with friends, family members, some people choose to stay at home wasting time seeing everything that is performed on the screen because this action is much easier. So this trend proved that the above statement is an extremely hot potato.",
        "In summary, the invention of TV is fantasy or not depends on how we use it. It means that we cannot charge television as a bad stuff which makes people get worse because we should consider every extent carefully before coming to a conclusion."
