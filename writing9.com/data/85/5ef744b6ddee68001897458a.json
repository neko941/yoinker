        "It is often argued that nuclear devices can create earth peace and give clean energy even if it is does not appeal to you at all. I completely disagree with this opinion and think that it has lots of disadvantages which outweigh the advantages.",
        "First of all, I believe that the invention of nuclear weapons can damage out our environmental system. Even if, some may have great benefits over it, but it has severely destroyed our environment as well as our health. For example, nuclear weapons produce radiation, which kills or sickens those exposed, contaminates the environment and has long-term health consequences including cancer and genetic damage. That is why it is more important to discard these devices which has serious effects of our life-beings.",
        "Secondly, a nuclear war could cause long-term damage to our planet. It reduces our global temperatures resulting shortages of food around the world. In other words, it is not at all useful for the whole world. For instance, nuclear explosions produce air-blast effects humans by rupturing eardrums or lungs. It provides a major terror threat which affects our military systems. So, though it is so cheap to use, it creates so many problems in the whole world.Thus, the demerits of nuclear technology outweigh the advantages for creating disturbances in the whole world.",
        "To conclude, I strongly believe that nuclear weapons do not make any peace or not getting any energy. Rather, because of it only people are more unhappy and more troublesome now-a-days. Therefore, not to use any nuclear devices for better environment, health and security for the people in the earth."
