        "In some countries, parents tell their children that with a hard-working attitude, they will be able to achieve all their goals. In this essay, I am going to examine the merits and demerits of this statement and then express my opinion about it.",
        "To begin with, on one side of the argument, there are people who argue that the benefits of telling children that they can reach their goals by working hard considerably outweigh its disadvantages. Moreover, the main reason for believing this is that it can motivate youngsters to try harder and never give up on their dreams and goals. Furthermore, it is also possible to say that assuring children that they can become anything they want if they continue working hard can raise the level of their self-esteem and make them more confident in life. To illustrate, in my culture, people believe that hard work can only lead to achieving your goals, and this notion has made me never stop being productive in order to be the person I want to be.",
        "Additionally, on the other hand, it is also possible to make the opposing case. As a result, it is often argued that in fact declaring that kids can be successful in their future only by trying strictly can turn them into an idealist who always thinks about being productive and practical without thinking about other aspects of life. In addition, people often have this opinion because they believe that not everything is the result of hard work, but that some goals can be achieved by improving other factors in the child. As well as this, a second point is that this statement raises children's expectations of life and if they fail to achieve their goals, they become depressed and helpless, which can lead to them questioning their power.",
        "In conclusion, I believe that this common saying, which is believed in some cultures and traditions, has its own merits and drawbacks. On balance, however, I feel that the advantages of this notion outweigh its disadvantages. This is because children work more effectively and try harder if they believe that working is the key to making their wishes come true."
