        "It is an undeniable fact that offsprings should be given teaching for their betterment. However, others tend to argue on what basis  this education should rely on. Whether pupil should be thought at home or they should be sent to a classroom to learn. In my opinion, the pupil should be sent to institute for better understanding and this will help them to build good social behaviour. In this essay, let discuss both  views.",
        "There are many advantages for a juvenile to attend classroom learning. Firstly, this will help them to interact with the teacher and other students in case if they face any difficulties in understanding a subject or clearing any question they are unable to grab them soon. Secondly, having  social contact with other pupils help them to build  strong communication and they can be a better team player during competitions. For example, the school has a different project where these pupils can participate with a team. This will help to accomplish the given task with unity and understand the given project more easily.",
        "In contrast, learning at home can be difficult. However, based on the unavailability of the university I believe remote schooling should be a better option. Some students have a better understanding and ability to grasp the teachings more quickly when compared to others. For these childeren home tutution will be convient. For instance, children in Africa unable to attend the academy at a young age due to poverty and the accessibility of the school location. So, these days NGOs have made an effort to supply computer to these children who can complete their higher study.",
        "To conclude, learning is vast and can be learnt from anywhere provided the interest of students to complete their higher schooling in any given location. On the other hand, distraction is available in every environment.And as a parent, one must look at the positive way of making their children keener on learning new things."
