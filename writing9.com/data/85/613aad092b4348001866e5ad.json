        "To begin with, some people believe trying new things and taking risks are not easy tasks,\u00a0so\u00a0they differentiate between successful and unsuccessful people. I personally incline toward this thought for two reasons that I will explore in the ensuing essay.",
        "First of all, new things mean a great opportunity to get new information in different fields or the same field. To become a successful person, there is no way to escape knowledge. For instance, when I was a little kid, I remember that my father used to look at different tasks carefully, such as gardening, cooking, marketing, speed reading, making mini-crafts, and many other subjects. For this, he went for different things, but my mother didn't like his opinion as he was not able to make much money through this. Nevertheless, a couple of months later, I discovered that my father had created a training center, where he taught various kinds of stuff\u00a0to others. After a few days, we found that he really had huge success through his motto.",
        "Secondly, when you take risks, you will give yourself a chance to know a situation in-depth, which will help you generate practical skills. It is not hidden from anyone that becoming an expert in a practical field can give us more opportunities to flourish in an area. My personal experience is a compelling illustration of this. For example, ten years ago, one of my uncles opened his business, and he was quite reluctant to take chances in his trading policy, taking the traditional route. However, he was able to get a survivable profit, but not as a successful one. So, he planned how to make a huge bounty from his business. Later on, he found that he could take a risk by shifting his trade to an online basis. It is worth mentioning that in his area, online marketing didn't take place in its full swing. As a result, he gained new experience and created new strategies, ultimately achieving success. In light of the foregoing, if he didn't take the opportunity and did his work as\u00a0a general trader, then he would not be able to achieve his goal.",
        "To summarize, doing different tasks and taking chances are needed to reaching your goal because it will enrich your skills and give you practical knowledge."
