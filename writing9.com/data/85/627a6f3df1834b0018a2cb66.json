        "It's been a long time since we met last time. I hope you and your family doing well. As you know, I've been trying for two years to relocate my life to Australia to pursue my career objectives. Luckily, I have been granted  citizenship three months ago, and I moved  here last month as soon as the visa is approved.",
        "I am writing this letter to tell you why I am choosing Australia since you are also interested to migrate here. First, the visa process is quite fast and reliable and it does not depend on where did you come from. It is a rare opportunity in this kind of discrimination world. Additionally, the weather here is almost the same as in our country and there are numerous job vacancies that suit us.",
        "Although migrating to a new country is not an easy task, I believe it will be worth it at some point in the long run. I am currently working as a part-timer and getting paid more than my full-time office work there. As far as I'm concerned, it wouldn't also be too difficult to get a job for you.",
