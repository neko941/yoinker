Instead of the pandemic, the journalist should work properly on the area already stated. Furthermore, they really understand about the public interest alike as special themes or topics today, next week and on every occasion. It is very crucial due to the effectiveness of daily data. they explore the artist and politician's scandal and make it  a highlight of the day.

Subsequently, each of us must be careful while reading or assuming a picture or a passage in the newspaper and other public places. Although it is forbidden and not important, these kinds of matters often happened every time. In general, it is really related to us as a user."
