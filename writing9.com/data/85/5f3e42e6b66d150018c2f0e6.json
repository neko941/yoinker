        "Gone are the days when women only live at home and engage in household chores; Nowadays, women are almost working in all sectors. The reasons for this are globalization, higher education in girls and women empowerment. Some people opine that, ladies should be allowed to be a part of the army force while others believe that they are not suitable for these kind of jobs. I partially agree with this notion and reasons for my inclination are articulated in the following paragraphs.",
        "To commence with, women are having better cognitive and communication skills, which is quite helpful while planning for the war. Moreover, from last few decades, women are excelling their career in each and every field whether it is white collar or blue collar jobs such as software engineer, policeman, aviation and sport.  For example, many women now prefer to do become a pilot or police, which are physically demanding tasks. This shows that, they are capable of struggle at borders.",
        "On the other hand, there are many reasons to not offer them at jobs in navy and army. Firstly, they are not as physically strong as men, as these kind of jobs requires rigorously exercise, life saving skills, hard to run and so on. Secondly, they cannot take the maternity leaves while they are at war, and might be not getting proper nutrition on the job while pregnant. Thirdly, these government jobs are mostly transferable, and they cannot handle their children at the borders and while doing war, which ultimately become a reason to ruin their family life. Lastly, they have to take a hard and quick decision, as kill someone, which is hard for women as they have an emotional, loving and caring nature. For instance, it is difficult for women to kill anybody, they prefer to give another chance.",
        "In conclusion, it is true that, women have done various kinds of work, including physically demanding jobs, they should be free to join the army; however, it is tough work to handle and they have to become not only physically strong but also mentally to cope up with the duties."
