        "This is to bring to your kind notice that I bought a laptop from a renowned store of yours. It was purchased 3 months back. And recently I started getting some issues with it. The screen goes black when it is turned on. I searched the internet for such issues and found out that many users of the same product are facing the same issue. I would also like to add that it is still under warranty. (Bill No - XYZ12345) .",

        "This type of issue is not expected from such a valuable brand. As it is still under warranty, can you please send someone to get it repaired? And if it is going to take a long to repair the laptop then please get it replaced as I am not in a situation to wait for long.",
