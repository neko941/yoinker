        "Hi Amy,",
        "How are you? I hope this letter finds you well.  I am writing to thank you for the photos and an unforgettable trip.",
        "I can not thank you enough for showing me your city and landmarks. Last week, I received the photos you've sent to me. Looking at the photos brings me so many happy memories of the time we spent together so vividly.  I especially like the one we took in front of the zoo.  I really enjoyed feeding koalas and kangaroos.  That was such an amazing experience and I will never forget it.  Australia is certainly a scenic country with remarkable landscapes and wildlife, particularly up in the north where you live.",
        "Next time, why don't you plan a holiday and stay with me in Japan next spring? The weather is great at that time of year and besides my husband and I will be celebrating our wedding anniversary. I could take you to see beautiful cherry blossoms and a famous castle. The scenery is spectacular.  I'm sure you will love it.  I'd be delighted if you could come and celebrate with us.",
        "Take care. And I'm looking forward to hearing from you soon.",
        "All the best,",
