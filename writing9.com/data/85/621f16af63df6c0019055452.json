As a result, many multitudes are now willing to visit Gujarat.",

In this ,way we can save the old traditions and Customs which is merged with belief and pass this  flow upcoming populace. Moreover, this is important for the incline awareness in citizens related to the old lifestyle. This is beneficial for improving an attitude towards customs.
