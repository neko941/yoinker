        "Criminal activity is becoming more and more common in the world. With the advent of  technology, some people believe that the crime rate can be reduced. From my standpoint, I am in favour of the idea as it would not only prevent  crimes but also solve them.",
        "To begin with, it could be thought that highly advanced automation has been used in every aspect of crime reduction and has helped in reducing violations. To illustrate more, before the use of sophisticated systems, criminals could change their identity easily and commit more crimes. Notorious activities have since declined as  facial recognition has been introduced by  Google. A recent study, for instance, revealed that in the past decades the chances of atrocities taking place, due to change of personal identities have fallen by 20%. Thus, innovation is preventing the violation from happening.",
        "Furthermore,  advancement in  automation also solves many cases from occurring in the first place. Firstly, sensors and security alarms played a crucial role in stopping crime in homes or banks. For example, heat sensors have been installed in  modern houses for security purposes. Secondly, the online records of the criminals are shared on the online portal easily so that police can catch them frequently. ( Eg- Interpol). Some algorithms are also developed for the security of  governmental data from  hackers too.",
        "To conclude, although from the past decades the rate of violation has decreased due to technological advancements, I believe that advanced technology declines the crime rate by the development of face recognition and solve it by introducing sensors and algorithms."
