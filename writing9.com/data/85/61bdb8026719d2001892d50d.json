        "My name is Steve Smith from Australia. I am writing to you to share the feedback on the cookery course I attended last week arranged by your organization.",
        "To begin, I was excited to join the course as I am always interested to explore different cuisines across the world. To my surprise, the expert chefs taught us so many varieties of cuisines in such a short  time. Especially, I enjoyed the classes on preparing Italian dishes such as Pasta. In fact, I didn\u2019t even realize how the time flew while learning various recipes. I was overwhelmed by the quality and the outcome of the course. I learned many things about food preparation and presentation.",
        "I tried my favourite cuisine which is Chinese. I loved the dishes prepared as they were delicious. I served them to my family and they liked them too. I shared the recipes with my friend who was interested in them.",
        "In future, please try to arrange another course like this with other cuisines that are rarely known but have to be tasted at least once. I hope to hear from you soon on this.",
        "Yours sincerely,",
