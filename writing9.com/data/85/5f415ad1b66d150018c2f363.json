        "It has become a matter of arguing between people about how to spend money on the infrastructure of transportation. Some believe high speed trains between cities should be constructed while others think more investment should be done on transit system in cities. In my perspective, both these investments are necessary and each of them should maintain their own budget.",
        "On one hand, some people believe in investing on fast trains, since this kind of transit is safe and fast. Spending lots of time, people go from one city to other ones for different reasons such as their job or study. This time can be saved by means of high speed trains. Meanwhile, this type of transport is very safe in comparison to buses and cars. For example, in a city like Toronto, high speed trains between nearby cities, transport people faster with no accident. These high speed trains will be the future of transport.",
        "On The other hand, there are some people that think the best way of spending money is using that for the improvement of the exciting transportation system. That is because they believe the main step to reduce traffic in the cities is improving the condition of buses and trains in cities.As a result,by this improvement less people will use their cars and the problem of rush hours will be reduced. Furthermore, this group thinks that public transport in cities is more general than high speed trains between cities an if the money is invested in this area, more people will benefit from that.",
        "In conclusion, transportation system between cities with high-speed trains and public transport inside cities are both important parts in the development of countries and while people argue about which should be prioritized, I believe each of them should be improved and have their own budget."
