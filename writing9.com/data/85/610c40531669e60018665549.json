        "Nowadays, many people hardly find time for  recreational activities due to extended working hours. However, some people opine that long office hours has a lot of  detrimental effects, while others believe that it has some benefits also. In this essay, I will discuss  the pros and cons of this new trend at length in the following paragraphs.",
        "Undoubtedly, there has been  a dramatic increase in the duration of work hours and this new change certainly has some of the advantages. To begin with, the public working for long hours are  definitely benefited from the monetary gains. Besides earning a monthly salary, they are being paid with extra allowances with additional incentives. For instance, doctors working for long hours are paid high along with added increments. Nevertheless spending extra time at the workplace allows understanding the complexities of the task to a greater depth. This in turn helps in gaining professional excellence. In addition, long work hours building our stamina and calibre to work in a stressful environment.",
        "On the contrary, long duty hours takes a lot in term of their health and happiness. Firstly, folk working on  long duties suffer from a lack of  building good relations. Eventually, their busy professional life has a detrimental effect on their personal life. For example, there has been a  high divorce rate among professionals with busy life. Secondly, they barely get time to relax and  it has a deleterious effect on health. Subsequently, they suffer from diseases from a very early age. That is why more and more people are having a heart attack at a young age. Thirdly, they merely get time to socialise and maintain their social circle. As a result,  end up  living a lonely life, which in turn lead to psychiatric diseases. Finally, being busy with professional life, they are minimally exposed to sports, which reduces their physical abilities and makes them working robots.",
        "To conclude, although the long working duration is considered beneficial by a section of society, but disadvantages associated with it cannot be ignored and are always more than advantages."
