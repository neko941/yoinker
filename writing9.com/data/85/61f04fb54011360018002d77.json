        "The first thing I noticed was that the air conditioner was not working properly, in a heat of 40\u00b0C, so soon I was all sweat. I tried to take a shower, and to my surprise, the only available temperature was boiling hot. Although I tried to call the reception and explained everything, the technician took two days to fix it and there were no other rooms available.",
        "Considering the impact of those problems on my job performance was huge, I discussed it with my lawyer and I would like to ask if you could reimburse my money, as I could not enjoy all the benefits I paid for. I emphasize that I will not accept any different proposals.",
