        "I am really excited that you have finally decided to study in Bangalore, India. Although, moving to another country must be really hectic but I can help you with that. You are most welcome to stay at my house until you find a place to say. Meanwhile, I know an apartment that will get empty around that time you come here. If you are interested, I can talk to the landlord. If not, I can help you to find places to move.",
        "While you are enrolled in the university, it is best you find  part-time work that can help with your expenses. I would recommend you to use the university\u2019s job portal website to keep an eye on the latest jobs. Also, you can attend  online seminars about different ways to find and apply for work which is usually conducted by your placement centre.",
        "Also, the most important thing is that while you live here, you would need to learn the local language. If you want to survive here you need to learn this language. It might be a bit hard to learn it at first but then it will get easy. Is it really hard to learn a new language? You can take this class in your institution itself. All the best for your studies.",
