        "In the present age, online shopping is becoming a trend among youngsters in many countries around the world. Some people believe that shops may close because of the ever-increasing online shopping business in major cities. However, I disagree with this notion because I think that some consumers would still prefer doing shopping in the store.",
        "Firstly, shopping on different applications may have grown up in recent times, but some people still prefer visiting shops and doing shopping. This is because some buyers are not comfortable shopping online as the pictures displayed on the websites may vary from the actual product. For example, a T-shirt may look different in colour on a website than when it is delivered at home. In other words, they lag trust on such websites and they choose to visit the showroom to personally check the quality and reliability of the product. Thus, some customers may choose to visit and shop from the store.",
        "Secondly, it has been observed that along with  online shopping, there are online transaction frauds that are increasing in big cities. Customers choose the product and do the payment online, but while doing this, hackers capture their personal information such as card details, password etc; as a result, people are falling for such frauds and losing money due to virtual shopping. For instance, recently while ordering groceries from Amazon.com, I received a message stating my ten thousand rupees has been debited from my account. This occurred because I entered my debit card details on the Amazon website. Therefore, some customers do not buy from online websites.",
        "In conclusion, although some individuals may predict that shops in towns may shut as online shopping is growing, I think that some consumers would still prefer to visit stores because they lack trust in online websites. If customers want to buy a product from a reliable resource, then they should do their research before buying from online sites."
