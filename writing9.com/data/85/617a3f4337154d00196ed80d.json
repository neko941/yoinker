        "Dear John,",
        "I am James Muir, a final year computer science graduate student from the University of San Jose, United States. I am excited to write this letter to seek additional information about my accommodation for the crash course at the University of Oxford.",
        "Firstly, I want to restate that I am enrolled on the course conducted by Prof Jason Bourne about the Influence of Machine Learning in the field of medicine. This session is going to start on 1st January 2022 and last for 4 days - till 5th January. To get accustomed to the weather as well as to get an extra day to communicate with fellow students, I am planning to reach the hostel on 30th December 2021. However, I will be heading back on the last day of the session itself.",
        "Secondly, I do not have any special accommodation needs. I am good with any dorm room that has a bed and attached bathroom. Since this would be my first trip to the university, any information on reaching the premises is really appreciated. My flight will be landing at Dulles airport, which is roughly 60 kilometres away from the hostel.",
        "I am grateful for the support and service your team is providing for the international students. Let me know if you need any additional details.",
        "Regards,",
        "James"
