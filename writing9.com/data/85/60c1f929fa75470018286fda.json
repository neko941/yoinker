        "It is true that capital punishments can protect a vulnerable society from future crimes. While some people argue that death penalties are unfair towards other human beings, others insist that violent criminals should be sentenced to death. In this essay, I will discuss both sides of the argument and explain my support of the former view.",
        "In contemporary society, many countries have abolished capital punishments. The death penalty can be unsuitable punishment for several reasons. First of all, the strongest argument is - people should not decide who can live and who cannot. Secondly, sentenced individuals are not always criminals. Thus, an innocent person can die which is very unfair.  Last but not least, a life sentence is a more relentless punishment rather than a death sentence. To illustrate, criminals would suffer more if they had to spend their whole lives in prisons. Some prisoners long for sooner death.",
        "Alternatively, violent criminals can be dangerous even in prison territories. One criminal can take the lives of several other people. Therefore, it would be more preferable to eliminate future crimes by issuing the death penalty. Moreover, people in prisons are maintained on the government budget. More specifically, taxpayers' money is spent on supporting the lives of prisoners. For instance, these  funds could be spent on improving the infrastructure of cities.",
        "To sum up, both ideologies have relevant advantages and drawbacks. However, I tend to believe that one human being does not have the rights to take the life of the other."
