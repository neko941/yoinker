        "I am writing this letter to give a tremendous review to a restaurant named Mannat which is located on the way to Delhi. I went there last month to drop my younger sister at Delhi airport with my parents.",
        "We stopped by there to have lunch. I ordered Punjabi cuisine with a special Mannat dessert, and I gave them instructions to not put spices into our food as my parents do not like to have much spicy dishes. They followed the same and present it to us. We enjoyed our meal, especially, the dessert was delicious, we never had such a taste before.",
        "Furthermore, the ambience was great, many families were enjoying their meal. They also had a music band which was playing, so people are having fun with their dear ones. We spent  quality time there as the flight was a bit delayed.",
        "I strongly recommend this place to everyone, as I know, that people want to get their food ready as per their taste and this restaurant is good in that, in fact, with your food you enjoy the good music which makes you feel relaxed.",
        "I am sure people will find this a good place to spend time with their friends and family.",
