        "When selecting a job, many people prioritise the lucrative one over the pleasant workplace environment or personal enjoyment. From my perspective, I prefer immersing myself in my dream career to living with the one with handsome salary.",
        "On the one hand, some workers have a preference for profitable jobs as financial is a prerequisite to meet their basic needs. For example, we all need money to pay for housing, food, bills, health care, and education. Therefore, most people consider it a priority to at least earn a salary that allows them to cover these needs and have a reasonable quality of life. If people chose their jobs based on enjoyment or other non-financial factors, they might find it difficult to make ends meet. Artists and musicians, for instance, are known for choosing a career path that they love, but that does not always provide them with enough money to live comfortably and raise their family.",
        "Nevertheless, I believe that other considerations are just as important as what we earn in our jobs. Firstly, personal relationships and the atmosphere in a workplace are extremely crucial when choosing a job. Having a good manager or friendly colleagues, for example, can make a huge difference to workers\u2019 levels of happiness and general quality of life. Secondly, many people\u2019s feelings of job satisfaction come from their professional achievements, the skills they learn, and the position they reach, rather than the payment they earn. Finally, some people choose a career because they want to help others and contribute something positive to society.",
        "To conclude, it is obvious that salaries certainly affect people\u2019s choice of profession. However, I do not believe that wage outweighs all other factors."
