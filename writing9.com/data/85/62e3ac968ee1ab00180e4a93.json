        "Some people claim that taking risks in both professional lives and personal lives is important. As far as I am concerned, whether doing risky things can be advantageous should depend on what types of uncertainty people want to take. In this essay, I would explain why the benefits and the drawbacks of taking uncertainty are of equal importance.",
        "To begin with, taking uncertainty can encourage innovation and creativity when it comes to expanding market sizes. As the community relays on fresh opinions and throughs, people who have the ability to break normal rules may seek  new trends. For example, introducing shoes in a region where nobody used them before may be risky, but it may also have chances to explore a new market. Therefore, taking opportunities when operating new products may provide more opportunities and potential profits.",
        "Nevertheless, financial crises may be caused by taking risks. Since the outcomes of taking risks are not identical, employees may put themselves under threat when they make decisions with carelessness. For instance, investing in high-risk programs can be a waste of capital once the project fails. Moreover, crime rates may increase if potential offenders are encouraged to take opportunities, which may reduce investments once foreign companies are worried about  security. Therefore, both social development as well as personal lives can be affected negatively if taking risks.",
        "In conclusion, it is undeniable that taking uncertainty can help enhance creativity and boost the economy. However, the potential disadvantages, which may be the financial crisis, should not be overlooked."
