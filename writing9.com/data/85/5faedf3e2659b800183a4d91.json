        "Nowadays people opt more to eat ready-made food from a restaurant rather than a healthy homemade dish. However, in my opinion, it is always better to consume self-cooked meals because it is rich in nutrition and the outside foods are expensive.",
        "When a meal is planned and cooked, it is more healthy for everyone having it. Preparing it by ourselves will give us a chance to incorporate all the healthy ingredients into it in a proportionate manner which will provide all the nutrition required for a human body in day-to-day life. For example, planning a particular dish by including the necessary ingredients consisting of vitamins, protein, carbohydrates, minerals and fat can only be achieved when it is self-made. Hence, the food made at one's house is always a better choice to stay naturally fit.",
        "Additionally, purchasing lunch alone every day is quite costly and if choosing it for all other  times of the day, then it will be very expensive for a common man and buying the groceries is a lot more affordable compared to it. Especially, if you trying have a healthy one; for instance, a salad bowl or grilled chicken are sold at a high rate than the other oily and unhealthy ones. Therefore, people must not spend much money on a pre-made dish which can be easily made through the items bought at a less price.",
        "In conclusion, although, people throughout the world these days enjoy having their dinner and lunch at a restaurant , it is always more advisable to prepare it at home as it is way cheaper and healthier."
