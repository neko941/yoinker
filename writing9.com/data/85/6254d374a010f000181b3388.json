        "It is argued by some that there should be restrictions on deadly sports, while others say that it is an individual's right to make decisions. I completely agree with the opinion that these types of games should be made illegal because they can make humans mentally and physically disabled.",
        "The most compelling reason to hold my viewpoint is that they can put someone's activity at risk, a person may become physically disabled or may even lose his soul. This is because of the high-risk factors in these types of sports. For example, last year in USA 13 juveniles lost their life while buzzy jumping. Moreover, these types of sports are expensive too, the community is earning too much by name of adventure. There should be jurisdictions against them to save one's money.",
        "On the other hand, it is advocated by some that they should have the freedom to choose whatever they want. They believe that it's their own life and they are the king of their own kingdom. In addition to this, it's the source of bread and butter for millions of people. For instance, in ,Bali more than 10,000 families  have food and shelter because of the earnings from these types of sports. They suggest that if proper protective measures should be taken then this will be the most drastic experience of their life.",
        "In conclusion, even though these types of events are the earning source for many human beings, there should be restrictions against them because of the detrimental effects on a person's life. Given this situation, it is obligatory that government should take appropriate actions to control these types of  dangerous sports so that the population can survive and can enjoy other sports."
