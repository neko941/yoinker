        "I am writing this letter to show my disappointment regarding the work your team had done in green apartment L10 Floor, last Tuesday.",
        "As agreed upon, I gave the contract to replace the tap of the washbasin and bathtub in the bathroom with a new one. But the work is done below par. The tub fills incredibly slowly. It means either the flow of the water is restricted or the line is clogged somewhere. Furthermore, the tap of the sink started dipping the water.",
        "For this reason, I would request you to kindly send the technician or replace it with a new one as it is in warranty. However, most priority is the replacement of the tap of the sink, it wastes a lot of water the whole day.",
        "Hence, it requires another round of inspection from your team to sort out the issue. Please let me know when the inspecting officer will visit so that I can ensure someone to be at home during that time.",
        "I hope to hear from you at the earliest.",
        "Yours Faithfully,",
