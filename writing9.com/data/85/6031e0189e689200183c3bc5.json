Alternative forms of transport should be encouraged and international laws introduced to control car ownership and use. To what extent do you agree or disagree?",

        "In the past years, there was a dramatic increase in demands and numbers of vehicles. Some people support  encouraging alternative forms of transport and introducing laws to control car ownership and use. From my perspective, I totally agree with the given statement because other types of vehicles indeed can substitute normal cars and it is necessary to control the usage of automotive vehicles.",
        "To begin with, admittedly, there are various kinds of helpful transportation methods that can be used to replace fossil fuel cars. One apparent category is public transportation, especially underground, taxi and buses. The uses of those motors can also deliver individuals to their destinations with lower carbon dioxide emissions. In addition, nowadays, it becomes more common to use electric shared cars, which have  the same function as people\u2019s own motor vehicles with less pollution. Furthermore, bicycles, including the one that uses electricity and the normal one, are beneficial for human\u2019s health when use them to travel to and back from working frequently.",
        "Besides, there should be regulations on the usage of private wheeled vehicles in order to protect the environment. If governments still did not take any actions, the result would be disastrous. For instance, ice glaciers in polar areas would melt caused by a large number of greenhouse gases. I hold a pessimistic view that the community can cope with even a small rise in sea level well. Thousands of people would lose their jobs, homes, and even life, especially in the coastal cities, and the potential of spread of famine and disease would be huge. As a result,  society would be more unstable, and citizens might lose  confidence in the country. Therefore, the curb on the number of cars using is necessary for every nation in order to prevent this consequence happened.",
        "In conclusion, I totally agree with the opinion that other forms of transport should be encouraged to substitute cars using right now, and it is essential to set laws to regulate the usage of motors vehicles."
