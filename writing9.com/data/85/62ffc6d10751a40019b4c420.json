        "I, Priya Reddy, attended a marketing professional meeting held at your hotel on Saturday, last week. I am writing this letter to let you know that I had forgotten a few crucial papers at the hotel after the meeting.",
        "The meeting was conducted in a conference hall on the second floor. I was seated near the exit door , where a cupboard was arranged next to it for the participants to keep their gadgets and other belongings. I am assuming that I might have left the documents in that cupboard , where I placed my mobile as well as the bag containing the papers. Although  I collected my mobile after the meeting, I forgot to pick up my bag. Those papers are extremely significant for me as they are having all the data I gathered  for my current project work.",
        "I would like to request you, to allocate someone from your team to have an in-depth search in the conference hall to find my papers.",
        "Looking forward to hearing a positive response from you.",
