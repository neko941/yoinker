        "Dear Michael,",
        "Thank you for warmly welcoming me and arranging a wonderful vacation. The friendliness of your family members is overwhelming, and I greatly savoured the scrumptious food cooked by your mother during my stay. I should especially thank you for the dinner you arranged on the last day of my holiday.",
        "I was a little dizzy after a couple of brandy shots I had with you after dinner, and when I was back in my home, I realized that I have left my wallet on the dinner table. There should be around $2000 in the purse in addition to my driver's license and credit cards.",
        "Luckily, my sister is returning tomorrow after visiting some of her friends, and she will pass your house on her way. I have asked her to drop by your place to collect the wallet, and it will be a great favor if you can send it over with her.",
