        "Few of the organizations have made it mandatory for their employees to wear a uniform during duty hours and this trend has some merits for both employer and staff. This essay will firstly, discuss the positive effects of a dress code on a company and secondly, its benefits for workers will be analyzed.",
        "To begin with, organizations are adopting the policy of homogeneous dressing on-premises and it helps to boost the brand image and discipline of a company. To explain further, having the same dress code for all of the staff creates the work atmosphere of equality and discrimination is avoided as all of the employees have the same appearance regardless of the position and income, in addition to that, it is an advertisement stunt at a minimal cost. For example, Atlanta Marketing solution has been known for the disciplined work environment after it made compulsory for the staff to have a uniform. Moreover, in many, situations it reduces the cost of the company while increasing the safety level of the workplace where there are machines, fire exposure or sharp tools in use.",
        "Along with the above-mentioned benefits, there are positive aspects of this trend in the workforce as well. One of these benefits is about the reduction in the expenditure on clothing items as casual dressing leads to allotting a separate budget hence increasing the cost of living. For instance, my friend spends a lot of money on buying dresses each month just because his office mates do the same way. Besides this, it keeps a person motivated and passionate about the job because of a homogenous working atmosphere which in turn could help a person grow better regardless of appearance.",
        "In conclusion, wearing a uniform in the workplace has several pros both for the organization as well as employees in terms of productivity, marketing and savings. Additionally, it proves to be a saviour in numerous situations with extreme work conditions by increasing safety."
