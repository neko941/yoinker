        "I work in a bank.These loud noises from his flat don\u2019t let me sleep peacefully at night, therefore, I wake up late in the morning and get late for the office too. Moreover, I feel sleepy in the bank owing to not having  sound sleep.",
        "I want to give my suggestion to curb this situation.You must talk to this new inhabitant and ask him not to play sounds at high volumes , if he cannot amend this then the glasses of his windows must be replaced with soundproof, consequently, no voices come out from his accommodation and will not harm our beauty sleep.",
        "I will appreciate it if you take the necessary action urgently.",
