        "Nowadays, young folk tend to study on e-book rather than old design paper books. Some people believe that they should start reading from the printed book than e-reader meanwhile other parties are the opposite. This essay will discuss  both views and in last, I will give my personal opinion on this statement.",
        "On the first-hand side, juveniles should start learning  to read from traditional paper the reason is that it is very convenient for them to catch information from textbooks. For example, manual books (some kinds of book special for children) has got big handwriting and quite a clear picture which make them take information quite easily and quickly. Furthermore, teenagers can retain visual information in their mind for a long period of time so it is undeniable fact that young people should start to learn reading from hard copies.",
        "On the other side of the coin, in fact, it is also undeniable that e-readers are very effective for learning not only for youngsters but for all age groups. Because of innovation in technology, nowadays electronic booklets are available in different versions such as  video so if adolescents can see and hear at the same time it helps them learn even more quickly than papers or copy. But sometimes electronic gadgets might be very expensive so children from poor families can not take an advantage of this.",
        "In conclusion, this essay discussed  the convenience of hard copies of text and the effectiveness of electronic editions. In my opinion, both books have their own value and similarly plays an important role in teenager's learning and reading process."
