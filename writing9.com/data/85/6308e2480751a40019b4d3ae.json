        "Dear John,",
        "I hope you are doing well these days.I had interesting and enthusiastic moments Thus I want to narrate my last moving adventure. As far as you know I had a dream to buy a house upstate instead of living in an apartment in a crowded city.",
        "To begin ,with me and my wife were saving money to build up a proper budget for our dream house for many years. Finally last month we saw a property ad while surfing on the internet. After examining the whole details we really expressed and called the dealer in an instant.For the next ,day we scheduled a visit to see it in place. At the first ,look house seemed extremely old.However, the inside of it was renowned by the former landlord.",
        "Our residence has 4 rooms, a wide kitchen area, light-well living room on two floors. The garden has a quiet enough size pool and a cosy area for planting vegetables. We really loved the place and after some, bargaining we deal and bought it.",
        "Now,I am desiring with all my heart to invite you and your family to wine and dine. I guess it could be a short holiday for you accordingly.Then we could have fun together.",
        "I am looking to hearing from you as soon as possible",
        "Best wishes",
