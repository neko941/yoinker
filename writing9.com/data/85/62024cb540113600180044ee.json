Some psychologists claim that the basic reason for this is that children these days are not getting the social and emotional learning they need from parents and teachers.\n\nTo what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?\n\nGive reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience..",

        "To begin with, Kids are in a great place now, when compared to the previous generation. They have  greater exposure and knowledge. They are mostly broad-minded and Quick-witted than their parents. On the  other hand, the wide area of information they are exposed to can also pose danger to their well-being at times. We'll discuss this further in the below essay.",
        "Firstly, Children need emotional and social comfort from their parents, otherwise, they might involve themselves in unimaginable problems which may be disastrous to their life. In earlier days, the Mother will stay at home and watch the activities of her kids and ultimately had a greater grip over the child's movements. Nowadays, since both the partners are working, children are mostly left unattended and are free to do whatever they want to. Similarly, teachers are not strict as before and they don't have a personal connection with the younger generation. For example, they don't converse with the students outside the classes and involve in their personal development.",
        "In addition to the above, Media content is spoiling the innocent perspective of the little ones. For instance, a Netflix series I saw recently had a lot of inappropriate content with substance abuse, alcohol consumption, violence. It is greatly famous amongst the youngsters and can affect them in various ways. Social media is an incredible tool to express our feelings, thoughts and ideas, at the same time, it can seriously alter our happiness and lead us to several crimes. Therefore, it is crucial to have  control over what we are learning and teaching our sons and daughters.",
        "To conclude with, I deliberately agree with the opinion that children these days are not getting enough attention and advice. This surely needs to be addressed with caution before it leads them to a bad future."
