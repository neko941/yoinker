        "In recent years, youngsters are being a part in most of the crimes in society and some people argue that parents are giving importance to work rather than taking care of their children for these problems.I would argue that,while parent's are responsible at some point, there are other factors should  be considered.",
        "Firstly, the majority of the people becoming workaholic give a chance for their children to get trapped into problems.This is because the father wants a quality education for their kids and a better lifestyle.For instance, according to Times magazine international schools are expanding in city as professionals wants their child's upbringing in a good environment.If the children get less parenting  in their teenage, then it would create a greater opportunity of being misguided in an early stage.",
        "However, teachers and friends are equally responsible for the teens going on a wrong path  and encountering issues in their surroundings.The reason for this is they spend most of the time in schools and with their companions.To illustrate, more than 80 percent of young criminals are due to bad company and less educational background.Moreover, the part of teachers is no proper monitoring the behaviour of their students, particularly the age they get easily allured by bad habits  should be taken into consideration.",
        "In conclusion, although the parents should be more concerned about the activities of their teenage children, there are also some other facts such as teachers in school and type of company they involved might be equally given the importance of the social issues carried out by teenagers."
