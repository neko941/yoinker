It was a month-end seminar, and I had to present it in front of the entire staff of my college, including the dean, vice-president, and my guide. Therefore, I needed to deliver an excellent presentation.",
        "The manual was like an angel in disguise to me. All the topics and definitions were so simplified, and I did not have to search anywhere else for other resources or references, as everything was there in the book, and I can not thank you enough for this. As for now, the presentation is over, and I want to return the book to you, so let me know whenever you are available, I shall come over to hand it over. Thank you once again.",
