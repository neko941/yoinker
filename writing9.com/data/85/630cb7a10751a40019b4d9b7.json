        "I am your next-door resident and writing this letter with regard to bringing your attention to the problem facing the high loud  music all late night. I would like to inform you this situation is absolutely disturbing me and probably other neighbours by all means.",
        "Firstly, of course, as you enjoy listening to music in your apartment is fair. However, the loudness was too high, therefore I could not fall asleep in time. As I require having to get up early in the mornings approximately 6:00 am. Sleeping is not enough,I can not concentrate on my duties at work properly. In addition, I am worried about my health as well which might be affected by repetitive sleepness nights. I desire you suggest some solutions for instance, while you listening to the music turning the volume %50 down besides using headphones could be  a solution either.",
        "As a result, I wholeheartedly believe that you would be taking some actions to provide against this appaling issue otherwise I should report whether to apartment management or citizen official at all.",
        "I am looking forward to your helping me",
        "Yours Faithfully"
