        "It's been argued that animals should have the same rights as  humans do, on the other hand, some people think it will be better to use them as a subject for medical tests which, as a result, will keep the population wealthier.",
        "In my point of view, wild creatures are very useful for human life and all world's future because ,without experiments on fauna, human beings won't have therapy results as we have at this moment. In other words, society made  huge progress as a result of experiments on species , consequently, we can do  better progress with these kinds of testing. For instance, nowadays we have a large amount of medication that saved somebody's life, besides, scientists still didn't produce  medication for  cancer. Therefore, it will be much harder to create it without testings on animals.",
        "On the contrary, there are a lot of beasts dying respectively to scientists' investigation. Species  should be equal to human beings since we all are living on the same planet. In  different words, we all have the same options and it's not fair for animals that society has an opportunity to control wild creatures. For example, hence medical development, there is an extinction of some types of fauna, therefore, it affects all flora and other aspects of natural life. In my opinion, it is cruel to lead nature to that point and the crowd should control their actions.",
        "To conclude, there are  advantages and disadvantages in both points of view, nevertheless, experiments on species can lead humans to  enormous progress, thus, we all should  deal with the drawbacks."
