        "Dear Mr Smith,",
        "I, Priya, working as a technical team lead at your organization.I am writing this letter to complain about the garage issue  we are facing on regular basis.",
        "Firstly, the parking space can accommodate only 50 cars , whereas there are approximately 150 cars owned by the employees. Unless we pay 10$ , the parking personnel was not allowing us to park the car on the 2nd floor . Secondly, We don't understand how can an employer build a parking space for 50 people when there are more than 200 employees. Though we were informed earlier, that for employees , the parking fee will be deducted from our monthly pay. However , we were compelled to pay the parking fee on daily basis.",
        "Finally, It is crucial for you  to resolve this issue as soon as possible. Moreover , there was  havoc every day in the garage space , because of  the frustrated employees. In fact, they were upset that they had to pay the double price, in spite of paying the fee on monthly basis. Furthermore, I would like to advise that there is  vacant land near to our office space , where all our employee's vehicles can be accommodated. Therefore, If you could talk to the folks , who manage that land for some chargeable amount, we all can be benefited from that .",
        "Looking forward to hearing from you immediately.",
        "Yours sincerely,",
