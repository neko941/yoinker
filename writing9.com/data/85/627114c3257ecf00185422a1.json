        "My name is Cole, I just read a piece published by Global Travel, writing that Fuzhou is a beautiful city in the north of China, which I think is a wrong description. As a mother town I grew up, I know it is located in the southeast of PRC.",
        "The Global Travel magazine is a famous and popular publisher I like, so as to most of the young generation. I recommend it to all of my friends.  If we don't correct the mistake in the writing, It will be confused by most of the readers who live in China and will mislead travellers who want to travel to China.",
        "Though the item has been published, however, I still reckon that we can do something to rectify the wrong information, such as publishing another note to claim the mistake, or we can modify the correct information on the website homepage.",
        "I look forward to your respond",
        "Regards,",
