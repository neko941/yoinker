        "The wildlife is the amount to recreate the disappeared species and nature. Most people are in view of saving the modern world from an environmental crisis, and to transform the new ecological diversity. Whereas, the other people focus to prioritize health-related factors to be looked at first. In this essay, I will discuss both valid concerns and my opinion.",
        "In this wake of global access world, the ecosystem is the main reason for affecting the environment badly. There are numerous species we noticed that are on brink of extinction. The alarming fact, though is a major part of the loss that occurred over the last decades. For instance, the Indian Sparrow Bird is disappeared for we hardly come across this chirpy bird of late. In addition, the Indian Cheetah went extinct for quite a long time. Although, the Government have taken measures to introduce the Cheetah project from Africa to India.",
        "On the contrary, while dealing with basic environmental hiccups as  Air Pollution is increasingly appeared to be a major challenge for society to live in. Although, the environmentalists have different projects in the queue to implement and improve the air index. For instance,  the recent survey conducted by the MoEFCC on Air Index declared that India is a country that is highly polluted after China. In similar, there is water pollution which is also listed as one of the challenges for the community but nothing transpired so far.",
        "To sum up, the modern world has limitless environmental issues, and the Government is required to be aggressive to restore various ''bioindicators'' species that reflects the healthy environment. However, this should not compromise the other disasters like breathing problems the most our nation is facing due to climate change."
