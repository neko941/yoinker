        "You must be really excited about moving to Sydney. How are all the preparations going? In your letter, you ask if I\u2019ve got any advice about how to improve your English before you leave. Well, I\u2019ve given it some thought and here are a few tips.",
        "Firstly, speaking is probably going to be the most useful skill so, if I were you, I\u2019d try and speak  English as much as possible. And I think you should do a short, intensive oral course before you go too if you have time. I wouldn\u2019t advise you to buy one of those language courses on CD though because they\u2019re expensive and you don\u2019t get the opportunity to interact with other people.",
        "Also, for your listening skills, you should tune into English language programmes on television and radio whenever you can. Also, don\u2019t forget that lots of Australian, British and American websites have audio that you can listen to, so I\u2019d make the most of the Internet if I were you.",
        "Finally, browsing the Internet will also help extend your vocabulary, but you ought to read books, newspapers and magazines as well. You\u2019d better get a good English-English dictionary too. I don\u2019t think you should throw away your bilingual one, but only use it when you really have to!",
        "Well, I have to get back to work now. If you need any more advice, don\u2019t hesitate to get in touch.",
