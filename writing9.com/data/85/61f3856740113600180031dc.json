        "In modern society, there is a wide range of lifestyles. Some think that watching sports in one's free time is just a waste of time. As far as I am concerned, spending time on leisure activities is important in terms of having a quality of life.",
        "The first aspect to point out is that watching sports gives people excitement which will lead their life more lively. Individuals cannot predict the result until the match finishes and there are many events that occur during the game. Therefore, some may into watching sports activities for the sake of entertaining themselves. For example, the public needs to work hard under the pressure from the community since they have many responsibilities. Thus, some would watch a sports game as an opportunity to de-stress. If one can refresh their mind by watching sports, it will beneficial for them when it comes to maintaining their mental health.",
        "Another important issue is that visiting a stadium to watch a game has another positive point. The audience can unite while supporting their team although they do not know each other. As a result, they can make new friends through their hobbies. For instance, individuals can understand each other the feelings about the game during the match. Additionally, they may go out when they have free time if their relationship becomes tighter. Having new friends gives people an opportunity to explore new knowledge and experience by going out with them which will make their life more valuable.",
        "To conclude, from my point of view, watching sports in one's free time is vital for the public because this activity brings excitement and joy to individuals. Consequently, it will make an individual's life more lively."
