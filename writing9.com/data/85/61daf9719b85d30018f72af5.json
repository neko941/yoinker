        "Let me explain, my jacket was of silver colour and the brand of it was GUCCI. It was a fancy jacket and was close to my heart because it was given by my husband to me on my first anniversary. It happened on January 8,2022 when I  came to your theatre for watching a movie with my bosom friends and I was seating in hall two in the second row and my seat number was 50. As I remember I kept my jacket on the back of my seat and I thought it was on there or on the floor near my seat.",
        "As I said my feelings were attached to it. It's my humble request if you find the sweater with aforementioned description please either you inform me via my telephone number or I will visit here within two days and I will contact you about it.",
        "I will look forward to your quick action.",
