        "Dear Sir or Madam,",
        "I am writing this letter in connection with the cookery course I took last summer and to make suggestions for further classes. I believe it is in your best interest to hold better courses.",
        "Actually, I have enjoyed taking part in the Italian food course  very much. The reason why I had a great time was mostly because of our professional tutor whom I learned has high-ranked restaurants both in New York and Rome. What amazed me the most was the state-of-the-art the art equipment each class is provided with.",
        "I have been cooking different Italian meals ever since and the one that I master is bacon spaghetti. I have made various scrumptious pizzas and my family is super content with my cooking lately.",
        "anyway, I would like to offer some suggestions on further courses which I would like to take part in. If it is possible, I would like you to have a pastry course especially for Turkish sweets such as baklava which is one of the most popular sweets all around the world these days. I am sure if you offer a wider range of classes, the Academy will continue to run profitably as more students you were able to attract.",
        "This is all I would like to share with you. Thank you for taking the time to read this letter.",
        "Yours faithfully,"
