        "I hope you are staying safe during the quarantine and every member of yours is fine as well. Anyway, the reason I am writing to you is that I\u2019ve found a cool website. Do you remember you\u2019ve told me that you would like to learn how to do pull-ups? So, I was surfing on the Internet and bump up on the website named \u201cSpartan\u201d, which is dedicated to fitness and related topics such as techniques of different strength exercises and workout programs. As well as this, there are various meal plans depending on a goal, if somebody wants to gain weight or lose it.",
        "Thus, I reckon that it would be useful for you because you can follow a specific program for your back muscle, and finally, you will be able to perform pull-ups. Speaking of which, I\u2019ve already started to do exercises from the website and it is obvious that my pull-ups technique is improving rapidly. Therefore, I advise you to look it through.",
