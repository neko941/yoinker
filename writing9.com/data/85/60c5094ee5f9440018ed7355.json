        "It is generally argued that  certain crime needs fixed penalties or flexible ones. both arguments should consider in fairly and this essay will be looking at both side and I will give an opinion on it.",
        "On the one hand, people  argue that standardized punishment considering more advantages than disadvantages. The main reason for this way is more efficient, transparent  and easy to manage. Moreover, it is clear the judgement procedure and penalties to everyone in the society and people will consider those before take any illegal steps. For example, today everybody knows what are the penalties for parking. ,Also this system is fair for every person in the country without any categories like ethnicity, gender or race.",
        "on the other hand, it is often believed that every crime should be considered separately by the justice system. Many people pointing out most crimes could happen without any intence and this should enter the transparent justice system and must stand accordingly to follow the suitable procedure to solve each case. For instance,  these days very common of stealing good from supermarket and groceries, reason of these are feeding families. ,Also most crimes, like murders happen due to reason of self-defence. So our legal system must consider  all factors and another side of the story.",
        "In conclusion, people are debating  which is suitable for our legal system fixed or flexible punishment. I believe every justice system in the world must consider and follow the different procedure for each case before giving punishment."
