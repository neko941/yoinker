        "The first thing I would like to tell you is that I wanted grey colour cabinets in the kitchen . In addition, In one bedroom we wanted multicolour lights for a special occasion.",
        "I would greatly appreciate it if you could change the cabinet of the kitchen because black is not matching with walls of the kitchen. Also,please could you fix  different colours of lights in a bedroom since my  children do not like white light in a room. Furthermore, a tap in a kitchen is not working properly. We  did not get hot water from it. So, please could you check this issue.",
        "I would be thankful if you could come this weekend because at that time I will be at home and we will review everything and fix it.",
        "I am looking forward to hearing from you.",
