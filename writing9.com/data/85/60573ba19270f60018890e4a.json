        "There is a contentious debate about whether schools should reward students who demonstrate top academic results or the ones who improve. In this essay, I will explore both opinions and explain why I lean towards the latter.",
        "On the one hand, a sustainable and continuous demonstration of the best academic results is admirable. Such a scholar attitude shows that a certain student is, indeed, a hard worker.

Moreover, there are plenty of stories illustrating that individuals who have struggled at the beginning of their careers are most likely to succeed as they are aware of downfalls. For instance, it took some unfruitful trials with various new ideas before Bill Gates has built his Microsoft empire.",
        "In conclusion, some people might believe that it is more important to reward the ones who are continuously great. However, I think that encouraging students who stood up and improved after failures"
