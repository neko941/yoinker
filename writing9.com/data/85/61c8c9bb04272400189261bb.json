        "Dear Mr Jones,",
        "I am writing this letter to seek admission for my son who is seven years old to your prestigious institute.",
        "My family and I will be shifting to Boston from Texas by next month. We have rented a lovely duplex house in the Middle Valley neighbourhood which is two kilometres away from your academy; therefore, I was hoping if you would help me out with the admission procedure.",
        "Firstly, my son is a professional Chess player at a national level. He represented his previous school team in the junior class and won many awards in multiple competitions. Secondly, he is an intelligent child who can solve high school mathematics; thus, his principal at Texas institution promoted him directly to sixth grade. In short, I would expect him to continue his academics from the same level and if required, the administration can take an entrance test to check his intellect and place him in the right grade as per the result.",
        "Furthermore, he loves to play basketball, enjoys a healthy debate and is a confident speaker on-stage. I have heard positive reviews of your academy's sports coach who was a specialised basketball player during his young age. My son would be honoured to learn some skills from him at your school.",
        "I would greatly appreciate your help and look forward to hearing from you!",
        "Thanking you",
        "Yours faithfully,",
        "Mrs Bhatt."
