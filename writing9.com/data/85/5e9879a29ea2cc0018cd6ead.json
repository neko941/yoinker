        "In the recent few decades, free health service is the most conspicuous trend in today's world. Not only this service extends human life expectancy, but also gives moral boost for better standards of living. As such, there are both merits and demerits for this trend. In my view, all the countries should have mandatory health services free of cost.",
        "Firstly, providing cost less medical treatments will reduce financial burden on low income people and acquire treatment on a wide range of medication. Moreover, the right to equality will be implemented and every citizen will be treated with similar facilities. For instance, Australian citizens get a Medicare card for their country citizens to get basic health treatments with no charge. Needless to say, many people will be benefited by cost free medical services across globe.",
        "Secondly, another pivotal aspect is that the government can reduce the burden on modern medical treatments by eliminating taxes on medical treatments. However, the government can enforce tax incentives on costly medication or tax exemption on medical insurances to improve declining mortality rate. For example, many developing countries are giving tax exemption to encourage people to take an insurance policy to reduce financial burdens. Hence, a collective approach from the government and the country residents can make free treatments achievable.",
        "In conclusion, every country should consider free medical services to every individual and help reduce declining death rate. If needed the financial institutions can play key role in this aspect. Finally, the role of government is too dire to ignore."
