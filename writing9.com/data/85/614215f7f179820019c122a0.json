        "The question of whether scientific research should be carried out or controlled by governments or private companies has become a matter of debate in recent years. From my perspective, I strongly agree with this opinion and this essay will give further explanations.",
        "On the one hand, it is true that scientific study can gain many benefits from being carried out and controlled by private organizations. Firstly, these companies can offer more practical uses of utilizing those kinds of studies. The reason lies in the fact that private organizations do that thing in order to improve their profit, as a result, they have to make the most convenient way to apply those research into people's life. Additionally, personal organizations also are considered as a more beneficial way for scientists to gain a better salary. Specifically, these companies have to offer high wages to researchers owing to the competitive rate in this market is increasing considerably.",
        "On the other hand,that governments make and control scientific research also bring about several significant benefits in many aspects. First and foremost, authorities can form those researches ethically to a right way. They are people who know what should be studied and what should not be. Besides, governments can allocate more financial resources than private groups. This leads to bigger effectiveness and activeness of scientific research.",
        "In a conclusion, although private companies which control and do scientific study is advantageous in some ways, I believe governments doing that is more just and beneficial in the long run."
