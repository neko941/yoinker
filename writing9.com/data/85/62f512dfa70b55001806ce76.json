        "To begin with, I would like to thank you and your team for tutoring students with so much patience. In addition, I never faced any difficulty because your teaching methods are really helpful for me to easily understand. Moreover, this makes me improve my creative thinking on how to add the ratio of the ingredients. I believe I will have a great opportunity in the future after learning a wide variety of cuisine in your school.",
        "Since the completion of my course, I have been cooking every day and was searching for a job to use back my cooking skill. I am glad to inform you that I recently got an offer as  permanent staff from a Fell Caf\u00e9 to assist Chef.",
        "Although the course was undoubtedly perfect, it mostly focused on teaching the preparation of main-course meals. It would be great if you could add a complementary starter and a sweet dish-making course to the original one.",
