        "I am writing to express my interest to help you with the household work. I work for a restaurant and will be on holiday over the next summer. Thus, it would be a good opportunity for me to spend my free time.",
        "To begin with, I can help to clean the house and the garden, too. Also, I am quite good at painting, so if you have any walls to be painted I can get it done for you. Moreover, I am a decent cook, therefore, I can also prepare some meals for you to keep over the week. Further, I usually like to keep myself occupied, and since I live alone I do not have much work to be done during the holidays. Hence, I think it would be great to spend time lending you a hand.",
        "In addition to the above, I will be available during all five weekdays, unfortunately, on the weekends I travel to see my parents who live quite far away. Therefore, if you think that I am a suitable person, do write back to me.",
        "Thank you for your consideration.",
        "Yours faithfully,",
