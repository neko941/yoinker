        "Certain persons feel that people who work in the entertainment industry are paid more than they should be. In my opinion, I agree with this perspective. This essay will discuss the reason for my rationale and also mention a job that I think they should be paid well.",
        "One reason why I totally agree that individuals in the entertainment industry are paid too much is because of this job's contribution to the society. I think movie stars, singers and football players do not contribute positively to the society, nor do they make a positive impact on the economy. Instead, all they do is entertain jobless citizens and help others in wasting their precious time. For example, a comedian makes close to a hundred million dollars for a 2-hour comedy session, just for making people laugh. Also, his counterparts in the soccer world are paid ridiculously high salaries just for playing on a pitch.",
        "However, it is my opinion that jobs that directly improves lives and impact humanity should be highly paid, such as a biomedical researcher. For instance, in recent times, there has been a pandemic, which led to loss of jobs, deaths and left hundreds of thousands hospitalised. Amidst all these, our only hope is a vaccine, that is currently being researched by biomedical scientists. Availability of a potent vaccine gives us back our lives and eliminates the social restrictions currently in place. Thus, in my opinion, I think the work done by these individuals is unqualified and has an extremely high value in the society; hence, should be highly rewarded.",
        "In conclusion,  some people are of the school of thought that people in the film and sports industries are paid too much. I totally agree with this notion and I explained the reason for my point of view in this essay. In addition, I also highlighted the kind of job I believe should be highly paid."
