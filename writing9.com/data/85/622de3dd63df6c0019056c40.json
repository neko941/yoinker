        "Nowadays, there are more adolescents than adults in certain countries. Personally, I believe this situation offers more benefits because young people are more productive and healthy as opposed to the older generation.",
        "First and foremost, having more young ones than adults means a more productive nation. Unlike adults who are usually frail and meagre in strength, the younger individuals are full of energy and thus able to perform more than them. Today, most of the wealthy countries have a higher population of adolescents because these contribute to the output of the nation more than the other group does. For example, The United Kingdom is known for its strong economy on the global market due to the fact that young people contribute greatly to make this possible. This is why it is advantageous to have a country's population full of such-like ones. I too fully  concur with this notion.",
        "Secondly, young people contribute to a healthy and strong nation. Today, it is a global problem to spend more money on healthcare ,especially for the elderly, yet with the majority of the population being that of  adolescents who are fit and healthy, any country can stand strong healthwise with very little expenditure on health. For instance, in a survey conducted on the benefits of having a healthy  and younger generation, it was determined that a youth helps in halting the spread of infectious diseases since he possesses a very strong immunity. Therefore, young people are a precious gem to any country especially if they make up the majority of the population.",
        "By way of conclusion,I reaffirm my stance that it is more advantageous to have more young people than adults because they contribute to a healthy and productive nation. Hence, it means fewer expenses for the government."
