        "In recent years, the question of whether people should invest more money in doing more research about space has become a public topic of discussion. Although the trend is not without disadvantages, the upside can justify these.",
        "On the one hand, there are a number of benefits that people can obtain from space exploration. First, due to overpopulation nowadays, the need to find new planets for humans to live is strongly emphasized. For example, since overpopulation happens as an emerging issue and natural resources on Earth are gradually exhausted, people should use more budgets to find new planets before human comes close to the verge of extinction. Second, learning more about space will not only help us to acquire more knowledge about our planet surroundings, but it will also allow us to prepare for potential hazards. Therefore, anticipating the dangers that the Earth will encounter will help the governments and scientists to find solutions to protect human lives in the long run.",
        "On the other hand, the possible drawbacks of space programs should not be overlooked. Firstly, it is true that these campaigns require an extensive amount of money. In fact, spending a large amount of money on this aspect might come at the expense of other necessities since they may receive less funding from national budgets. Secondly, astronauts and scientists who were sent into space might receive exposure to natural dangers. For instance, radiation that comes from the sun is a constant danger to astronauts in the space since it is the cause of skin cancer, thus, it will act as a hindrance for them when returning to their daily life.",
        "In conclusion, it is evident that exploring the universe might bring both advantages and disadvantages. Hence, it is advisable for the government and scientists to take everything into consideration before sending people into space."
