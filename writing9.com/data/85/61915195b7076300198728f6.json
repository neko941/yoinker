        "How are you doing today? I am writing to invite you to my son's birthday next week Tuesday. Dimeji, my son, is turning 6 years old, and I thought it would be a great idea to have you around. What do you think?",
        "So, the event will be held at the event centre with a white billboard directly opposite my house; you can't miss it. As I mentioned earlier, the party will be taking place next week Tuesday by 5pm in the evening. We will be having outdoor grills, bouncing castles, and lots of outdoor games for the children to play with. Also, we will be having some stand-up comedians and mascots to cheer the children up. It's going to be a fun-filled event I tell you.",
        "Finally, I must say that we will be so delighted to have you around. I had a prior discussion with Tolu, my wife, on this topic and she specifically wanted you to be around. Therefore, you can take this invitation letter to be a special invitation from Tolu to you, but through me.",
        "Till I see you next week Tuesday at the party, keep fit.",
