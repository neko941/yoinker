        "It is true that people now are suffering extra tension and difficulty. There are numerous reasons for it but, they can also be solved. This essay will address both  topics.",
        "There are a plethora of reasons for the apprising of stress among people. To begin with, most of the individual have a sedentary life, they do not have to do any physical work. They do not get enough body movement for releasing negative energy. Working continuously increases the load on the brain that leads to tension. Another reason is that  the world is moving fast and everyone is competing with each other, there is a race of coming first. In this chaos, humans have lost mental peace. Even at home, the demands of the family is rising like a rocket. Children on the other hand have their own problems due to the stress of studies and career.",
        "The solution could be various depending on the type of stress and how the person is handling it. Firstly, People should take a break from their regular routine and, go on vacations as an escape from stress. Secondly, it has been proven that  people who take care of their health have more mental peace than  others. For example, going for a walk, doing exercise, laughing are small things that can brighten your day. Thirdly, help other people in winning, competition is not always for one person to win . Sometimes playing together and winning is less stressful than running alone in the race of life.",
        "To conclude, there are causes that can be eradicated to make life happy and simple."
