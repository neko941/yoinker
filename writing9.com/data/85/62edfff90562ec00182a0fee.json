While others believe that there are several best paths to depict love to them . This essay will discuss both  views . And I will discuss my opinion in further paragraphs.",
        "To commence with , in the cutting-edge era is  a trade to give stature on  occasions to show love for them . To explain it , in the present climate every masses like to want  competence on occasions . talent is the source that makes attraction towards them . For instance ,  attending any party or matter surprise must be essential  during days . Without any , surprises they do not enter  the incident . Hence , when  folks give much quality on their birthday then they get satisfaction .",
        "On other hand , for some , masses it is not a good way to show affection towards them. They think of other numerous ways of showing affection  like existence in the story . To illustrate , some masses think that existence is the biggest surprise to give than any gifts . Although , existence is must essential for events ,not talent . For example , if we send the gifts without our existence  there. So it is not good . So all the masses think very negligently and in a negative way .",
        "To sum up , competence is not the happiness of we get a lot of ability at the circumstance but do not get any respect so that is not worth it for us ."
