        "I am writing this letter with regard to the lack of parking space available for the company's employees and the inconvenience caused by it.",
        "Since most of the employees commute through their private vehicles, there has been a shortage of parking space on the company's premises. While the next parking space is available at an extremely far distance, most of us have to travel again through cabs or auto to reach back at the office. Additionally, the area is unsafe, and because of the lack of security, our cars and bike have been damaged. For instance, yesterday, one of my colleagues, Mr.Shahid, was mentioning about his vehicle which got towed last week, and also the expense, he had to bear was enormous.",
        "However, even if we commute through an alternate mode of transportation, it turns out to be expensive and time-consuming. Because of this, we are not able to arrive at the office on time. In addition to this, the constant trepidation due to the shoddy parking area lowers our concentration at work. Moreover, it is practically unsafe for female employees to commute at night if they don't have a personal vehicle.",
        "If I may, I have a few suggestions, for example, increasing the number of parking allowance for the company's employees. Furthermore, a security guard allotted in the parking area would be very thoughtful. I kindly request you to resolve this matter and take action favourably.",
        "Thanking you for your consideration.",
