        "Hope you and your family doing well. I really felt very happy when I saw your letter. I am happy to come to know about you are planning to learn a driving class which was a wonderful idea. It's really necessary when considering the recent situations. We don\u2019t wait for a cab or someone\u2019s availability during emergency situations. I still remember that last year incident of your father\u2019s emergency situation you are struggled because of this. I recommend that Malar driving school is one of the famous schools in our region. You can go there and they can train you well.  They will assist you based on your availability and they support you to get a license also. I personally suggest you  be aware when you start learning. I know about your father\u2019s own car. Don\u2019t take that till you get a license.",
