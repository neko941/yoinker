        "More violence content in the media and the lack of correct guidance from parents are to blame for kids and young people all around the world. There is a punishment which should do to prevent of crimes.",
        "Nowadays, teenagers are particularly susceptible to attack in media content and might care from media disturbance if their emotional well-being is ignored by parents. For instance, television sometimes encourages aggressive or event disturbance behaviour among young people, and children would tend to take to attack when they face problems. Furthermore, parents pay more physical condition and attention instead of psychological situation of their children. This is particularly the case for single parents to take responsibility while having a full-time job. If parents fail to guide their emotional children, it is possible for them to feel refused therefore take revenge on society.",
        "In addition, the authorities should consider regarding about retribution to young offenders into account. Looking at more specific, teenagers who commit minor crimes like pickpocket might be punished a relatively short, and they will retrain for new skills in rehabilitation facilities. On the other hand, for those who carried out severe crimes ought to get hard sanction such as a long prison and depend on their range age. This is because they should understand that victims are the things not to do wherever to stay.",
        "In conclusion, a frequent exposure to attack on the media and parental neglect are two contributors to increase the trend of young crime. The government should take action to reintegrate teenager criminals into the community and carry out punishment according to the severity of crime when they are free."
