        "Dear Mr Singh,",
        "I am writing today with regard to my scheduled meeting tomorrow with you in the conference room. Although the schedule is for business development,  here I want to discuss several other issues as well which I will be  discussing tomorrow.",
        "Since it had been approximately 7 years of my service with this organisation, I feel overwhelmed by the wonderful opportunity that I had received in this firm. Being a  finance manager, I took the finance and accounts department to  phenomenal  heights as the profit of the company at the time of my joining  was just $250 million, however, it had  increased to $570 million by last year. Though it was  teamwork, being in charge of the said department, I feel honoured about it.",
        "Well, I would like to suggest some alterations in the finance department. Particularly, the computers are becoming obsolete as they are approximately 10 years old, besides this, the windows in all these devices are outdated and as per engineers recommendation,  these devices need a replacement. So I recommend the replacement of these gadgets for the benefit of the whole organization.",
        "Moreover, since I have been working for the last 7 years, I have not been provided with training in the Management field. As I would like to expand my skills , hence you are requested to kindly arrange me with the same. So that I could help the organisation to flourish more.",
        "Hope to hear a positive response.",
        "Yours sincerely,",
        "Katherine."
