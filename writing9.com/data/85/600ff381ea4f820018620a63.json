        "With the advent of the internet, knowledge sharing and accessing the information has become effortless. Subsequently, it has become feasible to know the happenings around the world. Also, the demand for online shopping is increasing enormously rather than purchasing in the shops directly. Furthermore, online social networking sites like Facebook has brought the different countries together whereas, before the development of  technology, people had rarely a chance to meet each other.",
        "On the other hand, there is no safety of the information which in turn poses a huge threat to the community and the individuals. Especially, the advertisements posted on the websites is a key factor to steal our data. Cyber-bullying has become a recent trend nowadays , to which many politicians and industrialists fall prey for it. Indeed, Malware attacks are the biggest security threats to  businesses on social media. In addition to that, the installation of numerous applications in our mobile phones would hack bank details and passwords with just a click.",
        "To conclude, the internet has produced a huge impact on the security standpoint nevertheless it has made human life easier. It is the onus of the individuals to be aware of the phishing attacks in the world. Extreme care should be taken care while clicking any new advertisement or during the installation of a new application in smartphone"
