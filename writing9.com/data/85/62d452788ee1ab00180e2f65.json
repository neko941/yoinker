        "I am writing in response to the latest received letter. It mentions that I must acknowledge the receipt of my new bank card, whereas I have not received it previously.",
        "On Monday the 12th, I did get a pouch with an envelope from the BNP Paribas Group. The envelope was with my name mentioning the pin code, address and my bank account details. However, there was no credit card inside which I have previously purchased and the edge of the envelope was damaged. I am highly concerned regarding this issue, it is critical for me to get the card in immediate order and I am afraid of possible fraud to my funds.",
        "I would appreciate your assistance in resolving this case and I demand the card to be blocked and send to my home address this week. If that is not possible for some reason, I assert an instruction with explanations of what will be done and a description with further steps that should be done from my side.",
