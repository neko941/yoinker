With the help of social ,media he communicated with many people all over the world. It gives him some mental relaxation and also he gets updated news.",
        "Secondly, even though there are so many advantages still there are some disadvantages also lying there. If they share their personal details with an unknown person who is not in good character then that will create serious problems in their life. For instance, My friend's daughter makes one new friend via Facebook. Later the unknown person posts some personal pictures of her on  social media and it creates more trouble.",

In conclusion, There were more advantages outweigh the disadvantages when folks communicate with each other even though there is no possibility to meet them."
