The envelope from the bank was in my letterbox, it was not handed over to me directly by the courier company. It was clearly stated in your email, that it should be only handed over when a valid ID is shown. But unfortunately, it could not happen.",

        "I request you to immediately block this card and investigate, how the courier company could be so careless to leave confidential documents in letterboxes, even when it is instructed to hand them over to the recipient. Also, send me a new card and please make sure this time it is handed over to me directly.",
        "Looking forward to hearing from you at earliest.",
