        "Firstly, I want to introduce the book that I read last week named, \u201c Diyunuwe Ran Doratu\u201d which was written by professor Daya Rohana Athukorala. It is a great book that describes lots of positive thinking ideas for personal development.",
        "Even though  I am working in the health sector, I am not aware of my and my family health before reading the book. Also, if I get more than enough salary, I couldn\u2019t achieve some saving targets. But, after reading this book, there are lots of guides to complete savings and how to look forward to our family. So, it was a brilliant book which was changed my mind the most.",
        ",Also I personally know, there are lots of people who look forward to getting some guidance on their personal development and task achievement. So, I highly recommend that book for those who are willing to have a bright future.",
