        "I am writing this letter to express my concern about the recent shifting of my new house.",
        "As you know I have been living in my previous residence for 10 years which is comprised of only two rooms but since I got married that became too small for us to live. Moreover, the sewerage system was getting awful day by day and there had always remained the blockage problem in it. Furthermore, the surrounded area near my accommodation has gotten too populated and congested, as a result, the streets got narrower and I was facing the parking issue as well.",
        "Now I am shifted to my new residence, which is way bigger than the old one. It is newly constructed and well-furnished and has 3 bedrooms with attached bathrooms along and a huge lounge. In addition, the kitchen is well-designed and fully equipped with fancy furniture. Also, there is a small garden in the backyard which has different kinds of plants. Last but not the least, there is a separate place for the garage where I can easily park my car.",
        "It would be a great honoured for me if you come and stay for some days at my place. Besides that, we will have a small party when you arrive and will do lots of shopping together.",
        "I look forward to meeting with you soon till then take care of yourself.",
