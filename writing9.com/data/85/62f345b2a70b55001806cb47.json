        "I am writing to bring your attention to the difficulties that we are currently experiencing with the local bus service.",
        "To begin with, let me explain what are the problems. First of all, we have an issue with the reliability of the service. There is no proper timetable, and some buses get cancelled out of the blue. In addition, these buses do not have comfortable seating facilities, sometimes we have noticed there are not properly cleaned.",
        "Secondly, let me share one of my own experiences with you, so I hope would be easy for you to understand how the locals are suffering from this issue. A few days ago, I was asked to come to City Council at 10am for an interview. Hence, I went to the bus stop to take the bus at 9.15am to reach Council on time, but it suddenly got cancelled, and I was unable to go to that meeting as well. Luckily, the interview panel agreed to reschedule my meeting. If it did not happen, I can not imagine how much I get lost.",
        "Finally, I would admire it if you can conduct a full investigation to identify the problem  and publicise the outcomes as well as the plan to preventing happening  in the future.",
        "I would appreciate your immediate attention to this issue, and I look forward to hearing from you.",
        "Yours sincerely,",
