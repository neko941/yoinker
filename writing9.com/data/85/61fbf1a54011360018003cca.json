        "Dear Rob,",
        "I am glad to hear from you again. Hope you and your family are well. I heard that you'll be going to a camping holiday for the first time this summer. Have you chosen a place yet? If not, I'll recommend you a place called Angel Island which is located in southern Thailand.",
        "I'm sure that you'll be thanking for my recommended place. The island is so beautiful and the water is so clean. Although there'll usually be a lot of people during summer, a dozen of good spots you still can choose for camping along the island. Moreover, at night, you can easily see panorama views of the very clear sky from the beach. You'll never forget that views.",
        "I'd like to remind you something as well. It is about mosquitos. Whatever insects from this island are so huge. Therefore, do not forget to bring some lotions for mosquitos, and also some tablets to prevent from catching a cold. So windy at the beach especially during the night.",
        "I still have a lot of work to clear. Otherwise, I'll go with you on this trip. If I've got a chance next summer, I'll probably camping with you there again. Hope you enjoy your camping trip on that island.",
        "All the best buddy.",
