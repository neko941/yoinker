        "Hope you're doing well. I'm extremely glad to know that you've decided to learn to drive. As I attended the driving classes and learned it a couple of years ago, I would like to enumerate a few points regarding the same.",
        "I've personally benefited a lot from self-driving, it's really pretty useful to visit places where ever we want independently. It has gained me a lot of confidence to handle any issues in public on my own because of travelling individually to various localities. Moreover, it could also be used as a mandatory Identity card in a few documentation procedures.",
        "I would strongly recommend you to join 'Modern driving school', located near the Sathyam theatre. The staffs here are friendly and hospitable, we could pursue the classes with great comfort as the timings are also flexible.",
        "Once you start attending the classes, you should observe all the minute details while the trainer is performing. Apart from this always carry your documents wherever you travel and initially drive slow by following the traffic rules strictly.",
        "All the best.",
