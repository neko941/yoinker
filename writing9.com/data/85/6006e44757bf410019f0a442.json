        "There is a common tendency for a multitude of countries to allocate their financial resources to support unemployed people. While this is a beneficial movement for those humans, it could drastically affect societies, as well as state organisations. The following essay will examine this impact and I will also explain why I completely agree with these statements.",
        "To begin with, from a human's perspective, the main factor which detracts from the positive aspects of such a tendency is the fact that it limits the possibilities to develop other significant social institutions. To put it differently, the enormous amount of money, which is given to people who are struggling to find their job, can be allocated to health or educational systems, as from my point of view, they have a higher priority for many countries. As a case in point, recently, in Russia, the government has decided to alter the distribution of financial resources by reducing the budget for the construction of local educational establishments and consequently, increasing the same for organisations, which provide unemployed people with support. Thus, it would potentially entail the complications with available places at schools for a variety of children.",
        "In addition, by giving money to unemployed people state organisations would encourage them to stay in the same social position, and it could aggravate the economics of countries. In other words, each government has to obtain the required level of income in order to maintain a stable economical situation. To illustrate this point, there is a pressing issue nowadays in the USA, as the staggering number of people would not like to work, but the state organisations will provide them with the necessary financial resources. As a result, a million people do not pay their taxes, and the country's budget is slightly being reduced.",
        "In conclusion, we are all too familiar with the movement to aid financially unemployed people within many countries. I strongly believe that it occurs the pressing problems for governments and societies, as it stops the improvement of other valid sectors and exacerbates the financial situation of countries."
