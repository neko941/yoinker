        "My seminar topic was Implantology and the comparison between guided and modified Implant placement techniques. It was a month-end seminar and I had to present it in front of  the entire staff of my college including the dean, vice-president and my guide. Therefore, it was crucial for me to deliver an excellent presentation.",
        "The book was like an angel in disguise to me. All the topics and definitions were so simplified and I did not have to search anywhere else for other resources or references, as everything was there in the manual, and I can not thank you enough for this. As for now  I am done with my presentation and I want to return the book to you so let me know whenever you are available I shall come over hand it over. Thank you once again.",
