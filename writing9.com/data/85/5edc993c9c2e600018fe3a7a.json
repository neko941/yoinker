        "International organisations such as WHO and World Bank offer aids to developing nations in order to support their developmental plans. While some people advocate that financial assistance is important, others talk in favour of practical aid and guidance. In my opinion, both measures are required for the sustainable growth of these countries.",
        "Those who are on the side of financial aid might argue that the developing economies are always in dire need of monetary support. This is because a substantial amount of money is needed to achieve the objectives, and they do not have sufficient funds to accomplish them. For instance, recently, WHO gave one billion dollar grant to India to fight Covid-19. If these types of grants are not provided to these countries, then it would be difficult for them to cope with these situations. Moreover, these economies have a more poor population and thus they need huge monetary packages so that they could provide necessities to these people and to grow.",
        "On the other hand, those who favour practical assistance and advice say that most of the times, money does not reach its destination. The reason is the higher corruption levels in these countries due to which bigger part of the funds go to the pockets of corrupted politicians and officials.  For example, UNICEF, an agency for children's welfare has its vast volunteer network in African countries to resolve child labour issues. Furthermore, expert guidance would always help in making clear plan to carry out projects effectively.",
        "In conclusion, it can be fairly said that financial aids would help developing nations to pursue their plans; however, technical support and advice would assist them in overcoming the difficulties. Therefore, I opine that both measures serve their own purpose and needed for the development of the nations."
