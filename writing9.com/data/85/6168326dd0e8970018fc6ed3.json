        "Many undergraduates were educated in educational institutions in their own country one century ago. In the present, they have the possibility to study overseas. There are merits and demerits for students. I am inclined to believe foreign universities provide many opportunities for graduates.",
        "Nowadays, a lot of pupils prefer to study abroad rather than in their own country. It is related to the fact that many academies offer many advantages for graduates, for example: if a potential student passes exams perfectly, he or she will get free scholarship and citizenship in the future. Also this opportunity allows graduates to feel the international education system and different lifestyle. Based on my experience, changes and possibilities provided by foreign countries and universities can change a student's life totally in a positive way.",
        "Meanwhile, there are disadvantages, some scholars can not get used to another life\u2019s tempo. Moreover, students have to face difficulties that they can not endure. According to the magazine \u201cThe International student\u2019s lifestyle\u201d, approximately 30% of students have to return to their country. This is related to various pressures they faced during the education process. For example: my brother studies in the university of engineering and computer technologies in Moscow and he said that some of his classmates had had lower grades in final exams and had to change the university.",
        "In a nutshell, abroad scholarship has many merits and demerits. Foreign universities' lifestyles offer a lot of possibilities. Potential alumnus will have to adapt and be ready for many difficulties due to the pros outweigh the cons."
