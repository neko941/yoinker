        "Some areas in the U.S. are prohibitive about teenagers getting out after a specific time at night. Although they can still go out accompanied by an adult, this regulation can be considered strict, especially for the younger. As a result, this rule is very debatable and extremely different points of view could be observed. I honestly prefer to ponder the detriments and benefits to reach a conclusion.",
        "A good aspect of this regulation is the safety of the teenagers. For example, it is common in many countries (not just in the U.S.) that some teenagers tend to be rebels at some point in their life, and parents may find it difficult to control their activities and time. Furthermore, I suppose that having a local restriction can help them to teach their children and keep them safe at home.",
        "However, despite the good aspect mentioned before, this type of regulation being imposed by the government could seem exaggerated and unnecessary. Parents shouldn't be too strict with their children and should allow them to commit their own mistakes. Moreover, I believe that the decision of allowing them to go out and making a time restriction should be a decision of the parents and not the state. In fact, this could even stimulate the dialogue between parents and teenagers, and strengthen their trust in each other.",
        "In conclusion, while I understand that having this kind of law could be beneficial in some aspects, I support the idea that each parent should have the responsibility to take care of their sons and daughters. The imposition of such restriction is not only unnecessary but sometimes even harmful to teenagers in an emotional way."
