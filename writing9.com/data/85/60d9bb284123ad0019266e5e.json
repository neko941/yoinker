        "There is no doubt in this present world studying in different countries are constantly on the rise. Some people argue that learning outside has major goodness than in his/her country. In my opinion, studying abroad has many advantages than their disadvantages.",
        "The main advantage is that the expertise they often bring back. To illustrate this in Saudi Arabia students tend to learn outside the country to complete their bachelor degree or further postgraduate degree as well as language education. For instance, in 2010 there were more than 200,000 who were got a scholarship and they came back now to assist for nation development. Furthermore, not only expertise that brought out as well as, it will change the person mentally. To be more precise, when someone changes his or her environment definitely,  it will affect the way of thinking. As a result of this, there will be educational, medical, and law development.",
        "Another argument is that will have a greater impact financially. To be more emphasis,  Saudi Arabia spent more than 4 billion dollars on tuition as well salary given. Subsequently, it will cause a budget imbalance. Moreover, learning abroad has a huge effect morally. Because of different environment will has a role to person behaviour. For example, when a teenager goes out of his or her home and family to live with others. Therefore, adolescent behaviour will get worse.",
        "In conclusion, despite the fact that studying in other pleases have a negative impact on money expenditure, governments should invest in their citizens to educate wither inside or outsides. Thus, will exploit minds and experts."
