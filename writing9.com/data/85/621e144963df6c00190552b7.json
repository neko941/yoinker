        "Nowadays, a lot of people seem to think that train is a more effective way to travel compared to driving yourself, especially for long journeys. As a result, governments are being pushed to break the bank and invest more in the railways rather than improving the roads. I agree partially with this but the benefit of developing the roads should not be overlooked either.",
        "First of all, I have to disagree partly, as land travel by cars, buses, and trucks are still needed. For an instance, opening highways and roads will help the people around those main roads economically. They will be able to set up shops and open places such as restaurants or merchandise stores that still attract passerby. On top of that, travelling by car is preferable when we are accessing more remote areas that are not reachable by trains.",
        "On the other hand, putting our money on enhancing the railways will help to create a more connected urban planning between cities. The ones who will profit the most are the passengers that move around frequently and needed to be somewhere else far as fast as possible. This will also leverage the logistic companies that look to move their goods in a more cost-efficient way as trains can carry a lot more weight compared to trucks with a cheaper budget.",
        "All things considered, I believe we need to improve both ends. Railways and roads are essential for every stakeholder present and we don't have to just choose one. I advise the people in control of the budget to allocate accordingly to make sure both can still serve the customers in the long run."
