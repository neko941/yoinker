We must ensure that everyone has the right to express over electronic devices. For instance Twitter, Facebook etc. Undoubtedly, one of the benefits of this is that they are capable to share knowledge and create a healthy atmosphere among the country. The government should handle these media networks with utmost care.",
        "Secondly, there is a rising demand in these sectors due to Smartphones. There is a great risk where the government share responsibility for the citizens. The countries are more likely to a security issue at a great level due to personal data stored on private servers. Since developed nations have always been far ahead in terms of privacy and safety, For example,a telephonic authentication, an email verification of the user who spends a long time on media networks. Sharing personal information with somebody is a very risky game.",

However,  awareness and alertness to play a vital role to divide responsibilities. It is clear that there are a lot of things to get our requirement done quickly, but one should remember that other hidden inside of it that is duties. Therefore, I firmly believe that while every citizen should be accountable."
