        "Dear Sir,",
        "I am Jasmeen Kaur residing in the western part of Greater Noida and I am writing this letter to raise my concerns about the new airport development project which is recently got approved by the ministries.",
        "Although  with the bigger airport the international travellers will get benefited to travel directly from this airport,  I wanted to highlight that this area is surrounded by various schools and colleges. So an increase in the number of flights will increase noise pollution which will affect studies badly as students won't be able to concentrate on their studies",
        "Moreover, it will increase congestion on the roads during peak hours and it is a matter of concern that how daily office-goers and students will be able to reach on time to their locations. Further, this development will harm the environmental conditions of the nearby localities.",
        "I request you  kindly look to publish this concern in your newspaper so that ministries can understand the concerns.",
