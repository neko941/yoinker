        "I am writing to inform you about an online training program which I would like to attend . There are many mutual benefits included in this policy that I would like to explain  in the following.",
        "This training procedure is about safety and fire rescue management. The institution where is holding this training  is one of the well-known centres in this field. However, this development only takes place once a year. As you know the cost of this kind of training is expensive and I can not afford it individually. I would appreciate it, if our company could accept to pay half of the plan cost. In addition, as I mentioned this course is online and I do not need to have any day offs except for the practical exam\u2019s days. After achieving this training certificate, I would provide a credit to our company for the upcoming tenders. Also, I will enhance my knowledge more in the safety subjects and will be ready for a higher position as a safety manager.",
