        "In recent years, the issue related to elderly people has attracted the public\u2019s attention. Some experts suggest that ageing populations are more likely to continuously increase, while others oppose that senior sectors experience both mental and physical problems. In the following paragraphs, the potential causes and feasible approaches will be discussed.",
        "Firstly, the principal cause of this phenomenon is that elders inevitably are in a state of neglect from their families. Thailand, for instance, the majority of homeless witness older persons living across streets or under bridges. This is because the family belonging to lower-income groups tends to leave these people alone thanks to saving the cost of living consumption. Additionally, it is common to understand that health seems to be a vital issue for retired individuals. To explain, a healthy lifestyle is normally ignored since people basically spend extreme life without preserving well-being when they were mature such as excessive smoking and consuming alcoholic beverages.",
        "Conversely, there are effective ways to tackle such problems, or at least mitigate the effects. The quality of life should be initially extolled by the virtue of governments such as providing the state welfare or pension funds, consequently, leading elderly communities to have stability after the retirement age. For example, the Obama Care \u2013 providing health insurance scheme \u2013 helps American people to access affordable coverage, particularly in underprivileged groups. Moreover, it is essential to raise awareness towards health concerns owing to the increase of lung and liver cancer in ageing societies. In other words, ministries can extend the higher value-added tax on unhealthy products in order to completely control the intake.",
        "In conclusion, even though the reason for this matter is severe, there are steps that regimes and individuals can take to minimise its effects. Therefore, these factors could be noticeably changed in the future."
