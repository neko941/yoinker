When people consume fast food, their brain generates chemicals stimulating a feeling of happiness and relaxation. Thus, constantly eating fast food is a way for our brain mechanism to seek pleasure. Moreover, these fast food contains high calories counts so they can provide a lot of energy for a busy day. This convenience has led many people with hectic schedules to choose fast food as their main meal. Therefore, despite being harmful, fast food is sought after in every meal of the day.",

It is necessary for the government to take strict policies in diminishing advertisements or opening abundant restaurants related to processed food. Furthermore, authorities need to invest more money to make more advertisements about healthy food, these might greatly reinforce the awareness of creating good habits. This campaign needs to focus especially on the busy ones promoting a properly nutritious menu on a regular basis and the positive effects can have on their wellbeing.",
