        "Admittedly, it is mandatory to need mobiles in daily lives to handle all business related problems since the occupations are not only limited to the national borders which force a society to practice modern facilities.

Put differently, the trend of having updated technological mobile in youngsters is nothing but just an attraction towards entertainment aspects of the relationships that either make them mature enough or mental for situations.",
        "To conclude, having explored both slants, I reiterate that having a phone is an effective way of efficient communication and to communicate surrounding as well as far distant persons; nonetheless overuse of negative feature can definitely drive a society to specific illness. Thus, it is obvious that trump supersede the gloomy aspect."
