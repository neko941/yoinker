        "I am writing this letter to give you some feedback about your latest edition of Business Magazine.",
        "Last week, I was travelling from New Delhi to Mumbai through rail. I wanted to read some business news while travelling. At the New Delhi railway station, I saw many magazines and novels. I decided to buy your journal because I was fascinated by its cover story about the Oil price hike.",
        "I was thoroughly impressed by all the articles and research which were mentioned in it. I had read many business books but no one had given as detailed information as it was in that magazine. However, there were some parts that I didn't find well, such as no graph or chart and the low quality of the paper.",
        "I would like to suggest for the betterment of your magazine Firstly, few diagrams like Pie Charts and line graphs must include because it will help the reader to compare the ventures performances. Secondly, improve the quality of the paper and try to make it colourful.",
        "I hope you will consider my views as it will assist your book to be sold more in the market.",
        "Yours faithfully,",
