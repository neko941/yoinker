        "Dear Manager,",
        "I am Lakshmi manager of Apple company and I am writing to you to provide our feedback on your service which was held on last Sunday evening at 5PM in the ballroom. My team  enjoyed  your great advanced furniture set up along with the smooth reception area and especially push back seating chairs were really awesome.",
        "During lunchtime the team was expected to have nice and tasty food unfortunately they were not happy with served food along with the snacks as well. In addition, one of the vegan items was not cooked properly and they even noticed some stones on their lunch plate which was horrible to the entire team.",
        "As we want to continue our business relations in future hence, we would like to see a good amount of  changes in food menu and if possible please replace the master chef with expert one. It would be good if you can check the food quality before serving to your customers and that will enable you to ensure that serving quality.",
        "I look forward to hearing from you with a recent update to the food menu.",
        "Yours faithfully,",
        "Lakshmi."
