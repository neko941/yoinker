        "There is a party that thinks that everyone should get access to any type of data while others prefer not to share due to its importance. In this essay, I am going to illustrate both  parties and then give my personal opinion.",
        "On one hand, there is a consensus that believes that we have to control the information we share with the public. The main reason why this group have this notion is that some types of information might lead to atrocities if it was in the wrong hand. Thus, governments should be extremely aware of the data that it shares wit with the common. Scammers, for example,  arrived in a stage where they use the data are given to us as a tool for their operations.",
        "On the other hand, we have a voice that advocates  more transparency due to their altruism and mindset. This is to say that this group believes that the more information we share, the more innovation will have. Furthermore, sometimes our findings might guide someone to come up with a new cure for some disease, an invention might increase our lifespan, or maybe a tool to help us increase our productivity. MoMo, for instance, is a famous app to manage someone life from important meetings to submitting  homework.",
        "In conclusion, it seems that the two parties have fair viewpoints. On balance, however, I tend to believe that we have to give access to any kind of data this is  because it might lead to more developments, advancements, and state-of-the-art inventions."
