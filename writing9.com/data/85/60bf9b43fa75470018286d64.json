        "In this competitive world, it is important to train ourselves to face everyday challenges and to attain desired future. Despite this, some announce that it is crucial to focus on the present rather than wasting time on planning for upcoming moments. I disagree with this statement  because without any goal we cannot simply achieve it.",
        "Firstly, in order to be successful we must set ourselves a goal to attain, then only we can focus to finish everday step to finally reach our destination. For example, if we didn't plan on anything we simply cannot achieve anything. Therefore, it is wise to spend some of our time thinking about the step-by-step progress we need to accomplish to reach our objective. Thus it would appear that  everyday aim needs to be planned and executed to attain our desired future.",
        "Secondly, it is also true that we need to live at the moment rather than foresight our future. However, if we just only focus on the present then there won't be any progress in our life. For instance, the American University of Management supports this theory that often successful people set their every day goals and try to achieve them within a time limit set by them. In addition, there is a saying that successful people make decision-based on where they want to be but, unsuccessful people make a decision based on their current situation. Hence, it is proved that organising is key to get succeed.",
        "In conclusion, planning is absolutely necessary to surpass obstacles and achieve our objective. So, without any aim simply fulfilling daily duty doesn't lead us anywhere in our life. As the essay has shown, planning for the future and focus on the present are equally important."
