        "Recently, there was the construction of a new building near my house and due to working of the heavy machines, I have seen the surface of the road has been damaged so badly. As a result, there are many potholes in it, which hinder the flow of traffic and create congestion problems in the area. Also, due to the dense population, the sewerage system got affected awfully and it remained no more up to the mark. Therefore, the dirty water is always running out from it and causes numerous hazardous diseases which are deadly to health.",
        "You are requested to look into this matter and send the maintenance team in order to repair the poor street and clear the sewerage lines as well.",
        "I look forward to hearing from you soon.",
