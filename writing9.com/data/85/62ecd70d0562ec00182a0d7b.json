        "However, since my new neighbours moved into the 501 apartment next door to me, I am not able to get sound sleep even for a single day for the past 2 months. I raised my concern multiple times but they kept being ignorant of my requests stating it is their house.",
        "This is a serious problem for me as being a working professional, having a shift from 6:00 AM to 6:00 PM, requires me to get up early around 4 to get to work on time. Their music is usually very loud; I can easily hear even in my bedroom which oftenly disturbs my sleep.",
        "Therefore, I would request you to take action promptly, reminding them of building rules. Also, maybe you could post a notice in the lobby about the noise regulations for all the tenants to see.",
