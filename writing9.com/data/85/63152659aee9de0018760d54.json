        "The dynamical growth of some cities might adversely impact  human well-being. I would like to approach this dilemma more sceptically and support my opinion with  relevant examples.",
        "To begin with, people's health is directly depending on the state of their minds. In other words, to what extent are some individuals  mentally satisfied and able to struggle against negative situations? Some people feel more comfortable in a place where they belong, which as a result helps them to maintain their health. For example, individuals, which were grown up in rural areas, when they immigrate to big cities, might feel depressed. The period in which they feel  apathy could vary from person to person. Sometimes, some oversentimental characters cannot overcome  these psychological problems and become weaker in terms of physical conditions.",
        "On the other hand, immense spaces tend to be more crowded. Overpopulated regions of a particular country, might suffer from daily environmental contaminations such as greenhouse gasses (GHGs) emissions. In big megapolises, GHGs overrated due to the region's daily routine. For instance, inhabitants have to move daily from one point to another for their jobs in a standard defined for the time. Therefore, big traffic at  fixed times could be observed. As a result, air pollution  occurs, which steadily affects  the well-being of society. However, thanks to contemporary achievements in medicine, individuals who are living in big cities, can get cures more easily, rather than those, who are living in rural areas.",
        "In conclusion, it is actually hard to determine what is the direct cause of ailments. The presence of negative aspects such as distracted mental conditions and environmental pollution in immense regions points out to worst effects. Nevertheless, it should be noted that  to connect these effects with the living areas strictly, would be  not a fair decision."
