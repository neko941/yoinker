        "I am writing to express my concern about the quality of drinking water in our office and suggest changing the vendor who delivers water bottles in the office premises.",
        "In the last 1 month, many employees including me were admitted to the hospital due to typhoid disease. Our family members did not encounter this problem hence I assume that it is because of the water that we drink in our company. This has also impacted the timelines of our projects due to the unavailability of ill teammates thus this matter needs  serious attention.",
        "After discussion with other colleagues, we came to a conclusion that the water supplier needs to be replaced with a new one and water should be tested at regular intervals to ensure the safety and health of the employees in our organization. Kindly let me know if you need medical reports or more details to handle this situation efficiently.",
        "I hope you will investigate this matter and take prompt action on the same.",
        "Yours sincerely,",
