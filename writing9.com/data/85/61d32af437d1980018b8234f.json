        "Images play an imperative role in describing a story. A group of schools opines that photos describe any situation better than written words. I strongly advocate this view. Clarity of the situation and picturesque condition is the main reason behind such belief; the same is explained with examples in the upcoming paragraphs.",
        "To start with, image processing is a method, which has much impact on our thinking process. The vivid clarity of the picture gives an overall better idea than the long descriptive story. Moreover, people feel bored while reading the wordy linguistic description. For instance, the Amul butter company sharing its success story with cartoons of imaginative characters rocketed the business.",
        "In continuation to the above, words, those are not mentioned in black and white, are also being reflected from images of an incident. As it is less time-consuming to learn and go through, where something is depicted with a flowchart along with relevant clicks of the incident, creates much impact on its target group. Furthermore, these types of notices are much appealing. In this case, it is worth mentioning, a part of the news from a daily newspaper was spread much in comparison to others although all the newspapers covered the same incident, as because the former one published it with images of real incident how the teenager was rescued who fell in the cage of a lion while visiting a zoo. It is vividly clear that images are much imperative.",
        "To conclude, from the above discussion I confirm my vote for the statement that images build much more impact than sophisticated word or literature, as it takes less time and can be understood by anyone and everyone."
