        "The issue of whether governments should provide financial aid internationally and domestically has been a debatable topic. While numerous individuals contend that leaders should solely support their own citizens, I believe that social and economic assistance between countries is crucial for the upliftment of humanity.",
        "Firstly, the levels of disparity in economic conditions between regions deem it possible for financially powerful nations to help those that are not. If developed states provide opportunities for their developing counterparts to utilise the former\u2019s resources, the latter will be able to launch projects that uplift their economy. For instance, financially powerful governments who also invest in agriculture can strengthen bilateral relations with progressing nations whose economy relies on farming. Hence, it is apparent that strong commercial alliances between states generate possibilities for global cooperation.",
        "In addition, social and cultural collaboration is instrumental in preserving art and heritage among nations. World history offers ample examples of the birth and evolution of civilisations and it is undeniable that numerous communities share social and cultural values with each other. It is also acknowledged that a number of lands do not have the infrastructure or capacity to protect their cultural principles. In such circumstances, the aforementioned values can be enhanced and saved through consistent associations between societies with identical perspectives such as hosting music festivals, sporting events and culinary fairs. Therefore, it can be identified that socio-cultural union between countries can assist those that struggle to conserve their traditions and rituals.",
        "In conclusion, it is evident that while countries are encouraged to focus on the enhancement of their own standards, it is also imperative that persistent collaboration on various aspects truly supports the concept of globalisation. Upon considering the evidence provided in the essay, it can be concluded that the notion of solitary existence and progress should be discarded and that people should support one another."
