        "It is often argued that investing in scientific progress is more beneficial than funding business industries . In my opinion , I completely agree with this view and think that  priority should be given to  science.",
        "Firstly, scientific researchers help  society  to find a solution to existing problems which have a direct impact on human beings and their surroundings . In other words , if the nation 's authority invests more in science , it will undoubtedly show a huge improvement and development in several sectors.  As a result,  it has become a developed country and has the ability to face many problems . For example ,  the vaccine of the virus  Covid-19  was developed by researchers and not by commercial persons and therefore they protect  the whole world from the adverse effects of this epidemic . That is why science is a more advantageous field and provides many benefits to the community .",
        "Secondly, scientific progress helps individuals to feel more secure  in the community  . To put it simply , when authority funds research activities, there is most security. They do not disclose any information which could hamper national security. thus ,  investigation and development in the field of the military are carried out by the union.",
        "Finally , the regime will be  capable of providing financial assistance to various analysis projects. For instance , if the project fails to achieve its objectives, the government has the resources to cope up with the losses incurred .",
        "In conclusion , despite the importance of commercial sectors, I strongly believe that the government should invest in scientific research because it provides several benefits to humans and society."
