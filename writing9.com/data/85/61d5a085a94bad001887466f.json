        "I am a graduate engineer and I would like to migrate to a foreign country to pursue my further studies. Clearly, I had been looking to learn about the skills in a kitchen. Then I found your course, applied for it and joined. Despite it being a bit difficult at the beginning your practical sessions helped me a lot to familiarise myself with it. However, the sessions helped not only to understand the basics of cooking but to introduce new cuisines as well. I have tried most of the items and they came out very well. As a result, my family appreciated me for showing the courage to do it. Also, I have been looking forward to trying new dishes.",
        "If time allows, I would like to join your latest course on Arabian dishes very soon.",
