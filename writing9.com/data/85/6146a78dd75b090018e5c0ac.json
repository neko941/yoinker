        "In today's modern world, there has been a significant rise in the number of emerging entertainers. Some people believe that these entertainers also play vital roles in  society. In my opinion, I support this contention because they are considered influencers by many folks. This essay will argue the same.",
        "Nonetheless, some critics are of the belief that scientists are more important than people, who entertain others. Mainly because scientists work for innovations. Moreover, their discoveries, which can be scientific or social, are likely to change the whole community. Not only people  but how they communicate or how they do their jobs  are mostly affected by many things developed by scientists. To illustrate, the discovery of the internet has dramatically changed the whole world in recent years. Additionally, activities done today by most people are completely different than in the past. Therefore,  some folks support scientists compare to entertainers.",
        "To explain my belief, it is also true that some feel otherwise. Firstly, for the past many years, people have been influenced by movies, tv shows, youtube videos in their lives. Secondly, adults are the main age group affected by these entertainers. Consequently, they try to behave or do the same things that have been done by these actors. To give a quintessential example, in recent years, the number of young people joining arm forces has increased by  ten per cent because many of them are probably inspired by those patriotic films on the army. Hence, some opine that good entertainers affect our society immensely.",
        "In conclusion, despite few demerits, it is true that people working in the entertainment industry are as important to society as scientists In my opinion, they should also think about people who are being affected by their roles and choose the act wisely."
