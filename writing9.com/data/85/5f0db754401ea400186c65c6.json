        "Despite many places around the world have improved mayor-crime rates, people still feel unsafe while walking on the streets or riding cars in the city. In this essay, I will explain the main reasons for this feeling and some strategies to overcome these issues.",
        "Many people still feel unsafe because, due to the actual economic crisis, there has been a sharp increase in minor crimes, namely,  robbery, shoplifting and car-theft. In the last couple of months, for instance, there has been a 25% rise in shoplifting in Buenos Aires in the last 6 months. Another reason for feeling less safe than ever is that there are more drunk homeless living in the streets. This has lead to a significant increase in vandalism, which makes the population worried about what could happen while they commute to work, for example.",
        "The first measure that could be applied to increase safety is to offer more job opportunities. Increasing, therefore, the economic status of unemployed citizens and improving their quality of life. To illustrate, if fewer people live in poverty, fewer people would rob to make a living. Another strategy would be to raise the number of policemen in dangerous areas where it is known that assaults happen more often. In this manner, thieves will stop robbing and harming people, consequently, victims will definitely feel taken care of and protected.",
        "In conclusion, whereas mayor crimes have actually been diminished, there has been a jump in the number of minor crimes, making people feel worried and unsafe. Governments all around the globe should take measures to tackle this situation, such as increasing job positions and placing more policemen on the streets."
