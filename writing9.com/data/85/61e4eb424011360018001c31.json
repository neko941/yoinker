Furthermore, there are high chances of me securing the first position in the university considering my previous papers went very well. Moreover, owing to the fact that my thesis is on the latest technology, our organization will have far more benefits.",

        "Although I realize that my temporary absence can cause an obstruction to the ongoing project, I give my assurance that though I am away, my knowledge about the subject will be transferred to my junior beforehand thereby not causing any inconvenience to the company.",
