        "Tourism gains its popularity all around the world, except for paying abroad visit. The reason for this trend is still a difficult question to discuss while some people believe that this development brings lots of negative effect on the countries having a large number of visitors. However, this essay will show some clear explanations and a huge benefit for the nations with tourism evolvement, with an appropriate conclusion.",
        "Concerning that humans choose a distinctive destination for their break-time and going abroad is always the best choice. Foremost and first, travelling to other countries brings visitors a peculiar feeling and sense of exploration. For example, Australia is famous for its modern infrastructure with fabulous forests that appeals to tourists from several nations to relax after a hard-working time. Moreover, researchers and students have opportunities to gain interesting knowledge about other cultures and traditions. It is quite useful for them to acquire great information to supply for their project or future career.",
        "Travelling abroad development brings a wide range of significant advantages to this country's economy and social reputation. Firstly, tourism industries supply an extensive profit to this nation's financial system. A recent survey reveals that approximately 50% of interests came from visitors around the world in 2020 in Korea. Additionally, this gives good chances for each authority to advertise their custom widespread through travellers without any campaigns. An illustration of this is that the Vietnamese know general information about Japan which is well-known as the peach blossom place or Italia's delicious plates.",
        "To summarize, although visitors might damage the environment in which they choose to go. The motoring development, meanwhile, the merits outweigh all the small demerits if governments publish strict regulations for travellers. In the near future, I have a tendency to believe that the progress of tourism would play a vital role in each countries' economy."
