        "Hi James,",
        "I am writing to let you know that I will be travelling to Canada in the month of September to start my master's program at Ontario University.",
        "Last year , I have completed my undergraduate and I was planning to study post-graduate in a foreign country. I applied to various universities in Canada and the UK. Finally, I have got an offer letter from Ontario University for Masters in Business Intelligence Program . Moreover, it is a two-year program and my parents have made the full payment of the university fees. however, I would like to cover my living expenses rather than depend on my parents. Nevertheless,as per the regulations ,  I can work only  20 hours  a week. Would it be possible for me to  find a part-time job as a data or business intelligence analyst since it relates to my current job role? Otherwise, should I find blue-colour jobs where the wages are paid hourly?",
        "I would like you to give me some suggestions , also the practical issues faced by part-time workers.",
        "I look forward to hearing from you soon.",
