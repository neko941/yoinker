        "While some people argue that governments should focus on health, I believe that governments' revenue should be used to resolve other key issues. In this essay, I will discuss both views and give reasons for my opinion.",
        "The reasons why governments should spend more money on health care are manifold. Firstly, it is true that everyone needs  good health to be able to live a better life especially seniors as they get sick easier. Furthermore, it is obvious that a good medical system can have a significant impact. To be more specific, more people will be able to get their needed treatments on time, and there will be more varied medications available. Lastly, because of the fact that the average age in every country is increasing, a decent medical system is needed more than ever.",
        "However, nobody would dispute the fact that governments' income is mainly from taxes, and citizens can have a say. Few people would contest that there are many other key issues in society. For example, education is a vital part of society but the tuitions have been rising every year. Most students nowadays have student loans that need to be paid off. Another key issue is that the price of houses has been going up quickly, and fewer people are able to afford a living. It becomes necessary for governments to take actions to tackle these problems.",
        "In conclusion, although medical cares are vital,  governments should pay more attention to other key issues such as expensive tuitions, heavy student loans and rising price of houses."
