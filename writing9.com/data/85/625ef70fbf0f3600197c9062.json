        "Turn off the other hands of argument, the main advantage is that play events lead the population to a healthy lifestyle.To put it another way,it is a good method to encourage the population to live exact ways.Because, presently, we can see that society  tends to do harmful habits like  smoking, drinking alcohol and so on. In turn, physical races play an essential role in every human life.Moreover,  the youngsters have their favourite athletes and  people try to repeat their game player's actions. For instance, Today the earth is divided into two parts and half of them are funs of Ranaldo and the other parts support Messi.",
