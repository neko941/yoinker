        "Foodstuff is very important in our lifestyle. There are a variety of flavours available in the market today, including junk food is the most widely used. The public is more inclined towards eating it out nowadays. Although  there may be some specific moments of eating canned meal sometimes, the side effects of using it can be far greater; however, society needs to be dependent on processed foods for certain reasons. . In this essay, I will discuss the reasoning for my perspective and provide relevant justifications.",
        "Initially, processed snack is the biggest growing trend among society today. Undoubtedly, today's life is very fast-paced, in which every human being has to do some things beyond his ability so that he can live a good life. In this run-on-the-mill life, sometimes there is not enough time for a person to have healthy cooking for his good health. As a result, he has to eat out prepacked and processed meal that consequently, leads to some health issues. Despite putting the detrimental effects of junk cuisine into consideration, a person has to anyhow become dependent on canned feed for the sake of time-saving. For example, the young crowd who move to work elsewhere away from their hometowns, have to eat their daily meals, eating out enlighten of the fact that they are away from home.",
        "On the contrary, some people have no choice but to dine out. It is important to note that a canned menu can be very harmful to the body. This can lead to many communities getting overweight, such as obesity, obesity, and heart disease. Therefore, home-cooked meals should be eaten with the least amount of detrimental snacks possible. For example, according to a survey in India, the number of the public suffering from diseases caused prominently by poor quality cuisine is increasing and hence, it is very important to curb it.",
        "In conclusion, I opine that there is no harm in having a portion of fast food, especially when the person has no choice but to eat out. Habits of eating homemade meal need to be adopted, with health remain healthy and healthy mind develops in a healthy body."
