        "There was a project which needs to be submitted last week for writing an essay on the world war and its side effects on the World. Although, I have completed most of the project and still need some time to finish it. Therefore, I was not able to submit it last week. Hence, I am writing to you regarding an extension of the project so that I can finish it and it does not affect my grades. It got delayed because I am reading a lot of books and watching documentaries to collect factual data.",
        "I hope you will consider my request and in spite of being delayed, you will allow me an extension of 1 week so that I can finish my research. Hope to see your positive response. Have a great day.",
