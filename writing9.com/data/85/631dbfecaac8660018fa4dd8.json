        "Dear Sir or Madam,",
        "I am writing to you regarding an armchair I have recently bought from your online shop. Allow me first to elaborate on what has happened to me. I made the order during  Black Friday and it was supposed to be shipped within 5 working days. My complaint is that it has been now 14 days and I was not informed yet when I will expect my items to be delivered.",
        "From your website, I understand that, according to the terms and conditions of your shop policy, there would be a short delay with the shipping process , especially during offer seasons, for two additional days only. However, I have been waiting for more than the mentioned period. Besides that, I called your customer service twice and they raised a complaint form to the shop manager, but ,still nothing has happened and not even a letter from your side has been sent.",
        "Anyway, I am really annoyed and I am sorry to tell you that if I did not receive my parcels, within 24 hours,  I would complain to the Customer Protection Department in our city and ask for a full refund of the amount paid to be credited to my bank account. In addition to that , I will stop purchasing from your shop, as other companies are offering a better service than you claim to have.",
