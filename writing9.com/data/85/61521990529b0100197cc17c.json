        "Beneficiaries of modern technology which was always debatable and have become more controversial. Many people claim that new technology raises the difference between rich and poor, while others reject this notion. The substantial influence of this trend has sparked controversy over the potential impact in recent years. In my opinion, using new tech-rich and poor social class is beneficial to be more rational. This essay will elaborate on both points of view of this issue and thus lead to a logical conclusion.",
        "There are myriad reasons that will further explain this argument, but the most predominant one stems from the fact that new technology gives us more comfort and creates life more accessible. For example, using a mobile phone helps us a lot, such as using mobile internet, we can easily access various information we need at any moment. As a result, a farmer can quickly know any query about his farming. Furthermore, mobile banking has become life is more straightforward. In rural areas, any villager can be banking whatever they should not go to the bank.",
        "On the other hand, some others believe that new technology may increase the difference between poor and rich. They frequently have this opinion because new technological products are costly and only fewer people can buy and use this. For example, the latest technology-enriched iPhone price starts from 80thousands BDT, and only fewer folks can purchase this. The second point is that most of the latest products' usability is only limited in the urban area. So, rural people should not use this product because of a lack of logistic support.",
        "In conclusion, according to the arguments above, one can find that the benefits of using new tech gadgets are instrumental indeed. Nevertheless, it is potential drawbacks should not be overlooked either."
