        "Dear Ms Stone,",
        "I understand from my son, Steven, that you are looking for some parents who could join the school trip to Japan. I would like to volunteer to join the group if you still have a vacancy to fill.",
        "I have been learning Japanese for two years now and I will be sitting for a Japanese Language Proficiency Test in July next year. It will the exam takers on reading, writing, listening, as well as speaking. As the school trip is to Japan coincidentally, I would like to take this opportunity to improve my Japanese and speak to the locals outside the school trip hours.",
        "I believe that I will be able to help out the trip organizing teacher and the tour leader as well. At the very least, I can help to keep a watch on the children. As I am a nurse by profession, I can be of aid if any of us in the group needs medical help, although I hope that would not happen.",
        "I would appreciate it if you could let me know whether or not I could join the trip, so that I can plan for my leave at work. I would also like to know the details of the itinerary, if it is already available, please. I look forward to hearing from you.",
        "Yours sincerely,",
