        "Nowadays, the higher the development in technology, the lesser the role of humans. To illustrate this driverless cars, buses and tracks were sprung up in some places and only passengers are travelling on the vehicle. Although there are positive and negative outcomes,  it seems to me that cons probably be followed after the benefits, as this kind of improvement is not suitable for long term usage.",
        "Firstly, in the minority of developed countries,researchers invent  techniques to make the community more convenient, as a ,result the replacement of drivers is all the hype these days. By using  non-human driving cars, man-made accidents such as speed violation, disobedience at no parking zone and problems due to drinking alcohol. Subsequently, the penalty charges would also be decreased.",
        "However, despite the advantages, drawbacks might rise in the future. To elaborate this, as the vehicles are running with artificial intelligence, there will be some unexpected problem at giving command; misunderstanding by the automation. Moreover, the unemployment rate of riders would also be skyrocketed. Additionally, when there is an emergency road accident, in ordinary public transport,  emotional communication should be used in this case, even though, we could not imagine how this sophisticated machinery may respond. Likewise, in some areas,where there have an enormous variation of weather conditions,which means the occurrence of natural disasters,like, snowstorms, tsunamis and pouring rain, nobody knows riderless buses may halt driving or not.",
        "On the whole, every improvement has benefits for the nation, nevertheless, there are some disadvantages to modern technology. If  robotic technology can substitute in the place of mankind, our world would become an artificial place. After taking everything into consideration, I tend to disagree that the positive effects of driverless automation outweigh the negative."
