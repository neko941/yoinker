        "Dear Jackson,",
        "I\u2019m writing in response to you asking for my advice about the camping holiday.",
        "As you know I\u2019m a big fan of camping and outdoor activities like that, and I suggest everyone at least take a shot once. By the way, I reckon that summer camping would be the best choice, because of the nice weather in summer and you can take advantage of beautiful nature and at night, you can enjoy some stargazing and stay up late at night close to the fire.",
        "However, I should warn you about some pitfalls you may have faced. Especially, because of the mosquitos and reptiles, you should sleep in a tent or sleeping bag. Above  that, it can get cold and freezing even on summer nights in  nature, and that\u2019s another reason you should bring with you some warm clothes.",
        "It\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve not been in nature, and I missed that though, if you make up your mind about this camping thing, let me know.",
        "I look forward to your reply.",
        "Best wishes.",
