        "The amount of money that a man has to possess is considered the most remarkable segment of success. In my opinion, other essential ways could be countable. That will discuss in this essay.",
        "Interestingly, the incorporeal resultants are much overwhelming than the material. On the first place, gaining quality knowledge, which means having precise and deep information regarding a specific major. Having miscellaneous practical life experiences, being much worthwhile. Moreover, the achievements that person has achieved, reflecting  prosperity on the personal and feasible level. Namely the CEO position, that can be a result of attaining hardly several goals. Equally, job satisfaction means not only the needs had fulfillments, but also the boundaries of success has blurred, chiefly work-life balance.",
        "On the other hand, money can be a precise reflection of success. However, being a hard worker, which mean a volume of tasks had been completed successfully, inevitably the rewards and fringe benefits will be earned, leading to soaring in the income, for example, the district manager gain doubled wage than the direct manager, as well as a multiple of functions has performed by the district's employer. On the contrary, has the person a high level of maturation, he would deserve good funds. which can be an indication of high quality in the brain processing that he has, leading to being an intelligent person, who knows how to defuse in the market.",
        "In conclusion, it would seem that the most remarkable factors of victory are the quantity of knowledge that the worker has, also the goals that had achieved. Conversely, money can be a sign of dedication in a position, and it perhaps indicates that such a man is brilliant."
