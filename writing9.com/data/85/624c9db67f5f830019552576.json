In the meanwhile, I will prepare some sort of preservative foods for you. I believe it will be more helpful for you in a hectic schedule.",

From the main entrance take left and there will be a small shop, behind that small way will be there. That way is the backside entrance of the house. It will be more comfortable for you to enter.",
        "Finally,  I request you to pour the water for my plants on daily basis. Not only pour the water into plants but also do feed my little birds in my house. I would be more thankful if you do this for me.",
