        "University plays an inevitable role in a person life as it makes an immature a mature one. But this privilege is used by rich ones as the lower class is unable to offer their offspring to costly education of an institute. So, the administration should take steps by making higher education free for all kinds of classes whatever their budgetary circumstances are and I highly agree with it.",
        "The first of view is that not everyone belongs to the same class. Our present society is divided into three main classes which are lower, middle and upper class. So, the lower and middle-lower class does not get the benefit of university coaching. To remove this class discrimination, authority comes into play by offering scholarships and different money giving programs to the lower class. For example, In ,India the winning party gives more grants to the lower class as compared to the upper class to remove the discrimination and make an equal society.",
        "Secondly, the number of  public centres of learning is less as compared to private ones. The private institute gives admission to only the higher class as their fees are way out of the pocket of an ordinary man. And there is a lesser number of public coaching centres which increases the number of applicants and not every common student can get in. Moreover, taxes money should be used to build more public institutes in backward areas. For example, a developed nation like Germany offers free education to any student who applies there.",
        "Bring this to an end, studying at university is everyone\u2019s right and the government should take that into consideration by making university coaching free and giving access to this privilege irrespective of their financial background."
