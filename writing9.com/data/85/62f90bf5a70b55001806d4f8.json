        "I am writing this letter to express my gratitude to your hotel. Please be informed that last Saturday, August 13, I organized our monthly meeting in one of your conference rooms on the second floor.",
        "Firstly, the lobby is so clean and the smell is so sweet, it looks like we are in  paradise. Secondly, the bathroom that we used during the meeting is not crowded. Lastly, the staff of the hotel are very friendly. Unfortunately, the food is not good. It is not delicious, for example, the fried chicken is not crispy and very salty. Furthermore, the fish that was served at that time are not fresh.",
        "Kindly note that we are planning to organize again an event in your hotel, thus, we do appreciate it if you could address that incident. For example, please check your food before serving them and training for your staff is needed.",
        "I hope my complaints will help your company. Thank you for reading my letter.",
        "Yours faithfully,",
