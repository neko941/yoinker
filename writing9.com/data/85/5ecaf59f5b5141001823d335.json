        "Around the world, many people have been dying on account of car accidents since vehicle was invented. As a result, people are everywhere concerned about safety on the roads and while one wants to adjust car speed limit, others are elaborating various ways to safer roads. Overall, from my perspective, both sides have valuable arguments because car crashes are a complicated global problem that demands a comprehensive approach.",
        "First of all, few people can deny the fact that presently high speed is the most common reason for vehicle accidents, thereby the lower speed of vehicles the safer roads. In many megalopolises, for example, car speed limit is 40-50 kilometres and society has been noticing the diminish of level automobile crashes. Although, speed restriction necessarily control that almost impossible on roads around towns. Thus, the speed limit is a good method, whilst, it has many obstacles.",
        "Therefore, governments around the world implement various methods, even, a comprehensive approach to solve problems with safety on roads. Many megalopolises, for instance, implement obstacles on the roads for regulation speed, pedestrian crossing under or above roads and video camera for fixation of delinquents.  Nevertheless, as with the previous method all these methods work in cities; however, countries around the world have many roads that still are dangerous. Consequently, problems with car crashes, regardless all efforts, still unsolved.",
        "To conclude, the safety on the roads a stressful global problem owing to many people have been dying each year in car crashes. Moreover, regardless all endeavour and ideas to solve such troubles many roads still are dangerous. Hence, I believe that eventually society figure out a solution, nonetheless, presently necessarily for people be always on alert on the roads in order to prevent car accidents."
