        "It is quite notorious that some developed nations are not recycling waste materials such as paper, glass and cans. The reason behind this seems to be the lack of enforcement of  legislation for the commerce sector. Should this be the origin of the problem, a simple solution would be to involve a neutral party to make sure these organisations abide by the law.",
        "It has been established some countries do not see recycling as a priority, therefore they do not have a clear plan to make sure their population is sorting out recyclable materials as needed, especially the commerce sector. For instance, businesses may see recycling as an unnecessary waste of money. Consequently, they have no interest in investing time and resources to dispose of their waste appropriately.",
        "To solve this issue, there should be a neutral agency auditing the trash disposal protocol of all the members of the commerce sector. For example, a non-governmental company monitors commercial waste to make sure private companies are following the rules and adhering to the legislation. The neutrality of this report would make it indisputable, hence business owners would have to change their behaviour.",
        "In conclusion, most of the waste not being recycled comes from the commerce sector of some countries. Despite legislation in place, these commerces choose not to recycle because it would impact their profit. Nevertheless, there is a clear solution to this problem, as simple as hiring a private company to inspect these businesses and to make suggestions where necessary. Although it seems like a simple solution, additional considerations should be made where countries do not have a trustworthy law enforcement agency."
