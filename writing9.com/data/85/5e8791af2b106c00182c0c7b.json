        "Since it was a one-day conference, and I had to rush back home the same day. I actually had a lot on my plate that day. There were certain changes during the lectures, for instance, some of the speakers were late for their speeches, and thus rest everything had to be extended as well. It was an extremely tedious and hectic day for me, and lastly, I had to rush to the airport, because I was late for my flight. Therefore, in the midst of all this, I completely forgot that we had planned to meet, and when I realized it was too late.",
        "I want to make it up to you because I felt awful about it. Moreover, next month I would be travelling again to Mumbai for a family function, and so then we should organize a get-together. I\u2019ll let you know the exact date in a few days. I am genuinely sorry once again. I hope you could understand.",
