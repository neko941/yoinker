        "Economic policy changes by many nations in the last three decades have paved the way for companies to make inroads to different nations across the world. These actions have produced excellent results for both the transnationals and the nations in which they function. I entirely agree that the opening of these worldwide corporations and globalization have created great returns for the entire community.",
        "Firstly, these global firms create competition in the local market, resulting in improved products and services by both local and globals firms. For instance,  Indian telecom companies enhanced their service quality to stay competitive with their global counterparts. Secondly,  They have created employment opportunities, contributing to the country's economic might through additional taxpayers. For example, Post globalization, there has been a 1 % increase in taxpayers in India. Thirdly, As a consequence of increased employment opportunities, other industries such as real estate, infrastructure, etc., have also grown, resulting in more options for different businesses and employment. The money thus earned by the government was invested in other sectors.For illustration, the Indian economy has grown 3 times after opening its market for global corporations due to all these changes.",
        "On the other hand, there could be cultural issues for people to work in these corporations, and there could be a sense of insecurity as well. Cross-cultural training can prepare people for this kind of problem. Also, there could be language skills issues and the solution for this as well is language skill development and training. For example, A Lot of companies have this kind of programs as part of their induction to help employees.",
        "In conclusion, countries all over the world got immensely benefitted through globalization and transnational enterprises and any minor language skill and cultural issues can be mitigated easily through employee mentorship programs."
