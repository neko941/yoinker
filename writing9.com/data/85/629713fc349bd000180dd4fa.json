        "Dear Sir,",
        "I am a resident of Ambala city and I am writing to you to express my concern about the construction of an airport in the locality where I am living.",
        "At first, I was glad when I read in a newspaper about the plan to build a new airport near my house. However, after a while, I was a little bit worried after knowing its consequences. Due to this port, nearby colonies can face severe disadvantages.",
        "Firstly, It will cause noise pollution which affects the concentration of many students as well as other citizens who are trying to focus on a particular goal. For instance, Various educational institutes situated in this locality will face disturbance because of the noise created by the flights. Secondly, People will face congestion and parking problem due to an increase in the number of passengers travelling to the port.",
        "I think the competent authority should find a possible way to solve this problem. I would say that this port should be built at a place which is far from the city so that no one faces any discomfort due to this development.",
        "I am hoping that you will take into consideration this aspect in order to serve the nation in a better way.",
        "Thanking You,",
        "Yours Faithfully,",
