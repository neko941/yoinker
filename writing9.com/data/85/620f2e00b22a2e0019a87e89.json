One month back a concert by many good singers was announced for which we all decided to attend it must. And after listening and enjoying all of them only your voice was worth listening and heart touching and the whole crowd was calling your name only. I felt very relaxed after listening to you because it left a soothing effect on my heart and soul.",

        "I request you to give me some tips on how to play the piano with English verses and to sing with it at the same time as you do. Your English songs are very deep and full of expertise.",
