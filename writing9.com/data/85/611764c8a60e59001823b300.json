        "Several people think that children are taught by schools how to be good parents. It would be a good idea. In my point of view, I agree with this concept because to be an ideal family they can learn from schools. Furthermore, I consider skills that the person desires to be a great mother or father are leadership skills and being well-organized skills.",
        "The reason why I agree with it is to be good parents they can learn in schools. Some young ages do not have a delighted family, so teachers should teach them how to be great parents. Based on my local school has a session that is called Wonderful Family. It  teaches about how to be nice parents. Every student has to learn it. As a result of this course, some students grow up to have their families. They have great skills to look after theirs.",
        "The skills which are significant to be a good mother or father are leadership skills and being well organized. I think these two skills are absolutely amazing. Firstly, leadership skill is the primary skill that I consider because when some people have their own children they must be leaders in every step of their kids' lives. Secondly, being well organized is another device which parents should have. Because they have many things that they carry on such as taking care of their children, doing housework and going out to do their jobs. So, they have to organize all of their duties.",
        "In conclusion, I agree with this idea because  to be a delighted parent they should learn in schools. And leadership skills and being well organized are major devices an ideal parent should have."
