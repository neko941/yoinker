        "Eating vast amount of sugar is harmful for health. While some individuals opine that, it is a state's work to limit the amount, some people believe it is a self liability. In my opinion, the consumer's concern is obvious to choose a proper food-chart for them; however, this essay will discuss both views.",
        "On the one hand, a person himself  only can ensure proper diet. This is because, not everyone's body has the same requirement of nutritions and additives; that means, the same volume of sweet intake is not dreadful for all. Likewise, the taste and the recipes also varies among the people; some individuals prefer sugary meals, while some salty. Therefore, it is not possible to identify individuals demand, rather people own self can  select what is good and bad for their own. Meaning that, if a certain measure of sugar consumption lets anyone sick, he has to cut the amount of it from regular cuisines. For example, a diabetic patient usually curbs carbohydrates from daily dishes to maintain fitness.",
        "On the other hand, awareness program organized by the administration could refrain citizens from over-eating of glucose. Because, a government has the power to reach mass people and educate them, which will create a sense among them to avoid white poison. For instance, they can organise medical campaigns to promote the importance of taking nutritionally dense food items, and ignore the items that causes diseases, like obesity. Despite this, no matter how many actions are taken by the country to distribute the knowledge of proper diet, the program will surely fail if individuals have no such concern to follow the plan.",
        "In conclusion, adding too much glucose is definitely has negative impacts on the human body. Although the government can inaugurate programmes to decrease the intake of this substance, I believe it is the self duty to eat well and maintain soundness of body."
