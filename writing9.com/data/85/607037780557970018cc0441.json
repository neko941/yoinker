        "Nowadays,  youngsters are involved in an oflot crimes in  society  which warrants a jail term. It has been suggested that they should not be put in the same cell as grown-ups for certain reasons, and I completely  agree with the opinion. This essay will discuss  why these two groups  of persons should not be locked together.",
        "Teenagers  should not be confined in the same area as adults in a correctional facility for several reasons. Firstly, they may get abused and assaulted  in the prison, due to the fact that when older inmates are kept with younger ones , they tend to feel a sense of superiority  and may begin to abuse the little ones. For example,  a case like this was reported  at a Prison in Nigeria, where a nineteen  years old boy was beaten to a coma by oldsters  in the same space for refusing to wash their clothes. In addition,  some of them end up getting  molested sexually, which would not have been so if they had separate rooms.",
        "Furthermore, a lot of adolescents  may come down with behavioural problems if allowed to stay with people above their age group, because some may end up picking bad habits  and learn antisocial behaviours from these seniors and may even come out from jail worse than how they went it. For instance,  studies in the past decades have  revealed  that about 70% of youths who were convicted came out worse than they were before  going to jail, as a result,  society, continues to suffer. Also, some of them have reported being cajoled  by these persons into engaging  in practices such as smoking.",
        "In conclusion, I think it is safer and wiser for prisons to have different cells  for adults and youths."
