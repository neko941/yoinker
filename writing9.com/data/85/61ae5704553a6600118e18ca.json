        "It is not a secret that sitting in front of the TV plays a great part in a daily routine of a plethora of members of society. Thus, the dilemma of its benefits and weaknesses raises lots of controversies. Below, I would like to explore this highly interesting and thought-provoking topic.",
        "First and foremost, let us discuss the pros of television. To start with, the more scientific programmes an individual watches, the more knowledge he or she has. In particular, the broadcast so-called \"Heads and tails\" broads the horizons greatly, underlying specific features of various countries as well as their traditions. In addition, a number of people have a visual memory, meaning that pictures shown on TV might help to memorise something much better than books on the same topic. In particular, with help of the \"Galileo\" , a programme I used to comprehend particularities in chemistry.",
        "However, despite some advantages, it also has some disadvantages. The most obvious one is if that if a person spares much time in front of this technology, he or she can become addicted to it, spending hours in vain instead of working. For example, according to researches, a few per cent of unemployed individuals were actually fired because they wasted a huge amount of time for bingle-watching. Moreover, on channels there is an excessed quantity of advertisement, that cause some manipulations,making someone  buy commodities. This led to additional unnecessary costs. Namely, if a kid sees an ad about a needless toy, he or she may cry in order to force parents to purchase it, instead of putting money into utilitarian things.",
        "To sum up, watching television does a bit in our lives, filling it with both its pros and its cons. These benefits are following: learning new materials and effective remembering, while its losses are mostly about addiction to it and manipulations of its announcements."
