        "I am writing this letter to express my disappointment with the last film that I watched yesterday.",
        "Actually, I was hanging out with my wife and a couple of friends in a Japanese restaurant where we decided to attend your cinema. We chose the new spiderman's movie. After a few minutes from its start, we realized that the spoken language is French while. We checked your online application, and we asked again on the ticket booth in order to double-confirm that the language is English.",
        "In fact, I was furious about the situation because my wife didn't understand any words and she was forced to read them from the subtitles. Another reason that made our night worst was the supervisor who refused to change the movie ignoring this huge mistake. Therefore, I demand a complete refund for all the tickets and beverages paid on this day.",
        "Thank you for your consideration, and I look forward to your positive feedback.",
        "Yours faithfully,",
