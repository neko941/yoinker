        "I am incredibly sorry for not having been in touch recently. Life has been a bit hectic. I hope you and your family are all well. I am writing this letter to tell you some changes regarding my trip to Canada.",
        "As I told you in my previous letter, my son Jason has graduated from Melbourne University last year. Due to the COVID pandemic, his graduation ceremony has not been organized. Last week, we received an email stating this ceremony will be arranged in December which is the same date as my trip to Canada. You can imagine how important and meaningful this event is to my lovely son, so I think I have to cancel my trip to your country.",
        "I feel extremely guilty for the inconvenience raised to you. I know we have been arranging this holiday this a couple of months, and you have made a massive number of preparations in terms of accommodation and transportation. I hope you can forgive me after hearing the reason.",
        "I reckon I will be free after this event, so we can delay our journey to January 2023. Please let me know whether the new plan is ideal for you or not.",
        "Drop me in line at your earliest convenience.",
