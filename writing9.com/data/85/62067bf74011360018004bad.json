        "Dear Sir or Madam,",
        "I am writing this letter to express my deep concern regarding closing down the' Happy Life' sport and leisure centre in Rock side village due to a monetary issue.",
        "Over the past 10 ,years my wife and children had used the sporting and recreational  facilities here, and it helps us to stay fit and healthy physically and psychologically.The centre helps us to get a break from our hectic lifestyle and relax our minds at the end of the day.",
        "In addition to that, this place helps the local community to get socialise, and children frequently utilize this place for their sports like tennis,gymnastics and use the gym to keep their physical fitness.",
        "Finally, if the council goes with the clouser decision the community living in Rock Side Village has no alternative option to do their sport and leisure activities.It will affect badly for society, especially for young children, because when they are not engaging in sports and recreation events, they tend to engage in more subversive matters,",
        "I sincerely request you to reconsider the decision. I look forward to hearing a positive outcome from the council.",
        "Yours faithfully,"
