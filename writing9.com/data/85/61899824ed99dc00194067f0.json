In my opinion,  the first view is the  most pivotal owing to the fact that  formal institutions are the right place to acquire  scientific knowledge. Although  self-centred learning produces  better results. This essay will shed light on both sides of the matter and provide evidence to prove the arguments.",
        "On the one hand, legal schools education is the best place to get  scientific knowledge. In other words,  the pupil's development in  terms of  scientific skills commences at schools. Reading, listen and   formal speaking are learned  quickly and efficiently  with  experts in the field such as teachers and lecturers. For instance, a student  can learn  how  to peak and read fluently from the comfort of his home,  that said he will  face a challenger to  make a formal speech publicly. \u200bMoreover, a professor  will still be needed to guide him to apply sophisticated vocabulary.  As a result, sophomores reach their personal best and enhance their abilities and capabilities in a wide range of ways.",
