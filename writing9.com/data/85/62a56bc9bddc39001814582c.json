        "My name is James Hulley and I am a friend of Sara from Nigeria. I am writing to make a few inquiries about Durban, South Africa as I would be visiting your country soon.",
        "I have a few questions to ask about the restaurants available for tourists in your city. What kind of restaurants are available in your city ? Do they have intercontinental restaurants such as Chinese, Italian, and others, or are they limited to South African cuisines only? Also, what is the cost implication of these places, I would like to know if it is budget-friendly for a tourist.",
        "Secondly, I have a bucket list that I hope to strike out after my visit, I heard that the nightlife in Durban is top-notch. Do they have clubs they operate all night? Also, I would love to see the wildlife because I have never seen an Elephant or a Lion. I am also interested in going to the beach one of the weekends.",
        "Do you mind if we meet up during my cause of stay? It would be great if you agree so we can explore these places together and you get to show me around yourself. I look forward to meeting you.",
