        "The heating effect is deteriorating global warming and it has a massive impact on the atmosphere which is caused by carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases production. There are a number of causative factors contributing to this new phenomenon. Nonetheless, certain measures can be taken to remedy this byproduct of emissions.",
        "As regards the root causes, there are two which should be taken into consideration. Firstly, emissions such as carbon dioxide are toxic cocktails that not only affect the atmosphere but also peoples health. Simply put, these emissions are not ozone-friendly so they cause  ozone layer depletion. Take exhaust fumes and noxious emissions from factories as salient samples; these fumes are destroying the ozone layer and expanding global warming. Additionally, greenhouse gases have various greenhouse effects of  which is causing climate change. To put it differently, these gases are leading to desertification and deforestation in many parts of the world.",
        "There are, however, some workable solutions to help global warming cope with this new phenomenon. One is step would be, reducing the usage of where he kills in order to decrease exhaust fumes. The fumes produced from vehicles are harmful to both atmosphere and human beings\u2019 health, thereby emitting the production of these harmful emissions is beneficial. A good illustration of this solution is expanding eco-friendly public transportation such as the subway. Another viable alternative is to plant more trees. To put it simply, making more green areas is very susceptible to cure-all problems on a large scale.",
        "To conclude, global warming is afflicted by emission pollution because of many reasons, the most important of which is exhaust fumes. In spite of all the contributing factors, proper insulation implemented by the construction of public transport and green areas can reduce the severity of this issue considerably."
