Do you agree with this view, or do you think that governments should limit the freedom of the media in some circumstances?",

        "Nowadays, mass media is the most effective method to produce ideas and thoughts, but some people misuse this platform. On the other hand, a growing number of communities believe that there should be no limitations on using electronic media. In this essay, I will look at both sides and draw some conclusions and personal opinions.",
        "To begin with, these days, society practices social media considerably compared to past times. Additionally, more time spent on social media can lead to addiction, which can be dangerous for humans because many of the thoughts they post on their social sites can not always be relevant or reliable. For instance, in India, the government has banned the Tiktok app because the nation posted vulgar and provocative videos that everyone could not watch. Therefore, in my opinion, the public should realize that it is their responsibility to stay away from lousy knowledge to keep their minds fresh.",
        "Moreover, most people make different accounts on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter which is legally not acceptable. Similarly, they support and share offensive videos from their fake accounts to hide their identity. For example, the findings of some studies reveal that 65% of youngsters use porn sites that are not suitable for their age in the whole world. That is why I firmly believe that parents and governments should strictly ban these sites for young school-going children; otherwise, they would have problems focusing on education.",
        "In contrast, the vast majority of the population support this statement that they should be free to handling media because this is their primary need. After all, some individuals cannot go outside, especially in older communities. Consequently, according to some folks, there should be no issue if they appropriately use television or the internet. As a result, they can easily connect with the whole world.",
        "All things considered, although it is a common belief that media is the only way to express ideas and information throughout the world. But, this is not that necessary like how the public use social publishing nowadays. So, I believe that governments should make some rules and regulations to operate the press."
