        "I am writing this letter to draw your attention to the food that was served to me during the flight. I am Leona, took a flight from Tronto to Seoul on 21 November 2019. My flight number was QE9230 and my seat number was F39.",
        "I would like to mention the problem I struggled with about the food, Firstly, the service was very poor. I had ordered some bread, but the attendant served me the wrong food. After that, I requested again for my food and got an unbelievable response. He insisted that is my fault. I am available to mistakes, but I want to point out that his attitude is unprofessional. It could be simply that if he just brought me the bread again, I wouldn't feel anything.",
        "Therefore, I request you to check the whole matter with the staff and I want to refund the fare of the flight. Also, the airline should educate customer service on whether is good or bad by themselves.",
        "Hoping to see your reply soon.",
