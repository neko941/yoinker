        "Some segments of society reckon that people should take care of their health and food; however, counterparts of the society insist that it is the liability of the government to see their mankind have good health. There are split opinions regarding the topic, though both have their pros and cons as per everyone\u2019s perspective. Therefore, before commenting on my decision, both opinions would be discussed.",
        "To embark on, there is no doubt for some people who would like to take responsibility for the diet individually. Firstly, they believe that adults have a free life and can make their own choices about what they eat and what exercise they do. For example, various studies conducted in the USA confirmed that everyone should take food as per their calories requirements to maintain fitness. Furthermore, everyone should do some physical exercise to sustain their strength. Thus, such basic care by people can lead to an improved state of health.",
        "Why government should take responsibility for their citizen? The underlying reason behind this is that they should restrict the advertisements of unhealthy products like tobacco, cigarette, alcohol.  To further corroborate the above view, a Harvard Health Alumni Study (2015) revealed that 50 per cent of people suffered from chronic gastritis disease due to an unhealthy diet in their daily routine because of addiction to alcohol. If the state government prohibit the manufacture of unnatural food, this will lead to a healthy lifestyle among communities. Moreover, the government should host some tv programs or seminars which give proper knowledge about health and diet. The more the government efforts, the better the health is.",
        "In conclusion, although it is the responsibility of both to take care of their physical state, everyone should know more about their health. I opine that the advantages of taking care of ourselves clearly outweigh the government\u2019s responsibility."
