        "I am very glad to express my feelings and inform you that we are working together on a networking presentation.",
        "We met last year at the annual function of the company and I am very well aware of your expertise in communication.",
        "My idea about this presentation is to structure it into three-phase from beginner, intermediate to advance level of networking skills with some motivational examples and  audience interaction at the end of each level. Moreover, we could elaborate on the power of networking in every field from business to politics with the help of a video demonstration that we could shoot before the day of the appearance.",
        "For the preparation for the final day, we should meet and practice the delivery, for me, the next weekdays are best to do it, if you want to change it, you kindly suggest your convenient dates and we can meet at our company auditorium for this purpose, as that place is the best for practice because we are going to perform in this auditorium at the upcoming annual function of a company.",
