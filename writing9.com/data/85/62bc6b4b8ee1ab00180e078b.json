        "Dear Mr White,",
        "I am writing to let you know that my wife, Maddie and I have planned to land in Canada soon. We will be staying in such a nice country for two years, therefore, it is of significance for us to rent comfortable accommodation during our stay.",
        "As Maddie has been admitted to a master's course at the University of Ontario, we have to reside in Canada from September first. So since we're in mid-summer I guess it is a good time to start looking for a small condo so that when we arrive we will have our house ready.",
        "We would like to live in a condo within walking distance of the university in order to minimise the commuting expenses as much as possible.",
        "Although she receives funds from the university, it is necessary for us to manage expenses so I would appreciate it if you can propose to me a one-bedroom condo costing between twelve hundred and fifteen hundred dollars.",
        "Yours faithfully,",
