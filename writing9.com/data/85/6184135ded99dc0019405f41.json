        "Education plays an important role in improving human resources of the countries, which some people believe  should be accessible and available for every student, regardless of their financial statements. In my perspective, I strongly agree with this idea for several reasons, described in the following paragraphs.",
        "the first reason that authorities should advocate  financial support to all students is to reduce social disparity. To reduce the gap between rich and poor people,  education is a promising method that all developed countries implement. For example, the government of the Netherland provide  scholarship to students who study at the kindergarten level until the university level. Consequently, according to the BBC news, Netherland is ranked in the top 5 countries that people have good liveliness in 2020, which the average  individual income is high. Therefore, providing the opportunity for education can improve the well-being of the population.",
        "Moreover, the nation will definitely get the benefit from investing in  schooling, as the country will have experts in several particular fields of study to help the government better the nation. For instance, during Covid -19 pandemic, the countries that are pioneers in producing the vaccine against the virus, are the countries, which prioritize  medical researches, and many innovations to overcome the pandemic are invented by students in universities. As a result, the nation will get  advantages due to its fast recovery.",
        "In conclusion, I absolutely admit  that the government should support the finance for education to all students because its consequences will provide several benefits to the nation including the reduction in human disparity, and an increase in experts to help develop the country."
