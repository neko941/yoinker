        "It is predicted that humans would require to colonize other planets or moons by the end of the current century as they have been polluting the Earth in numerous ways since the age of industrialization. Some people believe that valuable resources should be spent on studying more about these habitable planets while others think that money should be diverted to make the Earth greener. I agree with the former opinion.",
        "To begin with, it cannot be denied that the present technology and knowledge is not advanced enough to allow us to survive on other worlds. Tax money and human resources could be utilized to gain a better understanding of our galaxy. Moreover, in-depth research in the various scientific fields, such as high-efficiency fuels, tracking systems, and artificial intelligence, is required if we aim to achieve settlement on a different planet. For example, it takes nearly half of a person's lifetime to travel to a habitable moon of Jupiter. Therefore, research is highly essential to solve this issue of slower space travel.",
        "On the other hand, some people argue that space exploration is a waste of energy and money which could be used to solve current world problems, including pollution. Not only can we develop eco-friendly products with this money, but it could also be used to spread awareness about the Earth's deteriorating condition. For instance, localized campaigns in schools could be organized with the aid of public money.",
        "To conclude, I believe that even if humans try their best to save the Earth, its collapse is unavoidable in the near future. To save humankind, it is paramount that we invest and pool resources today to learn more about potential future homes."
