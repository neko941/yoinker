        "I am writing this letter on behalf of all the students staying at your property at B12, William Street.",
        "As you are well aware that we do not have hot water and heating system for the last two months. We are extremely disappointed due to the inconvenience caused due to no hot water and heating. While I really appreciate that you have sent a few workmen to rectify the problem, however, they were unsuccessful despite spending a considerable amount of time. I believe that the best solution would be to get it replaced instead of repairing which might only help for a limited period of time.",
        "Therefore, I would like to propose a way to resolve this situation. One of my friends works part-time at a plumbing company. After a thorough analysis of the hot broiler, he was able to identify the issue and came up with an appropriate replacement at his company. The price seems to be reasonable and will be able to complete the installation by the end of next week.",
        "I would be grateful if you could reply as soon as possible so that this matter can be resolved to everyone\u2019s satisfaction.",
        "Yours sincerely,",
