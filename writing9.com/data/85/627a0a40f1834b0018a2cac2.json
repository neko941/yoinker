        "I am writing this letter in connection with the problems that would arise when the local airport near my accommodation becomes bigger and have more flights. Hence, I am requesting you to publish an editorial in this direction.",
        "I live in the paradise colony which is just 15 km away from the Chandigarh Domestic airport and is home to a thousand  people including children and elders.",
        "As of now, it allows only a limited number of flights which is convenient because most of them fly during the daytime. However, the increasing number of flights will create problems owing to their timings. Moreover, they will create deafening noises which are impossible to avoid, especially at night which will definitely disturb the sleep cycle.",
        "The foremost reason to oppose the development is that it will certainly disturb our day to day activities. Besides, in view of its expansion, the beautiful park which is the beauty of the area will also be demolished. In other words, it will not just create disturbance in our lives but also destruct the natural beauty of the area.",
        "I hope that you will consider my opinion and publish it in your newspaper. Looking forward to hearing from you soon.",
        "Your's faithfully,",
