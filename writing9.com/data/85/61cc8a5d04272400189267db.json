        "Due to an increasing number of online shopping websites, local shops, in towns and cities, will eventually be vanished. I strongly agree with the statement, and I think that online shopping provides numerous offers with different options and, in fact, it is very time-saving.",
        "Firstly, unbeatable deals and a wide range of varieties lure consumers to shop online. For instance, E-shopping platforms, have attracted a young crowd by offering deals and discounts. This is because these sites want the customer to shop online and enhance their outreach. In addition, the sites offer a better range of products, especially in the fashion department, which is not possible for a local store due to financial and space constraints. For these reasons, small stores will never be able to cope with them.",
        "Secondly, shopping on the internet saves so much time because individuals can select and buy all the essentials from a single website. Moreover, E-commerce sites have introduced single-day delivery, which is very promising to the customers. Websites, for example, provided one-day delivery for all metro cities due to which individuals avoid going to the physical store. Also, if you are a Premium Member of any particular website, you can avail free delivery. In this present world, where every individual is busy working, shopping online can save them a plethora of time.",
        "To conclude, due to an increase in the online shopping trend, I agree that Small Medium Enterprise stores will be closed. Shopping on the internet has many benefits, from a variety of offers and discounts to single-day home delivery. While people will benefit from this changing trend, local stores will face survival."
