        "Dear Sir,",
        "This well-considered letter regards your erroneous thought regarding the improvisation of the gathering area.",
        "Several issues have been raised by the visitors who arrive at the reception area.Firstly,they have a problem with the sitting arrangements,as there is a lack of comfortable sofas.Secondly,proper ventilation and cooling is also their concern.",
        "As it is said,\"First impression is the last impression\", people develop an image of the company after looking at the welcome area.Therefore, it is very important for the reputation and goodwill of the company.Adding some more reclining chairs for the old age people and a few cosy sofas will help to solve the problem.Installation of a few air conditioners will provide the required cooling needed. Furthermore, I think setting up an aquarium near the greeting desk will enhance the beauty of the place.",
        "I respectfully request you to immediately address the matter for the growth and progress of the firm.",
        "Yours sincerely,",
