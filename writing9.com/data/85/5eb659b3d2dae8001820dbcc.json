        "It is often argued that advertising is necessary to promote their products to the consumers. Some people might think that the clients may be seen the rising majority of promotions by racing corporations. This essay will address the perspective of the advertisement to suggest the issues and solutions.",
        "First of all, many companies tend to show the fake advertisements. In other words, an abundance of exaggerated promotions might disappoint consumers because they would expect some affordable goods that they need to purchase. However, some of the price are not the same as advertising because sometimes the companies compete to their rival industries which means they may collect the consumers with the wrong information. And also, some corporations might indicate the aggressive advertisements which affect children\u2019s behaviour because they believe everything they have seen directly. Therefore, some bad effects would happen from the stimulated information.",
        "On the other hand, there are some methods to solve this phenomenon. In spite of the fact that some false advertisements exist, companies must express the real values of the products honestly to not lose the trust of the customers. Furthermore, the government would forbid when industries promote the inappropriate flyers. For example, the council may reinforce the policy for the violent promotions to protect the youth people because they are too young to determine the correct decision. Thus, the country might give a punishment for the corporations which do not intend the law to improve inhabitants\u2019 satisfaction.",
        "In conclusion, many people might be given with a plenty of competitive flyers nowadays. The nation and industry should support to not waste consumers\u2019 budget."
