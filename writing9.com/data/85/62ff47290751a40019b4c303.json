        "So what happened was that my team leader has recently moved to another department and my boss let my team members vote for the new leader. I heard from my teammates that they voted for me because of my amicable and broad-minded personality. That was very kind of them I had to say",
        "Anyway, I am gonna invite my colleagues as well as my family and friends to my party to celebrate my job promotion. I guess that there will be around fifty to sixty people over there, and I will make sure to prepare some stunning foods and beverages for you and my other guests.",
        "I first wanted to host this party at my place so that it feels more homey and comfy. However, it was unfortunate that I had to get my house fixed because of gas leaking this Monday. Therefore, I have rented a gorgeous decorated room in the central building, which I was very pleased with.",
        "I hope that you can make it to my party, and please DM me if anything suddenly comes up.",
