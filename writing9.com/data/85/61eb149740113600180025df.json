        "My name is Jay, and I have been enjoying the service of your store for five years. Today, however, I am writing to complain about the smartwatch that I bought from your store two days ago. Also, I want to address the poor performance of the store's client service.",
        "Let me describe what went wrong with my smartwatch. In the beginning, everything worked fine without any noticeable issue, but after 48 hours I noticed a problem with the battery. Although  the vendor's manual mentioned that the battery should last for 16 hours at least, mine lasts for only two hours. I have been calling  the  customer service at your store to help me out, but they never called me back.",
        "I would kindly ask you to fully refund me. I hope you will consider my situation favourably. Should you require any more information please do not hesitate to ask.",
        "Waiting for your reply.",
