        "I am writing this letter to suggest a new printer I came to know which will be very helpful in our office. I believe it will draw the attention of everyone because of its state-of-the-art design and cost-effectiveness.",
        "As far as I have known, the printer was placed on the market last month. It is featured with a compact inkjet. It is neither too big nor too small with 2 feet in height. The width and the breadth are 3 feet respectively. On top of that, it can duplex photocopy and print up to 50 papers spontaneously.",
        "I am sure that the device is going to be potentially fruitful in our workplace. There are hundreds of contracts that need printing every day, so it will be time-consuming and unproductivity if we continue to use the old machinery. This printer will make the job easier and get a better print quality compared to the previous counterpart. In addition, it does not consume too much voltage, and even if the power is an outage, it could work well with its own battery.",
        "Having considered the usefulness, I am planning to take quotations from the three vendors. If you feel interested in it, please confirm with me and I will take you to the electronic stores for further information.",
        "I am looking forward to hearing your prompt response.",
        "Yours sincerely,",
