The account I am holding was a salary account which was later converted into a savings account. I am writing this letter in response to an email regarding overdrawn of $240 and in exchange for $70 will be charged concerning this.",

Last week, I tried to withdraw money from this account and the transaction was not only a failure but I also received a statement and emails about the insolvent and the penalty. Immediately, I took the statement to verify the same. Hence, I presume that it would be a clerical error you may check my statement for detailed clarification.",
