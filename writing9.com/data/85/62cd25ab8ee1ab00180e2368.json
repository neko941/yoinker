        "I, Kuljeet Kaur, residing nearby locality, writing to make an enquiry if you still need a helper at home. I can provide you with the facility of a helper and I can do every household task whether it is cooking or cleaning. Moreover, I am having experience dealing with children too. I can do babysitting for your kids too.",
        "Currently, I am in a dire need of funds due to my education. Thus, I want to do some part-time work so that I can pay the annual fees of the educational institute on time.",
        "I can render my services in the evening from 4 pm to 7 pm. Apart from this, I'm also available during the morning time. However, I'm not able to come from 12 noon to 3 pm due to my classes. Thus, it would be really commendable if you could provide me with this opportunity.",

        "Thanks.",
        "Yours Faithfully,",
