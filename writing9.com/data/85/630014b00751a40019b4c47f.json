        "Nowadays, human beings moving abroad have a major impact on local communities as well as the global economy. As a result, such occasions may cause unpleasant consequences.",
        "Firstly, the vast majority of immigrants are coming from the so-called Third World. What is more, most of them were below the poverty line in their homeland, by reason of raging fights, natural disasters, or unstable economies, which are spread in developing countries. Consequently, such individuals (economic migrants) cross the border seeking better employment as well as more joyful living conditions. Secondly, in this day and age, plenty of people all over the world are looking for  political asylum. Journalists and bloggers from regions deprived of liberty are perfect examples of this trend.",
        "Concerning the outcomes of such a tendency, we cannot overlook the negative points of this phenomenon. First of all, lifting someone out of poverty is a major issue for the government which provides refugee assistance programs. In other words, the country will have to spend a great deal of money to help migrants to assimilate  if they were previously on the margins of society. On the other hand, crime may be bred, due to the actions of defiant foreigners. Furthermore, natives might take to the streets drawing attention to the possible problem of the soaring number of human beings sleeping rough. As an example, groundbreaking research carried out by the British government declares that over 1/20 of the UK population are refugees living on the streets. Moreover, the key factor is that 30% of needy people are street children in desperate need of accommodation together with qualitative tuition.",
        "Taking everything into consideration, though there is a heavy burden of maintaining immigrants along with a high chance of breeding crime, developed countries should provide assistance to those who are faced with severe problems."
