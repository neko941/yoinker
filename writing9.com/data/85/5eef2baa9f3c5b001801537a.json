        "There are a variety of styles that an architect could follow to build a new house. Some prefer to follow the local theme while others choose to design their own dwelling with their unique interest. In my opinion, I would like to endorse the freedom of the condo holder.",
        "On the one hand, following the existing style of old houses nearby has its own advantages. Firstly, the dwelling owner could save a significant amount of designer costs when they reuse the local theme compared to the modelling a novel version. Secondly, an area that has a unified residence form may look more aesthetic than arbitrary ones. There are a lot of areas in the world, which are famous for their beautiful and unified house architecture. For instance, the traditional village of South Korea in Seoul, which has kept the old style in all the new houses in that area becomes an attractive tourist destination.",
        "On the other hand, the interest of the house owner should be considered as the priority factor. Some people may live in the same house for the whole of their lives; living in a home that suits their style allows them to feel happier all that long. Even they live in a place for a short period, the old fashion of a place might not meet their requirements. Furthermore, the diversity and innovation in a space design is an inspiring factor impact on human creativity and emotion; therefore, the freedom in home construction should be encouraged. For example, Google and Facebook are well known for their encouraging creativity scheme; their building designs are full of colour and distinguish both inside and outside compared to other buildings nearby.",
        "In conclusion, although designing a new house referring to local architecture benefits both holder and local appearance, I firmly believe that the freedom to build our own new homes is an essential demand."
