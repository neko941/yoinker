        "Read the book",
        "Nowadays, I am studying piano activities. I will study hard and I want to be a great musician like you. I go to tafe once a time every week. As the course has 36 lessons, I will finish the plan in a year. In class, the teacher will show us how to use fingers and how to follow the musical notation. Sometimes I discuss playing skills with my classmate and talk about who are genius musicians in the world.",
        "I know you are always busy in your life, I still wonder if you can give me some advice on my study course and can revise my finger gesture on piano. If you can help me with my musical activities, I can be more confident and would increase my performance on the course.",
        "Looking forward to hearing from you",
