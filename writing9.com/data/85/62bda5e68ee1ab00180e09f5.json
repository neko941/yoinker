        "In the modern world, it is crucial for everyone to speak more than one language. It has been stated that children should acquire another language, apart from their mother tongue, as soon as they enter school. This essay will argue why I believe it is significant for a child to learn another language when they start school.",
        "Many parents are concerned that it can be overwhelmed for children to learn more than one language at a time. As they are protective of their kids, they would want them to be able to take the time to explore their likes and dislikes rather than forcing their kids to take on a language they are not familiar with. For instance, those who learn more than one language at a young age can go undergo tremendous pressure as well as stress which can hinder their learning abilities. Thus, many see it as unnecessary.",
        "On the contrary, there is a number of parents who encourage their children to learn another foreign language. At such young age, a child's brain is developing and at its best capacity to acquire new knowledge like  languages. For example, people often enrol their kids on tutoring schools to improve and practice their linguistic skills. It is the first step in paving way for them to grab more opportunities in the future, due to the language skill set they have learnt. For these reasons, I strongly believe it is important for them to learn foreign languages as soon as they enter the academic institutions.",
        "In conclusion, this essay argued the importance of learning a foreign language as soon as children enter school. In my opinion, although it can be overwhelming for them, I believe it is crucial to be able to speak more than one language to keep up with the world."
