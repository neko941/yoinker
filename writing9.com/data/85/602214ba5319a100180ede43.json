        "Nowadays, human activities create negative effects on  plants and animal species. Following this, some people believe that it is already too late to take any reactions to this problem, whereas others argue that effective measures can be taken to  combat these situations. From my perspective,  human beings could still make a difference .",
        "some people hold the view that the damages caused by human activities to wildlife are irreversible. The major reason is that many species of plants and animals have disappeared from our planet, and it is impossible to get them back. For example, polar bears are not able to take a break while swimming because there are no lands for them to live on  as the glaciers are melting   as a result of global warming. Meanwhile, human activity is the main cause of global warming. Hence, in those people's opinions, nothing can be done to tackle this problem.",
        "However, on the other hand, the government should introduce a new law about the restriction of deforestation. This is because the disappearance of forests will speed up the extinction of species.For instance, if the government outlawed deforestation, many people would not be able to cut the plants, which helps to protect the habitat for animals to live. As a result, the variety of species is guaranteed. Similarly, individuals ought to raise their awareness of environmental issues  . Therefore, it would not be impossible to save the endangered species.",
        "In summary, although there are some   in saving plants and animals in danger, it is our responsibility to save the world from the negative influence."
