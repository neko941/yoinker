        "I am writing this letter to apologise for having to reschedule our meeting. We decided to meet on Saturday, 12th of July but due to some ,reasons I have to put off the meeting to 14th of July. Also, I would like to change the place of the meeting to the Gold Hotel.",
        "I feel awful about the situation. I understand that you have reserved this date for the meeting and now it will not be easy for you to reschedule it. Let me explain the situation in detail. Actually, there is an annual function at my daughter's school and she is going to perform for the first time. I have to be there for her moral support and as she is performing mimicry, she needs me to help with her dressing as well. Even though this is an important meeting for our business, I always believe my family comes first. These are the important milestones that we will cherish later.",
        "I once again sincerely apologize for this trouble. Please let me know if that date and place are convenient for you.",
        "Thank you for your understanding.",
        "Yours sincerely,",
