        "Dear Sir,",
        "I am writing this to complain about the headset that I have received recently as part of an employee onboarding process.",
        "As part of my job responsibility, I need to facilitate meetings every day  between stakeholders and the technology team. Therefore, it is a mandatory requirement that the headset should be good enough to perform my duties. However, the headset which you supplied is defective and bearly audible to participants in my meeting.",
        "Furthermore, the problem became worst in yesterday's meeting when I was unable to deliver the presentation to the business. Although I was well prepared and expecting an approval on our business proposal  unfortunately everything went in vain as none of the meeting attendees was able to hear my speech.",
        "Therefore, I would request with help desk support team to immediately take an action on this and replace it with a new headset. I really appreciate it if you could send me a Bluetooth headset. Because with that I can even take my office laptop to the projector room.",
        "I hope you will immediately take an action and shipped the new headset. Feel free to reach out to me with any questions.",
        "Yours Sincerely,",
