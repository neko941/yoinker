Honestly, I am working hard to collaborate with my team and enhance sales, but I am afraid that I do not have enough experience to lead the whole sales department. I do remember that there is a management course in our headquarters in Canada that is specially designed for new leaders. I am quite positive that this six-month training will help me to upgrade my managerial skills.",
