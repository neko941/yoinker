I learnt from our internal newsletter that consistent quality problems of the products from our factory in Eastern China had prompted customer complaints and higher than expected warranty costs. I am writing to volunteer myself to go there for six months to help fix these issues.",

        "During my temporary leave, my work can be taken up by Ms Cynthia Lee in our department. She and her subordinates also have some experience in my field. In addition, actually the product quality here is very stable this year and we do not foresee much product risk in the coming six months.",
        "I understand there is a process for the group human resources department to select the right candidate. Please let me know about the procedures I need to come across and I would be particularly interested to know about the tax implications of working there. I will be cooperative with your arrangements. Thank you in advance.",
