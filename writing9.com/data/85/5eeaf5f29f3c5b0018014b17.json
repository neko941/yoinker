        "PEOPLE TEND TO THINK DIFFERENT ON A SINGLE ISSUE AS SOME BELIEVE THAT CONSIDERING CHILDREN TO MAKE THEIR OWN CHOICES WILL RAISE SELFISHNESS AMONG THEM WHILE OTHERS SUGGEST IT IS CRUCIAL FOR CHILDREN TO HAVE SOME FREEDOM AS IT WILL BOOST THEIR CONFIDENCE. IN MY OPINION, PARENTS SHOULD ALLOW CHILDREN TO FORMULATE SOME STANCE, WHICH WILL ULTIMATELY BENEFIT YOUNGSTERS IN NEAR FUTURE.",
        "ON THE ONE HAND, JUVENILE OF TODAY WILL BE THE STALWART OF FUTURE, AND THAT\u2019S WHY INTENSIVE CARE SHOULD BE RENDERED TOWARDS THEM DURING CHILDHOOD. MOST OF THE DEVELOPMENTS ESPECIALLY CRITICAL THINKING AND COGNITIVE ABILITIES ARE MODIFIED DURING THIS PERIOD. FOR EXAMPLE, A STUDY CONDUCTED IN AMERICA ILLUSTRATES THAT YOUNGS WHO WERE ALLOWED TO CHOOSE THEIR OWN TOYS BECOME MORE SELF-ESTEMMED AND CONFIDENT WHEN THEY GROW UP THAN THEIR COUNTERPARTS, WHO DID NOT HAVE THAT LUXURY. HENCE, PARENTS AS WELL TEACHERS BELONGING TO ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SHOULD BE MORE CAREFUL REGARDING THIS ISSUE AND ENSURE THAT CHILD ARE GIVEN SOME LIBERTY TO FORMULATE DAY-TO-DAY DECISION.",
        "ON THE OTHER HAND, WHEN CHILDREN DO NOT ENJOY THE FREEDOM TO INITIATE AN IDEA AND GUARDIANS DETACH THEM FROM EVERYDAY TASKS, THEY TURN INTO AN INDIVIDUAL, WHO IS SELFISH AND LESS SYMPATHETIC. CONSEQUENTLY, THEY CAN NOT FELL SORROW OF OTHERS AND GRADULLY INVOLVE INTO VARIOUS TYPES OF DELINQUEMCY SUCH AS ROBBERY, THEFT AND SO ON. FOR INSTANCE, A STUDY IN CHINA REVEALS THAT CHILDREN WHO ARE LESS PASSIONATE AND UNSOCIAL POSSESS HIGHER POSSIBILITY TO ENGAGE IN ANTI-SOCIAL ACTIVITIES. RESULTANTLY, IN ORDER TO FORM A BETTER SOCIETY AS WELL AS COUTRY WE SHOULD ALLOW CHILDREN TO IMPLEMENT DICISIONS, WHICH AFFECTS THEIR OWN LIFE AND BOOST SELF-RESPECT.",
        "IN CONCLUSION, I BELIVE THAT BOTH PARENTS AND TEACHERS SHOULD TEACH CHILDREN HOW TO DECIDE ON EVERYDAY MATTERS HOWEVER THERE SHOULD BE SOME BOUNDARY AS THEY ARE TENDER AND SOFT MINDED."
