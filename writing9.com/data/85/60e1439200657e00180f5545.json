        "Globally, many university students are increasingly opting to study in foreign countries. While the feeling of loneliness and away from home may make them more vulnerable to emotional imbalance, the culturally diversified environment abroad helps them in holistic personality development. In my opinion, the advantages of studying away from home country are far more despite having some disadvantages.",
        "Firstly, studying abroad provides ample opportunities to have life experiences resulting in a steep learning curve. Learning in an environment that is inclusive of peers from varied cultural backgrounds not only leads to a rich experience but also develops the learner\u2019s overall personality. For instance, university pupils in the same class can share knowledge and learn more about other cultures. Consequently, these learnings help them in real life when they enter the corporate world and prepare them to face upcoming challenges. Therefore, pursuing education abroad enhances learning and helps people in their careers.",
        "Conversely, some students may have nostalgic feelings while staying away from their homes. Even though they are exposed to people from diverse backgrounds, they still might feel lonely as for them family provides strong emotional support. There have been many such examples in the past that show some undergraduates have faced a lot of depression in foreign countries and have experienced emotional turmoil being not in contact with their relatives and friends.",
        "To summarise, there has been a rising trend of pursuing education overseas as part of the higher studies and career. Although some students may feel depressed and find challenges in coping up with the pressure, yet most of them experience advanced learning with people from different cultural locations. Ultimately, I am inclined to believe that the advantages of studying abroad outweigh the disadvantages."
