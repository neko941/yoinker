        "A highly controversial issue today relates to whether elder persons have more value than the younger population. In this essay, I am going to examine this question from both points of view and then explain why I believe the argument for the younger population has greater value compared to the older generation.",
        "To begin, there are cultures and people who argue that the value of younger people considerably outweighs that bought by elders. The main reason for believing this is that youngsters are more enthusiastic and ready to learn new things. It is also possible to say that young people learn new things fast compared to old people because they are raised in a fast-paced environment. One good illustration of this is when a university has conducted  research on young and old people in learning new technology in a smartphone, where young people were fast to learn and use to the new smartphones.",
        "On the other hand, others believe that old people possess more value than the young population.  It is often argued that old people allow culture and history not to diminish. People often have this opinion because old people don't easily forget their culture or history and they follow them regularly. A second point is that older people don't welcome changes and stick to what they do regularly. A particularly good example here is when people were asked if they choose the new lifestyle or the old lifestyle, most of the elder generation people have voted for old lifestyle and this proves that they would like to keep the culture and history alive.",
        "In conclusion, I believe that both arguments have their merits. On balance, however, I feel that the younger population have greater value than the old generation. This is because of the reason that young people are focused and can adapt to changes quickly and easily."
