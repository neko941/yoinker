        "You will be delighted to know that I am ready to set up new entrepreneurship with you. In fact, I have been thinking about the same for one year but due to financial constraints, I was unable to do that. As you already told me that you would spend 25 per cent of the total amount on it, similarly, I would do the same.",
        "Apparently, the rest of the money could be arranged by a bank loan. In this way, it would be easy for us to manage the finances. Moreover, I am good at communication skills and advertisement promotion since I have a full year of marketing experience. Therefore, we should look for the legal proceeding to start a fresh clothing store.",
        "Basically, I have main two reasons to do partnership with you. Firstly, we did work together for 4 years and would able to run this company smoothly. Secondly, I am already looking for a job, so it would be great if we would start fresh work.",
        "Do not hesitate to make any discussion.",
