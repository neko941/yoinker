        "Dear Lee,",
        "Hope you\u2019re doing good. I am happy about your placement at the University of West London, it is indeed a good decision that you have taken to study there. Anyway, I got your letter in which you had asked for some advice on a place to stay, I will share my thoughts with you, and I hope it\u2019ll be helpful.",
        "Let me first tell you where I stayed. It is an apartment located next to the railway station and it\u2019s quite closer to the university. I use to walk to college, it took me only ten minutes to get there. Moreover, it's a one bedroom flat with a washroom and a shared kitchen area.",
        "I think you can find the best place for you to stay through the local newspaper, there are several advertisements published on a weekly basis on various places available for rent. However, make sure you don\u2019t choose any place closer to the city area as the rent is apparently quite expensive. Also, avoid shared rooms, even though, it might be cheap, it could be a disturbance.",
        "Hope you find a place soon and do let me know if you need any further help.",
