        "I hope you and your family are doing good. I write this letter to request your kind attention and care on our house when we leave for our hometown for a week.",
        "Yesterday, my mother called me and said, she had fallen in the bathroom and sprained her right leg. Fortunately,  she informed the neighbours and they did possible assistance and medical care. the doctor advised two weeks of bed rest for her. Moreover, she is alone there, I had to go and help her in this situation. Thus, we are planning to leave tonight. I hope you can assist me with this. In particular, you don't need to worry much about it. If it is possible you can feed the love birds, water the garden, and just collect the newspapers and bills. If there is something strange happens you can call me. I would give you a spare key for my gate.",
        "I hope this is ok for you and looking forward to hearing from you soon.",
        "Thanks in advance for considering my humble request.",
        "Yours faithfully",
