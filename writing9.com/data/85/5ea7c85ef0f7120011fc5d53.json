        "Dear James,",
        "Thanks for your letter after such a long time, and I hope you\u2019re doing pretty well. Firstly, let me tell you how happy I am hearing you running your new commercial business. Secondly, I\u2019m writing in response to your letter regarding your request for my opinion introducing an appropriate product that you could import from my country.",
        "Do you remember last year when you came here to visit me, I took you to this coffee house, and they\u2019d served us some kind of tea? You drank it and enjoyed it a lot because of its high quality. This product is called Green Tea with beautiful packing and a reasonable price. I\u2019ve thoroughly analyzed this product and had found out that it is produced here and not only its quality is guaranteed, but they considered an unbelievable trade discount for foreign customers for large quantities. I think it\u2019s a big opportunity for you to make an order on their website www.GreenTea1.com. If you go online, you\u2019ll face an option called foreign customer service. Click on it and fill up your information. In their privacy and policy, it is mentioned that after your application, they\u2019ll call you in 2 or 3 business days.",
        "Need you any further information, I\u2019ll be glad to help. I hope you make it.",
