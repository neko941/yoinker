        "Youngsters of today are subjected to search for full-time jobs with more untiring perseverance in a large number of nations. This troublesome situation is attributed to a growing demand for intellectually demanding professions and a worldwide recession caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.",
        "One of the principal causes of this issue is that menial jobs in manufacturing factories can be encroached on by artificial intelligence. This is because the young are likely to have less sophisticated skills and take up repetitive work, which has been undergoing a gradual transformation to robots' work. Although technological advancement can generate new employment opportunities, they are encouraged to have expertise and experience of all shapes and sizes if getting involved in computer-related occupations. Therefore, it is a herculean task to engage in permanent ones. In order to mitigate the detrimental influences of this hindrance, governments should exhort them to participate in vocational training courses. If the jobless young are captivated by these lessons, they could acquire professional techniques, leading to career prospects in the foreseeable future.",
        "Another primary reason is that the COVID-19 pandemic of an unprecedented scale has thwarted normal economic activities. For example, innumerable businesses have curtailed their annual sales, and employees have been fired to overcome a plethora of financial difficulties. Under such circumstances, students and unemployed youths cannot find stable work, as most companies also confront their own deficits and cannot afford to employ additional labourers. The most effective countermeasure against this menace is that authorities should provide financial aid to some corporations suffering from a tremendous loss triggered by the widespread infection. Provided that they are able to improve financial conditions, they will be motivated to recruit extra applicants.",
        "To summarize, young people are impeded from living a stable life by vocations, which require a great deal of intelligence, and infectious diseases. Each measure against these problems correlates the governmental actions with youths and businesses respectively."
