        "It is a contentious topic of discussion  on what criteria the educational institutes must select beginners.As several individuals believe that academic potential plays an indispensable role in selecting pupils .While others contradict this approach and depict that the students with distinct skills must study together.I profoundly agree with the latter notion.Moreover,I would like to shed light on both views in the upcoming paragraphs.",
        "To commence with,Undoubtedly some denizens gives the opinion that the schools should select the trainee on the basis of academic abilities gives the first and foremost reason that it will not only ensure the competitive environment in the classroom but also it will make their learning better as well as it will widen their knowledge.For instance,enormous studies have consistently found that students with similar academic backgrounds compete with other pupils.Therefore, their chances to get the expertise of their course is very high and it will ultimately lead to their prosperous future.",
        "Nonetheless, another section of society believes that there must not be any type of partiality at the educational institutes.In spite of the different abilities of the students, the academy should promote equality among adolescents that will help them in building their strong moral character.Furthermore,it will help a learner to vast their knowledge in distinct areas.For example,a person who is a master in sports can make a scholar learn about pivotal skills of life like patience, a determination that is required in sports.Subsequently,to make pupils get exposure to different activities,the institution should have a class of learners with enormous skills.",
        "In conclusion,Although selecting a pupil in accordance with their academic potential has abundant benefits like learners can gain proficiency and ample knowledge in their courses as they are sitting with the students of same capabilities yet the academy must not ignore the advantages of learning in a school with distinct abilities students such as solving the issues with a unique approach.In the end,I firmly believe that a class filled with myriad abilities students would make individuals learn in a broad perspective in comparison with the class of same academic skills students."
