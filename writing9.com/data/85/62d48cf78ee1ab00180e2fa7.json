        "As you heard, there is no proper bus schedule in our place and we are suffering a lot as none of us from this village will attend schools and offices on time. We are in a situation wherein, we do not know when the bus will arrive and departure and this is not at all expected in our place. For example, a few  school students could not attend their competitive exam due to unplanned bus schedules and not sure how long this will continue?",
        "In order to fix this problem, we would recommend  you to please take immediate action and make sure that all bus drivers are following the timetable promptly. In addition, if you could provide some training to bus drivers along with some sudden audits would be highly appreciated.",
        "I look forward to hearing a response to this letter. Hope there will be a change in drivers and follow the timetable on time. If we do not see any progress and we would not hesitate to take this next level as well.",
