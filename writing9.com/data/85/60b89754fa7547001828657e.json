        "It is often argued that the purpose of the amusement schedules on television channel ought to inform the spectators about existing crucial problems in the community.

Thus, it is obvious that reputed TV programs can most efficiently create  awareness of social troubles among individuals.",
        "On the other hand, admittedly, transmitting message related to social troubles is a narrow field of learning. As all age groups of people spend a considerable portion of their time in front of TV sets, lessons from all different sectors of education ought to be broadcasted on  TV programs. For example, different scientific research, technological invention, and wildlife information can be shown in different TV programs in order to increase the basic knowledge about humans\u2019 surroundings.

In my opinion, all the TV contents should teach the audience a great number of topics, so that the valuable time of the viewers may be used appropriately."
