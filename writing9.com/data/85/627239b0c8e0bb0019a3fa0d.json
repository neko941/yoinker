All of the people who attended the event were extremely thrilled to see the giant chandelier and extremely friendly staff. Also, the supply of unlimited drinks and mocktails was relished by all of the team members and was fulfilling.",
        "However, I would like to bring to your notice one aspect related to food quality on which I received quite an unhappy response. To begin with, the food was not only stale but was also bitter in taste because of which the clients felt uneasy eating and later some faced health issues. On top of that, lunch is supposed to be served hot and fresh but it was too cold and also vegetarian dishes were not provided.",
        "It would be highly appreciated if in future the hotel staff would be mindful of letting everyone know the menu and the lunchtime this will ensure everyone knows what is provided and by what time. Also, please hire experienced chefs as they have the utmost understanding of customer taste requirements.",
        "Please let me know in case of any questions.",
