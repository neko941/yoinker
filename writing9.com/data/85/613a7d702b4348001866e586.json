        "Nowadays, people have many topics to debate. In that, the noticeable one is, about revealing the research evidence to the public. Because, a set of folks argue that, it is necessary to announce the information to the crowd. On the contrary, few others opine that it is not needed to inform society. But in my personal opinion, I strongly believe that it is mandatory to update the recent happenings in the globe to the community. This essay will examine both views in detail in the following paragraphs.",
        "To begin with, sharing the ideas of the research field helps to seek feedback and suggestions from experts. Perhaps, this will be a real motivation to scholars. Moreover, in, business the innovating ideas from the scientific platform assist to launch new products. However, this can bring economic growth to the company. Apart from these, adding up to the minute information in the curriculum helps the students to drag the current world into their hands. To summarize, if a scientist shows repugnance to reveal his invention, it will not bring any economic developments to the nation.",
        "On the other hand, public announcements of the report make the population panic sometimes. To exemplify, the use of nuclear energy can change the world, even though people neglect it, because of the dangerous side-effect it can cause. In addition, the other reason to withhold information is patency concern. Although it is the basic right of the inventor, he should make it accessible to the public also. To summarize, sometimes the citizens may get scared due to the universal announcement of innovation.",
        "Finally, the message shared helps the society to get up to date knowledge about the globe in all the necessary fields, although it has some demerits. So, in my opinion, it is good to update the innovations to the public."
