        "My elder brother will be coming to your city early next month, and this will be a great opportunity to send it through him. Kindly help me deliver the purse to his hotel when he arrives. I will send the address of the hotel and his phone number to you via the Whatsapp platform. I have also told him to refund you for the delivery fees.",
