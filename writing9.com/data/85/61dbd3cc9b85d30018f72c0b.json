I complained to the hotel staff to fix this issue but they were enabled to make it good. It created a bad impact of the company  on our foreign clients. Most of the investors didn't take part in this event.",
        "At last, I just want you should check all the facilities before booking the hotel because I don't want this embarrassment in upcoming future events and I appreciate your dedication because the other hospitality of the hotel is overall good.",
