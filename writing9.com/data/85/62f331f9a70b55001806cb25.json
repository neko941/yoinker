The colour of the floor at my home is not suitable for the new decoration style, so a group of handymen have been working on the floor section since last week, which causes a lot of cluttering and dragging.",
        "I am incredibly sorry for causing the noise for you. As you might have noticed that my lifestyle tends to be peaceful and quiet, and I rarely caused loud during the 10 years since we became neighbours. I hope you are able to accept my excuse and forgive me.",
        "I know your daughter will attend the national examination next month, so she desperately needs a quiet environment to study. I promise you I will ask the handymen to work between 8am to 3pm on weekdays when your daughter is not at home.",
        "Sorry again. I wish you can understand the reason why I bring some noise to you. If you would like to discuss this issue with me further, I would be extremely delighted to talk with you.",
