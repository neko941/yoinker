        "It is often argued that constructing new railway lines for speed trains between cities is worth and necessary to invest with a great deal of money, however, some commentators believe that the expenditure should be invested in the development of existing public transport is more useful. In my opinion, I am strongly inclined to the view that the money should be balanced to consume on both new lines and current public transportation.",
        "Nowadays, many local people who live in remote areas are struggling with accessibility to use high technology transportations such as rapid trains, electric buses, and subway to visit other cities. Furthermore, funding for the new rail track construction can increase an income for local sellers, and the economy progress can rise up significantly because travellers might be attracted an incentive by how convenience to go to sightseeing places in many distinguishing cities. To illustrate, the economy of Japan has been increasing for a decade in tourism industry: tourists can travel from the central to the south of the country easily via a very high speed train which is called \"Shinkansen.\" Thus, It is very beneficial to have express trains between major regions.",
        "on the other hand, an exiting public transport plays as an imperative role in our daily life because it is advantageous for decreasing traffic congestions. Moreover, it can reduce the pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, which can cause global warming issues. For example, Vancouver has quality battery electric buses, which are zero emissions, for their people. Hence, many people rarely use private cars compared to people who choose public transports as a choice for travelling. These reasons contributed Vancouver to be ranked on top 10 best cities in the world for quality of living.",
        "In a nutshell, transportation infrastructure impact on people in a nation in terms of  people's living, environment, and economy. It is clear that investment in the construction of new rail tracks is importantly as equal as the development of the current public transportation.  Nevertheless, plans for rapid trains should be reserved for the future."
