        "As technology has advanced, it became much  easier to meet our needs and wants, and aspects related to buying something are not an exception. Thus, the question that raises lots of controversies is whether at some moment boutiques or reselling hotspots will stop working offline. Below I will explore this highly interesting and thought-provoking topic, underlying why I frown on the mentioned earlier idea.",
        "The prime reason is that some members of society do not trust  the online pictures and descriptions usually written below , preferring instead of it checking by themselves. Moreover, it is often occasion when a store mixes up the goods and, as a sequence, delivers the wrong one. For example, on ,YouTube there is a wide array of videos so-called \"out packing\" where bloggers claimed that they had received an order with another size.",
        "The secondary reason is that the more content is on the World Wide Web,the more problems finding a certain appropriate thing to purchase, meaning a seller will lose revenue as its units will be hard to come across.For instance, now too many online boutiques are being advertised on Instagram, mostly it goes in vain because people are already used to it and do not pay attention at all, albeit not always. In addition, it causes harsh competitiveness, meaning that ,all in all, whoever will manage to rent a square in order to trade.",
        "In conclusion, I would like to stress that I agree for 100 per cent that never online space will be an absolute alternative for a real one, so such phenomena as offline shops will continue their existence. It will happen due to both willingness to check the quality,model, colour, size by her/himself and huge competitiveness."
