        "I am writing in relation to your enquiry asking for the reader's contributions to your respective magazine article called \u2018The book that influenced me the most. I would be grateful to share my experience, which would be helpful for society.",
        "I am going to mention the most holistic book named \u2018Mrutyunjay\u2019, which means the conquest over death. This story is about the mysterious yet the most dramatic life cycle of Karna, the first Pandava, who was very kind, generous, and brave at the same time.",
        "To begin with, this novel teaches you the most valuable lessons of life. In continuation, as  Karna was the man of his word, it dictates the sacrifices made by Karna to retain his religion, while also the advantage the people take of you due to this nature. Further, in my opinion, this publication definitely motivated me to be generous and taught me the joy of giving, which had me more successful in every phase of my life. By its effect, I have been donating to the orphanage on my birthday every year as per my strength.",
        "In my point of view, this book is a vast ocean of knowledge, which had definitely influenced me and my family. I am sure that it would impact the mindset of the masses with its wisdom to offer. Hope you are convinced with the aforementioned points, and would find it suitable to post in your magazine.",
        "Looking forward to your reply.",
        "Yours faithfully,",
