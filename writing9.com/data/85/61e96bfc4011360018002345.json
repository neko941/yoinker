        "Dear Sir",
        "Writing this epistle to express my annoyance regarding the product and services that I catered for from your store, located in the middle town.",
        "Last week, on the occasion of the new year, I bought a plasma screen T.V. as I got information from my reliable resource that your shop is best in town and giving heavy discount on electronic types of equipment on that day. On hearing this, I was on cloud nine since I was in dire need of T.V , but had a shortage of money. Luckily, I was able to buy that T.V. due to offered discount.",
        "All my excitement went into vain  when I installed it in my room. Although on the first day it worked properly, within a couple of days I started to face a few technical glitches. Firstly, the video got blurred within the usage of 30 mins. Not only video, but buttons of remote were not functioning appropriately. I went shopping back to explain the issue to one of your salesmen as the item was in warranty period. To my dismay, he did not provide me with the solution even after requesting it multiple times. So I would be obliged either if you provide me with the refund or replace the item.",
        "Hope you will take  swift action and ameliorate the issue of mine so that your reputation would not be ruined in front of your prestigious customers.",
