        "Dear Mr Nars,",
        "I am writing this letter with regards to express my disappointment in hearing that the work placement programme held every summer has vanished this year.",
        "One of the main reasons I chose your school, among the many, in New Zealand was because of the work placement programme offered under my Business English course. I am majorly concerned about losing the opportunity to gain practical insights into my course along with the chance to develop and engage with local people by utilising my course knowledge. I particularly selected your school and incurred extra expenses for this golden chance of placements, and if this is not getting offered- then I am been frauded.",
        "I would therefore humbly request if you could possibly look into reopening the summer placement programme again, otherwise, I should be getting my money back as I am not getting offered based on what was advertised.",
        "I will look forward to your response.",
        "Yours sincerely,",
