        "Nowadays, because of the rise of technology, the world wide web became a medium of instruction. It is often thought by many that learning through the internet has more benefits than in traditional classroom settings. However, some would think otherwise. In this essay, I will be discussing both advantages and disadvantages before giving my opinion.",
        "On the one hand, those offered through the internet are advantageous because students can learn not only in the comfort but also in the safety of their own homes. They would not need much effort to prepare for the day and physically go to the classrooms. For example, with the current pandemic, universities are forced to conduct courses online. If students and staff do not attend face-to-face lectures, there will be a decrease in the risk of contracting the virus.",
        "On the other hand, doing these would pose certain downsides not only for the teachers but also for learners. The former might lose their jobs because through online classes, less manpower is needed. The latter would find it difficult to separate the learning setting from the comfort of their own homes. A secondary school student, for instance, might not associate his or her home with family because he or she answers quizzes in the common room. Consequently, this would destroy the importance of family bonding.",
        "In summary, people believe that lectures taught online have a more positive impact than usual teaching, while others argue that these have more adverse effects. A major advantage is that students would be safer in their respective homes. Although, a disadvantage would be that lecturers might not be able to teach. In my opinion, the conventional curriculum should not be replaced by internet courses because it is not only appropriate but also ethical to distinguish the different social aspects of life."
