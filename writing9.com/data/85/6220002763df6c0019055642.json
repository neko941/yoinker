        "My name is Rohan. I and my family recently stayed in your hotel Hilton Garden Inn. in Brampton. I want to take into your consideration that some of your hotel rooms' air- conditioner is not in working position and making loud noises if we switch on it. I know it when we go into the hotel room and find air-conditioner ,not in good condition but I appreciate your receptionist Raman that when she knew about it then she immediately assigned us a new room and apologise us for our inconvenience. The new room which she assigned is excellent and she finalize it after making sure all facilities herself because she did not want to bother us more.",
        "I am writing this letter to you because I do not want  anyone to face a problem like this again. You can check or call a mechanic to see all the air-conditioner situation and change it if they are too old. If this happens to anyone it will create a bad image of your hotel in the mindset of a person which will not be beneficial for you or you can get bad reviews on social media also.",
