        "However, the positions of providers are always remarkable in the life of children. To begin with, the correct sacraments are provided by their mother through their behaviour others and future stars observe and start to walk on their footprints.

Furthermore, parents are always provided with  a secure and supportive environment through which they led themselves in the right direction. For example, parents understand their apple of an eye with patience and help to overcome  their mistakes. either it is a big issue or a small issue",
        "Moreover,  knowledge from the outside is also required for a beautiful future.

To illustrate, because of competition with friends and obviously the pressure of their teachers. Secondly, To modify the skills, it is better to take part in the event and hence the annual functions, various types of competitions in the education centre provide the correct path to them",
        "In conclusion, Although,  parents have a vital role in their life, it could be argued that for the bright path. It is necessary to have lessons from the outer world."
