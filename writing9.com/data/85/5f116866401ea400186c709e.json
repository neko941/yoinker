        "Since people have various viewpoints as to whether women are suitable to do a field job like detective or military or not. Our school of thought reckons that women taking up employment sector, which were mainly male dominated while others considered that they are not suited for force or military forces. This essay will not discuss both the viewpoints, but also my own perspective on the same in the subsequent paragraph.",
        "To embark on, there are multiple reasons why women should involve in forces. First of all, women are mentally and emotionally stronger than men, women have better quality to know the things carefully. They are not physically that strong, but they can use their intelligence to join in military and law enforcement. Second of all, women are playing a great role in the force. For instance,",
        "Dr. Kiran Bedi a retired IPS officer of India has decreased crime rate significantly. She is the living legend who has contributed a lot for the nation. Nowadays, women are more concerned about protecting their nation so they do physical and mental exercise to get a part in it.",
        "On the other hand, some people think that women are not capable to carry out certain jobs due to various reasons. Physical strength is vital to become a police officer or join military and women have less stamina for the job. For example, while catching a thief law enforcement officer needs to run fast to get hold of the burglar. Secondly, few women prefer to stay at home and looked after that toddlers for in laws where are some women are preferred to do corporate jobs.",
        "To conclude, I believe that both men and women are equally important to serve the nation as they have other traits and qualities that men do not possess."
