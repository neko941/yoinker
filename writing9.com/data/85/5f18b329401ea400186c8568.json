        "Undoubtedly, learning how to distinguish good and bad acts is a crucial part of youngsters' upbringing. While some people claim that punishment is an effective way to ensure them to do the right thing, I believe it is not a good method of teaching children good values.",
        "On the one hand, by being exposed to constant punishments children learn nothing valuable. To be more precise, the only conclusion kids can draw out after this sort of  regulation is that they did a wrong thing, but the reasons why they were wrong and the ways how they should have behaved are not elaborated. Hence, a lot of them tend to hide the truth and lie to escape a penalty. Furthermore, some violent actions to regulate children's behaviour, such as hitting with a belt, might influence their mental health detrimental and evoke aggressive inclinations. For instance, a lot of murders and criminals experienced abusive actions of the parents.",
        "On the other hand, other methods are considered to be far more beneficial to maintain discipline and foster moral values. By having a having heart-to-heart chat, parents are able to give a detailed explanation of misbehaviour that can ensure understanding of the right and wrong deeds. For example, revealing all hazardous consequences and bad sides of stealing things is a good way for a family to deprive their offsprings' of this acts. Not only do folks have to talk about discipline, but they also should set good examples themselves. The reason for this is that children are likely to respect their relatives and adapt their behaviour so that can likewise lead to embracing morals.",
        "To summarize, I am firmly convinced that nowadays punishment is nowhere near as advantageous as the constructive method of moral education. Therefore, parents should opt for discussions and setting a good rapport with their kids in order to foster good values."
