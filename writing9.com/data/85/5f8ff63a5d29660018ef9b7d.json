The world due to the steep in air pollution is an increasing threat for diseases associated with the heart and the lungs. Therefore, people prefer to use cars to avoid exposure to pollution. However, cars being expensive machinery preferred by people who can afford it.",
        "Bicycles are mostly used to travel a shorter distance. For example, to shop groceries. They can safe money for petrol and diesel. Moreover, it is generally used by a plethora of people to keep themselves healthy and fit. To illustrate, it is used to reduce the cholesterol of the body, helping people to deal with less heart and lung diseases. Furthermore, it is affordable for many people due to less cost. On the contrary, it is only used to do the works associated with the places nearby, as it may affect the time and energy of a person.",
        "To conclude, bicycles use should be an incumbent part of everyone's life to maintain a healthy life. Likewise, cars should be restricted to works for a longer distance."
