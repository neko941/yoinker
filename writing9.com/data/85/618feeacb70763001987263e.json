        "Nowadays, the tourism industry has been improved considering the ease of transportation between nations. Yet, there remains a controversial debate as to whether the overall efficiency of this phenomenon is benevolent for the societies or is able to result in excruciatingly negative impacts. This essay will discuss the proposed topic from both sides of view with some detailed explanations.",
        "Firstly, cultural shock is the primary influence of this subject on the host destination. This is an indisputable fact that tourists  bring their cultural background to the host nation ,which can be destructive for the principles of that region. For instance, some countries have  religious limitations for drinking in public or strict rules for women to wear a scarf  that can be broken by the visitors; meanwhile, these unethical behaviours have high potential to be followed by the youth in that place, which can be followed by various perilous consequences for the society and the government. Consequently, not respecting and adopting the policies of the targeted nation by the arrivals leads to cultural catastrophes for the inhabitants of that zone.",
        "On the other hand, financial prosperity is a great revenue of  tourism. Additionally, a higher number of tourists is a fundamental criterion in helping the economy of the area. As a salient example, the locals can benefit from the products and the souvenirs that are bought by the arrivals, which can help the monetary capacity of that zone; also, it is a noticeable factor in decreasing the rate of  unemployment based on the  capacity of raising money in the tourist destination regarding the new job opportunities provided by the help of tourism industry. Ultimately, visitors are  considerable elements associated with the commercial chances that they can contribute to the country.",
        "As a way of conclusion, I once again reaffirm that the development of international travel has numerous benefits and drawbacks for the aimed nation; however, I strongly believe that its advantages outweigh its disadvantages. Moreover, it is recommended that the visitors try to respect the restrictions in a country to prevent  unwanted consequences for both the society and the tourists."
