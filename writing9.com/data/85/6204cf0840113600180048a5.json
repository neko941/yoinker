        "The involvement of children in paid work has been a controversial issue. While advocates of this trend consider it a useful lesson for professional life , opponents consider it  worthless. I personally in the former viewpoint and reasons behind it would be discussed in the upcoming paragraphs .",
        "To embark on, it is undeniable fact that pupils who indulge themselves in job acquire experience as well as  various skills  which will be useful for them in coming life  . To explicate, they meet different people and learn how to deal with them. Apart from that, they also face stumbling obstacles in the way and they come across various unique ideas to remove them. As a result, they acquire  problem-solving abilities and communication skills. For instance, a survey conducted in America stated that most  of the students who work become independent and inculcate the potential to face any situation in life.",
        "Another reason to support the above argument is that they become financially stable. To put into another way, they become able to earn their living and more importantly, they know the value of money and they cal follow their dream . Moreover able to support the family in economic crisis. For example, a report in The Hindu declared that the vast majority of individuals who started working at an early age become successful entrepreneurs that those who do not work.",
        "After taking everything into consideration, it can be concluded that children engaged in a different kinds of paid work have the opportunity to learn more skills. Besides that, they become financially independent."
