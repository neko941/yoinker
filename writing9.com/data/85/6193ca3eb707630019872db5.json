        "Dear Mr James,",
        "I am writing to inform you that I am interested in the part-time course as advertised by your financial organisation. Therefore, I have decided to take a loan that is associated with the students that will be partaking in the study. I have a BSc. from the University of Ibadan and I have five years of working experience as a relationship coach. In addition, I have 2 years of working experience as a Customer Service Manager at Hilton restaurant.",
        "Furthermore, the course is a one-year program that will be held at the city hall, and the classes will be holding every day from 4pm till 6pm in the evening. It will be a blend of virtual and online teaching. However, lectures on Saturday and Sunday will be starting by 9am in the morning and it will end by 6pm in the evening.",
        "Moreover, this program will be of great benefit to me. For example, it will help me to master the current project I am working on right now, also it will boost my confidence in handling high-level tasks in my office.",
        "I do hope I will be considered for this loan, than you for your time.",
