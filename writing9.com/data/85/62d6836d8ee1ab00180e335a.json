        "Initially, I was anxious and skeptical to move to a new location but now I feel comfortable in my new place. I like the neighbourhood and the plethora of recreational activities around me. In fact, I started hitting the gym and feel energetic. Last weekend was hectic and I am glad that we could unbox all the  household items and organise them neatly before the party. Moreover, the party was rocking and everyone savoured the scrumptious meal that you had ordered.",
        "I have bought a brand new state-of-the-art television set to watch movies, however, I am bored watching them alone. Come over the weekend and we can watch any of your favourite movies while munching flavoured popcorn.",
