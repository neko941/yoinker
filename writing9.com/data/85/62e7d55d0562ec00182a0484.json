        "Dear Mr Manager,",
        "I am writing to commend the excellent food and service of The Majestic. Last week, I, together with my friends, dined at your restaurant in Grade street to celebrate an impromptu bachelorette party.",
        "It was the first time for all of us to eat at your restaurant, and we were surprised by how the food was very delicious and exceptional, especially the lobster and the shrimp cocktails. The beef stir fry was also very popular among the group.",
        "Moreover, the service was top-notch. We were a party of 15, and I was pleased that your restaurant was able to serve us with ease. The staff, led by our server, Mr Bill, was able to comply with our on-the-spot requests with a smile. Also, even though we did not have a reservation, we were still welcomed warmly.",
        "I would definitely recommend your establishment  to my family and friends. Please feel free to add my endorsement to any promotional materials you may have in the future.",
        "Yours sincerely,",
