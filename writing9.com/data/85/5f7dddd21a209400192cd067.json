        "I am writing this letter about the automated garbage collection system which is installed in DLF phase 2, just before the road which leads to the locality\u2019s bus station. From the past 3 days, the processing of the dump is not getting completed. As per the inputs from the fellow residents, the machinery was working completely fine, till Monday evening. Additionally, it can be observed that the main wire which was connected to the socket is severely damaged.",
        "Due to the aforesaid issue, all the citizens, especially the elderly people are facing difficulty in breathing because the lid now stays open all the time. Thereby, inviting numerous insects and diseases. Furthermore, the dumpster is overloaded hence, making the streets dirty.",
        "I sincerely urge you to kindly appoint some workmen who can offer some resolution. I, however, completely understand that due to lockdown, the manpower is very less in urban areas. Nevertheless, it will be great if some temporary workaround can be made for time being, such as emptying the dustbin and installing mobile bins as these can be removed easily once the previous system is up and running.",
        "Looking forward to hearing from you soon.",
