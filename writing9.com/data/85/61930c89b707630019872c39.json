        "It is undeniable that the Internet explosion is obvious in our recent era. In this concept, whether traditional paper product stands in their stable position? Numerous people claim that paper newspapers or books will have no place in the future market due to the capability to access free materials online. In my opinion, I partially agree with this statement, which will be explained further in my below essay.",
        "To begin with, it is agreeable that nowadays we could easily access variable materials with only a mouse-click. Thanks to internet development, publishers around the world could pose their produce in an appropriate version on the online market, hence users could purchase their needed books or magazines easily regardless of their geographic obstacles or time difference. For example,  by only a mouse-click, I have already bought a valuable textbook, published by Elsevier from the US, in PDF format which synced on my cellphone, thus I could look up the reference whenever and wherever I need. Therefore, it is true to confess the value of portable reference products.",
        "Nevertheless, I do believe that traditional books possess unreplaceable worth. In other words, reading on papers would enable us to highly concentrate, contemporarily to prevent some potential adverse effects caused by electronic devices. For instance, some researchers showed that reading real paper materials would reduce orbital diseases caused by the blue light screens. Moreover, valuable reading products are usually costly even in the online version.",
        "In conclusion, the thriving of the internet is remarkably helpful to satisfy the human reading requirement. However, those portable references are not always optimal choices in some cases. As a consequence, papers have their unique worth for their existence."
