        "In recent years, many schools, provide students with electronics, replacing traditional printed textbooks, exams and assignments. This essay will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this trend.",
        "Let's look at the advantages. Firstly, heavy books switched to the usage of laptops, tablets and computers.The gadgets are of lightweight and are easily portable. As a result, the child does not need to carry thick books because it can cause physical problems. For example, experts say that school bags should ideally not weigh more than 10% of the child's body weight. If it is heavy that could result in lower back pain, shoulder pain and other postural deformities. There is a better understanding of concepts. The visuals and texts in the tablets and laptops have better clarity and are more attractive than books. This enhances a student\u2019s interest in the study.",
        "Despite the advantages, there are disadvantages also. Continuous usage of the gadgets can cause strain to their eyes. Ultimately, leads to shortsightedness and the child has to wear glasses. Looking at another disadvantage is the distraction due to these electronics. Taking, for example, the internet is a global network with easy access to any information and communicates with others through social media. Students to get sidetracked during classes using the web and social media. Thus, the concentration level is low and they become less productive.",
        "In conclusion, although there are several benefits to using computers, it can have disadvantages. In my opinion, it is advisable not entirely to replace printed materials."
