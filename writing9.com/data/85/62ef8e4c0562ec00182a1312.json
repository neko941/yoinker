        "Let me explain my situation in detail. Due to the odd opening timings of this place which is up to 1:AM every night, an unbearable amount of noise caused by motorbikes, loud music and people talking keeps disturbing me.",
        "As a result, I am unable to sleep properly and on time which is affecting my health and studies. Moreover, I am also a part-time worker , therefore lack of sleep causes me issues at work too.",
        "I would like to suggest  if the canteen's opening timings can be restricted to 11:PM on weekdays and upto 12:PM on weekends, which I believe may be an effective solution to this issue.",
        "I hope my request will be taken into consideration. Thankyou in advance.",
