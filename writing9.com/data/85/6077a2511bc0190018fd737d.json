        "Many individuals believe that  tertiary institutions ought to give qualified undergraduate in-depth information and skills so they can use at their job , while others believe that a college ought to provide intelligence according to their need like which demands by their managers . According to my point of view that an academy should not only give knowledge and experience but also opportunities for research work as well as a scholarship to them.",
        "I think universities  provide ample  information  to their fresh graduates . In other words , a professor of college should provide enough theoretical and practical insight , so scholar aware of their studies and they get to know about how much they have interest , what is difficult or easy in this course , etc.  Also , a mentor should evaluate their junior performances.  Another thing is skills  if it  will  be  introduced during last year of subjects so at least they know and sharpens it .For example  , a doctor needed in-depth theoretical and practical  ability of medicine , whereas a leader has to be not only knowledgeable of history but also a master in leadership skills .",
        "Furthermore , a graduate must have chances for further study or research on their campus . Therefore,  they can master and invent  a  new thing in his or her field  ,as a consequence,  this will benefit  the university and the state , too .  In addition to this , an  educational institution should also give incentives or scholarship to needy or poor students so they also get a profit from their course . All in all , a college should help to make the best career for young adults by providing all the things to them .",
        "To conclude , my opinion is that  whether a university will give a full pack of  materials from proficiency to research work with scholarships  in order to develop the best career of their pupils , as a result ,  in future ,  he or she will not feel like that they lacked by course-oriented experience or information ."
