        "I am a nearby resident and writing this letter with regard to bringing your attention to the problem facing your puppy the whole day and night for the past 10 days. I would like to inform you that I am worried about it so barking throughout the day and night,Moreover we are facing a lot of disturbance in our daily activities as well.",
        "Firstly I want to let you know I used to pet a dog last year. It was a small dog like yours. In my ,experience the chief cause might be a lack of tasty and much-loved food. Secondly, please try to take the pup out for some time walking this will help to reduce the stress on your pet. If these two recommendations won't work and the barking problem still remains my final advice is to get it to the veterinary doctor to consult.",
        "I hope you will take solid action to resolve this issue  as soon as possible. If you will request any help or assistance please get back.",
