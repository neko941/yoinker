        "In this modernised world ,  certain group of people are in search of well-being  where as another section is wandering for money. This is where the question : \" whether money could buy pleasure ?\" arises . Some people states that joy is directly proportional to our financial status whereas others points out the existence of other elements in delight . In my opinion , several other ingredients are added inorder to have a happy soul . This essay discusses both the aspects and explain my opinion on behalf .",
        "To begin with , if a person is rich , he could enjoy every luxuries in his life . Hence, for many individuals fund is the criteria to be joyful. They emphasize on the fact that finance could buy everything they wish , which can fullfill their satisfaction that indeed results in inner joy and peace .",
        "On the flip side , opposites claim that besides monetary capitals , funds and properties , two more additives are needed to turn our lives jubilent : satisfaction and family . For instance , a wealthy man can feel lonely if no-one is there to share his ups and downs , thereby he will become unhappy and will not be able to enjoy his life . But a poor fellow can find contentment in himself when his family is there to share his emotions being a backbone throughout his journey. Moreover, satisfaction is another piece of paper in the book of  an elated person . To exemplify , a poor street hawker can be happy just like a business tycoon if he is satisfied with whatever he has. He do not have a greedy mind which craves for more luxuries in his life and even don't have a  depressed soul which blames for his darker sides .",
        "To sum up , being happy is a mixture of factors where economic wealth is only a minor one among many . Even if this particular sector is absent, one can find bliss in a lot more ways . Therefore , being well-to-do and euphoria are two different words which have nothing much to do when it's put together ."
