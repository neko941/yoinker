        "In the modern era, many companies would prefer to have a single pattern of uniforms for their employees. Therefore a fair number of experts believe that these dress colours  would help to amplify the unity and coordination among their staff. Hence, I would like to explain a few upsides and downsides of this statement.",
        "To begin with, the single dress pattern would bring  consistency to the firm. Firstly, these dress codes are helping to identify the staff nature of work and workplace too. Secondly, By looking at the dress code anyone can catch their employe profession despite the staff gender and age. Furthermore, When we have the biggest organisation with numerous employees count and this will help to classify the division of the work. In addition, they can fix the timetable by looking at the dress colour. For Instance, a food processing  company would have a similar uniform for their employees considering their duties and responsibilities such as the Production department vs the finance department. As per  recent Google survey findings, 95% of employees were happy with their company uniforms as they are helping to remove the gaps among them.",
        "However, undoubtedly, these uniforms will provide incalculable benefits to  any organisation regardless of its revenue, sales, and profit too. On the other hand, when you go out from the firm and the worker will get  huge respect from society by looking at his/her uniforms. For example, those who are working in the health and medical profession if they come out of their work  will get enormous respect and recognition from the local community.",
        "To sum up, no matter what level you are in at the workplace. One must respect the worker in all the way whoever is wearing the uniform in the company regardless of their age and experience too."
