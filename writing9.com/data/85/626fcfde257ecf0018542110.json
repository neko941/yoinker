        "Languages are a way of communication, and expression and  represent the cultural heritage of any region. However, multiple languages are getting vanish day by day. Some people expound that we should not worry about it as having fewer dialects will make our life easy.  Whereas, I partially disagree with their view. In the paragraphs to follow, I shall further discuss my viewpoint on this topic.",
        "On one hand, fewer languages will help to reduce the communication barrier among people and increase globalization as they can express their ideas to a wider audience.  As a result, it will increase worldwide reachability such as people can pursue their careers anywhere in the world based on their interests and will enhance the research potential of the world. Moreover, it will ease the business interaction among the countries and will increase their social and political relationships.",
        "On contrary,the extinction of a language impacts the cultural heritage of a region. Consequently, it will then impact the tourism industry. For example, people travel to various places and countries to know about their culture but using the same dialect will enforce society to somehow follow the culture of a new language and there will be no attraction left for tourists. Many social and cultural heritages will be lost as people will not be able to understand the pieces of literature written in that dialect.",
        "In conclusion, we may say that although having lesser languages will solve communication gap issues but it will cause adverse effects on cultural heritage and alienisation of some countries."
