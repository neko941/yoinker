        "Dear Sir/Madam,",
        "I am writing this letter to express my interest to stay in the college hall of residence for the first 10 days as I am very new to this place and also coming from a different country. As I mentioned in my application I would prefer to have a separate room which would help to study and focus more on my research-related topics.",
        "As you know, I am coming from a vegetarian family and I would prefer to have only vegan food. I have never eaten any nonvegetarian food in my entire life. Despite this Vegan food I would like to have Milk and eggs twice  daily morning at 8AM which would make me feel active and happy. In addition to my separate room. I may be required to have an internet connection to do my daily research work and also a mobile phone would be much required since  it is very far away from university and I can call for someone if needed any help.",
        "During the summer, I may need to have AC if not I can adjust with an electric fan and it might be a lifesaver. I knew that mobile phone maintenance cost is very high and if there is any challenge I am happy to have at least a basic land phone in my room.",
        "I look forward to hearing your response to my request. I hope it will come soon.",
