        "General knowledge, well, in my opinion, it is crucial to keep up and understand the happenings around the world. Some people assume secondary school students should study international news, while others say it is a bad idea, as it will waste a valuable hour of school. Both have their merits and demerits on which I would like to shed light in this essay.",
        "To begin, let us pretend that worldwide news is a part of the student's curriculum, what change will it bring to the student's life. In recent times, it can be seen that opportunities are growing wider across the world in all fields of work, such as new job offers, scholarship programs, scientific research, and much more. Having an idea about the happenings in the world could be beneficial, both, long term and short term. It could open a gate to numerous gains in terms of knowledge and in general, life.",
        "However, is it required to study international news in the institution, it may take up a lot of space and effort, which may not be interactive for students, and could lead to boredom. whereas they could be offered something they like, and eventually, they will turn out to be productive. Moreover, they can gain the same learnings, through the internet. This means worldwide reports at school could be waste of time.",
        "To conclude, I would say, it is important to learn what is happening on the globe, at the same point it is not compulsive to make it as one of their subjects, instead, they could make it optional and request assignments, which will lead, both, gaining knowledge and also making it interesting. This method will display a brilliant division of time with fewer efforts and even satisfy everyone's opinion."
