        "I writing to inform you about the luggage bag that was lost during my flight to London last week.",
        "While I am not completely sure how the bag was lost, I imagine that the luggage might have been left at the terminal by myself when I was busy on the phone with my wife. In fact, I have been in contact with the terminal staff since then, and they are almost certain that this is the most probable situation.",
        "The suitcase is a green colour, a large-sized samsonite model. Since  this flight was the first time it had been used, it must appear to be in very good condition. Unfortunately, it has my critical work documents and also it does not have a tag with my information.",
        "Likewise, Before I left the airport, I had contacted the airline company. Based on the information on the ticket, lost luggage is covered. Therefore, I have filed an insurance claim for my lost goods and I would appreciate it if your company could find my lost suitcase or just in case  it could not be found, your company could review the approximated value of lost baggage and process the claim as soon as possible.",
        "Please let me know if you need any kind of information.",
