        "It is mostly believed that certain people are naturally talented for certain activities like sports or music. Yet, others opine that any young person can learn and turn into a great sportsperson or make music.",
        "I believe the latter is true because even though one might not have a brain that is naturally designed for an activity, they can easily adapt with adequate training.",
        "On one hand, some people are able to perform very well at certain activities because their brains and bodies are naturally built for such. In other words, for any person to produce some beautiful musical melodies or to produce great acts at sports, it is because his body finds it easy to do and the brain does not struggle to ensure that he remains more creative than those born without these natural abilities. Take, for instance, some of the world's most celebrated musicians that are able to sing songs without the problems of having to learn the techniques of music production, they do so because they have natural talents from birth.  Additionally, for one to precisely manoeuvre the vocal cords in order to produce the best rhythm, it can only be done naturally because one can never learn to control those involuntary muscles.",
        "Nonetheless, even if a person is not born with a talent, it is possible to learn the art through focused training and coaching especially when they are young. To put this in perspective, every human brain and body is more than capable of adapting to new situations and adjusting accordingly. For example, because their brains are still young, many young footballers nowadays are not natural-born sportsmen and yet, they are able to master the art of the game through regular training. This proves how possible it is to become better at something even though one had to learn it at some point in life. On certain occasions, some people who acquired their skills after birth can even out-perform those naturally born with  talent.",
        "By way of conclusion, I reaffirm my statement that even if some individuals are not being born with particular talents,  they can still master them and do so better than those born with them. Certainly, every brain and body is capable of adjusting to the environment and overcoming any challenges in order to learn a new activity."
