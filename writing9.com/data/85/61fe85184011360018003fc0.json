        "writing this epistle to express utter annoyance with my recent purchase from your store .",
        "Last week. I bought a mixer grinder of 1000 watts with 3 jars of different sizes. For a long ,time I have been using numerous products from your reputated shop and have never been disappointed but this purchase made me upset. Two days back when I started to use it firstly It made a strange noise and after using it for 2 days it stopped working. Therefore, I referred to 'User 's manual' to troubleshoot this technical glitch. I followed all instructions but had no luck. As this product is under guarantee so I would like you to kindly repair it or exchange it as earliest. I need this urgently so it would be better if you send one of your servicemen to my house so that he can find the actual problem or suggest an appropriate solution .I do not have too much time to come again to your store.",
