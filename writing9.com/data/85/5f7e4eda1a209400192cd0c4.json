        "Certain folks believe that internet communication has broken down the\u00a0walls between international communities thus availing individuals who would not have crossed path the chance to foster frienship. Although it has been proved to be beneficial\u00a0due to, it encourages inter country union through marriage, it is also detrimential because it is obviously the basic reason for decline in face-to-face interaction in\u00a0recent times too.",
        "On one hand, social networking have linked people from far and\u00a0wide. Moreover, it opened tremendious opportunities for marriage bonds and online dating. In 2019 marriage record in the UK for\u00a0instance, showed that 20% of married couples met themselves on\u00a0the media such as: Facebook. Clearly this would not have\u00a0materilized if not of online communication. Thus,  holds a lot of merits as the globe\u00a0has become more intergrated as well as, mixture of different cultures so we are a step closer to world peace.",
        "On the other hand, recently\u00a0we have seen a decrease in the level of face-to-face intereaction between local communities since most folks spend most of their spare time on the internet. In Nigeria for example, in the past abroad men attend public events during festive periods in order to secure a date but reverse is the case these days as must of them are already hooked up before setting\u00a0foot in the country.\u00a0Sadly, this\u00a0have impaired physical conversation negatively hence, calls for concern.",
        "To conclude, online communication have broken unimaginable boundries. Even though, \u00a0the advent of social-media availed\u00a0many folks\u00a0the opportunities\u00a0to meet their life partner which would have impossible since they\u00a0are thousands miles apart, however, this at the same time is deterimential because it casued enormous downturn in the amount of assiocation between local communities."
