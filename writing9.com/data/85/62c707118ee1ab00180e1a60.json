        "Dear Mr,",
        "I am writing this letter to you to draw your attention to this new decision about constructing a new airport in our area.",
        "Actually, last week in the morning when I walking on Soleymani street, I found a group of architects was making a site plan for the airport and evaluating all aspects.",
        "Firstly, due to some reasons, I believe this construction had a bad effect on this neighbourhood. One of them is the place that you were considered for the airport is near the public hospital. In addition, I am completely sure the new airport creates a traffic jam in this area because currently, we have intensive traffic there.",
        "Due to these tips, I will expect you to evaluate exactly again and review all options and consider another place for your decision.",
        "Thank you for taking your time and your consideration of my letter. I looking forward to hearing news about construction in another place.",
        "Yours faithfully,",
