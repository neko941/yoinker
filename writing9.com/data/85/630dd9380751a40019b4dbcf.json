        "In many countries, the government started to provide more subsidies and pay for children's education. Although this might lead to some problems, I believe that the advantages outweigh its disadvantages.",
        "On one hand, there are some drawbacks to this change. One of the most important problems is that governments usually have a limited budget for each year. If they spend too much on education, other departments would be affected. For instance, their spending on infrastructure would be reduced and might not be able to build new railway stations.",
        "On the other hand, there are even more benefits than drawbacks. First of all, with the help of the government, children born in either poor or rich families can receive the same education, improve themselves, and have equal opportunities in the future. As a result, they would be able to narrow the  wealth gap within the country, which is a positive development in the long term. In addition, subsidies provided by the government can make people feel less stressed. In order to pay for the expensive tuition of their kids, many parents have been suffering from work pressure. If the government helps them with friendly policies, their overall mental well-being would be significantly improved.",
        "In conclusion, even though there are a few potential problems which might be caused by the change, it has more benefits than drawbacks. Thus, I am convinced that the government should continue paying for the costs of children's education and reduce the financial burden on the residents."
