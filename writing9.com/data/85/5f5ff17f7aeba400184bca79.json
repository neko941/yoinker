It is a 3 story building with 4 bedrooms on the top floor, the kitchen is on the ground floor and we have attached bathrooms with every bedroom. Also, we have a three-bedroom basement and a beautiful garden at the back of our mansion.",
        "Moreover, I feel lucky to have such wonderful and helpful neighbours. They invited us to dinner last week. I want you to visit my home and spend some days with me. Also, I was planning to invite my neighbours and our other close friends. When you will come we will decide together whom we should invite. I hope I will see you very soon.",
