        "I am writing this letter to invite our MP to a local committee conference meeting which is held to discuss green community parks in our neighbourhood.",
        "To provide more insights on the committee, We are a committee of 10 members living in Lefroy, Innisfil. Every member is serving either as an environmental activist or doing social service. Lastly, I am a professor and organiser of this committee.",
        "The main agenda of the meeting is to discuss plantations and improving parks. Firstly, some beautiful older trees in our surrounding area were uprooted and children's play areas are damaged due to recent floods. Thus, We are planning to plant more trees across our constituency and renovate play areas.",
        "Last but not the least, We would like to invite our beloved MP to motivate  and share his thoughts for this good cause. Moreover, we want to make sure we are not conflicting with any other activities planned in our suburb.",
        "Please respond at your earliest convenience!",
