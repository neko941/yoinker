        "The globe has been certainly passing from various troubles. From that, an important one is the rising the rate of atrocity in the few nations. However, this will create a detrimental effect on the citizens. The essay will discuss about main reasons which generates it and measures to curb it; as per my opinion are discussed in below paragraphs.",
        "To begin with, the predominant factor for an increasing offence activity is that the price of the essential products is rising drastically. Even the entire market, having a competitive atmosphere as a result, the layman has to work hard to earn money. Moreover, with the advancement of technology, people are putting all their details on the social media. This will generate jealousy having not able to acquire the latest trend. Although with the use of the Internet people can get the all details of an individual, this will help a criminal to do any antisocial activity. For example, the youngsters must suffer for the job, having more competition; as they attempt some wrong task.",
        "On the other hand, there are certain steps that are taken to omit such activity. The first measure is that the government should have to impose the straight law. This will provide the awareness and generate fear of the penalty given by the regime. Furthermore, another reason is the authorities should start some new businesses which provides an opportunity to earn money. As lack of money is the main reason of the criminal activity. Therefore, the people can earn the enough money as they reduce the offending task. For instance, many adolescents have stopped participating in the cybercrime due to the new laws.",
        "In conclusion, the mankind has attempted the criminal activity due to the competitive environment and wish to get the luxurious life. However, this will be solved by imposing stricter rules and an opportunity to earn money by the government."
