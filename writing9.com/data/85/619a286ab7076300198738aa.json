        "Sport has long been around since ancient times. While a number of people believe that it is essential in a community, others assume that it is no more than a mere hobby. I disagree and think that physical activities are a critical asset in society.",
        "To begin with, sporting events elevate life qualities. Crowds gather together to play games that magnify each other\u2019s relationships. For instance, a football game consists of eleven players and to win the match, trust and teamwork is required. Thus, athletics can cause the town folks to become closer and cooperative. Additionally, if the city has its own sports game or team that is famous worldwide, it can attract tourists and boost the economy. To elaborate more detail, Manchester in England is known for the football team. a number of people visit the city to watch the match being played which is beneficial for the locals.",
        "Furthermore, physical activities uplift an individual\u2019s well-being. Exercising and moving causes the heart rate to rise; it is necessary for maintaining a good health. To be precise, playing basketball for children or casual jogging for adults generate a high fitness level. The results can be seen in future years due to the fact that people will have a stronger immune system to fight off diseases or illnesses. Another reason is athletics produce energy for the civilians. The community becomes more active and engaged in their daily lives resulting in higher-level achievements. To illustrate, after exercising, a baker can invent creative desserts such as lemon tart cupcakes with raspberry fillings. The energy also provides happiness to each person.",
        "To summarize, sports are necessary for society since it contributes to healthy lifestyles and relationship. I believe that it is a major source of connection for the nation."
