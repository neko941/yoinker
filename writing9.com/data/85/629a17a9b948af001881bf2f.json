        "I'm writing to invite you to my party that is going to hold on the 20th of next month. Having survived that ghastly accident last year, I felt it was right to celebrate the right to live which I still have.",
        "This might seem off, but I have to explain in detail the reason for this party. Firstly, God has been so good to me and my family. Ever since I had that crash, I have been battling with  lower knee pain but recently, I had a minor surgery and the pain as far as I can tell, has gone. Secondly, I just acquired a new car and guess what? , It's a Chevvy brother!!.",
        "Also, the venue for the party is  our new crib just after Delaware public school. The direction is quite straight, all you have to do is to pick a taxi from the city council and tell them \"spooky area\". I will be waiting for your call when you get there.",
        "Don't bother about accommodation as I have made plans for you and a few other friends of mine. You can come along with your sister if you wish.",
        "I look forward to hearing from you.",
