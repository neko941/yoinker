        "I am writing this to inform you that I am available to assist you in your household chores starting June 2022.",
        "As you have mentioned in the advertisement that you need someone to help you out in cooking, I am an expert cook in making continental as well as traditional cuisines, particularly, Pakistani dishes such as Karahi and Biryani. I am sure you would love it. Moreover, during my master's degree, I took cooking as a private course from Gotham Cooking Institute Lahore which is a famous institute that offers cookery classes in Pakistan.",
        "Since I am living as a bachelor in Jeddah and during my summer break, I would have plenty of leisure time. Therefore, I would like to have somebody to spend a good time with. As you know, people here usually speak Arabic, and it is quite a challenge to find someone who could speak English. So, I think we will enjoy our time.Furthermore, we might end up becoming good friends.",
        "Lastly, I need to tell you that I would be available 5 days a week, Monday to Friday because I play cricket with my friends on Saturday and Sunday.",
        "If you are okay with the aforementioned schedule, kindly reply as soon as possible so that I make my plans accordingly.",
        "Yours Sincerely,",
