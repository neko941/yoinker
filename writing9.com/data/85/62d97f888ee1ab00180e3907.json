        "Dear Sir or Madam,",
        "I am writing this letter with a heavy heart after hearing the decision of considering to closing local sports and leisure centre. I oppose  that decision and let me explain why.",
        "To begin, when I was young, I and my friends use to play a lot in the centre  lot after school hours. We still cherish our memories in there and still, I feel to go back to the times that were spent  around see-saws and merry-go-rounds.",
        "Secondly, I want to make your attention to the pandemic that we had  last year. We were happy as a council  because we had the lowest death rates compared to the other councils. I have a strong feeling it is because our children had enough physical fitness than the others. Not only juveniles' but also  adults use sports complexes to improve physical health.",
        "I suggest, that if you consider closing this valuable asset, just to save money, it will result in raising more money in the future to cure the lonely hearts of your citizens. Because this centre is not only responsible for health but also it has the symbol of the unity of our community.",
        "I would appreciate your immediate attention to this letter  and help us to protect our sports complex. I look forward to hearing from you.",
        "Yours sincerely,",
