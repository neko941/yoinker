        "It is with a heavy heart that I bring it to you that the display of the phone you lent me got damaged. I feel bad for not being more careful in the way I handled it. I was hoping to return you the mobile, once I get settled here. But, I didn't see this coming.",
        "This happened precisely at the airport exit, while I was trying to book a taxi for my way home. It slipped off from my hands when a stranger bumped into me, as he was in an urgency to board his flight. He was nowhere to be found, when I realised the damage he had caused. I really feel terrible to bring this to you.",
        "On that note, I wanted to let you know that I will ensure to fix the display the way it was. I have further checked with a few other service centres in my locale. This shouldn't cost much and whatever it costs, I'll bear it for being careless. I hope I could fix the same over this weekend. Once done, I'll make sure it reaches you in a couple of days as the way you gave it to me.",
