        "My name is Jinson, I am writing this letter to express my dissatisfaction with the customer service of your store. I visited the premise  last Friday around 7 pm. Although I have been a frequent customer and have always received satisfactory service, this time's story was different. I was quite amazed by the appalled behaviour of your staff.",
        "When I entered the store, none of the staff members cared to notice my presence. I roamed around randomly and nobody came forward to lend a hand. Finally, I seek the support of one team member and she seemed involved in other thoughts. She did not give me full attention to me and never cared to render the service which I requested from her. Thus, in frustration, I had to step out of the store.",
        "I would like you to go through my complaint and take the necessary steps to resolve this matter. Additionally, I would be delighted, if you could give proper training to your staff members on customer service so that consumers may not face such situations in future.",
        "I look forward to hearing from you soon and the improved service as well.",
        "Yours faithfully,",
