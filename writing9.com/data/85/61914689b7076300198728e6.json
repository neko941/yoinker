To be honest, I would have been stranded if you and your family didn't allow me to reside at your place. Staying at your house gave me the chance to have some savings, and I would have spent a lot on hotels and accommodation. I am grateful for your hospitality and for making me feel at home at the same time.",
        "Finally, I do want you to know that I miss you all so much. Guess what I missed the most? The early morning breakfast time, where everybody gets to share their previous days' experiences. It is so much fun, and I would love to come around again if time permits.",
