        "Dear Martin,",
        "Hope you are in the pink of your health. I am writing this letter to apprise you, that I have shifted to a new home last week.",
        "I had to take this decision of shifting to a new place, as the owner was looking forward to selling out his property. He could find one interested buyer and they underwent a deal. The owner beforehand informed me about his willingness in selling his home.",
        "The new home is an extremely nice place to live in. It is a big apartment for a single person with two bedrooms, a kitchen and a living area. Most amazing is the balcony with a small table and two chairs, where you can sit, relax and enjoy the panoramic vista of the city while having coffee. On top of these, it is a fully furnished accommodation.",
        "It has been a while since we met. I was contemplating if you could find some time and take a visit to my new flat. I will prepare some sumptuous dinner, that we will relish on the balcony. Looking forward to seeing you soon.",
