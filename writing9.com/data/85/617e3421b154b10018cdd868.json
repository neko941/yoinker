        "Natural beauty spots are being lost in many nations due to the increase in population size and urbanization. There are many advantages of preserving natural places of beauty such as attracting tourists and promoting a healthy ecosystem. This essay will shed light on the benefits of protecting nature and the solutions to achieve  them.",
        "First of all, tourism helps boost a country's economy. People from all over the world travel to  witness and enjoy the natural history and charm of a country. For instance,  Cherai Beach in Kerala, India, known for its frequent dolphin sightings, has welcomed many visitors from all over the globe, who also wanted to enjoy  peaceful swimming in the natural waters there.  Furthermore, preserving the natural habitat helps keep the ecosystem in  balance. For example, the koalas in Australia were near extinction due to deforestation a couple of years ago but time management has now preserved this endangered species.",
        "To achieve this goal of preserving nature many steps can be taken. Firstly, the authority can enforce strict laws which include individuals paying a huge fine for disobeying state regulation. For instance, the government officials in Dubai has introduced a fine for the disposal of waste anywhere than in the place for which it has been assigned . Secondly, celebrities can help  spread awareness through their actions. For example, at their UN speech recently, all the members of the K-pop BTS had worn upcycled clothes as a statement for promoting environmental awareness. This encouraged many fans to consider doing the same and become more environmentally conscious.",
        "In conclusion, overpopulation and urbanization are a growing threat to the destruction of natural areas of beauty; however, there are many actions that can be taken, both by  officials and individuals, to protect the existing natural ecosystem."
