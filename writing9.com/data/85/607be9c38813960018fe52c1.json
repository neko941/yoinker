        "I am Viraj Pandya a veteran army officer from the Indian navy. I am writing this letter to seek information about the tour \u201cThe blue Himalayas\u201d. I found this info at the coffee shop in the brochure. Being a veteran I couldn\u2019t visit the place, however, my service at the Siachian peak had always kept me connected with the icy glaciers. The open sky of zillion stars always reminds me of my childhood days and peak\u2019s beautiful morning with golden sun lights blooms a rejuvenating day.",
        "Since the brochure has only information regarding the place. I am very keen to know the detailed tour structures, and its time plus how much will be the expense. It will be great if you drop me an email or text me a message or let me know the name of your website if you have any.",
        "I also would like to inform you that I am recovering from my post-fracture injury, due to that I might be incompetent to take part in the tour, however, I am always ready to work on my fitness level. Once I will receive all the necessary information regarding the travel I will work on my cardio and muscular fitness. That will surely support me in this future event.",
        "Anyways, I am looking forward to knowing more about this. Thank you.",
        "Best Regards,",
