        "Traffic is becoming the biggest concern nowadays due pollution also increased at a large amount. An appropriate method to resolve problems is  expanding the rate of fuel is claimed by many people. Completely agree with the given notion however there are many other solutions to resolve the trouble which I will explain in the following paragraphs.",
        "To begin with  there are several reasons why rising in fossil fuels can lead decline in corruption and traffic. First and foremost, when fuels are too expensive for citizens to buy they neglect to feed their vehicles which directly help in reducing pollution as well as deterioration created from their cars. Hence they use private means of transportation to travel which found more economical for them to clarify it. Here is an example. When individuals found it costly to use their transport instead of feeding their car for rupees 100 buy the ticket of train or bus for rupees 50.",
        "In contrast, instead of rising in the rate of engine ,oil there are suitable courses of action to reduce environmental problems and jams. firstly introducing motor vehicles which run with the help of energy sources like  Electricity. these motor vehicles are non-polluting and consuming low on ambition which helps to  rid the problem of air infection also not everyone can afford this and will help to reduce transportation jam. On the other ,hand government should reduce ticket costs of private means of shipment such as trains and buses with will encourage people to travel from it instead of using Personal one's.",
        "In nutshell, sing the rate of oil can help somehow to reduce environmental issues and  but there are other possible solutions to overcome this cause which I have justified in the Upper paragraphs."
