        "Since I'm in love with this country not just because of its scenic beauty but also find it one of the most peaceful countries to live in. Moreover, it has one of the highest rates of immigration due to opportunities related to education and employment which are readily available. To be frank, I mainly shifted here in view of getting better career opportunities.",
        "Although in the beginning, I missed my country due to cultural and language differences, I think that I've settled here pretty well now. On top of that, I have made new friends as well.  Besides, I got to work with one of the prestigious companies called Expedia which would not have been otherwise possible if I had stayed in my own country. To be honest, I am really having a whale time owing to my colleagues who are always ready to go the extra mile to help others.",
