        "On the other hand, the cons of solar power include,high installation costs .its first-time installation charges are very high and not within the reach of every common man especially,in developing countries.Furthermore, the batteries consume  a lot of space. Additionally, when the batteries get damaged the replacement cost is also high.For instance, one of my relatives has installed solar panels on the rooftop and used them for 3 years  and now the batteries need replacement however,he is finding it difficult as solar experts only can do it.",
        "In conclusion, solar energy is used in many countries to save planet earth from the harmful effects of fossil fuels.
