        "Dear Sir,",
        "I am delighted after noticing your advertisement for part-time voluntary opportunities at the museum. Archaeology and History are my favourite subjects areas and it is pleased to see there is an opportunity nearby.",
        "I have worked as a helper in a well-known gift shop for about eight months. Hence  I am familiar with handling and cleaning fragile items. I assume this would be an added qualification. in addition to the above-mentioned experience, I recently completed a certification course in \"Preservation of historical paintings\". Since there is a separate art section in your museum it would be really helpful for me to have a hands-on experience.",
        "At the moment i am being engaged in a full-time course at University. So, I am not in a position to  contribute during weekdays. Instead , I will be able to fully engage in this during Saturdays. I can start even from the next week. Looking forward to hearing a favourable response from you.",
