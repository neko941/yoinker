        "Dear Mr Tara,",
        "I am writing to you concerning an article that I read from your magazine dated 25th of December about Oyo town, which happens to be my town. However, this story is incorrect and I would like to point it out to you. For instance, it was mentioned in your magazine that we have less than 20,000 people in the town, however according to the last census held, the city has a population of above 50,000 but less than 75,000 people.",
        "I would like to emphasise that it is absolutely necessary for an international travel magazine like yours to give accurate and consistent data  because your newsletter is widely read and incorrect reports as mentioned above will be disseminated to nationals of other countries. This will give a skew perception of our town.",
        "In conclusion, I would like to suggest to your editorial team to please find a way to filter any information that will be printed for your esteemed customers. Also, if there are any doubts or need to verify any information before putting it in print, then it would be better to consult with the natives of the place or country to verify any claims. An approach as such will help your team to have validated information for your readers.",
        "I do hope my suggestions will be taken going forward to help readers get the best out of your prints. Thank you and have a lovely day ahead.",
        "Yours faithfully,",
