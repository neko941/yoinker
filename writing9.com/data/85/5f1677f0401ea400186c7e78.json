        "It is thought that because of the advancement in technology, one can prefer to watch a film on a small screen than a bigger screen. Therefore, it is more likely that people will shun to visiting the multiplex, and its popularity will diminish. I completely agree with this opinion and think that it will be hard for movie halls to sustain in the future.",
        "First of all, the latest advancement in technology called OTT (over-the-top) platform, specially designed for a smaller screen gadget like TV and laptop, has changed the way we used to watch a picture. This is because it provides a range of latest movie options with a high-resolution screen, and with less annual subscription fees. As a result, it is usual to witness a decline in the number of people visiting a Cineplex. For example, the OTT platform has launched a website called Netflix, which provides Hollywood and Bollywood movies for all ages of groups with various Genres. That\u2019s why people choose to watch a movie on the OTT platform at home, rather than go to the cinema.",
        "Secondly, nowadays it has been seen that movie ticket prices are way more expensive than it used to be. The reason for this is that they are facing a tough time surviving in the market, and because of the launch of the OTT platform, they have left with no other option. As a consequence, people avoid going to cinemas and opt to purchase an OTT platform family annual plan for the whole family. For instance, the Cineplex Entertainment Company has reported on their official website that its sale goes down by 58% after they have hiked movie ticket prices.",
        "To conclude, I strongly contend that the OTT platform will surely overpower the advantage of the bigger screen of the movie theatres. Hence, we could see a day when people completely stop going to the multiplex."
