        "How are you? Glad to see your email after 6 months. I am writing this letter as a response to the advice that you have asked, to help you with deciding whether to attend college or go for a job.",
        "I remember quite well that you mentioned that your dad has lost his employment due to the prevailing pandemic situation and because of that the financial situation is a bit tighter. Given this, you may not be enjoying the college, because you may end up taking a student loan.",
        "I think that it would be a better idea, if you could get a job. The benefits of work experience are much more, it would provide you with financial independence, a good professional network, exposure to world reality and realisation of the value of money. Furthermore, it would help you with better work prospects, if you want to attend uni later in life.",
        "Regarding the kind of work that would be suitable for you are 'Computer Assistant' in the school library, 'Front Desk Assistant' in the office etc., as you have good computer skills, better language fluency, an eye for detail and willingness to help others.",
        "I would be happy to talk to you further on this if you would want to. Feel free to call me on my mobile phone.",
