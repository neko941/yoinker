        "One section of society postulates that it is significant to maintain the neat and clear environment of home as well as work sector by planning in the right direction.  I strongly consent to the hilt with this mandate; notwithstanding, this disquisition delves into the supportive grounds in-depth, subsequently.",
        "Undoubtedly, it is imperative to maintain the hygiene of our surrounding due to being spared by the detrimental effects of life-threatening diseases. For exemplification, one survey by GNA (Guardian Newspaper of America), states that messy and dirty work-desk and home does not only invite a plethora of contaminated disorders namely: viral cold and fever but also welcomes mental conditions such as stress and anxiety. Moreover, there are numerous studies that have proven the behavioural muddles of a person that is caused by the shame of keeping filthy and unhygienic surroundings. In detail, if a person is not able to sustain the organization of stuff on the desk, definitely, he/she will have to pay more time and energy to find things, which could be the reason for anxiety, as a result.

To epitomize, as a questionnaire conducted in a company of Delhi, youngsters argued that although, maintaining stuff is pivotal but not to replace the total work hours of a person.",
        "To conclude, having explored both standpoints, I recapitulate that, I, personally, opine with the given statement that definitely one should keep the surrounding environment clean as it can be in order to progress for the betterment of a personal level, as well as to finish a task by not putting any hard and extra efforts."
