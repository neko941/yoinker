        "I visited this place last weekend. Though it has all the basic amenities like water supply yet it lacks some facilities. There is no handwash in the washroom which is creating a lot of inconvenience to the visitors.",
        "Apart from this, there is no other cleaning item which can be used to clean hands. Due to it, many players who regularly used this place face difficulty. Even, I also feel discomfort because it is a necessary product for maintaining hygiene.",
        "However, I explain this concern to the authorities but they did not provide adequate feedback. Thus, It would be really commendable if you could please take this matter into your kind consideration so that everyone can use the changing room without any discomfort.",
        "I am hoping that you will take corrective measures in order to serve the members in a better way.",
        "Yours Faithfully,",
