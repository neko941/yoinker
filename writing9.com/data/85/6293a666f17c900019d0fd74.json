        "I hope this letter finds you well and I am writing this letter to express my interest in an advertisement for a new language for your children. I am sure that I would give the best training as I am holding a master's degree in teaching methods and techniques. The  strong 10 years of professional experience that I am having is an extra qualification which will be an extra benefit to your kids to teach my local accent.",
        "Basically, I am from a village cultural background and I learnt extra cultural skills during my graduation  I can also teach these skills to your kids if they want to learn. In addition, I know how to speak and write other terminology as well  and I can also send details of that language if you guys are really interested in that. Last but not the least, I will take care of them during weekends and work as a babysitter if required.",
        "Due to ongoing Covid19, I lost my current job and I do not have any employment at this time.",
        "It has been 10 months and until now I did not find any of the best and the job is much needed for me to look after my family expenses. Hence, I look forward to hearing an update to this letter and feel  blessed to teach your children.",
        "Yours faithfully,",
