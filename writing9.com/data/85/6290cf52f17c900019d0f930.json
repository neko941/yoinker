        "Today with the new advancements around us most of the traditions have been changed. According to ,this some argue that the shopping habits now mostly rely on age factors, but I ,on the other hand, think there are plenty of various factors that modern people give credit to, which I will name  in forthcoming paragraphs.",
        "First and foremost,  money does matter in many cases. Financial factors are the most concerned factors when consumers tend to buy commercial goods. For instance, many  people nowadays, can not buy a car with a rate of petrol usage and most the olden people tend to buy brand-new cars like electric cars because, in the long, run they are affordable as the owners pay less amount of money for refuelling them. Most of today's consumers tend to expend their money on goods that are cheap and affordable instead of other habits of shopping.",
        "Secondly, the quality of an item is the most important factor to both youth and older consumers. Today many older generations tend to use smartphones because of the many new facilities they have. This can cause many  aged people to use new technology without thinking about the age gap and age-related factors.  For instance, in the recent century computers are a commonly used device among young and old people and everyone has a privet PC in their home. This may be another reason why individuals tend to notice other factors than age-related ones.",
        "In the way of conclusion, in the recent era, the public tends to shop more than ever before, however, some believe the habit of shopping accord the age factors is more popular nowadays, I think the age habits are the least important factor when it comes to shopping and other circumstances such as quality and financial factors are the most important ones."
