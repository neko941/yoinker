        "Dear Mike,",
        "I am writing to express my gratitude for the book \u201cRemote sensing of the environment\u201d that I borrowed from you last week. As you know, I was giving a presentation for one of the most revenue customers on Monday, who wants to make a 200 grand\u2019s deal. Frankly speaking, my manager told me \u201cDon\u2019t screw it up\u201d and I did not, thanks to you.",
        "Thus, the main purpose of the meeting was to demonstrate the most effective methods of damage assessment in case of oil splits, and the book was significantly helpful. I have found a chapter fully dedicated to the issue of oil spills and their affection on marine life and how to prevent it. As well as this, there was a detailed description with practical guidance, which software can be used for processing satellite data in order to assess the actual damage.",
        "One again, I really appreciated your timely assistance with this great book.",
