        "In this present world, some believe that many plastic bags and rubbish are being accumulated that we cannot fully dispose of and this let to the development of a \"throwaway\" culture. I completely agree with this. In this essay, I will discuss the reasons for this opinion.",
        "To begin with, we are using more and more plastic products and commodities that we won't be able to use the second time. For instance, the usage of plastic bags in retail stores and department stores is really high. In addition, the materials that some products use like plastic are hard to recycle so they will remain in the environment for a very long time. This shows that we have more rubbish to throw out these days due to the short lifespan of these products. Therefore, we are producing more garbage these days that are being accumulated in the environment and damaging our habitat.",
        "Lastly, the best solution for this issue is to involve the government to push policies and legislations that protect the climate. For example, some European countries such as Norway and Portugal have been doing the same thing and the results of their rigid policies can be seen in various studies. Moreover, the government should encourage companies to produce commodities that are more durable and more friendly to the environment by awarding them for their efforts. Thus, with  government intervention, the amount of rubbish produced will be decreased and this can give time for nature to recover.",
        "To conclude, the main cause of the accumulation of garbage in our time is the mass production of products that are not friendly to the environment. In my opinion, in our culture immense consumption of damaging materials to nature became a part of our culture. Given the current circumstances, I anticipate that governments of other countries will be more involved in this matter."
