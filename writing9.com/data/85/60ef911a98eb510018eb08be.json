        "I am writing this letter to advise you of the best places as well as to get you familiar with the weather conditions here. Moreover, while you will be here I will recommend different types of accommodation since I born and brought up here.",
        "I remember that you are allergic to cold weather due that I will say plan your visit next month in February because at that time the weather will be moderate. In case you want to do some adventures come near the spring season which would be in May month because you can enjoy river-rafting and bungee-jumping.",
        "Secondly, If I talk about accommodation then you can stay with me as well as there are plenty of facilities where you can feel comfortable stay. In addition to this, India is a diverse country, there are a lot of places, where we can visit for example The Golden Temple, The Red Resort, colourful city of Chandigarh and Jaipur, where you can enjoy the traditional as well as cultural food. Last but not least I will show you one of the seven wonders of The Taj Mahal.",
        "Looking forward to seeing you here soon.",
