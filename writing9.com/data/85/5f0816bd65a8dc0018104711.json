        "Gone the days when there was a guaranteed career prospect for every competent person. On the grounds that in our time getting an appropriate job has become highly competitive, some suggest that a high school student has to be in the right major of study to get hired easier in the future. I do not see eye-to-eye with those who have this point of view, for two compelling reasons.",
        "First and foremost, it is not wise to decide on the type of future career early in adolescence. Most teenagers are not mature enough to recognize what they want to do in the future. This period of life is a crucial time for youngsters as their character develops, and their perspective about things happening around them is changing day by day. Students in the early years of high school might tend to be in a particular vocational position; however, this interest is likely to be changed if they enter university. For instance, my brother always wanted to be a physician since his childhood; yet, by finding his creativity features in high school, he noticed that he does not like to practise medicine anymore. Now he is a fine lead-guitarist who has his music band and foresees to have an excellent job prospect.",
        "Furthermore, choosing a career earlier in life could be a short-sighted view as it might not help the young generation getting hired. In other words, even an early election of a career path cannot assure a student find a related position. The job market is becoming far more competitive in this present climate. Having just a single skill or an educational experience would not be helpful enough for job seekers to work in their desired role. Working in a better profession requires to be updated and often needs more than one field to be fully qualified. Take software engineering as an example. Day by day, thanks to the advancement of technology, the science of computers alters and requires expert people to operate them. For example, a software engineer who graduated years ago might not even get an interview invitation unless he/she becomes an expert in new technologies like mobile app programming or advanced computer coding.",
        "In conclusion, I believe that forcing children to choose their job sooner has adverse consequences. It is recommended that parents let their offsprings become mature enough to decide on their job prospects properly. Besides, juveniles need to shift their field of study or promote their abilities in terms of being more skilled and competent to be accepted into positions they are thriving."
