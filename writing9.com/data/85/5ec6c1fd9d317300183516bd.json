        "The agriculture sector is unpredictable because too many factors influence on yield, thereof, despite all innovations, people still do not have enough food. Consequently, as a possible solution could be global market with the implementing of barter, which keep in balance agriculture supply, because while in one country the abundance of harvest, another could feel shortage.",
        "Firstly, few people can deny the fact that all vegetables and fruits crucially depend on the weather and the infestation of bugs. In Ukraine, for example, many plant crops are dying throughout the winter months because fields was not enough snow-covered. Moreover at summer long drought or heavy rain be able to kill remain species. As a result, people always live in unpredictable conditions due to local crop productions can be destroyed.",
        "Therefore, as a solution such problem could be a global market of crop products where implement barter because all countries have different conditions for harvest. It means when in one country, for instance, wheat plants were dead, other countries have the abundance of such species; however, other species there could be destroyed. Thus, due to not all countries are wealthy and can allow buy enough fruits and vegetables, so interchange agrarian products can help people even from poor countries.",
        "To conclude, agriculture sector around the world the essential part of life each person, and at the same time the most vulnerable due to different factors. Furthermore, different countries suffer differently in one agrarian period; nevertheless, spend in order to save crops a lot. Hence, due to the economy of all these countries are harmed, global barter can be the solution of problems with shortage food."
