        "Recently, the debate on whether giving longer prison sentences is the best way to reduce crime has been heated. As far as I am concerned, providing more education should be a better way to prevent crime. In this essay, I will outline both sides and elaborate on them.",
        "To begin with, lengthen prison time will increase the cost of crime, the deterrent effect may help lower the rate of crime. For example, China has announced that the minimum cost for stealing has been changed from several days to several weeks. Therefore, people have a higher chance to think twice to see if the cost will outweigh the benefit that can bring to them by conducting the crime.",
        "In contrast, education can expose the general public to  moral judgement and know what is wrong in the long term. To explain this, many criminals feel regret after being caught and say they do not know what they do is forbidden. Moreover, Hong Kong has posted many notices on the train and the street to let people know the seriousness of smoking in public area and stealing in order to solve the crime caused by ignorant. Considering Hong Kong as one of the safest city in the world, the effect of education can be well illustrated.",
        "To conclude,  giving a longer prison period can only bar people from some bad that have lower cost, while education tends to solve the root of the problem. As a result, it can be concluded methods like noticing should be more efficient in the long term in safeguarding a city's security."
