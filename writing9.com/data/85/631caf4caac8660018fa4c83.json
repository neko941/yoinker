        "As the training is full-time, I cannot attend the office during the period. Hence, it would be greatly appreciated if you could avail me of a paid leave till the 26th of this month. I believe my absence would not affect the normal functioning of the department, as most of my colleagues have agreed not to take leave during these days.",
