        "Dear Mr John,",
        "I am writing to provide suggestions on improving our visitor hall with new facilities like changing the sofa and proving newspaper.",
        "As you are aware, there are numerous  problems reported about our amenities in the reception. Last week, a customer from Japan visited our office in Dubai to sign a legal contract with us. They were depressed and worried about the facilities in our visitor hall. They complained to me  that it did not have any newspaper as well as it was not properly organized.",
        "The reception hall is a front face for our business in this region. The facilities available there will show our professionalism to our customers. The good environment will help our business to grow more.",
        "I could recommend a couple of changes that need to happen. Firstly, I suggest you change the couch which was old and the colour on it  faded out. Another major change is to have newspapers with different editions. It helps our international clients to know about the news occurring in their country. I hope you consider these issues a high priority and resolve them as soon as possible.",
        "I am looking forward to hearing from you soon.",
        "Your\u2019s Sincerely,",
