        "Putting financial resources on Railways instead of Roads is a good idea made by governments across the world. In my opinion, I partially disagree with this statement as trains are faster as well as environmentally- friendly in comparison to vehicles. But some prefer roadways since they can drive themselves rather than depending on other drivers.",
        "To begin with, trains are faster than vehicles. This means that people can easily arrive at their destination as they use railways rather than roads. For ,instance most citizens in European countries are very punctual about their work because they travel by train. So putting funds into railway systems helps the government to make travelling faster for everyone.",
        "Railways are also eco-friendly. This statement indicates that trains release less carbon monoxide or no carbon monoxide as compared to vehicles. To illustrate this, railway systems have been adopted by most cities in India because it helps to reduce the effect of greenhouse gas which goes into the atmosphere. In addition to this financing ,rail line transport projects help the world leaders to make their countries more eco-friendly.",
        "In spite of all these facts Roadways could be beneficial. For those individuals who love to drive themselves. Railways would not be the prefered option for them. For ,example in New York City many people love to go to their offices by driving in their car. So if such people have the option between Roads and Railways they would likely choose Roads because they found it more interesting and enjoyable and hence it provides them enjoyment they seek.",
        "To conclude this topic putting finance in Railway transports is a recommendable idea as they are faster and emits less emission as compared to Roadways. Nevertheless, certain road transport can be constructed in countries where citizens value driving."
