        "First, I was delighted when I saw the name of our town in the article and I thought I would enjoy reading it, but soon I was shocked to read that there were many rubbery cases recorded in the town. I am a resident here for 20 years now, and I can assure you that this piece of information is not correct.",
        "I am sure you care enough about your reputation, thus, I suggest you publish an apology in the next audition and clarify the misunderstanding. Since the government recently started to focus on the tourist sector of the town, this incident would affect our reputation badly.",
        "Your cooperation is highly appreciated and I am looking forward to reading the article in the next publication.",
