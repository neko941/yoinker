        "The proliferation of demand for private cars, which has led to immense congestions in my cities all over the world can be undeniable. The authorities should take steps to deter citizens from private car possessions.",
        "The underlying reasons behind a huge upsurge of car consumption is the growth of the economy and technology. Global cooperations help the nations land better employment opportunities with handsome salaries. Besides, the cutting-edge technology allows countries, even developing countries such as  Viet Nam can manufacture cars on their own, thereby cutting down on the price for transportation. People are inclined to be more demanding so when being able to earn more, they are more likely to make a purchase of car, satisfying their higher demand. The number of cars is increasing suddenly while traffic infrastructures remain unchanged, thus resulting in the inevitable traffic jam",
        "To prevent it from continuing or worsening, the governments are necessitated to implement reasonable solutions.  Firstly raising awareness for citizens about the link between the excessive use of private cars and the adverse effect of environment and the huge traffic jam is essential. Secondly, traffic infrastructures should be reinvigorated by allocating greater budget for renovating public transports or adding modern means of transportation with remarkably high speed for example metros. Furthermore, improvement of the roads's equality should be paid more attention to, with an aim to providing the most comfortable zone for people travelling.",
        "In conclusion, the rapid rise of car ownership  leading to severe congestions is gaining around. This situation compels the official states to take steps without delay to squeeze the number of private cars."
