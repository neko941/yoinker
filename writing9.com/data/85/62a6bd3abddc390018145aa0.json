The phone was a brand new item and I just bought it  a week ago from the Amazon marketplace. In addition, there was a tag on the back side of my phone which can display my name and number as well.",
        "It was on Sunday and I just kept my  phone inside of the hotel room and went out to have my dinner. I just grab my dinner parcel as there was a huge rush in the hotel. Despite the rain, at night, I reached the room before 9PM and I realised that my phone was missing from my room and I am sure that I did not carry it with me since there was not enough charging.",
        "As you hear my situation and now I am submitting a claim form against  my loss. Hence, I would request you to please consider my claim request and approve it without any further delay. If you would like to know more information please find the FIR copy which I received from the local police for your reference.",
