        "Many people, especially married couples, usually have a tendency to choose a job offering many vacation days rather than a high-paid job so that they can have more time with their families. Although a post providing much time with loved ones is quite good, I support the idea that high income is regarded as one of the main purposes for two reasons.",
        "To begin with, one of the main reasons is that those who have a high salary could have enough money to pay for increasingly rapid living expenses. For example, if a dividual did not afford to cover all monthly living costs such as accommodation rent, transportation cost, food and other necessities, he would feel stressed or frustrated, resulting in a lack of working motivation and low performance. As a result, by choosing a high-paid position, the financial pressure for monthly expenditures are likely to be reduced considerably. This renders our minds more relieved and comfortable.",
        "In addition, employed people whose salaries are high could facilitate their children to have a high-quality education system. In fact, if a high-income family\u2019s children are sent to international schools despite a high tuition fee, they will have a better educational environment, fully-equipped facilities and more chances to develop their skills for a foreign language, leading to a solid background for a brighter future. This is what parents desire for their offspring. Therefore, having access to such an exceptional schooling system usually requires parents to earn a lot of money.",
        "In conclusion, while time spent with our family is considered important, a higher living standard is viewed as more significant. Consequently, a high salary could make everything become easier to deal with."
