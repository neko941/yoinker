        "I want to thank you for your help during my stay in this flat. You are a very kind and responsible person whom I have ever known. Especially, I want to say thank you for that day, when my electricity was switched off. I could do nothing in that situation, because I had not had the special knowledge and equipment to repair it. It could cause very big problems for me and my work, moreover, if I have not finished my work in time, I would have lost it. However, before I had started a panic, you had come and destroyed all issues. Thank you a lot for that help and for all other helps during the period, that I have been staying in this apartment. I hope we have become real friends and this relationship will be saved in the future.",
        "In addition, I want to say, that a friend of mine wants to rent this flat after me. If you gave a positive suggestion to this offer, she would remove here immediately after me. Please let me know your suggestion about this.",
