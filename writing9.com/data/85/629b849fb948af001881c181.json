        "Dear Jennie,",
        "Hope this letter finds you in good health and spirit. Thank you for trusting me to give you some pieces of advice before your university enrolment. So, here is what I have to say in response to your queries about the Bachelor\u2019s degree in Accounting course at Melbourne University.",
        "I understand that you want to pursue a career in accounting and finance at Melbourne University which I attended. First of all, accounting is not for someone who lacks good command of mathematics since it involves very complex techniques and skills in preparing financial statements and planning budgets, thus helping companies in getting fruitful returns after an investment. Students who graduate with accounting degrees will learn how cash flow affects the operation of a company and how to analyze the financial data from different reports such as profit and loss statements and balance sheets.",
        "There is a great advantage of the university you are choosing as it offers some of the best business syllabuses, faculty members, and internship opportunities in big4 corporations to teach you what you need to succeed.",
        "So, please visit the university website and read the success stories of the previous students who had already gained job contracts from multinational companies. From there, you will have a better idea of what a professional accountant looks like. If you would like to proceed further, feel free to contact the school admission team. They are available 24/7 online.",
        "Take care and see you soon.",
        "Warm wishes,",
