I'm thankful to express my opinion   regarding  selecting the upcoming events you are planning. Hence, you are spending a vast of money on an event.",
        "On the one hand, many children in our community need a facility and money to develop their skills in sports to keep them away from bad vices. Building good facilities and providing them with a good  uniform need a large number of funds. Therefore, the money you will help them excel in  sports. On the  other hand, Conducting an open free concert will help them relax and experience what rich people attend  an expensive celebrity concert. Some of the young individuals will inspire to develop their talent to become an artist.",
        "In my opinion, the events that your company are planning can have good benefits, but  2 years of sports sponsorship can help better ,especially for a young individual. It has a long-term benefit for their health and lessens the burden of the parents to keep them away from bad habits.",
