That being said, I am really aware that I am handling SRL Diagnostics and it is one of the biggest clients of our organisation provided that they have been associated with us for more than a decade now.",

As per our fruitful discussion, they have agreed to schedule a meeting with us again to discuss some issues, which they are currently facing.",
