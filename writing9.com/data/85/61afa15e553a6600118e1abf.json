        "in this present world, Modern technology usage is constantly on the rise. In fact, more people are becoming dependable on the internet as a learning platform. Despite the belief that the internet will eventually replace the necessity for books, I disagree with this idea. And this will be proven by analysing the fact that information from the net has no reliable sources, as well as the necessity of books in creating content for sites.",
        "Firstly, it is difficult the find valid facts on websites. It is well known that anyone could publish anything without the possibility to verify the source. For example, many people are having issues with the anonymity of the origin of the info. Which makes it questionable to use this data in comprehensive studies. Therefore, depending on the net solely is not supported due to the unknown publishers of this content.",
        "Secondly, books are the core for any learning materials on most sites. It is clear that the larger part of web information is from publications. Which make it paramount and more extensive than web pages and blogs. For instance, books are the number one source of information on Wikipedia. Thus, the need for books will never be replaced by the internet.",
        "To summarise, in addition to the fact that books are the heart of content creation on the internet, the lack of authenticity of web creators are two major factors proving that the role of books will remain critical. Therefore, I disagree that the internet will replace the need for books. After this thorough analysis, it is predicted that the necessity for books will even increase in the future."
