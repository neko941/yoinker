        "I am writing to you concerning my last visit to your restaurant on the 10th of January, which was last week Saturday. I arrived at your restaurant in the company of my friends at about 9 a.m. in the morning and we left by 4 p.m in the evening; we really had a good time.",
        "We actually decided to visit the restaurant on the occasion of my friend's 25th birthday celebrations, and when it comes to birthdays, I see it as a means of showing gratitude for life. So it is something to look forward to and celebrate as well.",
        "In all sincerity, I was amazed at the food and services offered. The menu was fantastic because you have so many arrays of both local and intercontinental dishes, also your waiters are so courteous, I had to tip a couple of them for delivering excellent services.",
        "Finally, I would love to come again and do extend my sincere appreciation to your staff. Do have a wonderful day ahead of you. Thank you so much.",
