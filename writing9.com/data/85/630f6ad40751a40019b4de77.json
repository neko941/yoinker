        "Dear Sir,",
        "I am Utsav, who recently purchased a dining set from your store on the 18th of September, writing to express my remorse regarding the services rendered by your organisation, The Pepper Fry.",
        "To begin with, 2 of the 4 chairs of the dining set lack proper padding. As a result, my family and I always feel uncomfortable sitting on them. Additionally, one of the chairs has burnt marks on its leg.",
        "Upon discussing the same with the service department of your firm, I was treated condescendingly by the service manager, Mr Harish Singh, over a telephone call, who told me to deal with this hurdle on my own while neglecting my service request.",
        "In the wake of this problem, I would like to request you to kindly provide a resolution on the same by replacing the dining set with a brand new one or providing a technician to repair the aforementioned issues. I am certain that you would investigate this problem at your earliest convenience.",
        "I look forward to your response.",
        "Yours faithfully,",
