        "We arrived here last week, still we are in the process of making ourselves comfortable in our new home. I am really happy with the neighbourhood and the structure of the house, it is quite the same as I saw in the photographs that send me during our negotiations.",
        "By the way, I some found furniture in the master bedroom which needs some attention. Especially, the wardrobe closet. Some of its drawers are really hard to move. In addition, the writing table  makes some noise when I put something on it. Since we moved here recently, and we are still new to English speaking neighbourhood, it would be a great help if you can come over here and help us by contacting someone who can fix these issues or please let me know the whereabouts of a place where I can go and do an exchange.",
        "I would appreciate your immediate attention to this matter and I am looking forward to hearing from you.",
