        "Undoubtedly,there is a huge ongoing debate between playing sports as a person and as a team.There are pros and cons for each of these.Having said that, we shall discuss a few advantages in this essay.",
        "Primarily, there are many gaming activities such as cricket, and football ,where it is necessary to play as a club .A set of people opt to play as a group because these games help to interact with other mates and gain extra knowledge which consequently motivates us to improve our work.For instance, if we consider any cricket team,it has a captain who encourages and guides his teammates to play well.For example, My cousin is interested in cricket and is good at bowling but lags a bit in fielding.Nevertheless, after joining an academy and becoming part of a group,her leader taught some excellent techniques and ideas .Now she became a team player and doing great,both bowling and fielding.",
        "Secondarily,Other sets of members choose to play individually and it has its fair share of advantages as it helps in an individual's personal growth and brain improvement.Here, we are our boss and make our own decisions and  success and failure,  are decided by us.There is no necessary to answer or question anybody ,except  ourselves . In particular, we have games such as swimming and chess, where an individual is responsible for all his moves and the triumph can be enjoyed alone.",
        "To conclude, I personally prefer to play any sport individually as I like to make choices of my own and am ready to bear the burden of failure as well the fruits of victory,"
