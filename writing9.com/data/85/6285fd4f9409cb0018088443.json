        "While a certain group believes food quality has made improvements due to technology and scientific breakthroughs, others think this advancement may have some negative effects on humans. I will discuss both views and give my opinion at the end.",
        "First of all, new equipment and science have improved the processing of food.  Preserving  food has become easier as chemicals are being added to make them stay longer. Also, with refrigerators, they can stay longer. For instance, someone coming home late from work wouldn't worry about his food spoiling when he owns a fridge and there is power. Secondly, the production of materials is done faster and it is easier to monitor the quality. However, there can be a lack of enthusiasm and carelessness from employees to do so.",
        "On the other hand, some of the chemicals used in improving food quality can be dangerous and can expose humans to some diseases. For example, eating a lot of can food has been said by many health professionals to result in cancer. In addition,  there is less supervision because most people believe that these machines are faster and more accurate. Furthermore, a lot of  fake food products are certainly more than before mainly because most producers are more concerned about making profits than worrying about their customers. Nonetheless, I Believe more supervision and quality techniques would go a long way toward improving consumables.",
        "In conclusion, Science and Technology have brought more ways to improve food for humans. Hence, I believe more research and solutions need to be effected to remedy harmful chemicals."
