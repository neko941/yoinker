        "Dear Sir,",
        "I am writing this letter to inform you about inconvenience facing by company\u2019s staff due to lack of cafeteria within our company.",
        "The issue related to the cafe is raised by all the workers in the last social meeting of our company. The majority of workers want a place where they can sit for their break and can refresh themselves with tea or coffee along with some snacks. I think it is very important to set up a canteen as we have been working on a very critical and urgent project. Now, workers have to go to the next side of the road to bring snacks and tea which waste their productive time. Moreover, room number B-6 is not occupied and I consider it best for the caf\u00e9 because this room is large in space and easily accessible to all rooms.",
        "I hope you will understand the problem and arrange to set up a cafeteria for the staff of our company.",
        "Yours sincerely,",
