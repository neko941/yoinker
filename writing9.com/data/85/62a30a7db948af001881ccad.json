        "Some parts of the population argue that kids should stay with their parents at home until when they are around the age of six or seven. While others think that it is crucial for the young ones to start attending school much earlier. I believe that starting school before a child attains his or her 6th birthday will  be more beneficial in that the child will have a high intelligence quotient and also develop social skills early enough in life.",
        "To begin with, commencing educational carrier as early as  the 7th year of life will go a long way in helping a youngster to develop a high level of knowledge concerning different areas of      research. In addition, expanding their horizons and academic performance of the offspring. Thus, putting them on the advantage side of life. For example, a study conducted by a renowned American based sociologist showed  that 98% of pupils  who were introduced to school just a few months after birth had better academic performance as compared to their counterparts. This showed that early commencement of school develops horizon.",
        "Furthermore, early exposure to the academic world will assist the baby to develop interactional and behavioural skills. Hence, making them sociable and friendly. Additionally, these skills are applied much later in life to enhance  carrier success. For instance,  an article published  in a UK journal revealed that adults who attended school at a very tender age  interacted and related with other colleagues better than those who attended late. This has proven the fact that the importance of being in an academic cycle much earlier in life can not be overemphasized.",
        "In conclusion,  even though some groups of individuals prefer kids to be in the classroom before they are 8 years old. I am of the opinion that such children should be enrolled a lot more early because it will offer them the opportunity to build up knowledge and acquire relational abilities."
