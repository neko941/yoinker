        "My name is Zannatul Firdaus. I am a service holder. I live in Khilgaon. Today I am writing this letter to inform you that, at ,present we are facing some issues with the garbage disposal in our area.",
        "To embark with, Our area is very populated. Most of the people are jobholders. Normally the waste collector come at noon, but nowadays they come early in the morning. Though  they come in that time I do not think that  people can complete their household chores, therefore they throw the waste on the road.",
        "In addition, for this ,reason people face many problems. Moreover, as the community dispose of their waste on road, it creates a bad smell. Furthermore, it causes many health issues for children and older people. Over and above, if the public leave their garbage anywhere, then when it will rain the drains will cover with garbages and dirty water will fill the road.",
        "However, I would like to tell you that, please take some strict actions for this, and if you can please fix a time for collecting waste.",
        "I hope you will understand our situation and take some steps. Thank you for the time you read my letter.",
        "With regards,",
