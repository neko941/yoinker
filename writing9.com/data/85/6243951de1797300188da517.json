        "Nowadays the same products may be available for purchasing everywhere on the earth, resulting in growing commonalities across nations. While states become more similar, I think this would be a double-edged sword.",
        "Firstly, the accessibility of an identical thing across  nature is causing national erosion. For example, in the past, the majority of Hong Kong people wore qipao or Korean wore hanbok. Nevertheless, the entry of multinational brands such as Gucci, Louis Vuitton and Nike\u2026 into the fashion market has resulted in an increase in young folks wearing Western-style attire. As traditional clothes of some land are being supplanted by Western designs, some of the region\u2019s long-held ideals are being lost. Furthermore, as English becomes the most popular language on  earth, most parents force their children to study English or learn at International schools. It leads many children to forget their mother tongue, they cannot even talk with their grandparents or they need translators.",
        "Secondly, the countries become increasingly similar, the tourism business may suffer. Nations pay money to discover unique things from other countries. For example, many individuals go to Korea just because of the extremely popular food called bibimbap. However, authentic Korean restaurants now can be found all around the world, so people no longer need to go to Korea to sample true Korean cuisine. Moreover, people can get whatever but not even try to travel to other countries. For instance, in the past, K-pop fans needed to travel to Korea to buy their idols\u2019 goods and albums. They were charged for the aircraft trip in addition to the albums\u2019 price. With the flow of time, people easy to buy their idols\u2019 albums and goods online or in stores.",
        "By way of conclusion, getting any other cultural things in our countries is a double-edged sword. It can make people easy to buy everything from other countries, but it also erodes the culture of some countries."
