        "It is true that chained supermarkets are growing in number and expanding in different countries thanks to globalization. According to some people, this phenomenon has killed the business of  local communities. I totally agree with this statement. This essay will explore my reasoning in details.",
        "Needless to say that people would rather buy their products cheap from one of the  chained supermarkets  that have the lowest price guaranteed policy rather than buying them from one of  the local convenience stores in their neighbourhood. This can make small stores unable to compete with them and lose their customers. Eventually, most of them will have to close and lose their jobs due to not having enough customers. For instance, Walmart a big American store with thousands of branches in North America is a prime example of what is called an unbeatable price policy. Since Walmart buy their products in large numbers, they will get the lowest price possible from the distributors. Therefore, they can sell them for the cheapest possible price. Local stores are unable to sell their products cheap and will lose their customers.",
        "Another reason why the presence of these stores can kill the local economy lies in the fact that small stores are usually selling mostly local fresh produce coming from local farmers, while big stores can bring their perishable from anywhere around the world and  sign contracts with whoever gives them a better price. Thus, local farmers might not be able to sell their fresh produce to supermarkets unless they adjust their prices to the lowest offer possible. In this case, they might not be able to survive due to not being able to sell their fresh produce cheap. As a result, the whole economy including the local producers might lose their jobs.",
        "To sum up, it seems to me that the presence of huge grocery markets like Costco and Walmart can kill the economy because neither the local stores nor local farmers can survive in the market with their presence."
