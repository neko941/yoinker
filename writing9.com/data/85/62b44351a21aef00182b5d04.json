Therefore, applying through the company, it will be easy to carry out the training course. Additionally, I am requesting financial aid  regarding  the course fee. It will be appreciated  if there is any possibility to bare the course cost by the company.",

Hope you will understand the importance of the training course which I have mentioned above.",
