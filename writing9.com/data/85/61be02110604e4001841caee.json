        "Dear Elyn,",
        "Hope you are doing well. I am writing this letter to enquire about the possibilities of getting a part-time job in Boston. I got admission to Boston University for post-graduation in Management and classes will commence in January.",
        "As you know, to study and stay in a city like Boston, without a part-time job it would be too miserable. Moreover, I need to cover all my expenses including quarterly tuition fees, monthly rent for accommodation and food too. In addition to that, if I would work in a temporary role it gives me great exposure to work culture and connecting people. So that it will be useful for my internship.",
        "As an ex-employee of Macdonald at Boston, I hope you can recommend me to get a job. However, I have 3 years of experience in the packing section of Macdonald\u2019s in India. If you would not mind please circulate with your peer group regarding this. I would be grateful if you help me in this matter.",
        "Appreciate your understanding in this matter.",
        "Hope to hear from you soon,",
