        "Usually, it is argued that tourism plays an important role in the income sources of many areas while on the other hand, it may lead to the cause of many problems if management is bad. In this essay, I will discuss the pros and cons of tourism with suitable examples.",
        "First of all, beautiful and famous parts of the country take the attention of the tourists. They come from all over the world just to see the beauty of nature. For example, in Pakistan, there are many famous places like Muree, Swat, Naran Kaghan, Azad Kashmir and Kumrat. They are known for their natural charm. They stay in hotels, buy things like clothes, dry fruits etc which ultimately contribute to the mean of revenue. Azad Kashmir is very popular for its greenery and dried fruits too. Tourists from all over the earth come here and enjoy the place and buy these goods too. That is why the earth mainly relies on travel as the main source of its income.",
        "Secondly, there are some other factors that are responsible for many problems if they are not organised well. Lack of facilities e.g non-availability of hotels may lead to many issues. For instance, According to the world tour organization, providing better quality food, hotels and guide is the right of the tourists. If these needs are not fulfilled then it will lead to a decrease in travel So, management of that places should be very well because it is directly linked to their wage.",
        "In the conclusion, there are many places in the sphere that are very well known for their beauty, nature, food and many things. It is believed that managing things according to the situation is too important because if they are not managed well so it will be the responsibility for many issues."
