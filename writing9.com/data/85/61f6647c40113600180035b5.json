        "Secondly, your restaurant is the right location as this is not as far from my place which would suit me a lot if I get this job. Also, it will be beneficial for you as in the overflow work I can be there within a few mins because my residence is 10 mins away.",
        "Lastly, the evening time will suit me as in the morning time I have to take my university classes, and after completion of my classes, I will come straight to your restaurant for the interview if it is fine for you.",
