        "In this day and age, people are putting an enormous amount of effort into constructing their dream house. Many people claim that new constructions should be designed to blend in with surrounding areas while others believe that house owners should have the right to erect their accommodations however they want. In this essay, I will discuss both mentioned views before drawing the final conclusion why I lean towards the latter.",
        "On the one hand, it is undeniable that building houses that are the same as former ones is beneficial. The most significant advantage of this trend is that tourism will be boosted given that historical locations and buildings, which attract a great number of visitors, will be preserved. For example, Hoi An, which is an ancient city in Viet Nam, has gained a reputation for its traditional houses and stores along the streets and has welcomed thousands of travellers a year, which is a great contribution not only to tourism  but also to the national economy.",
        "On the other hand, I am more convinced that citizens have the right to build their accommodation freely. The primary reason is that they are the legal owners of the house, hence, there is no reason why they can not construct it based on their own desire. If they can live in an apartment that suits their preference, it will be more pleasant for them, compared to being forced to design the house to fit in with local surroundings. Another reason is that people can save a lot of money if they construct houses that follow the modern design, providing that this style is simple and minimal, unlike the conventional style of construction. By doing this, citizens can set aside more to invest in other aspects of their lives, such as health and hobbies, as well as to contribute more to society through charity.",
        "In conclusion, it is impossible to argue against the opinion that people should build houses that follow the style of their residential areas. Nonetheless, I am of the idea that house owners should be the ones who decide the design of their homes."
