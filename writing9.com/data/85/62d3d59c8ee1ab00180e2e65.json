        "I hope you are doing well. I am Cole Chen who is your neighbour next to your house, and I can give you a hand next summer.",
        "I would be the person whom you are looking for.  Firstly, I have lived in our town for more than 20 years, and I like doing household at home. When I was young, I always helped my mum to clean the backyard and trim the garden. Secondly, I am studying for a diploma in house art which means I can decorate your home as well as my house after I do some labour jobs for you.",
        "I appreciate you giving me an opportunity to help you. If that is good for you, I can come next Monday, 18 July every day except Wednesday and weekends, as I have another part-time job which makes me unable to go to your place.",
        "I am looking forward to hearing from you.",
        "Yours sincerely,",
