        "Renting a house has been becoming increasingly common in recent years . While some persons  think  that this trend has many negative consequences  and prefer owning  their home. Personally, I take the view that the disadvantages  of renting a home can outweigh its advantages .",
        "On the one hand , hiring a residence has  significant merits to people . The first reason is that everyone can be able to have a house without having a large sum of money . For example , the newly married couple can have a children's residence  by renting one despite their financial situation .the second reason is that renting a property brings people more ease and convenience   , especially if they plan to change the city or the country such as junior workers and students . Thus , this form of living has some advantages .",
        "On the other hand , there are many reasons why individuals prefer owning a property instead of renting one . Firstly, it provides persons with the feeling of being protected and secure . In other words , if individuals buy their property , they will not be anxious about the cases when they will not able to pay the proprietor . However, they feel comfortable and confident . Secondly, the act of paying the sum of money every month for a long period is not an economic solution . To put it simply, if persons calculate the amount of money they spent during a long time , they will find that wasted an immense sum total which  should be invested in buying a residence rather than rent it . Thus, this tendency is not convenient in a long term",
        "In conclusion, despite that renting a house can have a few merits , I strongly believe that the benefits which it brings about can exceed its drawback and  owning a home is the best choice ."
