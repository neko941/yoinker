        "Holiday destinations are always a popular talk among society. A bunch of humans will plan for their home country rather than visiting foreign in the coming future. I partially agree with this and will demonstrate the same in this essay along with my opinion.",
        "To begin with, native countries are always placed first when planning for a vacation. Firstly, in this era of financial crisis people usually decide the places according to their budget. Moreover, if they are short of money they visit the nearby tourists' attractions. For instance, most of the parents need to deal with several things to run their house in a good manner so they opt to spend less when it comes to vacation. Secondly, many professionals are bound with commitments so in the end they are left with quite less amount of time. As a result, by looking after their current situation they have creates their plan with the leftover time.",
        "On the other hand, visiting abroad countries will always be in trend. First and Foremost, many people want to step out from their habitat towards different territories because of exploring purpose. To add on, they want to visit lookout different places with their naked eyes which they have seen on the internet. For example, numerous travel portals show the attractions which appeal to their eyes, and they accordingly make their mind to visit such tourist spot physically. Lastly, encouragement of adapting to the culture abroad country, they usually make themselves visit. Hence, there are several festivals that foreign people celebrate which are not usually available in their native city.",
        "To conclude, numerous tourists site are worth visiting in the home country, however, foreign geographical serves many different experiences for the visitor. So, I think that totally depends on the tourists that what are their requirements."
