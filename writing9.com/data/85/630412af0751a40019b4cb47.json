        "My name is Alan White, a resident of the northern region of this city. I am writing to complain about the recent unreliability of your bus company's service.",
        "I have been taking your 301 bus to work for many years. I habitually get on the bus at the Star Road station at 8.15am and get off at the Cook Road one and I note that the 301 bus normally does not delay for more than 10 minutes even though there is mild snow in the winter. Things changed completely since August, however. Buses are now more often than not missing the timetables although I do not see any traffic congestion after i get on the bus, I guess there must not be a traffic jam before I get on too as those areas are not in the city centre.  With that being said, now I need to get up half an hour earlier and take the 7.45am bus to provide spare time for bus delays. This is actually eating into my rest time and makes me extremely tired.",
