        "Many people share the perspective that the goal of every country should be to produce more materials and goods. While others might argue in contrast to that and that is because some believe that there are other factors like quality of living which must be taken into consideration by a country. On the other side, people supporting the production of resources have a mindset that it is the key to make a country more developed. In this essay, I will discuss both sides. In my opinion, I firmly agree that a nation's goal should be to manufacture more goods.",
        "To begin with, manufacturing items in the province is like climbing the ladder of development. This is because exporting commodities is a major factor when it comes to the development and power of a nation. For instance, if a province wants to buy resources like phones or any other sorts of things manufactured in other states then it needs to pay an ample amount of duty taxes and shipping charges to that very province. In other words, we are all aware that any products made in the US or China if brought to India or provinces similar to that need to pay heavy duty taxes. That's why states find it more profitable to produce their own products.",
        "On the contrary, apart from making materials, a nation must take care of other factors as well like the quality of living. It is every state's duty to look after its folks along with its development. To put it more simply, the focus should also be on things like recession problems, accommodation and congestion in the city. Appropriate measures must be taken like creating job opportunities for unemployed folks, constructing new buildings and rails.",
        "To conclude, the factors portrayed by two different perspectives of people are justifiable and must be taken into consideration. But it is very important for a province to be developed enough to support its population. As mentioned earlier in the essay, I hold the view that every state should make more goods and materials so that they can progress."
