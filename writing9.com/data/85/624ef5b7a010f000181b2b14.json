        "Humans have always been sociable animals. Therefore, friendship has been valued among people to the point that some of them even make friends online while others disagree and consider this relationship a real interaction. I mostly agree with the latter group.",
        "On the one hand, online friendship is beneficial at some point. Firstly, an individual can find more friends through the internet rather than through reality. In today's world, people are often too busy with their jobs and families that do not have enough time to meet a new person face-to-face, whereas they spend much time surfing the internet. For example, a nurse can easily attend some chat rooms or websites such as Facebook or Instagram and talk to others, while meeting a person is much more time-consuming. Secondly, internet users can find like-minded people around the world and become friends by sharing information. That will require more effort, time and even money in the real world.",
        "On the other hand, I almost agree with those who prefer face-to-face friendship. In this way, the relationship can become deeper through time. Friends should hang out and bond with each other by spending more high-quality time together. For instance, they usually have some nights out together and experience different things which may result in excitement, happiness, anger and so on, which is almost impossible in online friendships. Consequently, the risk of deception and fraud will be decreased because most people cannot pretend for a long time in real friendship in spite of the internet.",
        "In conclusion, while there is a population who are fond of making friends through the internet, I support others who prefer to meet someone and become friends."
