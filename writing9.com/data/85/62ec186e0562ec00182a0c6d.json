After all, this essay will discuss the main causes of Global Warming including rising carbon dioxide emissions and deforestation. This essay will be suggested essential remedies to these difficulties such as mitigating the effects of fossil fumes and using environmentally friendly energy sources.",
        "On the one hand, there is a broad range of challengings that assist to improve the pace of  Global Warming. After all, with the industrial reform in the 19th century, the average temperature in the whole  part of the earth commenced to go up on the ground of massive carbon emissions. Furthermore, in the second half of the 20th century, the blooming population generated excessive consumerism that give the pace to logging campaigns to meet their basic needs. Hence, without its forests - which are called the lungs of  nature, the overall temperature begins to rise due to crowded cities and fumes created by cars, plains and others.

For instance, thanks to one of the latest technological novices, including CDs and DVDs which carry information that causes to  fall off the paper using thereby with the Elon Musks vehicles which run both solar and electric energy.",
        "In a nutshell, the latest phenomenon of soaring temperature situation and water rising in the earth's oceans creates stakes that future generation meets.
