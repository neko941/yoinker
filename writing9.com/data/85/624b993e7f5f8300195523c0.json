The way they invite us was very grateful and everyone in the hotel was so polite and very friendly. Even they came to know about my son's birthday later they give a surprise gift which takes our day even more special. There are so many varieties of cuisines they are offered to choose. Especially, Barbeque was very spicy and tasty. They have a special menu and arrangements for parties and other gatherings also. I suggest you please take this matter to everyone so that folks are really enjoying and spend a memorable time in that beautiful location.",
