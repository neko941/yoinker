Therefore, I have been overloading my knowledge with practical experience since I have graduated. While I had had a profound awareness of all techniques in the field, I decided to enhance my path with an academic degree. Moreover, I have to choose 10 subjects among 15 ones, so I need your help to pick the ideal topics that will help me in the field. I will send the list of available curriculums.",
