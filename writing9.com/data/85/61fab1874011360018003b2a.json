        "I am writing this missive to let you know that the recently installed garbage collection system is not functioning in the right manner because of the damage in its motor that is caused when it was raining constantly in the last few days.Thus,the rubbish is filled at the dustbins and the garbage is stuck at a particular place.Since the machine is not working which will move forward the rubbish.",
        "I would like to explain the scenario, it's been 4 weeks when rubbish is stored at the dustbins and the movement has been stopped.As a result, various cases related to dangerous diseases like Malaria have been rapidly increasing at an alarming rate in my locality and due to the rubbish kept outside the houses, it stinks a lot in the locality that affects the physical as well as mental health of the people.",
        "From my point of view,you should address these issues immediately by ensuring that the motor gets replaced as soon as possible and please give the duties to the local sweepers to clean the garbage from the automatic dustbins and dispose the rubbish to the desired area.",
        "I hope to hear from you soon",
