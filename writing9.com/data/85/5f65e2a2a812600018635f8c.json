        "There is no doubt that many languages are endangered. It is often thought that this  trend is beneficial; however, I personally believe that this is true because it improves communication between countries and reduces the conflicts  among them.",
        "Firstly, when the number of languages has died out, people would start a conversation in available medium. By doing this, the barriers could be blurred and open plenty of opportunities in multiple levels. Additionally, various business sectors could be witnessed  a great leap. In other words, if both partners vernacular is  same, that makes  positive energy there, which would enable to have strong connections.  For instance, a recent study showed that  during a business meeting if everyone speaks similar, which might be more successful.",
        "Secondly, countries boundaries can be overturned by having a bilateral conversation among enemies. The reason for this that the key cause can be discussed and maybe they could reach an  agreement or peace settlement.Another point is to consider here that  extinction is the part of evolution since we are part of a small global village. Alternatively, speaking different languages divide mankind and they could not grow  as we expected.  For example, in India, a country with more than 20 entirely different medium of communication. Despite the differences, they live unitedly as they have  two official languages both Hindi and English.",
        "In conclusion. even though people have a different view on whether  the extinction causes any problem, I firmly believe that this brings benefits to individuals and  society. It is predicted that this disappearance  will be continued even in the future."
