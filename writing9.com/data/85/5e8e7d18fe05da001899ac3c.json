        "I am writing this letter regarding a big conglomerate buying the Victoria Park near our locality and our community's effort to abandon the deal. As you know, during these difficult times of the worldwide pandemic, people are requested to stay in isolation, and to bring the conglomerate down to its knees, the locals are protesting to save the park. In addition, there are no natural faunas around the area and if this area is bought by this multinational company, we will have pollution as well as traffic issues. Currently, the park serves well to the needs of elderly people and children for various leisure activities and sports.",
        "I request you to publish an article against this organisation to abandon the deal. If we are unable to stop this organisation, then I'm afraid, we will need to proceed with protests in large gatherings and take the matter to the county municipal bodies.",
