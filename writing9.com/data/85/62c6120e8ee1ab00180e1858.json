        "Dear Sarah,",
        "I am writing this letter to share my experience with the music institution in my area.",
        "In your last letter, you enquired about the details of my music club. First of all, this academy is built in a large area and there is a lot of space for parking so you will hardly face that issue. Secondly, all classrooms are centrally air-conditioned which provides a pleasant ambience to the students. Finally, it is accompanied by contemporary musical instruments which are simple and fascinating to use and a huge staff of qualified teachers who assists pupils to learn quickly.",
        "The class which I liked the most was the classical one so, I would like to suggest you take that one and for that, there is only one best teacher whose name is Mr John. If  are you able to take classes from him this will be icing on the sugar.",
        "You should go with this club because it is learning-oriented rather than just making profits, the staff is already guided to teach the student and the best thing is that they only charge for only once until the child will be pro in it. Also, it offers a variety of music classes at economical prices.",
        "I look forward to meeting you soon when you come here till then take care of yourself.",
        "Kind regards,",
