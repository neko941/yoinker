        "It is thought by many that the biggest environmental issue these days is the death of specific living creatures, while others think that there are bigger issues than that. In my opinion, I agree with the second opinion, because Plastic Waste and Global Warming are bigger threats to us.",
        "On the one hand, protecting animals and plants is one of the responsibilities of humans. That is, any animals and plants have a serious position in the environmental cycle. In other words, without particular species of them, the survival of humans faces danger. For example, in the northern part of ,Iran the Iranian tiger has disappeared, because of this, the population of wolfs is increased, so they came close to residential regions without any fear of tigers, and they kill residents and their ships and cows. As a result, not only is it important the loss of particular species of plants and animals, but also any species of them are essential for humans.",
        "On the other hand, the mentioned problem is not the main one. Nowadays, there exist some environmental problems which have more consequences than the loss of species. In fact, these kinds of problems have an effect on the whole of the world. For instance, climate change and heat waves which are caused by humans are the most important problems. Because if the earth becomes a heater, a big part of species and even humans will die and disappear. So, the earth will not be suited for living. As a result, there more problems exist that are vital, and need to be spent time and money on them.",
        "To conclude, while the death of specific species (like Flora) is a big problem nowadays, I think Plastic Waste and Global Warming are the biggest issues here. We have to confront these two major threats first, then deal with the killing of different kinds of living creatures."
