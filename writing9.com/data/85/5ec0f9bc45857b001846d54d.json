In my opinion, conventional teaching has stunning feelings, but educators are always using proven methods that have been practiced for more. For instance, some of the teachers are apathetic to teach for the students because their aims only salary doesn't educate them better. I think they should be cautious and the can also be a friend with them so it will motivate them for studying purposes.",
        "From what we have discussed above, we can clearly draw a conclusion that conventional methods are proven to be working and teachers should have a relationship with the students."
