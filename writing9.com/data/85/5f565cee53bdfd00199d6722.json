For instance, employees, students and journalists using applications, namely Microsoft office. Additionally, websites which you deal with them only by typing on the keyboard. As a result, nowadays, most  people use  technology for typing rather than traditional writing.",
        "Secondly, a recent study had illustrated that  the reason for such a switchover is mainly because  an individual can save time as well as exertion. Furthermore, these websites and applications are so flexible that a person can edit or change the word within a single click. According to the survey conducted by the management student, he said 80% were youngsters who like to use a computer for writing while the remaining population still follow the traditional method. Finally, people are abolishing handwriting and adopt the new methodology of writing to develop their skills and to be in demand in the job market.",
