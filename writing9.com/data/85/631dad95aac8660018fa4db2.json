        "Great to hear from you, I hope you're doing well. I'm thrilled to know that you're thinking to move here to find a job. London is a densely-populated city. Therefore, you will get a good opportunity to find a suitable job for you.",
        "I agree with you, that you need to find a language school to improve your speaking skill first, and I'm sure you did your own search, but let me tell you, that I asked for you my friends and many of them recommend  Language House. It is  old school and it has a 5-star rating on Google.",
        "what is good about this school is that it offers a dormitory for the students from abroad for a reasonable price if they have registered for the 5 courses.  Besides that,  it is located slap-bang the city centre, which means you can, either cycle or even walk to any place you need.",
        "I served the web and found out that they start a new course on the first of every month ,but you have to inform them two weeks in advance that you will be with them. The admission fees and the registration form can be done by  phone call within 10 to 15 minutes only.",
        "Anyway,let me know what you decide, and for any questions please drop me a line and will help you out with anything I can do for you.",
        "All the best,",
