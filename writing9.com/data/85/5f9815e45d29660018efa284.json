        "The criminal record is one of the main problems during the last  decade. One group of believe that individuals' unlawful history needs to be abolished  after they attain the age of 18. I totally with this statement because it can make a person more civilized, and will enhance their acceptability by others.In this essay,I shall elaborate for topic further.",
        "Firstly,people can be relieved from the stress or the guilt due to their illegal past behaviour, if there is no documentation on it.

        "Secondly,when such a person is not liked or accepted by others, then the risk to commit a crime in the future increases.

Therefore, the acceptance by the society improved, also resulted in a decrease in the crime level.",
        "To conclude, it is certainly a great idea to clear the criminal data of a body, to enhance  his or her acceptance in the society, and to make him or her more civilized."
