        "In the present world of ,globalization the boundaries of the continents have melted, as a majority of the people are doing trades with each other regardless of their physical location. The developed one export new technologies to the developing regions, and the developing one, in turn, provide them with food items. There is always a debate around, how much foodstuff should be produced by different nations and how much need to be imported. Some folks feel that states should produce the foodstuff that their population eats and limit the imports. I denounce the said statement and will be discussing  my opinion in the following paragraphs.",
        "The first supporting reason for my point of view is that many continents of the world are totally dependent on irrigation for their economies. If the consumption of the crops that they grow decreases, it will surely impact their growth and in some ,cases they might even go bankrupt. For instance, there are various states like India, Africa and some parts of Europe which export important food products like Rice, Potato, sugar and coconut. Reducing the import by developing parts of the globe will have a negative implication on their future.",
        "The second argument for my viewpoint is that on the contrary, there are many developed countries that have excellent economies but they have limited land area for agriculture. It is practically impossible for them to grow food for their own area. There are many examples, like Demark, Spain, Dubai and Switzerland are totally dependent on others for their basic necessities. If they start importing less then their social infrastructure will not be able to handle that situation resulting, in the failure of the governments.",
        "In the nutshell, we can accumulate the fact that all the countries in the world are interdependent on each other and if any change is made in the basic nature of the import and export then it will drastically affect the trade circle which had been in place for centuries. So, to keep the machine running we should not interrupt the trade cycle."
