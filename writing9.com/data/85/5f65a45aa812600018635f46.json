        "Motorways are significantly helpful for people, who have to reach in a short time on the job or any other places because speed limits always high and a person does not face any traffic lights. As we know there are a plethora of advantages of freeways, as on the other side high rates of accidents and noise pollution in residential areas are the biggest disadvantages. Driving carefully on high- speed and building the highways far from residential areas are the most suitable solutions to these problems.",
        "To begin with, the primary issue of a motorway is high- speed limit, which sometimes causes fatal accidents. Although  it makes highways super fast and quickest way to travel, it also causes many problems for ridders for those who are driving very fast with no care of accident though. Moreover, second main complication is noise pollution, which produced by high-speed of vehicles so it is very hard for those people who are living close by the motorway. For example, M1 is the longest highway in Australia accident rates are very high, which occurred on it and people not to prefer to buy the house near to highway.",
        "On the other hand, there are solutions to fix these problems, if people drive with care all the time then speed limits will no longer be a cause of accidents and people should avoid line changes in high traffic times on high speed. Furthermore, the government should build the highway far from the residential areas if it is not possible so they should build high walls around the sides so noise and access can be controlled. For instance, M1 motorway in Australia crossing less residential area but the government covers in with proper wall around it.",
        "In conclusion, therefore, high speed- limits and turbulence from vehicles are the major problems of motorways but nevertheless, it can be solved by the care of riders and with the little attention of the ministry."
