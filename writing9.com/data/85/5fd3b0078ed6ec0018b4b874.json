With each passing day, students spend a lot of time while dealing with its preparation that really made their lives complicated, there is enough chance for improvement. Significant numbers of candidates do react differently because of pressure. The present essay will discuss the topic in a broader manner.",
        "Firstly, an examination holds important carrier value. Pen and paper pattern is used widely in most countries now. They are a sign of system. They must ensure every generation has easy access to them. For instance, an individual system in Japan. But undoubtedly, one of the benefits of this is that they are less stressful.

However, teachers and students to play a vital role in tracking this subject. Many people believe that formal \u201cpen and paper\u201d examinations are not the best method of assessing educational achievement. Therefore, the computer is the best way to do it."
