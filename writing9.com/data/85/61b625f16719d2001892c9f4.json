        "In fact, I am amazed by what you did for me on the day of the accident. The nurse told me that you stayed there with my family during all my recovery days. In addition, I truly appreciate that you donated your blood to me where other strangers will consider many times before doing it.",
        "On this occasion, I would offer you a family meeting next Sunday at 8:00 PM as sign of gratitude. My wife will cook us a turkey with some vegetables from our garden. After that, we will celebrate the birthday of my younger child.",
        "Thank you again for everything, and I hope that you will accept my modest invitation.",
