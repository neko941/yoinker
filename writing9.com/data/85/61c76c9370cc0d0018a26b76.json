        "The topic of people\u2019s health has become increasingly popular nowadays. However,some experts believe that the health situation in society may deteriorate soon. As for me, I agree with this prediction only partially. And in this essay, I will explain why.",
        "Every year the number of factories around the world increases, and it contaminates the environment more and more every year .Obviously, this can cause well-being issues. For instance, people from my town are suffering from a nuclear station which is situated just  7 kilometres away from where I live.On average ,20 people per year die because of the pollution it produces by throwing the waste into the water. Hence, if society does not take necessary measures to control environmental problems, there will be inevitable health consequences for humanity.",
        "On the other hand, innovative technologies are being constantly developed which improves the quality of life for individuals. For example ,in  the last decade, we improved the industrial quality of alternative energy, and a lot of countries all over the world have started successfully replacing conventional  energy resources with eco-friendly ones.If such an environmental policy will become dominant among the majority of the countries in the world, chances are high that the average level of health will even have a positive growth rate.",
        "To draw the conclusion, I can say that the topic of people`s health is quite important.To predict which way humanity will choose is rather challenging.At stake, there is  affordable energy today on the one side or a costly way of replacing energy resources for the sake of a bright future for the next generations on the other side. So, if people do not change their environmental agenda, further development may come at a health cost . But there is still a possibility for the global community to choose a better way."
