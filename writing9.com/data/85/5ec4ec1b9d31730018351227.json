        "In a would of increasing level of globalization, tourism has been playing an important role for a long period of time, and the question of mutual understanding between countries is becoming easier to answer. Personally, I am inclined to believe that tourism has a positive effect on relationships between countries, and the reasons for that will be explained below.",
        "First of all, the flow of tourists between nations facilitate cultural exchange, which results from visiting national sightseeing, museums, and historical places. Having discussions with local people helps foreigners to understand behavioural patterns and the background of the nation. As a result, both hosts and visitors gain knowledge about each other, which builds a foundation for future cooperation and long-term friendship. Not only tourism creates opportunities to find new friends, and possibly partners, but it also forces the local community to develop communication skills. For example, sellers of merchandise have to know one of the international languages, at least on a basic level, in order to be able to make an appealing presentation of their offerings. Thus, the language skills of the nation significantly enhances.",
        "In addition, if the number of tourists entering the country increases, it will have considerable effect on the wealth of the nation. As the country becomes richer, people will want to visit other countries as well. In this way, the number of economic transactions between different countries significantly grows, improving quality of multicultural relationships even further. Lastly, even though government's measures to attract more tourists can damage the original outlook of ancient constructions, generally, states will try to preserve cultural assets, which could have been neglected in case tourism did not exist at all.",
        "In conclusion, I am convinced that tourism is one of the most powerful tools to build and sustain good relationships among different nations across the world."
