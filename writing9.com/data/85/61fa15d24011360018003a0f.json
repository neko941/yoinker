        "Dear Sir,",
        "The main endeavour of writing this letter is to express my concern about the deteriorating condition of the famous building which is Queen\u2019s library. It is an ancient library and was made by Queen Victoria so it is the most heritage of our city. Besides that, It is a symbol of the historical tradition and culture of our country.",
        "However, the building is now in devastating condition because it has not done any maintenance for the last decade. So, please let me take a moment to elaborate on it. Firstly, the colour is faded consequently, it looks very old and it would be more difficult to identify by people. Secondly, although the pillars are enough strong, roofs and walls are become extremely weak.",
        "I hope you can understand my above-mentioned situation. Moreover, I would like to offer some suggestions, which will be helpful to make an improved state of the building. First of all, the library should be painted with dark colour along with nameplate so it is easy for people to detect it. Last but not least, roofs should be replaced with another one in order to avoid incidents. I would be glad if you could pass these suggestions to the higher management authority and hopefully, they will take some corrective actions as soon as possible.",
        "I am looking forward to hearing from you soon.",
        "Yours sincerely,",
