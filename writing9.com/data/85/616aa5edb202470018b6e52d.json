        "I am writing in connection with the day-long meeting that we organised at your hotel - \"The Richmond\", on 28th January 2020. I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for successfully hosting us, and also express our concern about the food quality, which we expect would be better in the future.",
        "Two days ago, I took feedback from the participants who joined the meeting. Although they liked the hotel, including its facilities and the services of your affable staff, many of them complained about the food we were served. Indeed, some of the menu items that were served during the lunch were not properly cooked and we did not enjoy the taste and aroma of the food. Soup and bread were served cold and that was unexpected. The lack of western food items on the menu was surprising to some of the participants.",
        "I believe you should take steps so that all the dishes are cooked properly and served in time. I also recommend that you add some western dishes to your menu.",
        "I wish you a good day and hope that that you will consider my suggestions.",
        "Yours faithfully,",
