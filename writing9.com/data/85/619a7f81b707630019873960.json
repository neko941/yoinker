        "Entertainment is becoming a very important part of our lives. The significance that the entertainers are being paid too much has always been debatable. Although some people are of the opinion that individuals who entertain are paid a huge amount of money that has a negative impact on society,  others are of the view that this has a positive impact on human beings. In this essay, I will be discussing both the views and state my opinion, that is the benefits outweigh the drawbacks.",
        "To begin with, these days entertainment is playing a very essential role in the industry. Additionally, entertainers help in making the individuals happy by creating a positive atmosphere that helps the audience forget all their sadness and brings joy in their life. For instance, men after their long tiring day at work and women after completing all the household chores, sit and relax by watching programs such as cricket, TV series, movies etc that makes them feel calm and tension-free. As a result, celebrities deserve the price they are paid to make the audience satisfied.",
        "On the other hand, it is undeniable that jobs such as doctors, teachers, engineers and other community workers are paid less when compared to the amount the entertainers earn. Moreover, people who entertain also enjoy a comfortable and luxurious life. For example, doctors pursue their studies for almost 10 years to become professionals to save the life of  society, which involves a lot of hard work but they are paid less. Subsequently, this has a negative effect on individuals.",
        "By way of conclusion, although there are many disadvantages for the celebrities to be paid more, the benefits outweigh them, in order to keep humankind happy and cheerful."
