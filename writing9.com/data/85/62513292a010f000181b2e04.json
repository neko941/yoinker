Her left arm was severely injured and she has been hospitalized for three days. So I have to go there since my grandfather is not capable to take care of her alone. What's more, I have to stay with them until my grandmother will not be discharged from the hospital.",
        "I did not contact you earlier because I was busy making arrangements to go to my grandparents' home because of short time booking of flight is always a daunting task. I think it might have inconvenienced you with such a late cancellation. If this is the case, I'm really sorry.",
        "Despite not being able to come, I still have a little something for you. If you don't have any plans, I'd love to invite you for dinner somewhere in the city next week. Please let me know if you are available.",
