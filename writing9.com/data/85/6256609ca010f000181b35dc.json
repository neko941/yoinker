        "People have different options regarding transportation. It is argued that the best method of solving  traffic jams and transport difficulties is that remove people countryside or suburbs from the downtowns.This essay will examine cases of this problem and the forthcoming paragraphs showed both the agreement and the disagreement sides.",
        "On the one hand, the basic advantage is that to use only to introduce public transport. To put it another way, nowadays people  have their own motors and they tend to reach anywhere by their vehicles, especially to work. Consequently, these kinds of actions lead  to making traffic jams, particularly during rush hours. For example, In New York city  large companies like Apple,Samsung, and so on, There are worked of thousands of employees and in turn, workers have their own cars, and as a result, they made traffic jams during rush hours.",
        "Turning off the other hands of argument, the best way to solve these kinds of problems is for the government should encourage businessmen to move country yards. In other words, Big companies and  factories have to relocate their offices in suburbs.Also, Government should develop public transport like buses, trains and so on.Because automobiles produce toxic gases and these sorts of chemicals  affect human physical health. For instance, in my home country, the government announced one rule related to the transport like there is written, the local community should use only public transport, especially exact hours.",
        "In conclusion, I support  this statement, and I think transportation is mainly part of  human life that's why everyone who  to loves drive motors themselves, the domination should select special places."
