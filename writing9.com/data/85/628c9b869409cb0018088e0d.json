        "One of the most conspicuous trends of today,s world is the colossal upsurge in the number of people who believe that the government is spending a lot of proportion of money on art and that money could be used on some crucial matters. Here, in this essay, I will articulate some points  which will enlighten others' viewpoints along with mine.",
        "There is a widespread worry that this will only lead to a myriad of concerns in the life of some people. First of all,  society is facing a lot of issues including pollution, unemployment, crimes and many more so in this case, the authority should give attention to this to tackle these serious issues rather than craft. For example, as the unemployment rate is alarming, consequently, crime is boosting up day by day which is the result of the robbery, stealing and some high rate crimes, besides the government should spend money to arrange jobs and work for youth to decrease the crime.",
        "On the other hand, some people opine that artwork is the landmark of any  the country, so the authority should try to maintain artwork likewise any memorable building or books and any kind of symbol which shows the pride of the nation as a result, a forthcoming generation can come to know about the great work of their province. For instance, all over the world, there are so many creations which show the honour of any nation as though Statue of Liberty, the Eiffel tower, the Red fort and all the corners of the  world these countries are famous for these landmarks and a source of income as well so in this case, these all are the pride of the universe.",
        "In the conclusion, in view of the arguments outlined above, it can be observed that artwork is a fundamental part of any nation so the government should be acknowledged both art and other  important issues."
