        "It is the\u00a0fact that famous sport players are paid with\u00a0extremely high salaries\u00a0worldwide. Some people support this; while, others believe it is unjust for other professionals in our\u00a0societies. I personally agree with the former. The essay will discuss both views and presents my own opinion.",
        "To begin with, firstly, sport celebrities should be rewarded with huge salaries because\u00a0it takes\u00a0a long journey for\u00a0them\u00a0to become famous globally. They spend the majority of their time\u00a0in\u00a0practice day constantly since their childhood. They have to go through\u00a0the tough process which ordinary citizens are unable to tolerate. Secondly, they convey the\u00a0optimistic spirit, become role models and take leadership responsibilities. For example, the famous retired Olympic athlete, JingJing Gou has become an icon among Chinese females and encourages them to pursue their dreams.\u00a0Finally, they are hired by magnates which make extremely large\u00a0profit from sports events; as a result,\u00a0they should extremely high\u00a0income\u00a0as well.",
        "However, others\u00a0believe that sports celebrities should earn a less amount of money. Firstly, sports professionals merely provide entertainment to our lives.\u00a0The role of this professional may not be necessary as compared with other professionals, such as nurses, teachers, policemen, and so on. The contribution provided by the latter is crucial to maintain harmonious societies and keep our communities\u00a0in order. Due to this, they may advocate that the latter occupations should deserve well-paid. For\u00a0instance, imagine that in a world without teachers' hard working to educate their students, it is difficult\u00a0to meet the demand of the future workforce markets. Therefore, teachers should receive more compensation than sport celebrities.",
        "In conclusion, I believe that without international sports competitions or events, our lives will become less colourful for which\u00a0I personally support that it\u00a0is fair for them to receive extremely high payment because of the above reasons. Moreover,\u00a0international sport professionals\u00a0not only lead social developments rather\u00a0create the sense of harmony among international nations."
