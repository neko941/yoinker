        "I hope you are doing well, and I am writing this letter to you to give you my advice on the courses that I did at Nanyang University last year. I hope this letter will help you to get ideas for your studying.",
        "To begin with, I want to suggest to you  the courses that I took when I was studying at university. Although  there are so many subjects for students to choose from in this University, I took telecommunication networking courses as we all know, telecommunication is popular and an essential subject to learn to improve  technology. In addition, most employers are demanding  telecommunication engineers  these days with  higher pay. Therefore, you can get a lot of opportunities and will be easy to find jobs after you have finished your education if you take this course.",
        "Moreover, the university\u2019s ranking is also good as it gives students courses with internships. As a result, almost all students who graduated from this Nanyang University can join  a good organization once they finished their studying. Besides, it is convenient to apply as you can apply on the university website.",
