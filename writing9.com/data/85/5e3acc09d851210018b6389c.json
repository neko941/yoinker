        "On the other hand, this issue is really affecting my work as I have a deadline to submit several 3d scans to a client by next week. Consequently, I am now using my old machine to complete the task, but it is very slow and I am afraid that I will not be able to finish in time.",
        "Accordingly, I would like to know if you can provide maintenance at my place as soon as possible, or if you can send someone from your side to pick up the scanner to fix it.",
        "Thank you in advance.",
