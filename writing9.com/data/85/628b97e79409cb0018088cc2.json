        "Learning to distinguish right from wrong at an early age is of great importance for children. To help them learn the difference, punishment is necessary. I completely agree with this point of view because getting punished is equivalent to facing the consequences of one\u2019s bad behaviour. However, only mild punishments should be allowed.",
        "Punishment shows children their misbehaviour has consequences. Take for example teenage boys who bully disadvantaged kids at school. Not punishing them amounts to encouraging their bullying behaviour. This leads them to believe that they don\u2019t need to respect their peers from low-income families. Punishment, by contrast, helps them realize their mistakes and that there are consequences for them. As a result, they may very likely stop bullying others; otherwise, they will deal with the consequences again.",
        "However, only mild punishments should be used to discipline children. At a young age, children can be very rebellious. So, if parents scold or spank them for their misbehaviour, they may become even more rebellious. Instead, parents can use mild punishments, such as taking away children\u2019s pocket money and asking them to do household chores  and at the same time educate them about why they receive the punishments. These methods are unlikely to hurt their feelings and make them rebel more.",
        "In conclusion, children should be punished if they misbehave because this lets them know bad behaviour brings bad consequences. However, it is important to take care not to hurt their feelings; therefore, only mild punishments can be used to help them learn to tell right from wrong."
