Therefore, people are slaughtering animals to feed the increasing number of mouth which, in turn becoming the reason for the extinction of endangered species and disrupting the food chain. For example, more than 25 billions of animals are being killed in  the US every day to fulfil the need for food while the  actual figure could be far more than that.

This awareness could solve the problem of deforestation, As people will be more concerned about the situation.",
