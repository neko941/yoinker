        "It is argued that a few years down the lane majority of the individuals would prefer to surf online for updates on news and to read novels which in my opinion, I agree with the viewpoint as digitalization is the next step in the media industry.",
        "To begin with, since reliable sources on current trends and ebooks can be accessible from personal mobile phones and iPad, ten years from now, everyone would enjoy reading through such smart devices. In addition, free stories and PDFs can easily be downloaded and a wide variety of digital websites can be found online. For example, research has shown in the UK that many top newspaper industries are investing heavily in the development of their website as well as launching free subscription services. Moreover, sales of devices like Amazon Kindle and iPad have seen tremendous growth as is a new favourite device for many.",
        "Another reason in my view is that information on the internet is far more updated. This also enhances their experience as they would not have to wait as the latest news keeps streaming on apps. For instance, during the World Cup series crowd was able to see real-time score updates. Furthermore, sales of newspapers would decline in future as everyone will get details on their smartphones and social media. For this reason, I feel that utilization of printed copies will decline as everyone would be dependent on downloadable copies and ebooks.",
        "To conclude, I think print media will be considered a thing of the past as people depend more on free information and electronic devices to read from and traditional media will not be able to compete with digital media."
