        "Recently I have shifted to this wonderful city with my family, but to ,surprise I came to know that there is not big stadium available in the city, which provide a variety of sporting facilities under a single roof. I think the development of a stadium is vital for the proper development of the people living here.",
        "I am a national level hockey player and working in the public sector under sports quota and most of the time I keep on travelling. But when I will be at home it will be difficult for me to practice. So if a stadium is opened , I along with other youngsters can ripe the benefit and may make the country proud at the international level.",
