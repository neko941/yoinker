        "How have you been? It has been ages since you wrote to me. Anyway, while aimlessly surfing through the internet , yesterday I came across an amazing website  and I instantly thought that you would love this. It's called danishtravels.com and is an up and coming travel blog by an Indian guy named Abhishek Tripathi.",
        "I know you're quite fond of travelling and cannot stay in one place for more than six months. Such a restless soul you are! I'm positive that this website can guide you for your future travels or backpacking adventures. One unique feature I found here is recommendations segregated by individual interests. You'll find suggestions for sports aficionados, music lovers, history and archaeology buffs and so on. I'm sure it will enrich your experience overseas and might even motivate you to start your own travel  blog.",
        "Despite providing a plethora of information, the website has  surprisingly user-friendly and easy navigation. All you need to do is type in the place you want to visit and voila! all information is on the screen. Another way to go about it is to search for places by interests and geography. You can also fill in the questionnaire and get some suggestions. You'll find this site intriguing and in no time you'll be hooked to it.",
