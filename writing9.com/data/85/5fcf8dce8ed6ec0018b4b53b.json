        "It is believed by some that a main purpose of Universities is hiring its alumnus into the best companies, while there are other who take the view that studying at University is not only about aiming of a future career. In my opinion, I believe that studying at University besides well-paid job also brings developing communication skills and memorable moments for each individual.",
        "On the one hand, finishing a university leads to a better workplace. In other words, people choose to study and acquire higher education due to employers\u2019 demands who would like to hire a person with University degree rather than school or college graduate. Moreover, many people intentionally choosing to study at  top universities in order to work at the best companies. For example, statistics show that in contrary to those who had studied at another place, students of Harvard University are more welcome to work at top-leader companies such as Google, Microsoft, and Amazon.",
        "On the other hand, getting knowledge at University contributes to improving social skills and leaves bright moments of student life.  It is common knowledge that attendance of school, extracurricular clubs impacts on social skills of a child, as a matter of fact, there is no exception for Universities, where individuals become more talkative and sociable, hence, take participation in University\u2019s activities and outings with classmates. As an example, recent research show results how peoples\u2019 life changed after graduating, Majority said that before enrolling they were quite shy and antisocial, however, University taught them to be more socially active, owing to frequent outings with friends. In my opinion, the eventual part of high education is to teach individuals how to communicate with each other and capture in memory a lot of bright moments about youth.",
        "In conclusion, some people reckon that a better job might be getting only after University graduation, while others believe in broader purposes of higher education. I firmly agree with the least, because of improving communicative skills and warm memories about student life period."
