        "I hope you are doing well. I am Akshata, one of the students who is taking a part-time Oracle Database program with you. The reason, I am writing this letter is to inform you that I will not be able to continue the course, which I really enjoy with you, for a couple of reasons.",
        "The first reason is that I have been handed a few additional responsibilities at my full-time job which means that I would need to spend an extra hour at my office. And, if I spend an additional hour at my office, it is highly unlikely that I will be able to arrive at your class on time. The second reason, of course, is that after finishing my office work when I actually arrive in your classroom, I feel a bit too tired because of spending too much time on the road due to the bad traffic situation.",
        "Therefore, based on my situation above, I would really appreciate it if you could allow me to take the course at another time when it is convenient for me, possibly from the June session.",
        "I would really appreciate your help regarding this.",
        "Yours faithfully,",
