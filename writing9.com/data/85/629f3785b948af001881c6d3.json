        "Shaping up a future for a youngster may be compelling especially when it comes to deciding on the profession they would choose. Part of the society asserts that young folk should not be romantic about their future whilst others argue that they should be free on what to do in the future. In the following paragraphs, I will analyze both sides and claim that an individual better avoids dreaming when it comes to real-life and occupancy.",
        "On the one hand, there are sounding reasons why crowds fortify the idea of letting pupils free on the selection of their forthcoming occupancies. To begin with, everyone has the right to have a dream of their own which they surely desire to follow. And preventing this right might cause not only discouragement but also early deprivation of willingness to work with these people. Moreover, pursuing a goal job could make that work much more desirable and attractive for that person. Hence, if a juvenile is enticed by one occupation or business, one should never try to dissuade that young fella.",
        "On the other hand, a rookie is better decides on their job regarding several important factors. First of all, it is obvious that a person should have the necessary abilities or knowledge to get recruited for the job. For example, when a youngster dreams to be a doctor but gets no medical education, that illusion would be a big waste of time and a disappointment. Secondly, folk should be picky about jobs when it comes to paychecks. In detail, workers should not let their employers exploit their energy by giving them very low salaries. Therefore, people should stay away from those types of cheap businesses.",
        "In conclusion, freedom of choice in occupancy is surely what many of us dream of. However, there are a bunch of real-life facts that individuals should consider before they pick their future jobs."
