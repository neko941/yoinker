        "I am writing in connection with my recent stay with my colleagues to organise a meeting at the Sedona hotel in Singapore. Although  my colleagues were satisfied with the services given by the hotel, they were dissatisfied with the food that was served for lunch.",
        "Firstly, one of the services that are liked by my colleagues is the internet and they did not get experience with connection fail through the meeting. Secondly, they are really fond of staying in their room as the bed and sofa that were given by the hotel were allowed them to be more relaxed. Besides, they were satisfied with room services as the rooms are very clean and the smell in the room makes them fresh.",
        "However, according to their feedback, they don\u2019t really like the food for lunch as the main dishes are too spicy to eat and it was saltier than they used to be in main dishes. Therefore, I would like to suggest to you about the food in order to reduce putting salt and spicy a lot in curry otherwise curries were not delicious and to make sure the desert that should be good ones.",
        "I am looking forward to getting your input on this issue.",
