        "These days , many parents prefer to express their love towards their children by purchasing  a wide variety of toys for them . Although I think that this  method can have some obvious negative consequences , I believe that the advantages of having a large number of toys can outweigh its disadvantages .",
        "On the one hand , there are some reasons that why people do not prefer to buy for their toddlers a considerable number of playthings . The strongest reason is that those youngsters who have multiple types of games  tend to be introverted . In other words , children will become busier and occupied by discovering all types of games   they own and playing with them ; consequently , they will spend less  time with their parents and friends which can affect negatively their development in terms of  communication skills . Moreover , this way of acting with youth remains a waste of money that should be invested in meaningful things because purchasing a variety of dolls  requires a large sum of money . Finally , this habit is greedy because youngsters  will have a strong desire to acquire more and more  playthings and then they will not appreciate the simple ones and finally will not find joy in simplicity .",
        "On the other hand , in spite of these arguments , there are several reasons that why parents prefer to buy for their toddlers a large number of pastimes. Firstly , there are some games that are made for educational purposes and help children to foster their learning and growth . For example , Lego learning blocks can help preschoolers to learn letters , numbers and languages skills . Secondly, playing with playthings can benefit the psychological development of youngsters and help them to develop useful skills  such as creativity , cognitive thinking  , social and spatial awareness which are crucial to boosting their mental and  personalities .",
        "In conclusion , despite  that playing with a large number of toys can lead to some adverse effects on toddlers , I believe that it is a positive trend and the benefits that can bring exceed its drawbacks ."
