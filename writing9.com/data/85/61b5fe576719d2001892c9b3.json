        "Teaching connoisseurs throughout the world have debated whether youngsters should be provided musical devices training such as guitar and piano. I strongly agree with the view owing to the fact that it  boosts their mental development. This essay will shed light on the matter and provide evidence to prove the arguments.",
        "Several reasons take experts to believe that these skills are fundamental to teenagers. First and foremost, musical apparatus helps children mental and psychological development. In other words, these devices build brain  emotions such as  emotional imprint, feelings, and desire. For instance, recent research carried out by  Cambridge University showcased that 70% of teenagers who experienced guitar playing in earlier stages of their lives were more emotive than those who did not. As a result, it increased their probability to be well-succeeded in future pursuits. Furthermore, it is the overriding motive for increased children intelligence worldwide.",
        "Secondly, sound instruments are the way out to overcome life's challenges. Because of employment shortfall in a plethora of nations, this orientation is seen as the refuge. Let us take African lands as an example, recent investigation by the University of Oxford pointed out that 70% of children followed the branch for surviving reasons. Hence, they encountered a way to suffice their needs and increase their family's income. Moreover, the overwhelming majority of musicians today are in the area solely to sustain their families.",
        "In conclusion, indeed, sound apparatus is worthy for youngsters. For this motive, I strongly agree with the statement.
