        "I am writing this letter in connection with my latest journey with your airline. I would like to present my opinion on your service and to make suggestions for your improvement.",
        "I have been travelling with Qatar Airlines for five years more or less and I have always been pleased with the services. Last month I have traveled to Dubai on the 1st of January for the first time.",
        "I would like to mention the things that satisfied me the most. What really amazed me was the convenience of my seat and also the quality of the food served during the flight was magnificent. Although there was a little inconvenience with one of the flight attendants, she was all alone in our cabin and she could not handle every passenger need immediately.",
        "Anyway, I would like to offer a suggestion to curb this issue. If it is possible please provide more flight attendants for your short flights. This will not only help employees to accommodate passengers need but also satisfy travellers.",
        "This is all I would like to share with you. Thank you for taking the time to read this letter.",
        "Yours faithfully,"
