        "Dear Principal,",
        "I am writing this letter with regards to the open position of sports teacher in our school. Hence, I would like to introduce  one of my childhood friends since my elementary school days. I know him very well, in fact, my friend and I  graduated from same the University.",
        "As I said, he has done his sports master's degree from a reputed institution. Furthermore, he also has profound experience in sports coaching activities despite the solid academic marks and degrees. In addition, he  participated in national-level sports competitions and secured first place.",
        "I strongly believe that his great experience and phenomenal track record in his career would be an asset to our school. His immaculate experience would be a great help to our students. However, he may also produce required documents as part of the reference checks and further validations.  Considering the above all points he would be the right candidate for this open position and I would recommend his profile for this post.",
        "I look forward to hearing a response with good news and please do let me know if we needed any additional details to move forward.",
        "Yours Sincerely,",
