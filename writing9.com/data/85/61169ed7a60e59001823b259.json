        "Considered by many parents that special childcare centres provide the best services to preschool\u2019s children. Otherwise, many working parents think that family members such as grandparents can be proper caretakers for kids. I am inclined to believe kindergartens are the best place where a child can learn anything he needs.",
        "Nowadays,the population are growing but places in kindergartens are less and many guardians are staying in a queue in the government\u2019s kindergarten. But many of them can not wait and allow grandparents to look after their children. This is not correct due to the fact that many grand relatives have an old-fashioned point-of-view. When an infant is young he or she is like a sponge and absorb everything. Moreover, the old-fashioned habits of his grandparents and lack of communication with his peers can have a negative influence on his future behaviour. I consider that any childcare centres private or not will be more wholesome rather than allow him to stay at home with grand relatives.",
        "Some merits of nursery school are a complex education of basic abilities such as reading, speech and math, and of course discipline. They have a day-routine schedule that allows them to sustain the order. Also speaking with other peers have a positive influence and allow them to grow in a proper atmosphere and make friends. In my humble opinion, this is the best place where a kid can evolve his or her abilities.",
        "In a nutshell, I sustain the meaning that nursery school is the best place and have many possibilities for both sides parents and children."
