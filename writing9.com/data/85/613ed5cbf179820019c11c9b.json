        "That an increasing number of students would prefer pursuing vocational education to choosing academic studies at university has become a hotly debated subject among educators and grad students. Personally, I take the view that the trend\u2019s merits outweigh its drawbacks.",
        "To begin with, it is indisputable that in comparison with vocational education which has a restricted area of expertise, an academic one has a broader scope of learning. Admittedly, an academic course may offer various related subjects/programs for undergraduates to explore. A student majoring in Mathematics, for instance, can also take classes on philosophy or other similar liberal arts studies. Consequently, this sort of learning can be helpful when helping pupils to create a well-rounded course of study and, more importantly, choose a rewarding and suitable career.",
        "Nonetheless, there are many more perks of learning in a vocational environment. Compared with theoretical courses, one of the most significant advantages of this development comes down to its hands-on experience. Vocational training offers students a specific trade that focuses solely on practicing employment-ready skills needed for particular occupations at the workplace. For example, those wanting to become an engineer can apply for Airport Operations programs whose instructors are often industry professionals. Besides, pupils studying vocational courses can join the workforce quickly. Most program durations might be completed in two years or less, which are shorter than degree courses. As a result, students will be able to embark on a career soon, make money on their own, and live independently.",
        "In conclusion, both vocational courses and university education have their advantages and disadvantages. Students graduating from high school must see which course will fit their abilities in the long run. I think that opting for a vocational course rather than academic education will result in further promising career prospects."
