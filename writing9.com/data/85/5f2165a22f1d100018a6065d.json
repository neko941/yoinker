        "Technology has been flourishing by leaps and bounds and providing us new avenues to keep ourselves updated with the latest news and current affairs. Therefore a fair amount of people believe a conventional way of newspaper and magazine reading will be disappeared. I do not accord with this given statement owing to the several benefits it extends such as easiest and cheapest source of news which will be discussed further in the essay.",
        "To embark on, there are multiple reasons why the traditional  ways of getting news are still popular. First of all, reading newspapers has become the ardent habit of many people. Everyone, whether from affluent or middle class is seen desperately waiting for the paper in the morning. Moreover, these are the most portable, cheapest and easiest way of knowing about the global activities. It can be carried from one place to another in less space and available at economical price and do not require electricity and other appliances. Furthermore, the other attachments, for example, The Times of India come with additional pages on career guidance, property and wealth which are quite helpful. Thus, it enhances the knowledge of the readers on all aspects.",
        "However, undoubtedly, technology has given has a radical approach to be updated about the outer world without being dependent on conventional methods. On top of it, it also demonstrate videos of news, which is easy to grasp and do not require much time to read the entire article in a magazine or newspaper hence saves time. Besides this, we can download, share and forward the relevant news to anyone across the world. Needless to say, that old methods will be having no place in this ever-advanced modern world.",
        "To conclude, the lives of people are drastically affected by an advanced version of the technology, yet in my opinion, it will not be able to pose threat to the existence of traditional newspapers and magazines."
