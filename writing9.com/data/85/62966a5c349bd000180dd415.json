        "The venue for the party will be our residence in Noida on June 30th. We live in a society in Sector 46, which is nearby the Golf course metro station, and you can easily take a cab from there and it hardly takes 10 minutes to reach our place from there. I wish that you come for at least 2-3 days since we have not had the chance to meet after our graduation. You need not worry about your stay as I have made all the arrangements for your accommodation at our place.",
