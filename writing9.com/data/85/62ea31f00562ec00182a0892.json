        "The current expansion plan includes the demolition of the stadium to convert it into a runway. This stadium has been standing long before and is one of the town\u2019s iconic establishments.",
        "I am against its destruction because that building means a lot to us. Many citizens have memories tied to it and have businesses running because of it. Having a bigger airport does come with advantages; however, I believe that tearing down a monumental building is not worth it.",
