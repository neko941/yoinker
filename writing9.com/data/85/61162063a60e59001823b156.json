        "Nowadays,  employers are looking for employees with good social skills apart from educational qualifications. Although qualification is one important aspect, communication and team participation are few key features. Networking and active engagement in office politics are important for one's growth both personally and professionally; therefore, these are nothing but social skills. In this essay, I will discuss my notes on this topic.",
        "Firstly, talking about networking. This can be best explained as: communication with fellow workers and experienced senior officials; however, most people think developing a network means boot-licking. According to research, it is not how it appears to be. Most experienced business trainers believe this to be an important skill. This can be achieved by active engagement with people in the organization by showing interest in their activities. For instance, rather than a highly experienced individual, a team player who mingles well with the team will be chosen for a promotion. The manager/lead look for proactive people. It is believed that technical knowledge can be gained with the help of training but soft skills are hard to incorporate.",
        "Secondly, on the other hand, participation in office politics.  This is nothing but making use of your network power. There is a very fine line between making use of influence and wrongly using it. As a result, this skill is helped tremendously when used properly. For example, If there is an IJP- internal job programme, with the use of your influence, you may have the option to get updates from time to time, either by verbal approach or by email. Many organizations encourage the participation of individuals in such activities as it directly or indirectly affects their companies growth.",
        "To conclude, I strongly agree that it is very important to have basic or advanced social skills apart from education. Albeit education can help secure a job, emotional intelligence and professional social skills directly influence one's advancement in the firm. Recruiters mostly seek such talents in today's workforce."
