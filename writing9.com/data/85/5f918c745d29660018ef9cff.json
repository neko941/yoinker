        "When it comes to imparting and exchanging information, some people believe that speaking is more powerful than writing. Personally, I think that both methods can be effective forms of communication, but it depends on the specific circumstance as to which is the most appropriate at the time.",
        "On the one hand, speaking is an extremely effective and efficient mode of communication in certain contexts. Oral communication enables people to emotionally connect with their listeners. The tone of someone\u2019s voice can powerfully convey a wide range of emotions, and that is why some people are able to inspire and influence others simply through a powerful speech, or a song, or piece of poetry. Secondly, misunderstandings can also be easily prevented when people interact face to face. For example, if one person is confused about what the other is saying, he can immediately ask for further explanation to ensure that their message is completely understood.",
        "On the other hand, writing can also be an effective tool in everyday communication. In the workplace, written messages, emails, and documents are effective tools, while speech may sometimes be ignored or interpreted in different ways, written forms are usually stated very clearly. Employees can therefore reread documents repeatedly to avoid miscommunication. Additionally, written documents are usually required in legal procedures. This is the reason why many important documents including memos, reports, job descriptions, and e-mails are usually kept in written form.",
        "In conclusion, both spoken and written modes of communication have their own purposes, benefits and drawbacks, and people have to carefully consider which model to apply in each specific situation."
