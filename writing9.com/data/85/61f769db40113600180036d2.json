        "Dear Sir,",
        "The main endeavour of writing this letter is to express my concerns with my hostel accommodation which I have been sharing with other three students. Our room is on the first floor and the room number is G-702. I have been living in a hostel for the last 1 year. My previous roommates were extremely cooperative, polite, friendly and inclined to do study.",
        "However, the students with whom I have been living for the last two months, are totally different from me. They do parties at night and also invite their friends. They are doing dance till late at night and put a radio extreme loudly which makes an enormous noise. Apart from that they never clean the room and make it very dirty. Because of all those reasons, I am unable to do concentrate on my study and I get disturbed a lot during my exam preparation. So, I find it is more difficult to stay with them.",
        "I hope you can understand my above-mentioned situation. I would be grateful if you could shift me to another place. Most importantly, I would prefer a quiet place where I can do my work peacefully.",
        "I am looking forward to hearing from you soon.",
        "Yours faithfully,",
