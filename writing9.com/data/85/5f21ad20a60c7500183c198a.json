        "Nowadays, humanity is becoming developed, and there is no denying the fact that this phenomenon changes the culture and habits of some communities. Although over-reliance on technology may cause that traditional customs become forgotten,  in this essay, I will investigate whether technological advancements are able to coexist with historical tradition.",
        "On the one hand, most traditional actions became outdated in that they have been replaced by electrical appliances. For instance, festivals in Spain, where people congregate to prepare a certain type of food such as tomato sauce are no longer held inasmuch as the respective fruits are processed in factories. In addition, this brings greater benefit as it could be conducted the whole year by professional workers not only once a year by inexperienced people.",
        "Turning to the other side of the argument, traditional cultures emerged from a set of values that are still passed from generation to generation. In fact, if they were forgotten, many nations would lose their identity and would no longer recognisable in the world. Moreover, distinctive features of specific countries could be used as an advertisement to encourage tourists to visit their state. Japan is a good example of land that is able to earn money by selling their cultural heritage to visitors, and at the same time they have a high level of technological development.",
        "All things considered, in my view, culture and technology need to be interlocked in that country is not able to reach their full economic unless they are connected. Furthermore, without its history, the state loses its soul and becomes only a spot on the map which may lead to regression, not development."
