Furthermore, when I was listening to your traditional songs, I felt extreme peace even after having a huge crowd at the function. In addition, I imagined myself on the stage because you are my only role model. To explain this, I would like to inform you that I am also learning traditional music. Basically, I am a trainee singer and enhancing my musical skills by attending class at a very popular academy of the legend A.R.Raheman.",
