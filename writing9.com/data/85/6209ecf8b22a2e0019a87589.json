        "Boxing is a sport where two people punch each other to earn points, and the person with the highest points emerges as the winner. It is a bloody game that often leaves the competitors with noticeable bruises. Many believe it is detrimental for boxing to exist in the modern world. In my opinion, I strongly disagree with the proponents that sports should be eradicated because, asides from the fact that the players should be left to indulge in their passion, it is an honest profession through which wealth and fame are attained and must be left to go on in this new era.",
        "The existence of boxing should not be brought to an end, seeing that everyone has a right to be involved in what he or she loves. Besides, these folks are not cajoled into boxing. They willingly chose it as a sport to play. Meanwhile, if one is forced to abandon their passion, it will result in rebellion. For instance, a recent study proves that people who are forcefully put out from hobbies tend to protest, which often leads to violence and death. Hence, it is wise to leave boxing for those who love it.",
        "Furthermore, sports and boxing need not be stopped because it is an honest professions. Numerous people make a living by participating in it. In fact, it has enriched lots of people who are faithful competitors and makes them well-known. For example, the famous Mike Tyson made his first millions as a boxer who started sports at a young age and did not relent. This goes a long way to prove that boxing rewards the participants greatly and should not be cut off from this new age.",
        "In conclusion, although sports is a bloody one that causes apparent injuries, I opine that it should be in continual existence since many people are passionate about it and wholeheartedly accept the outcome of the sport. It is also an excellent way to make an excellent living."
