If I recollect well, I have placed the forms in a drawer where projector wires were tangled, just beside the podium bay.",
        "Post our workshop, the onus was on me to seek feedback from the participants. Moreover, I had prepared a survey checklist assisting us to work on the improvement areas and acknowledge the strength factors. The shared comments would be vital for our future events helping our company to evolve.",
