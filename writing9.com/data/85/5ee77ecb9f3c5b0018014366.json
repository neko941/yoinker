        "In this competitive era, all parents desire their children excel in their academic, and they hold a standpoint that the child should not have excessive free hours and if they do it should be utilised effectively by making them do their school work. As per my standpoint, this free time should be used to help them outgrow their other skills.",
        "First and foremost, being better with extra curricular activity like sports is as important as being excellent in studies. Students should get enough encouragement to be proficient in sports and other activities. The individual who is active with extra curricular activity gets a chance to explore the other side of talent in them. Moreover, the mind requires change, and if children are compelled to do the similar thing for the whole day then they will lose interest in that. For instance, those who are active in sports gets an opportunity to become more efficient with sports, as well as they will not get boredom from academics. Thus, restricting the child to perform other activities in their free time will have a negative impact on their development.",
        "Furthermore, in real world bookish knowledge is never enough. The person is never hired based on their grades, they get hired if they outshine from other competitors and this is only possible if they have confidence and other skills like interpersonal and communication skills. To illustrate, when the student gets an encouragement from their parents to take participation in debate or speaking competition, the child will get a boost to participate and by participating they will conquer their stage fear, and not only that it builds great confidence in them. Hence to improvise with this other skill, it is essential for youngsters to be trained from their childhood by letting them participate in other activities like elocution competition, dance, drama and other activities.",
        "To conclude, the free hours, which the students receive can be used in developing their other skills which will help them to become multi-talented. Making them study in their free time will result in performance because of the boredom created because of monotonous schedule"
