        "I am writing to you because your hotel was highly suggested for me and my family to spend our next vacation.  My family is composed of four people: my husband, my twins who are 5 years old, and a dog,  is your hotel a pet-friendly hotel?",
        "We will arrive on 1st May and check out from your hotel on 11th May before 12.00 pm. As we are in four people we are expecting two double size bedrooms one with double bed and another with two single bed with attached bathrooms. Hot water, air conditioning, TV and minibar are essential amenities for us, and we will also be extremely pleased if we have a sea view.",
        "I have seen on your website that the final price of the reservation is around $100-200 per night. However, I am not sure if the meals or other facilities are included could please send to me the details about it?",
        "I am also interested to know about recreational activities in the vicinity. As I will stay 10 days with two young kids I would like to know about  the entertainment options for kids. My last doubt is related to places near to the hotel, it is easy to get around by car? My husband loves to try  different types of foods and I love buying all types of goods.",
        "Thank you so much for your attention, I look forward to hearing from you soon.",
