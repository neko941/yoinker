        "I am using CISCO company WiFi (Product Model No: ATYPK3128Q & Bill No: 148970) router for using the internet connectivity for my laptop at home. Suddenly, Internet connectivity was stopped working in my laptop.",
        "I tried to restart my laptop and WiFi router to fix the problems, but it won't work for me. Afterwards, I was directly connected the cable instead of through router to my laptop and was working perfectly with out any issues. At last , I was found that WiFi router is not switching ON and was purchased couple of weeks back which should be in under warranty.",
        "This is a result of unable to do my office work at home and its effected my preparation of sales reports for next week upcoming meetings with Business stake holders. I would be grateful if you could come and check the equipment at my home to fix this else I am hoping you will replace it with the new equipment based on warranty terms and conditions.",
        "I really appreciate your support on this ASAP !!!",
