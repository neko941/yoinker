Consequently, we can observe that family can be gathered only at  lunchtime, while other families cannot even meet with each other. Hence, this negative aspect causes that family members cannot find time to communicate with each other and to do several activities. For instance, today we observe that teenagers are addicted to using machinery gadgets when they are meeting with their families. Thus, this is impacts negatively in relationships.",
        "Secondly, the most highlighted effect is the psychological state of the person.

For example, youth today especially those who are between 20 to 35 years old,  are making a comparison between their lives and others. Thus, unfortunately, this leads to depression and dissatisfaction with their lifestyle. Nevertheless, there should be regulations to mention how this aspect could be influenced directly or indirectly ways to these stages of individuals.",
