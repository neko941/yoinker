        "In today's world, pets are an inseparable part of many societies. A lot of people have their own pets. It's because of their countless benefits. Of course, they also have some problems. I will explain them.",
        "We have many advantages to having pets at home. I write two of them in this paragraph. Firstly, pets are companions. They have strong emotions. They fall in love with their owners and show this love. The pets help their owners without any expectation. So, they can be good Campanians and friends for humans ,especially the elderly. Secondly, they can increase the sense of responsibility. Pets require a lot of care such as hygiene, security, nutrition and so forth. Their owners have to do them. In fact, they realize that are responsible for their pets. Therefore, their sense of responsibility increases in them.",
        "There are some disadvantages to having pets. one of them is their high keeping costs. As we know there are many diseases which can be transferred from animals to humans. Hence, it's very important to consider their hygiene. For example, their hair and wool should be cut regularly, their teeth ought to be cleaned and They must be vaccinated. All of these have high costs for their owners. The next one is that they can create intensive dependency. As I explain before, they are very kind and loyal friends. This feature can lead to a dependency between them and their owners. Thus, if they get lost or die, their owners may become very depressed.",
        "In summary, although having pets for humans has many profits,  it has some drawbacks, too. The profits are being a Campanian and increasing the sense of responsibility. The drawbacks are high maintenance costs and creating dependency."
