        "Dear Sir or Madam,",
        "I am writing this letter to inform you about the adverse impacts of the construction of an airport in our area.",
        "Last week, when I was walking in the park, one of my neighbours informed me about the scheme of building a new air station in our society.",
        "Although this is a great idea, there are numerous negative repercussions of it. First and foremost, it would increase noise pollution since aeroplanes produce loud sounds and this can be harmful to people who are living near the airport. Moreover, the community is already densely populated and this construction would lead to traffic congestion problems due to the rush of flight passengers. Finally, being a sensitive place, this area would require high protection services and hence creates commuting issues while entering and leaving the society due to strict security checks.",
        "However, the land near the highway is currently in idle position and it would be large enough to accommodate a well-built airport in it. Therefore, you are requested to plan it to establish over there.",
        "I look forward to hearing from you soon.",
        "Yours faithfully,",
