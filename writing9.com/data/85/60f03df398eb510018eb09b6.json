        "In today\u2019s digitalized world, we face problems like the author\u2019s rights in the entertainment industry. Unfortunately, products suchlike music or films are freely available on the internet. In my opinion, failure to comply with copyright law could demolish the entire industry.",
        "To begin with, violating an author\u2019s right has numerous disadvantages; for example, it will discourage every talented person who works in this section, like musicians, book authors, or film artists. They spend almost their entire life and put emotions and imaginations to create a rewarding task, and if their products publish or broadcast on cyberspace, their creative endeavours will be destroyed by gratis downloading. Furthermore, the primary income of these artists comes from selling their work; by unauthorized downloading, they will face several financial difficulties. For instance, a music composer hires a crew, including musicians, pays them and invests considerable money in his project. Still, in general, costs don\u2019t cover up entirely because his work is available freely on the internet.",
        "Secondly, owners\u2019 efforts are always in danger of copying illegally by other virtuosos. Their competitors from the same field of work can access these products without paying copyright expense and can use owners\u2019 ideas in their projects; such practice is morally wrong. By keep doing, the owner\u2019s rights will be trampled, and eventually, their talent doesn\u2019t acknowledge properly. A particular example is, in Iran, various musicians copy famous foreigners\u2019 song melodies without paying their copyright credit to be well-known and wealthy.",
        "In conclusion, with the advent of the internet, some new phenomena have risen, like downloading peoples\u2019 artwork without getting their permission. I feel, doing these immoral actions will harm the industry and destroy Artists' creativity which ultimately damages their income source."
