        "I am writing this letter regarding a goal I have always had in my career, which is spending six months in our main centre in the US.",
        "One of the main reasons why I believe it would be a valuable experience for me and for the company is that I would be able to learn a lot about their processes, and later apply the improvements in our local processes. Besides, it would be a great experience for me to practice the language and meet excellent professionals.",
        "In order to reduce the impact locally, I could still be responsible for 20% of the most important tasks I have today, and I am sure the rest of the team could help with the other activities. In addition, I could send a detailed guide containing each activity, the owners and the deadlines, thus, it would be easier for you to monitor everything.",
        "Therefore, to be able to reach my goal and develop my career, I would like to ask for your help. I am aware you have many contacts in the US office and I would appreciate it if you could write a recommendation letter, as well as talk to them if possible. I still will be available to help you with all doubts and emergencies.",
        "I look forward to hearing from you.",
        "Kind regards,",
