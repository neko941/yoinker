        "The excellent source of recent occurrences is the newspapers because of its popularity,  compare to other alternative means. I totally disagree, and this will be proven beyond reasonable doubt in this essay.",
        "To begin with, newspapers used to be the most important and reliable source of news in the past, but nowadays technological innovations had unveiled many alternative means such as the internet and media. One could be aware of an incident while happening through social media. People could just record and take pictures with their mobile phones. Information reach everyone, far and near. For instance, during elections, results are posted immediately on platforms as people cast their votes, but it may not appear in the journals about two days after, hence they usually have delayed news. At the same time, whenever citizens are clamouring for something, especially those in rural areas where newspaper is not available, they communicate through radio and television. For example, a deplorable condition of a road or dilapidated structures. It is through many platforms on the internet that the government can feel the impulse of the society.",
        "Furthermore, the outbreak of global economic crisis  has generated a desperate situation to plenty of families, especially in developing country like Nigeria, hence people have lost their  jobs and not buoyant to patronize vendors. Also, individuals are aware of what is going on in their locality at the comfort of their homes with the help of the internet and mobile phones. Apparently, the news gets faster to the media, than stale news in newspapers. For example, an accident happened in my city last week, the news went viral on the social media, however it was seen in the newspaper two days after. Consequently, this has saved many lives because rescue team acts promptly whenever they see such. Moreover, important happenings could be saved immediately to Google drive on the phone, unlike newspaper that would litter the house when kept.",
        "In conclusion, technology has contributed to news and gives alternative means which is more faster and reliable. \"Information is power\". People don't longer wait for news in magazines and journals."
