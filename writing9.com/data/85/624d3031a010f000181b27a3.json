        "Dear Sir,",
        "I am Karthi and located on 8th Street, Rajendra Nagar. I have resided here for over 8 years and which is covered under your local council body. I am writing this letter to let you know that share my opinion about closing the sports and leisure centre in our location.",
        "First of all, When we come across such news  and my family feels really sad. The centre was very famous for its sports gatherings and we spent most of our weekends time there. Not only us, most of our local folks frequently visited there and spent their idle time as useful.",
        "As for my concern, centres like as we have presently must be created in all locations. They are not only giving sports, but they also create social relationships with people. They make  unity in our society. Lastly, if such centres are closed in terms of money perspective, then there is no such place for interacting with other people in this faster world. Generally, people are more stressed and feel depressed with so many things. They should need a place to get themselves relaxed and involved in other activities.",
        "Thanks for your consideration and hope good response from your side.",
        "Regards",
        "Karthi"
