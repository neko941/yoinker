        "Dear Sir or Madam,",
        "I am writing you to inform you that the black Fujifilm XT-3 camera I bought at the B&H store located on Collins St on the 7th of November, while I was on vacation in Melbourne, does not come with the items that Tom Morris, the local seller informed me of.",
        "The camera sold should have been accompanied by three batteries and a 128 Gb SD card, as described in the receipt. Nevertheless, when I opened up the box, two batteries were missing, which made me feel disgusted. Additionally, the 128 SD card, which Tom told me the store would give me in case I bought more than $800 is missing.",
        "Prior to buying this awesome camera, Tom Morris gave me his email address, so I could be in touch with him if anything out of the ordinary happens. I have emailed him a few times, but I haven't had any replies. I hope this sale was not a scam and would appreciate knowing how the company is going to handle this uncomfortable situation.",
        "Therefore, I would like to know how both of us can proceed with this happening. As I am in Singapore, coming back to the store is not a viable option for me. Hence, I might consider a refund on the missing items to straighten up this situation, but still open to other possibilities.",
        "I am looking forward to hearing from you any time soon.",
        "Sincerely,",
