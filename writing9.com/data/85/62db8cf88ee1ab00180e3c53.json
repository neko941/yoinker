        "Dear Sir or Madam,",
        "I am writing this letter to express my satisfaction with the hotel that you booked for me when I am participating in your organization\u2019s meeting in Melbourne.",
        "I so appreciate that I could be invited to take part in the 10-day Accounting conference regarding taxation legislation which is being arranged by your accounting firm in Melbourne. During the meeting, you will analyse the changes in Australian taxation law, ranging from property law to individual taxation law, which is an incredible chance for me to enhance my accounting knowledge.",
        "However, there is an excessive issue that I am facing with regard to the room where I am living. As the heater of my room does not work, the room is extremely cold due to the low temperature in Melbourne, and I am afraid that I will get  cold without a working heater. I  informed a manager of the hotel, who said a technician would come to help me fix it. Unfortunately, the person has not appeared.",
        "I wonder whether you could provide me with accommodation with a working heater in order to keep me warm.",
        "I am looking forward to hearing from you.",
