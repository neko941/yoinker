        "It is often argued that people will decide to travel overseas less frequently than within their native country. I strongly disagree with this statement since transportation and communication will definitely be improved which will make it possible for travellers to travel faster and understand people from other nationalities.",
        "Firstly, the number of hours one must spend on a train or a plane to arrive at their final destination will most likely diminish radically in the future as science will evolve and provide faster options to travelling. As a result, people will be more inclined to travel abroad since it will be far more fast and comfortable than it is today. As an illustration of this, there is already a rocket in development which promises to take passengers from New York to Shanghai in just thirty minutes. Hence, individuals will choose to spend holidays overseas more frequently.",
        "Furthermore, while many people still fear travelling to another country because they are not acquainted with the native language, this will no longer be an issue in the future. This is because technology is rapidly advancing towards an efficient way for people to communicate even if they do not speak the same language. For instance, there are already electronic devices that enable people to engage in a conversation by translating what each person is saying. Thus, in the next few years, it is probable that travellers will explore more other countries as they will be able to understand local residents.",
        "In conclusion, it is believed by some that people will rather travel inside their own country than travel to other nations. Nonetheless, I disagree with this statement since travellers will want to meet new countries as transportation will be faster and communication will be easier among citizens who speak different languages."
