        "It is true that in several countries folk prefer to have their own accommodation rather than be a renter of a house. In this essay, I am going to discuss the causes of this situation and in the end, I will give my own opinion on whether this condition is good or bad.",
        "On the one hand, there are some main reasons that people consider owning their home more important than being a tenant. First, tenants most of the time have a kind of anxiety about staying in their house. Because there are some hosts that insist the tenants to getting out without any reason. Second, individuals prefer to have  a small house instead of worrying about the rent payment which usually rises annually. Finally, when people own a house for themselves, they can easily do some refurbishments or decorating without giving  permission from someone. For instance, in some cases, the host of the home does not give permission for tenants to change the style of the home.",
        "On the other hand, this situation depends on whether each person  can be good or bad. For example, for young couples who do not have enough income for purchasing a home for themselves, it can be bad for them. However, for older people who have some physical problems and  cannot move easily, it can be good for them to having own home without any worries about moving to another place.",
        "In conclusion, despite the fact that purchasing accommodation for some folk is an essential thing,  it depends on the folk, which can be considered both a merit and a demerit."
