        "The children are considered as the future of the country. Some people have a conception that only the good parenting has potential to mould children into responsible member of society. On the other hand,  not all people in accord with this. They consider a school is appropriate place where a child can learn to become a lawful citizen. In my opinion, both parents and good schooling help children turning into good civilian.",
        "Firstly, the parents play a pivotal role in the life of their children. Moreover, some children see their parents as a role model of their life. So, the parents should behave properly and maintain decorum in the house in front of their children. For instance,  a child being raised in the house of parents with criminal background, it will impact the morality and behaviour of the child. Because the children have tended to intimate. Furthermore, the parents should not quarrel in front of children as it can make them depressed.",
        "However, the school is like a second home for children when they are at a certain age. In school students learn various good traits such as respecting other gender, sharing, good behaviour. For example, the children who are studying in school would feel more comfortable with other children, while others will hesitate to get mingled with them.",
        "In my conclusion, I would like to state that if the parents and the schools, work in collaboration to guide their children in becoming responsible members of society, It would be more effective and beneficial."
