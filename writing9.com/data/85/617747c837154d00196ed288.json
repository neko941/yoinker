        "Global warming is a crucial issue that has impacted  every country around the world. Some people think that only authority and big commerce can change this situation, whereas I agree with those who think every single  person can make this change. In this essay, I will elucidate both my view and my opinion, and the following examples will be provided to support my point of view.",
        "To begin with, on the one hand, some people think that  most people who make  climate change are large businesses, so only governments can be the only people to control them and this issue is too big to determine by individuals. For example, according to the latest survey conducted by Bangkok University, it has been revealed that 80% of people who are living in Chonburi and Rayong, which are the biggest industrial areas and have the most air pollution provinces in Thailand, think the state should launch regulations  to strictly control those factories. Furthermore, they also think that  another important way is that government officers should be honest about their responsibility or corruption in order to examine the industries. Huge businesses are the biggest cause of climate change, thus the ministry can be the one who must play a major role to tackle this problem.",
        "On the other hand, I agree with those who think every single person can make a difference in the global warming situation because they are more powerful if everyone has awareness and takes responsibility for our world. It is clear that the  population in this world is more than the number of governments or industries, therefore if everyone helps to prevent climate change such as reusing, reducing, recycling or putting the waste in the right place, it would make the change. I totally agree with the statement that everyone can change this world.",
        "In conclusion, I strongly believe that everyone, every nation, every government and every private organisation should take responsibility together in order to protect the worst natural situations which might happen in the future."
