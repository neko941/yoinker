        "In this concurrent ,world the internet provides multifarious instruction. Few ethnic groups assume that the details are incorrect or false. I firmly accord with the given statement. This essay will propound my accordance along with credible examples.",
        "The chief rationalization for my agreement comes from various points. Firstly, the most distinguished hub is incorrect information is spreading related to the impressive titles and wrong labels accompanying  media material. The reason for using them is in attracting customers and gain popularity. If the person sees the pop-up message and then clicks on it, in most cases the actual content will not match with the presented heading. As a result, most of the news will be mistaken or accepted in the wrong way. Videos uploaded on social media like YouTube can be good examples of this, as the main purpose of bloggers is to have more followers.",
        "One more rationale to substantiate my crux is the network connections used in marketing and services, and the problem is that their quality can be overestimated. This is a quite common activity and is used to interact with customers to buy certain goods.  In other words, particular sites can help the producers in promoting their client services. For instance, some advertisements maintain reviews and comments of other people, which can be published by the company itself to increase the number of sales. In online shopping, the quality of clothes does not really match, what was described in reviews. These are some top-notch concrete reasons for aggressing  the presented argument.",
        "In conclusion,  the above discussion unravels the important point of internet data. However, to gain popularity and sell  certain goods, the media and the online social platforms are spreading wrong information to the consumers. I wholeheartedly grant with the given statement and have explained the same in the above paragraphs."
