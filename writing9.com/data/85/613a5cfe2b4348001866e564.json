        "In today's modern world, the mode of communication has changed dramatically for young people than in the past. Most teenagers enjoy socializing online rather than meeting in person. In my opinion, an increase in  technology can be one of the main reasons for the current trend. This essay will argue why they prefer online platforms and what measures can be taken to discourage them from doing this.",
        "It is true that the youth nowadays prefer meeting their friends online. The main reason behind this action is  the sudden escalation in  technological advancement. Social medial platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Youtube are being used massively by many teenagers. Moreover, they believe that it will probably save their time and energy for travelling from one place to other. To give a quintessential example, in the current covid-19 pandemic, the usage of online applications for meetup has increased by  ten per cent which is a significant rise. Therefore, young people love to socialize online with others.",
        "On the contrary, some critics are of the belief that teenagers should be encouraged to meet their friends in person. Firstly, parents can arrange picnics or play dates for their young offspring. Secondly, they might explain the benefits of socializing in person. For an instance, teenagers can have their meals together, play outdoor games and discuss interesting topics if parents inspire them to meet face to face. To illustrate, a recent study shows that the youth, who hang out with their friends in person, is likely to create a strong and  emotional bond. Besides, this might develop  lifelong friendships. Hence, teenagers could be encouraged to meet in person.",
        "In conclusion, although young people have been inclined to use online social media platforms, parents can play an important role in encouraging them to meet one another in person. In my opinion, schools and parents may work together to motivate them by developing some group activities or field trips."
