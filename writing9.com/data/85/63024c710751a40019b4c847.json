        "Yesterday, I visit your downtown branch in Kuwait, I was amazed by the clarity and sound of the television that is displayed. I was able to inquire about your salesperson and he demonstrate  how to set up and assemble the item. Additionally, I bought the device in cash and was able to bring it home for me to enjoy. When I arrived home, I was greatly dismayed because the device is not sound good and the screen are not working well. Finally, I found out that the padding of the brand is put properly and the box is not stable enough to hold the item inside.",
