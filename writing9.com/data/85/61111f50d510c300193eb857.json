        "Traditionally, only a few people were willing to take the time to learn the history of your home or building, but searching for this kind of information is becoming increasingly popular these days. The reason for this phenomenon is that people will use this information, it can be found on the Internet, and older people who live on it.",
        "The main reason for this is that tenants can use both the positive and negative history of the building. On the one hand, as a people, will find many wonderful, culturally related stories, such as a very famous writer who lived in this house for many tourists who will be attracted to this by photographing these houses, and they share it on their social media platforms. In this case, the house will be evaluated in the future. On the other hand, from the point of view of the history of houses and buildings in which people live, and from the point of view of their protection from injuries. For example, some elevators in old buildings  were often used in the past. Because people know that the information they choose comes instead of the old one.",
        "There are also several tools for residents to conduct some research. The Internet is one of the most suitable materials that are provided in articles and films related to the plot. In addition, it is an old-fashioned way, including newspapers and magazines, and documentary films, all of which are in the past, and have a clear picture of what happened in the past. However, it is just under the control of the government or developers that some of the negative news is located, which can have a negative impact on the income that can be removed for Internet access or published works. As a result, people will find there are many elderly people who have lived there for a long period of time, and thus they will have a better understanding of old stories.",
        "To summarize,  the presence of the media,  allows us to do research, and more and more people are starting to do just that. After all, a person should look at the history of houses and other buildings."
