        "First of all, I really appreciate the content of this material which is rich in interesting and valuable information. On the other hand, your text said that Brazil is composed of four regions that have more similarities than differences. Actually, this information is incorrect because this country has five regions in addition, each of them has its own identity and it is possible to identify huge social and economic differences between them.",
        "In order to correct this article and also avoid misunderstanding conclusions by the lectors, I suggest a correction note in your next publication to inform the rectified number of Brazilian regions to your lectors and to point out that there are various differences between them.",
        "On top of that, you would like to suggest new content about this country, because I believe that will allows readers to meet an amazing and diverse culture. A good topic is about each Brazilian region focused on the unique details of each one, such as its culinary, typical dance and music.",
        "Please contact me if you need any extra information that I could explain to you.",
