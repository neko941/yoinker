        "The importance of knowing foreign languages cannot be denied. Hence, some people believe that foreign language lessons should be introduced in primary classes rather than secondary. In this essay, I will discuss the pros and cons of this debatable question.",
        "When we look at positive aspects of children learning a foreign language at schools we can find a number of  benefits. Firstly, children at an early age are generally curious and can easily learn a vast amount of information. More specifically, a children's brain is still in the phase of formation, which makes the absorption of the new information easier. Secondly, when kids learn a language they have an accent of a native speaker. For example, when a Russian speaker starts learning English in secondary school, most likely he/she will never be able to have the accent of a native English speaker.",
        "On the negative side, some people can claim that children have to focus on their own language first. However, coming from my personal experience I can say that for kids learning a language is much easier than we think. For instance, as a kid, I had to communicate in 3 different languages as well as with my peers. I had to speak Persian at home, Russian at school and Uzbek in the street. Subsequently, now I can communicate all these three languages on a native level. After all, people who speak several languages have improved memory, problem-solving and critical thinking skills, enhanced concentration and an ability to multitask.",
        "In short, I strongly believe that introduction of a foreign language can have a conducive effect on children's academic performance. In the long run, this will also benefit their careers and cognitive skills. Whereas, lessons should be tailored  for younger ones to make learning a fun and joyful experience."
