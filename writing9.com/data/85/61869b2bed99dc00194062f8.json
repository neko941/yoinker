        "Over a half-century, children in some families are implanted that everything they wish is possible and achievable as long as their endeavours are enough. This instruction does not have only benefits but also shortcomings to adolescents believing like this. In this essay below, I will explain either the advantages and disadvantages of this teaching.",
        "On one hand, trusting in the notion that they would succeed anything if they try hard enough has favourable outcomes for teenagers. To begin with, children whom parents teach like this can use it as a motivation and they ,consequently, will exert a great number of attempts in order to accomplish their demands. In addition to this, once these youngsters are able to complete their goals, they will have more confidence in themselves making them have positive thinking and increase their self-esteem afterwards. All of these personalities which are  fundamental to having good mental health and are developed from trusting in the notion may conduce them to be successful people in the future.",
        "On the other hand, there still are some defects in instructing this idea to adolescents. It is no denying that in reality, they cannot achieve every wish they desire when considering all various factors such as their background knowledge, endorsement from family, and financial status. To illustrate, if youngsters set their ambitions which are impossible to accomplish and they hugely devote themselves to the tasks but they are still incapable to finish the objectives, they will end up being resentful and depressed causing both physical and mental health problems later.",
        "In conclusion, it is clearly seen from previous paragraphs that the notion of teaching adolescents to believe they are able to succeed in anything is both beneficial and harmful toward the children. From my perspective, I consider that this instruction can be told to them; however, these teenagers should also apprehend the limitations of this doctrine."
