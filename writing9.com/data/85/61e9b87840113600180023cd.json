        "I am writing this letter to bring to your attention that our shop does not have any  parking area for cars. This problem has very significant meaning and can negatively influence our sales level.",
        "In my perspective, this problem should be solved immediately, because our customers always complain about this. Furthermore, sometimes, some of them do not enter the shop because they cannot find the parking place near the shop. Should be pointed out that a new shop with the same items as us will be open next month at the next crossroad from our shop. When this shop will be opened it will have 3 parking places. Therefore, if we did not change the situation, this new shop would have a big advantage over us.",
        "If you check the city map, you can find some empty area behind  our shop, which is available for rent. If we rented this territory, we could solve this problem.  In addition, we can provide some navigation, in order to help our customers  find this parking place.",
