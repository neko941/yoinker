        "Furthermore, I would like you to know that I won't be working with the City library again. The simple reason is because I have to go back to school at the end of the month. I have been offered a place at Gorgon University, and I have equally decided to accept the offer. As much as I would have loved to continue working with you, the university is in another town and it would be nearly impossible to combine working and schooling together.",
        "Meanwhile, if you don't mind, I have a great colleague that can fill in the space if you want a replacement. His name is Tunde, he is a friend with a great attitude and, I am sure you going to like him. I have discussed this with him already, and he is interested in working with you; all I need is your consent, and he can come around to see you.",
