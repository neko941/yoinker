I was too worried about it as I need it on an urgent basis to draw some cash because I have to do the payment to one of  my suppliers. Furthermore, I am not able to do any online transactions through my mobile app since it requires card details. Lastly, I have already paid its fees in advance to the bank which will take into consideration and must be refunded.",
