        "Nowadays, obesity has become a common issue among children. While there are some suggestions about increasing the sports activities time on schools to solve overweight problem. From my point of view, I opine that this perspective will partially help out students because it is not the only factor affecting their weight. However, a supervision on their eating habits is crucial as well.",
        "Firstly, sports and exercises are vital for students' fitness and health. Not only will exercise boosts their strength, but they will gain a positive energy and release the gruelling study stress as well. Moreover, fat children will be motivated by their peers to burn more calories. This can be proven by a research study conducted by the faculty of education, Baghdad university, which has manifested that, the offsprings who are considered overweight compete with their peers at school to lose weight, and their results are higher than children who are exercising at home alone.",
        "Furthermore and more importantly, schools' authorities should apply a supervision program on what children eat at school. To illustrate, despite the fact that sports activities are crucial, eating habits play a vital role in children's weight as well. Therefore, if we diagnose this issue, parents and teachers should cooperate to mitigate it. For instance, the lunch at school should contain healthy food, and fast food should be banned. This can be proven by a report published by a medical magazine, which has shown that fat children who cut instant food from their meals have noticed a good drop in their weight.",
        "Having presented the ideas above, I have drowned the conclusion that healthy offsprings need both sport and healthy food. I want to reiterate my stance that schools have a vital role in raising students' awareness about the proper habits for their lifestyle."
