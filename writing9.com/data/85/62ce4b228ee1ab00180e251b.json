        "Two weeks ago, I have got hit by a car while I was crossing the road. I believe, I was unconscious and lying on the floor. As per the administration officer at the hospital, it was you who have taken me to the hospital. Also, my parents were out of town, therefore, the doctor said that you have admitted me to the hospital and waited until the surgery was over. Moreover, you have communicated the incident with my parents and helped them to calm down without getting panicked.",
        "I would like to express my gratitude for the support you have given me in this crucial situation. And I have recovered completely and started to carry out my day-to-day activities. Parents and I are like to invite you and your family to visit our place in the upcoming weekends. Please kindly let us know a suitable date for you.",
