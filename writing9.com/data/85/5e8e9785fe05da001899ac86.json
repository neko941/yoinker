        "Some segment of people wants to live to be a vegetarian because they think it is a best way to stay fit and healthy. People who against an animal experiment, they are saying not to add non-veg items in their meal as it helps the world as a whole. According to my point of view, we should add some proportion of meat or fish in our routine meal. I am going to discuss further about this in the following paragraph.",
        "First of all, vegetarian food such as fruits, vegetables and green leaves has high protein and vitamins. So that the people always prefer to have only vegetarian food, but this is not the right approach as we have to consider to maintain the food-cycle as well. For instance, If we eat only green oriented meal, there will be a plethora of changes reflect on the nature as a whole as we are disturbing food-chain which will cause the world pollution. So balance in the diet is a very genuine way to maintain the nature.",
        "Although there are a variety of vitamins in non veg to help our body to keep healthy, some people are not accepting the fact. The human body requires fruitful of seafood and red-meat. For example, fish contains omega-3 oil, which helps in cardiac and eye related issues as per the medical case studies. On the other hand, if people take an excess of meat in their diet, consequently it causes of some hazards in their health. Hence try to take an equal portion of veg and non-veg is the best way to be a healthier and we can promote this to develop the nature as well.",
        "To conclude, healthy life is an ultimate target for some portion of the people by having only vegetables as per their knowledge, but adding some fish and meat also help their life healthier. So excess of anything is bad for the human body and all should have a proportional balance in their diet to continue the healthy lifestyle."
