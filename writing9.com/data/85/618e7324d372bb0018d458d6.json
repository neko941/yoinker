        "I am writing this letter to recommend a legend from my area for an award that you are organising next month.",
        "In my society, there is one tea maker who has a very small shop near to our city railway station. His name is Ramesh Kumar. His age is 55. Even he earns very little, he runs the school for girls in my village and he does not charge anything from girls students. He is managing this school from his personal income.",
        "He does not have a proper place to live, the situation of his house is poor but ,still his dedication towards girls education recharges him with courage. I strongly believe that he deserves this award for his contribution to society because it will enhance his confidence. Such people are very limited in this world. The appreciation is the only effort we can contribute to their service to humanity.",
        "Hope you will consider this legendary man for an award. If you need any support from my side, you can contact me anytime.",
