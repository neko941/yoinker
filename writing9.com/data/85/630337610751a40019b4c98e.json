        "Nowadays, considering the significance of financial awareness for  youngsters, part-time occupations can have beneficial outcomes for the pupils. Yet, there remains a contentious debate as to whether should parents motivate their children to participate in these job opportunities or if it can lead to detrimental results. I partially agree with this topic and will support my perspective with more details and practical examples.",
        "Firstly, this scenario teaches the younger generation to be financially stable. In addition, it is an indisputable fact that working at an early age is a potential factor in reaching a better understanding  of the monetary condition, while the individuals will be more prepared for the possible money-based crisis; also, they gain the strength to organize their life based on the possible financial situation. For instance, children are able to arrange their expenses as well as their related living costs accurately without being worried about the consequences; furthermore, they will  have the opportunity to start saving money for their future porpuses. Consequently, encouraging the learners to join  short-period careers results in a stable mental ability to clarify the importance of financial arrangements in the near future.",
        "On the other hand, this alternative can digress the students' attention from the concept of learning in the educational system. Regarding all the benefits of working at an early age for the students, it can disturb pupils' attention to the learning processes, which leads to a lack of enthusiasm for the learners to participate in the classrooms. One particularly salient example is the children who start earning money from their part-time business and lose their faith in the educational system to aid them in reaching higher achievements; meanwhile, this case can have insurmountable impacts on the level of literacy in societies. Thus, motivating pupils to join working environments can result in a lack of desire to continue higher education and be  more influential  in society, while the individuals will lose more profitable job opportunities based on their low-value degrees.",
        "As a way of conclusion, I once again reaffirm that inspiring  youngsters can have various pros and cons , but its drawbacks outweigh its positive points. Also, it is highly recommended to establish cognitive processes for the younger generation about the possible outcomes of this scenario."
