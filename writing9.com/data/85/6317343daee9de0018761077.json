        "To begin with, let me explain to you how I got to know about this proposal. I read an article about this plan which was published by the Sunday Observer on the 25th of August 2022. In that, they have given  descriptive detail about the plan and the proposed location to build the airport.",
        "Secondly, I would like to point out  one of the major issues that we will face because of the proposal, and that is, since we live very near to a bird sanctuary, this construction will disturb these wonderful creatures to fly away from the place. So, there might be a problem for the habitat as well as for the local businesses that go around this sanctuary.",
        "Therefore, I suggest you  consider developing Jaffna or Palali airports as international airports, which will be much easier than constructing a whole new airport.",
        "I would appreciate your immediate attention to this matter, and I look forward to hearing from you.",
