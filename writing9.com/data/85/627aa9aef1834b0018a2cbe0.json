        "Dear Mr Bharara,",
        "I hope you are doing well. I am Sharmila Sharma, working as a senior automation resource in the same organization. I am writing this letter since I was asked for a suggestion on how to improve the reception area.",
        "I would like to tell you about the complaints that have been reported. Whenever a visitor enters the premises, there is no one at the reception to help him out. In addition to that, there is no water or coffee service present. And people from the office have also complained that there is trash littering around in the reception area. Reception plays an important role in a company's reputation. If the reception area is awful then people will stop visiting the institution. If the office space is not clean then an employee could quit his job or may fall sick.",
        "My suggestion for the improvement of the reception area is that cleanliness should be maintained and there should always be someone who can assist the visitors. With this, there should always be facilities for water and coffee for the person visiting the institution.",
        "I hope you will find my suggestions helpful.",
        "Yours  sincerely",
