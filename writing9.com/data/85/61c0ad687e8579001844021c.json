        "I am writing to express my interest in joining your family and caring for your kid. I have some justifications to choose this  job. The first  point is that I am an extroverted person and I can adapt to new people quickly. Another ground is that, due to having several nieces and nephews, I am able to communicate with children and have a good relationship with them. Moreover, I have  studied a lot of books about babies and teenagers and learned how to deal with them .",
