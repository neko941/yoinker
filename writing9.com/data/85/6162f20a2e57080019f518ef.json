        "It is certainly claimed that tertiary education, which plays an important to produce future human resources in each country, must be provided without any charge. I totally agree with this idea, as I believe that graduates will be the potential elements to developing countries in the next decade, while some of them are not able to complete a degree due to financial support.",
        "To finish a university degree, students may have to pay expensive tuition fees which some parents cannot afford. This is the main reason why some students decide to discontinue higher education. For instance, the highest rate of children who have drop classes since high school in Cambodia, although those students had good study records provided that their families are poor, so they are not able to pay for the schools. Therefore, there will be more graduates if the university education is totally free for everyone.",
        "Turning to the country benefits, the government is generally needed the next generations who are capable to generate their knowledge to develop the country. Thus, generate students must be young dynamics to be a part of the country\u2019s development in every sector. For example, some students who complete a degree in engineering are currently working in developing infrastructures. This represents only the construction field, but there are more sectors such as medical, agricultural, economic sectors and so on. Those people will be able to apply their knowledge to develop the country significantly.",
        "In conclusion, I strongly believe that the free of charge on higher education certainly provides positive effects on individuals and society."
