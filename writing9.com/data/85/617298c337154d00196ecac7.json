        "I had the most amazing vacation with you in your city. I enjoyed trying out various local dishes that you introduced me to. They were so delicious that I even had to buy some of them for my parents back home! I also got to visit the tourist attraction sites, as well as the local favourite spots, that are unknown to outsiders. Among all, I love spending time with you, as it made me feel like we were back in our school days.",
        "How about visiting me during the December holidays? I'd be so excited to have you at home and plan  our itinerary. I'm looking forward to hearing from you.",
