        "The authority has partial responsibility for any individual's health because they have to provide enough medical care structure to cope with the increasing number of people. However, I believe that everyone has to take care of his health by a regular exercising and healthy dietary scheme.",
        "On the one hand, the government has to enhance the quality of the medical care structure. This is because of the increase in population in every place, which requires the authority to multiply the number of hospitals. For instance, in Egypt, every year, the population increases by around 2 million people; therefore, the government has to increase the sum of hospitals. Nevertheless, it is the responsibility of each one to take his precautions to maintain his health by going to the hospital every few months to do a full check-up.",
        "On the other hand, people should adopt a healthy lifestyle to improve their health. This is because a balanced diet system could  enhance the body metabolism. For instance, everyone should take enough portions of meat, vegetables and protein to increase the body burning. Furthermore, nothing is helpful more than exercising regularly; for example, if anyone spend  30 minutes in jogging every day, this will improve the body mass. As a result, it is evident that these procedures will prevent any health-related issues such as cardiovascular diseases.",
        "In conclusion, while the government has to provide an adequate number of hospitals, it is the responsibility of individuals to go to hospitals for a regular check-up, adopt a healthy diet scheme and physical activities."
