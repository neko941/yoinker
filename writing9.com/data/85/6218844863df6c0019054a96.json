        "In the era in which technology along with high-tech machines has progressed constantly, it is inevitable that people are much attracted by electronic media. Electronic media are believed to negatively affect people\u2019s relationships. I partly agree with this opinion but it still has some positive effects.",
        "On the one hand, there are some negative effects of utilizing too much electronic media on the relationships between people. Since the advent of media, people  have spent more time on social networking sites such as YouTube, Facebook or Instagram. That makes people talk less to each other as they are more interested in building wonderful images online. For example, when a group of friends meet up in a cafe, it's easy to see that most of the time, some just look at their screen which makes the others irritated and tend to be involved in another group where they are listened to, shared and have a great time with friends. Furthermore, the bond between members is looser as children prefer to chat to their friends online instead of communicating with their parents resulting in a lack of mutual understanding. As a result, children might feel isolated in their house and rarely share current problems with their parents.",
        "On the other hand, besides drawbacks, there are some benefits of electronic media. People easily keep in touch with each other. For instance, children who have to live far from their parents for higher education can make video calls every day. Another good point is news is spread more quickly than it used to be. When unexpected things happen, people are informed immediately so they can come up with solutions to cope  effectively. To make it clear, a friend's car broke on the street and asked for help by texting her classmate. Within 5 or 10 minutes, her friend came and drove her to school.",
        "In conclusion, although communicating through electronic applications can cause some problems between people, and it cannot replace face-to-face meetings and conversations, it somehow brings advantages."
