        "I am writing this letter in regards to some purchases that appeared in my credit card statement that I totally affirm were made by someone else. I have been a client of your bank since 2016, under the bank account 4138801,  and I had never had any problems with my accounts, until now.",
        "Let me start by pointing out the items and the reason why I did not buy them. The first item is a car cleaner, which I believe has the only purpose of cleaning a car, which I do not have. In addition, there are flight tickets to Asia, there I am absolutely sure I did not buy, as I am still not  entitled to vacation in my new job, so there is no reason for purchasing them.",
        "Finally, I would require a cancellation of this credit card, as well as a correction to be made in my statements. In addition, I would appreciate it if you could send me as soon as possible a new credit card.",
