        "It is undeniable that these days advanced technologies play a crucial role in our lives. This is the reason why these technologies have altered the way in which kids spend their spare time. While this trend provides several benefits, I personally believe that the drawbacks far outweigh them.",
        "On the one hand, the major advantage of new technologies for children is that utilizing these innovative technologies is the easiest way for the young generation to communicate with their friends. To illustrate, nowadays, there are numerous applications on smartphones which can help kids to interact with their peers fastly such as Line, Facebook, Instagram, and so on. Moreover, advanced technologies are effective tools to widen their knowledge. For example, children can enhance their English skills by playing games on their mobile phones.",
        "On the other hand, one of the obvious disadvantages of utilizing advanced technologies is that youngsters will have a high possibility to have Attention Deficit Syndrome. In other words, due to spending too much time on smartphones and tablets, children will not be able to concentrate on one thing for a long time and be often grumpy. In addition, It can cause some health problems. In simple terms, the young overusing computers, smartphones, and tablets will have a high risk of being shortsighted. Finally, they may be scared of  society. That is to say, kids who spend a large amount of time on electronic gadgets are generally in their own world and hardly interact with people in  real society.",
        "To summarize, there are numerous advantages to youngsters spending their leisure time on new technologies, but it seems to me  that the setbacks are more significant."
