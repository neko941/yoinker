        "It is still controversial whether crime is brought about by social issues and poverty or by innate characteristics. While some people support the point of view that crime commitment may be a result of individual characteristics, I would argue that it is a large consequence of social problems and poverty. In this essay, I will delve deep into both arguments and give out my logical conclusion.",
        "On the one hand, there is a school of thought that human nature is the main cause of crime. To elucidate, bad characteristics such as laziness or selfishness may breed future offenders, who seek to acquire money without working for it. As a matter of fact, a number of lazy youngsters choose to steal from others to make a living instead of working hard to earn money honestly. In addition, a cruel person is more likely to commit crimes than a normal one. For example, children bullying their friends at school tend to become violent criminals in the future.",
        "On the other hand, I believe that crime originates from social issues and poverty. To clarify, unemployment is when people cannot find a job to earn money, while poverty is the state of people having no or little material possessions. A society in which these two problems remain at a high rate would make it really hard for its inhabitants to make ends meet. Therefore, these citizens may have no choice but to resort to committing crimes in order to survive.",
        "In conclusion, although both views certainly have some validity, it seems to me that the principal causes of crime are the result of social conditions and problems"
