        "It is widely believed that the usage of  cellular phones is as unfriendly as flaming, and its prohibition in some places like that mobile also should be prohibited. I strongly disagree with this point of view, as I believe that the mobile phone is extremely important in this modern world, while it has  some negative impact.",
        "First of all, the mobile is attached to our day to life activities. This is because of easier communication with others and is also  used for multi-purpose actions. For example, nowadays  people all over the world use the digital phone for communication purposes like face to face chatting, texting with other people etc. While it is true that it  will create  some unwanted problems,  but many applications in phones can make a dramatic positive effect.",
        "Furthermore, the mobile is used in many ways such as emergency calls, studying etc. This can lead to helping the people who are in an emergency to call the police or ambulance. For instance, due to the covid ,pandemic there is an online class for students and most of the people use their cell phones for their studies. Therefore, although it appears that using  digital mobile in an illegal manner, it can be argued that these functions in fact increase their more utility.",
        "In conclusion, it is illogical to suggest that banning  cellular phones like smoking, has both positive and negative impacts. In my opinion, the usage of mobile was extremely beneficial but at the same ,time some applications in these functions should be forbidden."
