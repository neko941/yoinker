        "Knowlegde they say is power. Although certain folks presume that data's should be accessed at no cost hense available to the entire\u00a0public, a few think that some important research work must be purchased instead of being free. In my opinion\u00a0I believe that\u00a0the masses must have access to vital intelligence at no cost\u00a0because it ensures civil unrest is avoided\u00a0and\u00a0curcial data can\u00a0also save lives.",
        "To begin with, knowlegde is an important\u00a0aspect of life which keeps the masses a brass of recent happening in their surrendings. If the public is deprived of key information it can lead to\u00a0public unrest which could disstabilize a whole region. For example, when i was a student a rumor was leaked about a security threat currently faced by the school authorities and they shyed away from addressing it, consequently the students carried a demonstration where\u00a0a lot of infastructures were vandalized thus\u00a0resulted to a\u00a0total shutdown from the government which lasted for 3 months. Simple update on the envisaged challenges could have gone a long way to arrest this issue.",
        "Additionally, access to\u00a0essential intelligence can be be the key to salvage catastrophic outcome when could result to huge fatalites.\u00a0With the on going Covid-19\u00a0outbreak\u00a0for instance,\u00a0the spread of this virus could\u00a0have been mitigated if\u00a0the\u00a0crisis was reported real time. Furthermore, national lockdown would have started earlier in\u00a0December\u00a0and\u00a0the researches on the drugs or preventive measures could have commesed on time. Moreover, this serves as a good lesson to the human\u00a0population on the importance of\u00a0Knowlegde but regretablly some people already paid the price with their lives.",
        "To conclude, If the\u00a0world\u00a0at large is\u00a0informed, a lot of\u00a0regretable incidents\u00a0could have\u00a0been\u00a0avoided such as: war and\u00a0lives\u00a0can\u00a0also would be\u00a0saved. I strongly support that vital data must be free and accessible at all time because the human race depends on it and such important factors should not be optional."
