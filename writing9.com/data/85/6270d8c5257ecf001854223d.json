In addition to that, the LAN cable port is not working. Due to the current situation, I work from home for a consultancy firm and facing such challenges would risk my job as I don't have any alternate solution to it.",
        "Could you immediately send someone from your technical team to look into it. If you want me to come to your store to get the laptop checked, then also it works for me.",
