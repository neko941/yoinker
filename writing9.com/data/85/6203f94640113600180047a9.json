        "Dear Tutor,",
        "I have come to Brighton College from Singapore, Where I was a student for ten years. I have already taken examinations in Singapore in English, Biology, Computer and Maths. My highest score was for Computer: I got a grade of  A.",
        "When I was a student in Singapore I also had a part-time job in a shop. My uncle owns a supermarket and so I helped him in the evenings. I worked there four nights a week and I think this was a very good experience for me.",
        "At the weekends, I usually played volleyball with friends or, if the weather was bad, we used to go to the theatre, which is very popular in Singapore. Because of my part-time job, I also spent a lot of time studying at the weekend.",
        "I haven\u2019t been to many other places. My father took me to Thailand once. Three weeks after we returned he also went to Malaysia and took the whole family.",
        "This is a brief description of my background.",
