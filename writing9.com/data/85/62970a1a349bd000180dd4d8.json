        "Dear Alka,",
        "I hope this letter finds you well. I am very excited to know that you are planning to learn to drive and want me to give some sort of advice on the matter.",
        "Firstly, I suggest you should apply for a license that is mandatory by law. It has enormous benefits. Firstly, It can be used as an ID. Moreover, It will save you from any penalty as well as legal proceedings which occurred during the course of the journey. For instance, In India, It is obligatory that a person needs to produce a driving license in case it is demanded by traffic personnel or you'll be fined in case of failure.",
        "Also, I want to recommend to you a driving school namely, the Maruti school of driving. I also take my classes from there and they proved very helpful as well as beneficial for me. They teach me unique skills to drive my vehicle.",
        "Furthermore, You should take all the precautions to avoid any dangerous situation. You had to obey some fundamental traffic rules such as wearing a seat belt if you driving a four-wheeler or you had to wear a helmet in case of two-wheelers. These will ensure your safety.",
        "I am hoping that the information provided by me will assist you. Looking forward to hearing from you.",
        "Regards,",
        "Kuljeet Kaur."
