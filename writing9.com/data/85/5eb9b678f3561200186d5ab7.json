        "Few people argue that medical facilities should be provided for free, whereas others believe that the worth of health treatment need to be borne by individuals. In my opinion, the government must account for the well being of nationals. This essay will discuss both the views.",
        "On one hand, one of the most important duty of each state should be to offer health infrastructure to each family at their own price. This is because every human being cannot afford for a regular check-up due to wide income gap in the society.  Additionally, there are certain diseases, such as cancer, Dyslexia, where symptoms must be recognized and treated at the initial stage to prevent fatality.  Therefore, the government can play a vital role in offering zero charge medicine for its public to reduce the mortality rate. For example, Sweden has the lowest death rate in the world due to their free of charge wellness program.",
        "On the other hand, it is imperative for the administration to control the expenses on their natives, as such a mammoth amount of money would impact the GDP of the country. Moreover, authority needs to reserve the money at the event of a natural disaster because a large majority of people got affected at that time. Despite this, the GDP of the kingdom depends on the physical state of its native. If youth is in a proper physical condition to perform its responsibility, he or she would have higher productivity and better output for the country, which would result in higher tax for the empire. For instance, a recent survey proves that the higher is the happiness index of the citizen, the more is the efficiency and the gross value of the state.",
        "In conclusion, although offering complimentary medical services adds to the rate of the kingdom, it also indirectly result in adding up to the growth of the nation, as greater no of residents are contented. Given the situation, it is recommended that each territory propose complimentary medical facilities to their nationals."
