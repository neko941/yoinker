        "In the modern work, the internet has its influences in all the fields. A group of people argue that the current technology can replace the country's historical exhibitions, as all the ancient objects can be viewed through the computer. I completely disagree with this and this essay will state my reasons for the same.",
        "Firstly, the historical famous places such as museums and galleries are largely responsible for economic development of a country. In some locations, these are a primary source for attracting tourists. In Mysore, for instance, the authority acquires close to  5 lakh rupees in a year as a part of exhibition fund. This clearly displays the importance of tourism and the international travellers who show deep interest in visiting these places as a part of their trip.",
        "Secondly, displaying the ancient objects in the digital version may reduce the clarity and this impact the originality of the images. The image perfection depends on the medium we use to view it and the quality of the camera used for capturing the picture. Moreover, uploading the photos also can reduce the perfection of the pictures. In Kerala, for instance, the government has started a website to display their cultural photos, but it did not obtain any appreciation from the society as the originality in the picture was missing.",
        "In conclusion, in my opinion, a real visit to the galleries and museums gives more pleasure and natural feel and virtual visits through digital platforms has a significant impact on the realistic emotions of the pictures.  Considering this, it is better to start encouraging the art exhibitions in a country."
