        "In the world today, few people believe that life will become easier if there are fewer languages. As  passing years various language are not being used anymore. I totally agree with this statement,  because fewer languages are easy for communication and aid in relocating to other countries for working purpose. Now I would like to explore my viewpoints on this statement before forming a conclusion.",
        "To embark on, there are several reasons as to why netizens believe that Life becomes easier if these are lesser languages.  The first and the foremost reason is that, the communication between individuals and the ability to become a lot easier when fewer languages present. People become more comfortable and confident when they communicate with others and especially while travelling. For example, the number of Indian feels comfortable while travelling to abroad as they can speak and understand English very well. Hence,  fewer  language ease  communication.",
        "In  addition to that,  limited language is helpful for people to migrate to another place for work purposes. Multiple companies have their office in the whole world and often ask their employees to relocate. Moreover, one of the major problems faced by them it is a language barrier be it  while buying groceries and renting a home. Although, the presence of fewer language would support overcoming all of these leading to a more comfortable life in a foreign land. For example,  Indian multinational companies have their office in Canada and send two of their employees every year. These individual agree as English and French are widely spoken in Canada.",
        "By the way of conclusion, for the reasons mentioned above, it seemed that life becomes easier if there are fewer language and an individual easily communicate and shift to foreign for working purposes."
