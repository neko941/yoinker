        "With the development of information technology , internet shopping has become the most popular mode of shopping than  conventional shopping  . Although  online shopping has benefits like cheap and easy mode of buying compared to physical purchasing , it has some disadvantages like  the high possibility of fraud and shipping delay .In the following essay , this writer wishes to discuss further on pros and cons of online shopping .",
        "To begin with , when we consider  the positive side of this new development , easiness to purchase comes first . Furthermore , we can purchase any item , even at  midnight with this mode and we can pay easily using cards . At the same time , there are multiple varieties of items to chose from and interestingly , their prices would be cheap compared to conventional shops due to the absence of middlemen.To illustrate this , a few days back  I have purchased a computer from an online shop in the  Abans company and on the same day one of my friends has purchased the same computer from a computer shop in Colombo , but the price is more than 10000rupees higher than the mine.",
        "On the other hand , when we discuss  the disadvantages , the main problem with this method of purchasing is  internet fraud . Since  there are many fake online sites and fake companies , some people who are new to this method will be fraud by these fake sites  and they can easily steal from their  credit cards .Moreover , there could be some bitter incidence like delayed shipping of purchased items to customers. For example , one of my friends experienced a delayed shopping of an iPad from the online shop , and when the item reached him , a new version of the iPad  has come to the market .",
        "In conclusion , online shopping has become one of the popular modes of purchase  by customers and it has advantages like low price and variety to select compared to the conventional model . however , some people may experience a delay in shipment and froud as its disadvantages ."
