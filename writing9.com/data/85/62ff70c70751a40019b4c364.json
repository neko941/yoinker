For example, one day I forgot to close one of my room's windows, and thus next morning, I had an argument with my coworker. Furthermore, I had to do repetitive tasks every day and it was so boring.",

For instance, I have a higher income, full-payment insurance is considered for me, there is a friendly atmosphere in my workplace, and the most important item for me is that it is a creative career.",
        "Surprisingly, I bought a house in the suburb and we will move there next week. Moreover, we are planning a trip to your city and I wish I could see you.",
