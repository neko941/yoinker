        "While encouraging people to join the battle against poverty and inequality, we can choose one of two main tactics, So, we can appeal to the emotions of others by showing them disturbing, terrifying images that reflect the real situation. On the contrary, it is possible to concentrate on the happy scenes and results of the work already done. Both of them have their pros and cons that need to be properly analyzed while choosing the most effective way to engage more individuals.",
        "On the one hand, by distributing sad or sometimes extremely depressive content we show the reality of what is happening. Moreover, it helps to calculate the amount of money required and prove that assistance is crucially needed as soon as possible. For example, in Ukraine, there is no lack of food or resources, nevertheless, videos and photos of the war realities shared on social media demonstrate the constant cry for help and attract attention on a global scale.",
        "On the other hand, after some period of time human beings tend to get tired of the negativity and try to limit it in their news bubble. Therefore, pictures of volunteers or the results of their efforts will be more engaging in the long run. Thus, taking into consideration that the fight against poverty and hunger is endless, it would be more useful to choose this tactic. For instance, I am more willing to contribute and make a donation when I see an organization that has already established its work in the region and made a real difference because I can trust it and see where will my money go.",
        "To sum up, there are two main approaches in the media and social campaigns against poverty. For sure, the most practicable way is to combine both of them, though if we need to choose only one then sharing positive pictures and videos would be more helpful in the long-term activity."
