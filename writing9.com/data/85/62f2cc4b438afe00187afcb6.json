To begin with, I have some problem with my gas stove, it goes off sometimes while cooking. so must replace it or do some maintenance work on it. Secondly, there is an issue in my bathroom. There is no place to take support, as I told you that I live here with my grandparents. You must install a rod or make some place to take support.",
        "Last but not least there is a problem with air conditioning, when I turn on AC it goes off after a few minutes. Even it is not cooling properly. So every day when I am off to bed I had to turn on AC for half hour  so that at the time of sleeping we can feel the cool air. So it is very important that you have to replace it.",
