        "I hope this letter finds you well. I am incredibly sorry for not having been in touch recently. Life has been a bit hectic. I am writing this letter in reply to your previous letter asking for my ideas about the oven that I bought last year.",
        "As you may still remember, I was fascinated by a Sony microwave oven when it was released. At the end of last year, I found David Jones provided a huge discount, so I purchased it immediately.",
        "Using this oven really saves my time and energy. I no longer need to cook by myself as I always grill food in this oven, which gives me a great deal of time to relax and do other things. However, I realize this oven is quite difficult to clean. For example, after grilling meat such as steaks and lambs, it becomes particularly greasy, so I need to clean it on a regular basis.",
        "There are several alternative items you should consider. First of all, if your budget is up to 300 dollars, you are able to buy an air-fryer that has similar functions. Furthermore, Tiger produced a small size oven, which is quite portable and easy to clean.",
        "I hope my advice is useful for you. Drop me a line to let me know which one you consider purchasing.",
        "Best wishes,",
