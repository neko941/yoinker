        "A number of individuals opine that the entire human race will someday lose their sources of livelihood to artificially intelligent automated machines. In my opinion, this might inevitably occur due to the benefits they offer.",
        "To begin with, artificially intelligent robots are more accurate than humans. Therefore, in places where accuracy is of importance,  they are most likely to be considered.  For instance,  the pharmaceutical industries, where drugs are manufactured,  take the amount of constituents they use very seriously because a little disparity could be fatal. Moreover, Jackson pharmaceutical company,  was reported to have laid off almost have of its staff so as to get automated machines with high precision. If this continues, which is likely to be the case, however, and in places where accuracy is of utmost importance, the people there will definitely lose their jobs.",
        "Another point to consider is that, these robots are faster than humans. In other words, they produce more than human beings in terms of products. Considering this fact and the goals of numerous manufacturers, these machines are like to take the places of physical manpower. To illustrate,  Marks and Spencer, a manufacturing industry in the UK, was seen to have put off a large percentage of its human resources and gotten five of these machines in order to increase productivity. This has also been said of several other producers of goods, so as to match up with the ever increasing population demands in the world today.  Hence, the artificially intelligent robots are indeed threats to humans' jobs.",
        "To conclude, there is a belief that programmed machines will take over people's jobs and in my view, I think this will eventually happen due to the accuracy and greater outputs they are known with."
