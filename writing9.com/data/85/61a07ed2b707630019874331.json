        "As I told you earlier , I am planning to attend my Master degree at the National University of Singapore.I selected to attend Computer Science major which will take nearly two years to complete including research works.I am also thinking   for apply student grant if the Singapore government allows me to do it . Although I need to take the entrance exam , I believe that I can handle it smoothly.",
        "As I know , living costs are high in Singapore compared to my country and I need to work after my classes to cover my personal expenses like food and transportation charges .",
        "As I remembered , you have many connections who are from Computer Science backgrounds.It would be great if you can introduce me to anyone of them . If possible I prefer to work in the Computer Science field because it would give me more knowledge to do my research paper.",
        "I hope you can help me with my request and I look forward to hearing from you .",
