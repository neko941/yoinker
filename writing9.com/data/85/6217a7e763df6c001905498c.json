        "In some parts of the world, an increasing number of people are curious about the history of the house or apartments they are now living in. This essay will discuss why people are interested in history and how they can find out about that.",
        "There may be several reasons why histories of buildings are becoming interesting for people nowadays. First of all, in this modern world, people love to observe and learn new things because it makes them excited in some ways. The second reason could be that people want to know about the mysteries that might have happened in where they are living. For example, people are intentionally renting a haunted house in order to experience things they are not expected of or find out whether ghosts really exist.",
        "If people are enthusiastic about researching the hidden story of the buildings, they can take steps to achieve it. Firstly, they can contact the landlord and ask about it. Then they can trace who originally owned that house and have a conversation with the initial owners. In addition, they can find out more about the building by looking at the details such as design and architecture. As an example, people can know when a particular building was built or how old the building is, by paying attention to what types of bricks or styles are used.",
        "To conclude, it is a good thing that a majority of people are eager to learn about the historical knowledge of the building they are living in. There may be personal reasons why they are interested in this and they can research by simply asking their landlord or just looking at the design of the building."
