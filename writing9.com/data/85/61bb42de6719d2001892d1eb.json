        "I am writing to you concerning an item I lost during my last trip from Abuja to Lagos. I boarded the Abuja rail on the 24th of January to Lagos, however after I disembarked, I noticed that my laptop bag was lighter than usual. After checking in, I couldn't find my HP laptop. This is a 14-inches laptop, Bluetooth and wireless network-enabled. Also, it is ash-coloured and it has the HP logo at the back of the screen.",
        "To be honest, I left the laptop on top of my luggage, besides where I sat during the trip and I was conscious of the bag, just to be sure that it was safe. Although, I stepped out of the carriage once, however, I returned immediately to my seat after visiting the lounge.",
        "For now, I would need your support to help track and maybe retrieve the laptop. You can start by asking your staff, if they've seen the type of computer described or if they've seen any stray laptop left on the train.",
        "I hope you can help out with finding this device, I will be so happy if found eventually. Kindly let me know if there is any information on the finding.",
        "Yours faithfully,",
