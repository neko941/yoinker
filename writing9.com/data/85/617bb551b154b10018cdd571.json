        "In the contemporary era, the internet has replaced face-to-face communication with online chats and calls. Although it helps to contact loved ones who are miles away ,it causes addiction to this virtual interaction. In my opinion, e-media contributes towards worsening communication rather than improving it.",
        "Undoubtedly, there is not merely one, but a basketful of causative factors why online applications are beneficial, out of which the most prominent one is that this help to strengthen the bond among the family members who are far away from each other. Due to the internet's availability at every nook and corner people can be in connection with dear ones. For Instance, students who migrate to foreign countries for higher studies make contact with their parents through social applications. As a result, they do not fall prey to homesickness.",
        "Having said that when it comes to drawbacks then there are plentiful. The main one is that people spend their most of time exploring social media as they get addicted to it.  Because the algorithms used to create social applications are user-effective which grab the eyeballs of the users. According to a survey conducted by \"The Times\", it is concluded that 80% of multitudes in the world pass their time  in exploring facebook which impacts their daily tasks. Therefore, it works as an addiction to them.",
        "To conclude, there would be no exaggeration to state that the use of social media is reducing direct communication. Even though these sites are helpful to maintain bonds between relations; however the addiction of using these can not be ignored. In my viewpoint, virtual interaction collapses the emotions by not understanding the feelings behind it, which can be possible through face-to-face only."
