I  appreciated your agency helping me to settle in a nice apartment when I was the first time move to England and knew nothing about the apartment information. I am really enjoy the living atmosphere and the nice neighbourhood.",

I think it is a great opportunity for my job career and I have made a decision to accept the offer. Therefore, I am asking if it is possible to terminate the renting contract two months earlier since I will leave the city in the near future. I hope you can understand my current situation and do not hesitate to contact me back if you have further questions to discuss the detail about the termination of the renting contract.",
