        "It has been a topic of discussion for a long, that whether the government should pay college fees for the students willing to pursue a University education. In my opinion, this practice shall not be followed as it might create more problems than benefits.",
        "First of all, it is important to attend school for basic knowledge and opting for graduation or post-graduation is not necessary for all youngsters. Moreover, the bright pupil who excels in his or her academics is generally provided with a scholarship or stipend. If everybody is allowed to attend  college for free then there are chances that the value of education might fall drastically. Also, this may raise disparity among some students. For example, a bright student who wants to focus on the class lecture will often be disturbed by a dull backbencher who is not interested in studying which will lead to disputes. Therefore, the government should consider utilizing funds for other activities rather than paying fees for everyone.",
        "The authorities shall use the money on developing facilities that are beneficial for the institute as well as its students. Instead of spending blindly on someone who is not even sure about their future goals, it would be advisable to spend on the existing infrastructure. For instance, building a high tech laboratory or procuring ultra-modern equipment will contribute to the institution greatly. Consequently, undergraduates will admire these upgrades and study more enthusiastically. Because of this, the level of education will rise and ultimately the reputation of the University.",
        "In conclusion,  government officials should not pay the college fees for anyone who wants to study at the university rather they should consider using money where its value is worth."
