        "Dear Mr Crousen",
        "I am Masoumeh Dehbashi one of your students in the statistics faculty .I am writing this letter to show my high interest in attending your current computer course and if it would be possible to request to enrol without spending required elementary practices.",
        "On one hand, It is essential to claim that I am in my last semester of education so it would be impossible for me to attend the primary duration in the further term in order to gain the pre-circumstances of upper-intermediate level as your services just are provided to current pupils.",
        "Secondly, It is approvable that I always have a grateful passion for computer learning thus during my school years I always have been surfing about this equipment.therefore I claim that definitely could get over the course even if a written exam is necessary for entrance .",
        "Finally,I would profoundly appreciate it if you could make an exemption if it is possible for enlisting me to the list of classes.",
        "I will wait to hear from you about the registration process.",
        "Yours sincerely",
