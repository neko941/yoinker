        "Nowadays, the advancement in technology accords people a chance to keep in touch with others regardless of where they are. Nonetheless, it is thought to cause isolation from others and discourages  them from being with other people. I agree with these statements because ,without the internet, people would not manage to visit others in far fetched places even though it results in people wanting to be alone while using it.",
        "First and foremost, the use of the internet has reduced the burden of physically visiting others in order to keep the lines of communication open. In other words, without the internet, many people would not manage to communicate with their loved ones who reside in distant places that are hard to access by means of the current transportation available. Take, for example, the use of WhatsApp which allows people the convenience to communicate with others without being with them in person as opposed to the challenges of physically visiting them. Moreover, regardless of how bad the road network might be, an individual can still manage to talk to his friends and may use video calls in certain instances. This advantage can only be possible due to the availability of advanced technology.",
        "On the other hand, the internet comes with some undesirable effects that include people not appreciating the value of physically interacting with others.  To put this in perspective, because people tend to be so glued to their devices while using the internet, they lose their emotional need for socializing physically. For instance, with the coming of applications like YouTube, people would rather watch videos via that application alone than be in the company of family or friends. In the long run, their longing for the company of others diminishes and isolation crips in.",
        "By way of conclusion, I reaffirm my statement and agree with the fact that the internet brings enables people to be in constant communication with their families even though it leads to the diminished need for physical interactions and  eventual isolation. It has both  positive and negative influences."
