        "Dear Mr Sam,",
        "This is James, your tenant of flat number 215. I am writing, to draw your attention to the recent repair done to the roof of my apartment. Although, the leak was rectified, unfortunately, after yesterdays heavy rain, my entire room was almost flooded.",
        "To begin with, as you are aware, the roof was already damaged as I moved in, and you promised to sort it out soon, which you did, and I am grateful. However, I believe the job was not done properly, and that is the reason for the leak to pertain even now.",
        "Therefore, I kindly request you, to redo the repair once again, make sure the roof is repaired and waterproof. Moreover, since it seems to rain often these days, it would be helpful if prompt action is taken. Further, I suggest making the payment to the contractors only if the issue is fully resolved.",
        "Thank you for your consideration.",
        "Yours sincerely,",
