Speaking of which, I spent most of the time in the ward assigned to me. Since it's a sharing ward, there is another patient next to me. He has a five-year-old daughter, Emma, who has started calling me aunty and often comes and plays with me. My family have also become very fond of her, and we have already invited them for dinner at our home once her father and me, both recovers.",
        "As mentioned above, I will be discharged next week, mostly on Wednesday. Dr Joe has recommended taking rest for one week and carrying out some physiotherapy exercises which will help me to recover quickly. I will be joining the office as soon as I complete my final checkup post that week.",
        "Thank you again for the warm gestures.",
