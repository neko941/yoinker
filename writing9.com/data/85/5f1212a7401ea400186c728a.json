        "Firstly, I'm a big fan of a few of the items offered in our canteen in terms of their taste and the main item which I personally like is the grilled chicken club sandwich and the taste of the sandwich is top-notch, this is one of the main reason at least twice a week I will be visiting the cafeteria. However, I'm very disappointed with the management for not maintaining hygiene standards.",
        "The main reason for writing this letter is due to yesterday's incident, as I was served with the sandwich which has uncooked chicken. Though it is the first time I have experienced this situation for the past two years. I would suggest there should be an investigation on this.",
        "I would also make a suggestion to higher officials to conduct food inspections on a daily basis to make sure the guidelines are followed. This way we can make sure cooked and fresh food is served to all the students.",
