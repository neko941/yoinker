For instance, Manging director of an institution should extend the post of Senior managers so that job selectors can call interview for the old people.",

Hence, most accustomed cannot get shelter in their last stage and also they did not get any pension scheme.

Thus, taking the taxable money, it will be distributed to the old aged folks who can lead their life in a flexible way.",
        "To sum up, similar jobs between the young and old are declining the jobs every day. The most effective solution is to make a comfortable life leading of accustomed people."
