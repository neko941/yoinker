        "School going children these days have become more obese due to their sedentary lifestyle. While many strongly believe that being active is a healthy practice that should be entertained in schools as an education and sport activity. I agree with this, and in my opinion, educational institutions must promote or adopt essential physical activity and sports sessions at school premises due to their benefits on physical and mental health.",
        "It is appropriate that improving physical activities at learning institutions provide an optimistic impact on children. The first and foremost reason is that deploying individual classes for sports and games would improve children's health by increasing their metabolism. In other words, obese teens will use without any deterrent if they get an opportunity inside the learning campus to boost their metabolism with the help of time provided for playing games. Consequently, they could shape their body with an appealing physical structure that would create self-esteem. For example, one of my friend when studying her grade ten, she was teased by the peers for being overweight, so she decided to join the regular course on tennis, conducted by the school management; therefore she radically reduced her weight and became fitter than before. Hence, student activities at schools could help to become fit and socially impressed.",
        "Moreover, youngsters are gained with their mental power when they perform exercises at the academic campus. Since many teens are exposed to mental stress because of their education and environment, they should rejuvenate their brains daily through exercising sessions at educational institutions. That is to say, exercises not only make the children physically fitter but also mentally fit. Besides, they become potential in their academic performance and score higher grades than before. For instance, I excelled in sport and my studies when I initiated my evening course on sports with my coach after school. Thus, a student can become multipotent if they give attention to sports.",
        "In conclusion, however, many schools do have games period in their schedule; still, it is needed to be more preferential in allowing more time for sports and exercises as they bring up their self-confidence and fitness exponentially."
