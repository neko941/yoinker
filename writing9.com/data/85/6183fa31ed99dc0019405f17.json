We discussed a lot of things and even exchanged our business cards for future business partnerships as well as working together at one of your restaurant chains.",

To be exact, I have noticed that like 10 stores and above branches absolutely needed to have a Human Resource professional to retain the best performer, to recruit the talented employee and to facilitate the training as customer service and upselling skills, etc.",
