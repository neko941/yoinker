However, in the past, I have missed an opportunity to finish the elementary sessions mandatory  for the current training, I would be grateful to know if there is any possibility to consider such candidates.",

I assure you that there wouldn't be any problem because of me in the class, and I will put an extra effort to understand and practice everything taught. I kindly request you to consider my application for the training and give me an exception.",
