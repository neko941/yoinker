        "I hope this letter finds you in great health! With blended feelings of both happiness and sadness, I need to tell you that I will need to postpone my visit to meet you as the much-awaited marriage for my sister has finally been fixed during the second half of the November month. As you know, Indian marriages traditions are given the utmost importance, being her only real sibling- I need to be present during all the occasions and ceremonies.",
        "I am writing this letter with guilt in my heart that our trips further will now be postponed as well. I was hoping the marriage dates were late next year- however, as you know, respecting the conventional customs while deciding engagement dates are paramount in our culture.",
        "To the wandering thoughts, as you have already taken days off from work, how about if you come to India to witness this beautiful Indian wedding and the arrangements it comes with. It will be a nice opportunity as I know you are always excited about Indian weddings.",
        "Let me know your plans, as I am sure we both will accommodate something to find each other's way.",
