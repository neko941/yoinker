        "Dear Mrs Jane,",
        "First of all sorry for the inconvenience caused since last Friday. I felt sorry by hearing your complaint about our noise in this flat. As you know I am a piano player and I joined  one of the famous piano playing clubs in the city. These days we are practising for the piano competition which will conduct by the inter-state piano committee at the end of this month.",
        "Then, we decided to practice for the competition from our home as there are enough space in my location rather than other's place. But, now I understood that  It is  big trouble for the whole flat and it spoils all the member's calm environment.",
        "Finally, we got a decision to practice our session in the conventional hall and we booked that venue by paying  the regional council. Again sorry for  all trouble mistakenly we did and I promised you that this will not happen again.",
        "Thank You.",
        "Regards,",
