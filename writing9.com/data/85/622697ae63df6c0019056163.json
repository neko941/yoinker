        "I am writing this letter in order to draw your attention to the potential negative effects that can occur with the construction of the parking lot.",
        "Let me start by mentioning that I am a citizen of this town and I have been living here since I was three years old. Furthermore, the city park has been part of my life and many people in our community and, thinking about having it replaced by a car park is devastating.",
        "As for why I believe that this action can have a detrimental effect is because the park is used for those who work and live around the park. Although there are some private places, many people in our community cannot afford them and the park is where they go instead.",
        "Finally, I would like to provide some suggestions that could be considered, which is to construct the parking lot in some of the city buildings. Another possibility is to give more public transportation options to the community, so there will be no need for parking places.",
        "I am looking forward to hearing from you on how you are planning to address this issue.",
