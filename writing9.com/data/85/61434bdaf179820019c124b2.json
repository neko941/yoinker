        "In recent years, the trend of online shopping is significantly rising. While the popular opinion is that electronic commerce will be replacing in-store practice. It is my firm belief that no matter the growth in e-commerce it will never replace shops in towns and cities. There are two primary reasons for this.",
        "To begin with, although buying clothes on the internet is convenient, it can never compete with the shopping experience that a showroom offers. There is also the fact that the orders placed on the internet can always lead to an error in the size and actual colour because you are not seeing the product first hand. For instance, customers look for fitting when they buy t-shirts and pants and if the fit is not right they can always buy the correct size in the store. Therefore, orders placed on platforms such as amazon can never replace the showroom experience.",
        "Furthermore, purchasing items such as electronic devices on the internet does not warrant the safety of the product while being delivered. Additionally, it is a hassle to exchange the product when it is bought online as there are many processes to be followed. For instance, when a computer is purchased online the delivery is usually carried out by a third party who is not responsible for the condition in which it reaches the buyer. However, if the machine is paid for at a store, you have a certain level of human interaction which will instil trust and you can always reach out to them for assistance. For these reasons, electronic commerce can never replace human trade.",
        "By way of conclusion, I once again reaffirm my position that no matter the increase of sales online, it can never take the place of the experience provided in showrooms and shops that will continue to exist in towns and cities."
