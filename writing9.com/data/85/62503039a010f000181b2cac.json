        "Educational institutions vary in mode of operation. While some schools think it is more effective for students to have vast knowledge in a range of courses, others believe it is better to focus on limited subjects. This essay will provide the advantages of both systems of education and provide which is best.",
        "It is often said that \"Jack of all trades, master of none\". This implies that when a person focuses on too many activities at any given period of time, there's a lesser possibility of becoming an expert in any of such. For this reason, a major advantage of learning a specific subject is that those students easily become professionals in that field. For example, a general practitioner cannot function as an eye specialist or a nephrologist because he has no in-depth knowledge in those areas of study.",
        "In contrast, being knowledgeable in different areas of study can be useful in life as it helps to broaden the horizon of individuals in such learning environments. Additionally, studying a wide range of topics helps students choose future career paths according to their interests. For instance, when school children are taken on field trips, it provides the opportunity to develop their minds.",
        "In conclusion, I believe both systems of learning are beneficial as they have their own time and place for usage. A specialist is who he is because he chose to focus on a particular subject while having an idea of any difficulty presented in life makes one stand out."
