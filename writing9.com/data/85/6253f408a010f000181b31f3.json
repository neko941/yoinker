        "There is no doubt that these days the crime rate is rapidly increasing among young people. The question is, what are the reasons behind those violent crimes? Is it the lacking of emotional and social learning from parents and teachers?. In this essay, I am going to discuss this option and draw my own conclusion.",
        "In terms of causes, the psychologists claim that the reason is that nowadays children are not receiving  suitable social and emotional support from both home and school. The main reason given to support this claim is that today the majority of families are comprised of working husbands, which means they spent half their day outside the house, leaving their children without guidance. To illustrate, their absence has a negative impact on their kid's life. In other words, provide them with much passive freedom. Hence, they will learn from the streets rather than from their parents. Teenagers who live in this environment tend to commit a crime, due to the absence of good parenting.",
        "Moreover. As the recent numbers show an elevation in the violent criminal behaviour among youngsters under 18 years old. Schools consider another source as the study claimed. This is because teachers play a vital role in their student`s social circle. In other words, nowadays schools follow old teaching methods, that are bare of emotions, just learning orders while they need preparation for the real world.",
        "In conclusion, although the fact that parents and tutors are the main reason for this defect, it could be there other causes for those criminal motives. I believe that both home and school share a solid part of this phenomenon."
