        "This will be my son's 5th birthday party. It will take place in the Children Activity Centre, which is situated opposite the Opera and Ballet Theatre, in the city centre. The party will start at 11 am. This centre provides some fun activities for children and their parents, which include puppet performances and a magic show. In addition, during all time three clowns will  amuse guests and play with children. Cake, pizza, fruits and light refreshments will be offered for participants. Furthermore, I have arranged  the cowboy's show, which will begin at the noon.",
