        "Hi, hope you are in the best of  health and spirits and writing this piece of paper to share my experience at your apartment during my trip to Shimla .",
        "As you know , since my childhood I am fond of travelling in hilly areas so vacations spent in Shimla filled my heart with extreme joy. It was pleasant to see the snowfall along with beautiful scenic views. I participated in adventures activities and also clicked ample photographs to capture  unforgettable memories. luckily I chose the winter season for the visit. Since tourists prefer it at this time we can enjoy it  a lot due to the pleasant weather and crowd.",
        "I feel grateful to you for letting me  stay at your home. I am sure you would have definitely gone with me if your official tour did not conflict with my visit . Anyhow, I kept your home spick and span in your absence . while going outside I always confirmed to lock it properly as it was like my own home .",
        "Pay my regards to my uncle and aunt and give my shower of love to your daughter.",
