        "Dear Manager,",
        "I am writing this letter as we learnt about the plan of  new airport construction in our locality by  today's newspaper which is quite surprising to all of us.",
        "As you know, the location you have selected is the best for agriculture and farming industries despite the huge population and mesmerizing waterfalls throughout the place. Therefore, If you guys still going ahead with the same plan and this may be an incalculable impact and damage to our food processing system  finally most of the people will be in empty hands without any work and zero pay as well which is not a good sign to society.",
        "Having said that, we would like to suggest the different locations which are in close proximity to the city. In addition, this would enable to improve the transportation and infrastructure services to countryside areas. Last but not the least, the rural areas will be developed as there will be an international market and high-rise hotels in the middle of the village.",
        "I look forward to seeing the changes to the plan and I am sure that this will make happen without further issues.",
        "Best regards,",
