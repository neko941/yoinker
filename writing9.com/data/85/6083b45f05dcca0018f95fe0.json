        "I have been visiting this library for the past 5 years and have used a variety of great services including the printers, projectors and books available. However, using the libraries sitting lounge is not a pleasant experience. The chairs themselves are quite uncomfortable and make a squeaking noise when sitting on them. Another issue is with some of the roof lights installed. The building still uses the old CFL bulbs which are expensive and less bright.",
        "Chairs in the library should be swapped for wooden sturdy wooden benches with back support. This eliminates the plastic chairs and introduces an eco-friendly alternative in the common reading area. Installing LEDs instead of the old CFL bulbs can not only save electricity but also are more environmentally friendly.",
