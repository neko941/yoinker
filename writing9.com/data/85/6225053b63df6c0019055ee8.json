        "It is true that many centres of the cities have become overpopulated all around the globe. There are several reasons for this issue which can be tackled mostly by governments.",
        "There are three main causes for this overcrowding in the urban centres. Firstly, many important buildings such as offices, hospitals, and universities are located in these areas which mean many people should come to the city centres each day even if they do not live there. Moreover, most of the entertainment facilities are located here as well. Secondly, commuting to other places of the city from the centre would be much easier, especially in the case of using the public transportation system. For example, if a person who lives in the centre wanted to go shopping, he or she could easily walk there or take a bus, otherwise, using a private car would be more convenient. Finally, there is a chance that renting price in the crowded city centre may be lesser than in the suburb.",
        "However, there are remedies for the above-mentioned reasons. Governments should expand the routes for buses and trains that help people to commute to the centre. Another solution would be establishing the buildings such as offices and universities in a vaster area. This may deter some people have a daily commute to the urban centres. At last, governments could control the rent prices by funding new housing or legislation for the prices.",
        "In conclusion, many city centres have faced overpopulation all around the world but this issue could be solved by taking several steps."
