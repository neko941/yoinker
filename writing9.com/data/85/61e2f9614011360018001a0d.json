        "My name is Jay, and I have been a loyal customer for ten years.Although, I like your store, I am writing to you to complain about the poor performance of the store's customer service. Yesterday, I went to your store at 2:00 P.M. to return an item back. I waited almost two hours before I was able to speak with the customer service representative.",
        "Let me describe the whole situation. After waiting for two hours and when it was my turn to return my item, the scanner stopped scanning, and the system glitched. The client assistance man asked me to wait again. Furthermore, it took him an extra hour to fix the scanner. Consequently, I am frustrated from this bad experience so much that I decided to file a complaint because none of them even expressed sorry for my delay.",
        "Finally, I would kindly suggest hiring one more representative to prevent this issue from happening in the future, and to decrease the load on the current client assistance person. I hope you will consider this solution favourably.",
