        "The world has changed more significantly than ever before. Some people believe that we are facing too many options these days. In my opinion, I completely with this point of view. This essay will discuss the main reasons why people have too many choices nowadays.",
        "It is true that people have a wider range of choices with advanced technology. For example, students tend to have more choices on their study, like enrolling various kinds of courses on the internet, or studying abroad, while they could only study in their own countries in the past. In addition, they could gain more study resources on the internet.  As a result, it is no doubt that people could obtain benefits from a wide range of options.",
        "On the other hand, people are confusing about what they really need. There is too much information on the internet, which leads to a result that people tend to hesitate to make a decision. For instance, when a consumer wants to purchase something and is searching on the online shopping platform, a huge number of goods will be presented. People tend to spend more time on choosing and comparing the goods they want to buy. Therefore, it is difficult for people to make a decision among all these options.",
        "In conclusion, the world is changing all the time these days. Some people think that we tend to have too many choices in this fast-paced age. This essay discussed the reasons why people have too many opportunities to make a choice. In my view, people should take advantage of the wide varieties of choices and try to be aware of what they really want."
