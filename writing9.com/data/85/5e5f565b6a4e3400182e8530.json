        "Dear Sir / Madam",
        "I am writing in connection with my recent stay at the Four Seasons in London, England. Unfortunately, due to a malfunctioning heater in my room, I spent three miserable nights at your hotel from April 26 to 29, 2010.",
        "When I arrived in London, there was an unexpected snowstorm. I understand it does not usually snow in April; however, when I got to my place, there was no heat. After complaining, a technician was sent up, who informed me they had to install a new heating unit. When I asked to be moved to another place, I was told the hotel was completely booked. Unfortunately, each night after work I returned to discover the problem had not been rectified. Eventually, I spent three horribly uncomfortable nights, wearing my coat to bed, wearing socks around the place and ending up with a bad cold of the unheated room. I had no time to complain as I had to catch a flight home right after my conference.",
        "I am shocked by this terrible service. This is not what anyone expects for $400 a night! To compensate me for this tremendous inconvenience, I ask that you refund my money right away and offer me a free, more comfortable stay in one of your finer suites in the future. If not, I am prepared to take my complaint to a higher authority.",
        "I look forward to hearing from you at the earliest,",
        "Yours faithfully,",
