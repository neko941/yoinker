        "It is often argued that couples are investing more and more in extravagant and huge marriage ceremonies. The paragraphs below will discuss this theory explaining why the influence of social platforms and the eagerness to live have cooperated for this phenomenon and why it is not an advantageous progress.",
        "To begin with, there is a myriad of motives to justify why weddings are becoming super events. One of which is due to the advent of social media. Since the development of some platforms, like Instagram and Facebook, people started an idea that posting about extortionate and gigantic celebrations and moments is normal, even if it is not their reality. Therefore, it is just another way to maintain their status quo. Another justification is that people are celebrating life more than ever. To illustrate, after the COVID-19 pandemic, the rate of marriages has risen compared to before this period.",
        "However, following this trend is not an interesting decision. First of all, it is a considerable investment for one night only that could be sectioned in others expenses. For instance, every bride and groom mostly desire to live together, constitute a family and travel, thus, they must value frugality. Secondly, the effort to make it happen may not be worth the stress. For example, my sister has not enjoyed her wedding because she spend most of it worried if the guests were being served or if the band was going to arrive on time, on a day that she should have been the person to enjoy the most.",
        "To conclude, recently, weddings have become bigger and more expensive due to the use of social networks to post trivia and due to the fear of maybe not having these experiences at another time. Moreover, this development is not worth it, as the expenses can hamper reaching other goals and stress out the people who must be pleased."
