        "I am writing this email to express  my concern and bring it to your notice regarding your pet noise at night times. I thought of it playing as I heard the barking for a minute but over  time I got to know that it is barking daily at night time. Therefore, I am unable to go to bed and cannot have a nice sleep for a week.",
        "As you know, I am working a full-time job during the day the time , which includes a lot of physical activities and monitoring. If I do not have a nice sleep and it may get  impact  my job. Moreover, I may get sick due to a lack of proper sleep. I hope you might have experienced if you do not have nice sleep at night time.",
        "As you heard my pain story hence, It would be good if could keep some training classes for your pet. Furthermore, you may also be required to have some assessments for your pet. Last but not least, if this is not going to stop and you may be required to hand over your per to local pet training centres. Hope we will not come into this situation.",
        "I look forward to hearing a response to your cooperative measures.",
