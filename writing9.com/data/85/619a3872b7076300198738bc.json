Furthermore, I notice that even your guests are not the same ones, but appears to be totally random people coming in and out of our building, as I do not feel safe anymore, even in my own house. Last night, I even saw someone peeing in my doorway!",
        "Therefore, I would like you to diminish the volume of your box music so as to keep it hearable only in your apartment and do not bother the other neighbours and me anymore. Moreover, I am going to ask you to request your guests to show their identification documents before they get in our place so that we can feel safer knowing who has been in our gated community.",
        "I would appreciate your immediate attention to this matter. I look forward to receiving your activity response.",
