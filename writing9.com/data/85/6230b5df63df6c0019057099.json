        "The number of crimes has increased significantly annually, and the sanction decision should be well managed. Overall, the policy regarding these regulations must be assessed and evaluated to prevent an increasing percentage of crime. Personally, I agree that the circumstances of people's crimes and the reason for doing those should be considered to take action how long they will get punished.",
        "Some people say that fixed punishment for each type of breach has to be implemented. If it is dangerous for the community and has an enormous impact on society, it should be organized well, for instance, some narcotics sellers and corruptors disrupt national stability, such as economic and health state. They should be punished assertively, also it becomes the best way to overcome people trying to do violation activity. Furthermore, an assertive law must be implemented for those whose cases are related to the primary cause of crime.",
        "On the other hand, a community that believes that the circumstances of each person's case and the motivation for doing misconduct agree to consider these reasons when deciding on the punishment because every violation is divided into some levels. In addition, the sanction could rely on each case, the victims and a whole impact for the future. For example in the case of robbery. A group of robbers could be consist of a leader and members. Moreover, they have different tasks for each member.",
        "In conclusion, there should be a critical assessment regarding the policy of making sanctions.  Although it is such an unforeseen and complex issue, it will impact the number of inappropriate behaviour in our country. It must be concerned about the effect of the breach around us, particularly for the next generation. Subsequently, a fair punishment that would be given must look at all causes and effects aspects of the execution of the crime."
