        "People have different views about whether or not we have the right to keep animals in zoos. While some people agree with the idea of having zoos, I believe that this would be cruel to wild animals.",
        "The first group may have two main reasons for having zoos. Firstly, it would be better for children to visit these creatures in person. They have been learnt about animals in schools but it would not be as effective as seeing them alive. It also may help them to become more passionate about other creatures. For example, perhaps many zoologists were taken to these places a lot during their childhood which has affected their curiosity. Secondly, some species are endangered enough that need to be kept in a safe place to live and breed.",
        "On the other hand, I agree with the argument against this idea. In my opinion, any kind of creature should not be kept in a cage. Wild animals need to be as much free as humans and live on their own, otherwise, they may get depression. Keeping them in zoos also could affect the food chain and the consequences would not be favourable. For instance, the lack of some predators may result in the overpopulation of some species such as foxes that would eat crops. Another reason against zoos is that some managers and zookeepers would be harsh on these creatures and injure them.",
        "In conclusion, although there are convincing reasons to keep wild animals in zoos, I believe that they should be free to leave and hatch or die."
