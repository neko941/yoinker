        "However, there are a few things which make the whole experience bitter. For example, the lighting is not great in some seats, especially in the corners. In addition, Sometimes books are misplaced and take time to find them.",
        "I would like to make some suggestions for improvements. Firstly, we can arrange more light in the corners so that it would not be difficult for readers to read. Besides, we can automate the library system so that when a user returns the book,  we can put it back in the right place.",
        "I am looking forward to hearing from you and hoping that the above suggestions will contribute to the betterment of the library.",
