        "My name is Zannatul Firdaus, I am an employee of your office. I live in Khilgaon. Today I am writing this letter to inform you that, I am not happy with the decision you made that our cafeteria will be closed.",
        "To embark with, people do not eat at the cafeteria because it is not spic and span. In addition, the place is very conservative as a result employees feel suffocated in that area. Moreover, the price of coffee and snacks were enhanced from last month, but our salary stay unchanged.",
        "Furthermore, though it has some issues I think it should not close down as some stuff are totally dependent on it. Similarly, the waiters and the salesperson will lose their job and so on.",
        "I think you should take some measures, such as, make sure that place should be neat and clean and the food price should deteriorate. Last but not the least, the microwave oven should be repaired.",
        "I hope you will understand the situation and you will change your decision.",
