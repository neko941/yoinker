        "It has been pointed out that several nations have introduced laws and legislation to restrict local workers\u2019 working hours. Personally, I opine that the authorities have recognized the drawbacks of work overtime is the reason for this circumstance, and this is a positive trend as it can bring countless benefits to companies.",
        "First of all, the reason why governments passed the laws related to working hours is that they have acknowledged the disadvantages of working for long hours. If employees always work beyond predetermined hours, they are less likely to have leisure time to do exercise and have enough time to sleep, which harms workers\u2019 physical health. For instance, an officer of the Chinese government states that they carried out a lot of research and collected data in terms of the health situation of professionals such as lawyers and doctors. A massive percentage of evidence shows that most of them are suffering from health issues such as depression or insomnia, which promotes local departments to introduce laws to ban working overtime .",
        "Furthermore, limiting operating hours has economic benefits to organizations. This is because staff have a moderate proportion of time to rest and relax, so they no longer take several leaves sick and have a high level of enthusiasm and concentration towards their tasks, thus making companies more productive and profitable. For example, a vast majority of accounting firms in Australia obey the laws and regulate their employees to work 8 hours per day. The managers of those firms state that after conducting this regulation, they realized their employees are full of energy to fulfil their daily tasks with a higher quality, which increases firms\u2019 profitability and productivity.",
        "In conclusion, although people may vary in their opinion about the cause of the restriction of working hours and the effects of this situation, I am of the opinion that political leaders have acknowledged the seriousness of staying back is the reason for it, and this positive development brings advantages to corporations."
