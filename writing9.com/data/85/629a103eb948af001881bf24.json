        "The desire to gain recognition is a diachronic matter in humans' life. The issue is controversial with one side maintaining that being popular has a positive impact on one's life, while opponents mention that being well-known can be totally harmful. Personally, I support the latter approach, although both attitudes are discussed in this essay.",
        "On the one hand, nobody can deny that famous people can afford a prestigious lifestyle. More particular,  popularity  plays a critical role in someone's income increases. Since the audience is interested in a specific person, this person becomes a role model and every industry, such as movies, can export financially one's star quality. As a consequence, the celebrity person can sign beneficial contracts and gain an enormous amount of money. For example, Bratt Pitt signed a contract with no payment requirements for his very first movie, and now  his typical earnings raise by 3.000.000 dollars per movie.",
        "On the other hand, being a celebrity can be seen as a loss of privacy. Indeed, persons, who are recognised by the public, have always all eyes on them.  Hence,  they cannot relax and enjoy their personal moments, since a journalist or fan could take a photo of them at an appropriate moment. This can be clearly indicated by the case of Princess Diana, who in order to protect her affair and avoid the paparazzi , urged her driver to this fatal accident.",
        "In conclusion, although being distinctive and well known  can provide  someone with  a sense of speciality, I insist on the superiority of having a calm personal life and sharing private moments with beloved persons without having anyone's annoyance. Therefore, people should be focused on real life's values, without  caring for publicity's vanity."
