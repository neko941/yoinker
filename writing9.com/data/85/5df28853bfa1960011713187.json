I am not feeling well either due to blister all over my body and the running temperature. My physician suggested taking one more week of bed rest to recover completely. I can submit a medical certificate highlighting my current state of health from my doctor if required.",

I am hoping that this will not affect our relationship. Requesting you to kindly postpone my date of joining to November 30th. Also, please do let me know if I will need to submit any other form of proof.",
