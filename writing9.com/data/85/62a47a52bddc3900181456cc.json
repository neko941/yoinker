        "Dear Sir",
        "Hope this letter finds you well. I am Simhachalam Gouroju, I am writing this letter to inform you about the article published regarding Nagapur city in the last week's magazine. I was born and brought there in the same place, and I was there until my schooling. Therefore, I know each corner of the city and as well as its complete history.",
        "It was mentioned that the old places in the same town, would be a great location to visit during the rainy season, as there are many historical constructions such as temples, 90 feet tall Iron pillars, and many others. In the contrast, the place would be completely filled with rainwater during the same time as the place is in the lower part of the city and it will become difficult for the visitors to have any chance to explore those beautifully constructed buildings. Moreover, the majority of the shopping malls will be closed due to the highly accumulated water around the streets.",
        "Since, it might a huge inconvenience for the people who are planning to come to my town, based on the content being published in your newspaper, I request you to correct it immediately and acknowledge the same. Additionally, I want to suggest you  be more vigilant before publishing such an article because those sorts of things will have a great impact on many readers.",
