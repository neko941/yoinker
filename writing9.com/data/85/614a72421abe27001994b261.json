        "Currently, many people are wondering how they can learn to spend money effectively. In my opinion, it is possible to achieve that by gaining relevant knowledge from various sources and following the example of people who have succeeded in financial management.",
        "First and foremost, thanks to advanced technologies, society can find a lot of useful materials about the efficient use of capital. Moreover, since this topic is quite popular, there are various online and offline courses, which are available to anyone. For example, I read an electronic book \"The Richest Man in Babylon\" by George Clayson. There, the author talks about the basic rules of using and accumulating funds as simply and clearly as possible. Using the advice, which is provided in the book, I was able to successfully manage my finances and save money.",
        "Besides, another possible way to improve skills of asset controlling may be using the experience of those who are well versed in it. This is justified by the fact that a rewarding experience can not only contain many tips for learning  but also definitely become a reliable real model in the investment world. A good illustration of this is American entrepreneur Warren Buffett, who is one of the most famous investors in the world. Also, a good example would be Robert Kiyosaki, who has written many bestsellers on financial independence and safe investment rules.",
        "In conclusion, the ability to spend money wisely is one of the fundamental aspects of adulthood. Therefore, I think that such things as financial literacy and using the experience of successful entrepreneurs can help people to manage their money more effectively."
