        "I am writing this letter about the computer course which interests me as I am having a keen interest in such sort of courses related to computers, however, at the time of university, there was no specific subject I had. Additionally, as per the requirements I have completed an elementary course.",
        "Firstly, I want to share that I am staying alone from the family and dealing with all the financial expenses alone so I have been working an accounting firm which helps me to deal with my monthly expenses like rent, food, and so on. So, this work is quite essential for me to deal with all the things.",
        "Lastly, my work timings are 9 am to 6 pm, if possible can I take the training of the course in such particular timings. In fact, it would be great if I can take the classes between 6:30 pm to 9 pm because that will not hamper my job hours, and in that way, I will be a part of this.",
        "I hope to hear a positive response from your end.",
