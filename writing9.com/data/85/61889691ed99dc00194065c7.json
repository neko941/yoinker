        "There is no doubt to say that people, in recent years, have witnessed  the prevalence of Internet-based communication, shopping, and transaction activities. In my opinion, This development has shown both\u00a0positive and negative\u00a0aspects equally.",
        "On the one hand, unrestricted access to the Internet has brought\u00a0great benefits to the public for its convenience and comfort. Firstly, telecommunication tools including email, instant messaging or social networks facilitate people's interaction, bringing them closer together. For example, if an international student wants to contact his family, it will be convenient to deliver a message only at a click regardless of geographical barriers. Secondly, this improvement of technology allows shoppers can seek out items or services of the finest quality without engaging lengthy commutes. As a result, this might prevent them from bad conditions, such as traffic congestion, torrential rain while they are moving.",
        "On the other hand, certain detriments can be associated with excessive Internet use. This is because the over-reliance on virtual communication is the primary\u00a0cause of the decline in social skills which are crucial for real-life contact. To clarify this point, there is a heavy number of social network users tend to feel awkward while trying to strike up conversations with strangers. Thus, these people would gradually become more socially alienated and suffer from a great sense of solitude. Furthermore,\u00a0This trend can be detrimental to persons' physical\u00a0and mental health. If humans were overindulgent in the online world, it undoubtedly triggers a sedentary lifestyle, which consequently leads to some health-related problems such as obesity or sleep deprivation.",
        "In conclusion,\u00a0although the online network contributes several benefits, I think negative impacts on lifestyle and health should be taken into account for uncontrolled online use for shopping, working and communication purposes."
