        "I am writing this letter to express dissatisfaction with the film I watched yesterday in your cinema theatre.",
        "Last night, I visited the cinema complex to watch with my wife and children ,movie named \"Tarzan\". After a few minutes ,start we realize that this movie is in Tamil .We checked your online application, and we asked again at the ticket booth in order to double-confirm that the language is Hindi.  . Moreover, the hall was messy and unclean. There was popcorn scattered all over the seats from the previous batch who watched the movie.",
        "In fact, I was furious about the situation because we didn't understand any words and were forced to read them from the subtitles. Another reason that made our night worst was the supervisor who refused to change the movie ignoring this huge mistake. Therefore, I demand a complete refund for all the tickets and beverages paid for on this day.",
        "Thank you for your consideration and Looking for positive feedback from you.",
        "Yours sincerely",
