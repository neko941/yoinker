        "It is a belief in society that in this era we have numerous choices. I completely agree with this statement, because the advancement of technology and liberty to choose has contributed to a wide range of options in every area.",
        "Firstly. In this modern age, technology in every field is advancing day-by-day which has resulted in a plethora of options. Whichever goal an individual is willing to accomplish, he has numerous ways to perform it. For example, if we talk about the field of education, in the previous period the students did not have many alternatives to choose for their area or institute of study, but nowadays they can select at their comfort about what, when, and where to study. Moreover, single adults can choose their partner at an ease through various social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram etc. In addition to that, an applicant can apply to various firms of his choice with just a click of a button.",
        "Secondly, In the contemporary world, people have the freedom to choose, we live in a democratic society where society choose their leaders also children have a choice to select their career, whereas ,in the previous age, communities were not allowed to choose their ruler and children had to work in the profession of their family. Lastly, there are few drawbacks of alternatives, such as families living in rural areas are willing to migrate to urban areas because of more amenities and technology but as the population in the city is increasing steadily and the area of living is decreasing, the poor population is not left with any choice than to pay more to migrate.",
        "To conclude, it is undoubtedly true that in recent times society has numerous alternatives. However, there might be drawbacks of it but the benefits of choices do not outweigh the disadvantages of it."
