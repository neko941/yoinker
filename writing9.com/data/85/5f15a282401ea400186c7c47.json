        "Rewarding the students who show their good perform in the school is better than punishing them. In my opinion, I totally agree with this statement which will be discussed with deep reasons before the rational conclusion below.",
        "There are several reasons why I admit that giving appreciation is better than punishment in the school. First and foremost, the teacher no need to educate them by force through a kind of sanctions. Due to the most human, especially the students who prefer to get good things instead of bad things. For instance, they would be excited to receive rewards, and trying to be more discipline in the next time. Otherwise, if  they got punished, they would hate to go to school and escape from being attending at a school. Moreover, the recognition from their teacher could motivate them to do more and more better performance as a learner at school. Also, this would affect to the improvement of the student's grade that could be higher than their previous grade.",
        "However, punishing the children would influence to their behaviour and future lives. Firstly, later, they could not be confident to do anything at a school than former. They would be embarrassed at showing their creativeness as the instance, since, they afraid to do something wrong and get punished as before. Furthermore, this could automatically lead to their social problem. By means that this kind of students would not be motivated to have social skill in the future, including getting a job.",
        "By way of conclusion, I restate that reward is better than punished for children, which will improve their many performances and grades at the school. While punishing could lead them to be less confident and less social skill."
