        "The role of robots in our lives will be increased in the future. Robots will be utilized to replace human beings in the upcoming years and this will be a negative development as it increases unemployment.",
        "Robots are going to be used in various industries such as manufacturing and medical sector to replace humans. That is to say that, they can perform the assigned work with high accuracy and in less time when compared to people. The ultimate corollary of this is they will be replacing men and women at work, particularly in areas which involve high risk. For instance, a recent article published in TimesNow newspaper, which is the largest circulated daily newspaper in India and also renowned for its accuracy and fairness, stated that 40% of the workforce in Nike company will be replaced with humanoid robots by the end of 2022.",
        "This replacement of working people by robots is a negative development as it increases the unemployment percentage. In other words, employees lose their jobs as robots are cheap and can work continuously, without rest, unlike humans and this increases the production of the company. The outcome of this is companies preferring robots to humans which eventually increases the unemployment rate. For example, unemployed people in the USA were increased by 5% in the year 2018 after the government approved the use of robots in their manufacturing industry.",
        "In conclusion, robots will be used to replace human workers in the future and this will create a negative impact on people by taking away their jobs."
