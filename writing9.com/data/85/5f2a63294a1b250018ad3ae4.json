        "It is undeniable that famous sports players gain a lot more income than those engaged in important occupations. Some people believe it is fair whilst other think this can barely be justified. This essay will discuss both views, then present my personal opinion.",
        "Successful sports players ear a lot for a reason. They undergo strenuous training for many years and it is very demanding physically and mentally. Their amazing performance at sports professional are only possible with great diligence and endurance. Also, they cannot play sports for all their lifetime like people in other professions. Most sports require much energy and stamina and this reduces their lifetime as sports players from 10 to 20 years, whereas most people in other occupations work for about 40 years or longer. This means they should be able to earn money to support their life after retirement. Thus, the great deal of they receive is well justified.",
        "On the other hand, people criticise that successful sports professionals earn too much and it is unfair to people who work in other important occupations such as nurses, teachers, soldiers and scientists. For instance, Teachers devote their lives to education and prepare children to be leaders and innovators of the next generation. Likewise, Soldiers are committed to the nation`s peace and citizens` safety and risk their own lives to defend the country. However, in reality, teachers and soldiers are often underpaid for what they do for society as a whole. It seems very apparent that they contribute to our society more than sports players who earn in comparable amounts of money. Therefore it is unfair to people working in important professions earn much less than successful sports player and I strongly agree with this idea.",
        "In conclusion, Although it requires great efforts to be successful sports players, they should not be paid more than the justifiable amount. It is unreasonable for others in important occupations to be paid less for them than what they do for the society."
