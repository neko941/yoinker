In fact, I booked a hotel Cera Classic for a small celebration in which there will be a musical night along with dinner. Basically, I can manage the dinner arrangements because I have decided to include Indian and Spanish food items in it.",

Since you have had a prowess in writing songs and singing, I want you to write a special song for us and make this party unique with your melodious voice. I am happy to hear if you have any addition to my plans. I hope you will certainly accept my invitation and be there on time.",
