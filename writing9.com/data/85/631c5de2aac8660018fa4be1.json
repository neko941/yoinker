I explained this at the time of joining and I was promised that it will be considered while taking classes, however, The classes are being thought at the expert level which is very tough for me to get  up to speed. In addition to that, I was not explained well in case of any doubts asked. Also, the explanation was not in a detailed fashion.",
        "It would be so helpful if they could provide me with some assistance in answering my queries and move me to a class where most students are non-native speakers. This would help me in achieving more scores and understanding the language in depth.",
