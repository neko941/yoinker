        "Let me explain in detail. Nowadays the internet is giving me hard time because multiple fluctuations are occurring throughout the day along will poor speed. Although I have opted for a 100 MBPS plan, I never received more than 50 MBPS. Owing to this poor speed I am not able to take business calls and this is further affecting my work as well as reputation in front of my seniors.",
        "I have restarted my WiFi router a myriad of times, and already lodged a formal complaint but it has been pending unattended for the last 2 days. That is the reason, I would request you to please assign an engineer to solve this problem on a priority basis, and arrange a home visit to check the settings of the main connection.",
        "As I have already mentioned that the internet speed for which I paid is extremely poor; therefore, I am entitled to a 50% reduction in the bill amount. It would be highly appreciable if you can adjust the remaining 50% in my next month's bill amount.",
        "I will be looking forward to your prompt action on this.",
        "Yours faithfully,",
