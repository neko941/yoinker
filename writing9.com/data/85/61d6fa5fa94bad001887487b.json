        "It is argued among parents that young adults should be taught about the value of money. I, personally, believe there are various reasons that we have to teach them such a thing and also a number of methods that assist us to teach children this issue.",
        "In my opinion, teaching the value of money is essential due to some causes. By learning this skill, adolescents may learn how to save their money for the future rather than wasting it on unimportant things in the present. In other words, During one's life, the person may face various problems that can be solved only by money. In this case, an individual who saved money beforehand can deal with the issue better than others. For instance, a person who spent most of his money for not imperative things such as different items of clothing like shoes, pants and shirts, may encounter a wide range of difficulties in his life such as paying bills, renting a house or purchasing some gas. These problems can have more influence on people's lives than having brand expensive shoes or clothes. As a result, being aware of how to spend money can be vitally important.",
        "However, I believe there are some approaches that we can take to help young adults to learn the value of  money. Firstly, young members of society can take in this skill by their parents in different ways before going to school. A game, as an example, is an effective method to convey  money-saving skills from parents to their children. Secondly, children can possess this opportunity to learn the value of money in schools via a curriculum about financial issues. Finally, technology can provide various methods for us to teach our teenagers about the importance of money.",
        "In conclusion, from my point of view, learning the importance of money is crucial because of some personal and societal reasons and this goal would be achieved by using different methods."
