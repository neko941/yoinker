        "There is a common impression that smartphones are destroying social interaction in the current time. I fully agree with this statement and this essay will explain further with reasons.",
        "Firstly, the benefit of social communication can be experienced only by physical presence and smartphones encourage people to connect virtually. There is a sense of satisfaction by greeting  a human being with a handshake and these devices are killing those emotions. For example, nowadays, childhood friends are preferring to send a smiley icon over their mobile devices rather than meeting each other physically. Thus, this culture of communication has made those friends move away from each other emotionally as they tend to forget each other faces over time. So, in this way smartphone applications have created distance even between close friends.",
        "Secondly, Social communication involves greeting people who are real and actually living in  society but smartphones have allowed a single person to create multiple fake profiles and interact with others using a fake identity. While this happens rarely in the real world, it occurs frequently in virtual social networks with the use of smartphones. For instance, a watchman can deceive others by stating that he is a businessman and can convince them to give him a huge amount of money in the form of a loan using a fake profile in a smartphone. If he has to do the same cheating in the real world, then he would have live in an expensive flat and drive a costly car. In other words, he has to actually become a rich person and ask for loan in order to make others believe that he is making a genuine request. However, this is not the case in the virtual world, where he can download fake photos of buildings and cars to show others that he owns them. Hence, smartphones are providing a way to cheat in interactions and this would diminish the value of genuine interactions that were carried out with honesty over centuries.",
        "To conclude, social interaction has vastly lost its value due to the use of smartphones in the current time. Therefore, it is clear that this statement is true as the true identity of the participant can be hidden in such interactions."
