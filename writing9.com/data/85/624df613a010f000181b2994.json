I signed a contract that included a refundable deposit that was requested to cover possible damages to the property. After a deep inspection the day I left, you could observe the apartment was in  immaculate condition. Therefore, you should give me the entire deposit I made back as per our agreement.",
        "This is the second time I am writing to you to express my concern about this matter.  I have already informed my lawyer about the details of the contract, and he is willing to take legal action if you do not provide us with an immediate response.",
