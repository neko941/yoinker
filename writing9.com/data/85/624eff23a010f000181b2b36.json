        "Secondly, nowadays due to changes in our lifestyle and all  the people do not have enough exercise developing sports and sports central could provide better conditions for healthcare .",
        "thirdly, because  our region has cold weather we need  indoor space for sport. So if you do not find a good place to replace of current fitness centre All people are deprived of having a stadium in winter",
        "I am forwarding to get the answer from you. I wish you would review your decision.",
