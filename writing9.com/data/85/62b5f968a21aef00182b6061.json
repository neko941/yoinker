        "Dear Editor of Amazing Post,",
        "Hope this letter finds you well. I am writing this letter to propose a couple of suggestions for the cafeteria located at the heart of our campus.",
        "I must say I really enjoy having dinner at the cafeteria because of its tranquil atmosphere and service. It has become a symbol of our school given it is one of the old and most famous restaurants in our community. Its delicious food combined with impeccable service left me with a strong impression.",
        "However,\u00a0along with its growing popularity, there is a growing number of customers coming to the restaurants, undermining the dining experience. People are constrained to small spaces for activity and packed like sardines.  The ventilation system, at the same time, does not work well, so people can hardly breathe fresh air.",
        "I would like to take such a chance and give some advice to make the restaurant even more amazing. Apparently, since the small cafeteria can't accommodate so many visitors at the moment, it is necessary to expand its space.  Preferably, the cafeteria should fix the ventilation system and improve its air quality.",
        "These are just a number of suggestions from me as a faithful customer of school cafeteria. I am looking forward to the improvement of it.",
        "Kindly regards",
