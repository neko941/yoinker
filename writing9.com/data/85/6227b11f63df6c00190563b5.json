Therefore, they are suffering lots of health issues like cancer, heart problem and so on. Stopping cooking at homemade their life easy but detrimental.",
        "On the other hand, taking physical exercises and yoga can solve this problem. For example, one research group in India found that in this era people are lazier than in the past decads.They are reluctant to walk and do exercises in their daily life so they face different problems like obesity. If they do exercises and yoga daily they will get rid of this problem because yoga and exercises keep our body fit, alert our mind, enhance our blood circulation and reduce our fat. So these are very crucial to mitigate the problem that we face for leading an unhealthy life.",
        "In conclusion, for the sake of modern life scientists are providing the information for leading a healthy life but human being are not conscious to obey these rules and they spend an unhealthy life. However, we need to avoid unhealthy food and need to be aware"
