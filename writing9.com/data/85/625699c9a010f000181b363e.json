        "Dear Derek,",
        "Hope you are doing well. I'm writing this letter to express how grateful I am because of the book which you borrowed when I told you about the forthcoming presentation at work. That presentation was aimed to complete a project before its deadline. Oftentimes web developers are given a one-size-fits-all interim in order to finish a task. However, depending on the difficulty of the particular project there might be some troubles leading to shortcomings.",
        "The presentation was paramount for every member of the team, but especially for junior-level developers. The reason is that they are not accustomed to the process and any misunderstanding by them may result in poor performance of the whole team.",
        "The book is worth reading since it contains top-notch approaches how to be able to capture the audience's attention. In addition, there are some remedies, which are explained comprehensively,  for speakers who get butterflies in their stomach being in front of a crowd. In a nutshell, I found the book really valuable and I read cover to cover.",
