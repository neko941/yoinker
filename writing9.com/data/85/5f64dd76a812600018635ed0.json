        "Vegetarianism as a lifestyle is quite popular amongst the people living in Asian countries although many think differently. Not eating anything as a result of animal slaughter is not only considered as a healthy habit but it is often related to emotional sentiments. However, the majority of the global population still consumes meat or seafood as their staple diet. This essay will elaborate on the view-point of vegetarian people along with relevant examples.",
        "Firstly, inclination towards only consuming plant-based food is mostly dependent on the environment and regional factors. In some areas, this might not be a choice for the residents. For example, people who reside in areas with high snowfall tend to consume an animal-derived diet, considering the fact that the vegetation in the region is highly unlike due to the harsh weather. On the contrary, citizens living on highly fertile soil where agriculture is practised are more susceptible to adapt to a vegetarian lifestyle.",
        "Secondly, the thought process of eating meat is somehow linked to religious emotions in several cultures and religions. For instance, Jainism as a religion strictly forbids killing and having any kind of living being as food. Due to the face that their religious leaders, preach them that doing so is a sin. Therefore, proving birth to an idea of making the world a better place by giving up on making a diet of any living creature on the planet.",
        "In conclusion, I opine that choosing an eating regime is dependent of numerous factors, besides, adopting and committing to a side is a personal choice without any diversion towards positive or negative, it is instead about availability, environment and a person's own belief."
