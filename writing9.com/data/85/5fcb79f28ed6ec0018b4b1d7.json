        "Nowadays , people have different opinions on  the construction of a building in their area .In this context, a few individuals are inclined towards the idea that all the houses in a community should have a similar look,whereas, others opine that every building should be unique in its own way. This  essay would discuss both the opinions and give my viewpoint.",
        "To commence with, the  main motive behind the people who are reluctant to  change the architecture of the fresh buildings maybe because of the fact that when the homes in a local area appear same , then the economic boundaries of the people does not come into the picture and they can mingle easily with all of them. Moreover, they feel that traditional homes represent the heritage of a place and hence needed to be preserved. For example, in the state of Kerala, we see many houses following the same pattern. Thus showing their interest in holding on to the past culture.",
        "However, there are many reasons for which people are into the idea of erasing the old-structured method of constructing their houses.Firstly, those age-old buildings lack the comfort of attached bathrooms and some others like guest rooms.Therefore, the new generation is wanting to construct in their way by including the space required for these amenities. Secondly, some individuals feel that they can show off their wealth only by living in stored buildings. For instance, many people want to live in duplex houses only to showcase their prestige.this  away they display their rich status.",
        "To conclude,  even though we should take the responsibility in continuing the past culture, according to me as a home is a mirror of our interests, we should also be given an opportunity to make them look as we like.Hence, local authorities should support  people to construct their homes as they wish."
