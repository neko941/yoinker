        "Dear Sir or Madam,",
        "I am writing this letter with regard to the new airport construction coming up in our locality at Mulund west.",
        "I got to know about this news through \"The Daily Times\" newspaper on the upcoming constructions page. Initially, I was glad to read about the article because the government has planned to fund this project with international standards design. The column also described that the project would be executed by four leading architects and builders. Later, I was surprised after learning about the location of this project.",
        "Building an international airport in Mulund locality might have some troublesome effects such as noise pollution and increased traffic. Since this is a residential area, many people may develop certain health issues with the increased noise levels. Furthermore, an airport in such an area would hamper the air quality in the atmosphere as more vehicles will travel to and fro from the airport thereby affecting the residents.",
        "If I might suggest, Panvel is one of the best suitable options for an airport, as this area is in its developmental phase. Many chains of hotels, as well as resorts, are coming up in the next few years which might be convenient for airport travellers. Moreover, there is ample availability of land which means that the airport could be constructed on a large scale basis.",
        "I hope that you may consider my suggestion and opt for the best suitable option. Thank you for your time.",
        "Yours faithfully,",
