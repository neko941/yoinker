I am writing to you in regards to the issue I face with one of the neighbours of mine who happens to live in the apartment adjacent to mine, which I believe also belongs to you.",

This is very problematic for me as I have to wake up early every morning for work and these sounds don\u2019t allow me to sleep on time.",
