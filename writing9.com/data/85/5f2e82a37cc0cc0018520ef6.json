        "Food and shelter are the basic requirements for every individual and most of us spend our entire lives trying to earn a decent living. In certain nations, people consider buying a property essential instead of renting one because it procures social acceptance, stability and prosperity in life. In my opinion, it has a negative impact on people as it creates unwanted tension and pressure. In this essay, we shall elaborate the cause and the outcome  further.",
        "On the one hand, there are several reasons for such ideology, the main reason is social equality, for example,in many cultures, people believe that a house deems more respect and honour in a society and many consider it as a mark of high stature. Furthermore, for some it provides assurance as they own a place to reside and comfort themselves, unlike in rented apartments where there people have a constant trepidation of becoming homeless. Additionally, some people believe that houses bring prosperity and blessing to one\u2019s life.",
        "On the contrary, every rose has its thorn; hence these circumstances create a detrimental impact on a person. Moreover, buying an apartment is not cheap these days, and very few are able to own a property and as a result, unwanted stress hampers people\u2019s mind, for instance, countless people suffer through depression caused by peer pressure resulting in poor job performance and health problems. Since people give heed only to land owner, others are dismissed even thought they have promising capabilities. Alternatively, these views should be discouraged and should not be coerced on anyone.",
        "In conclusion, there are plenty of reasons why people consider owning a house crucial, but overall it delivers a derogatory result. Nevertheless, if an individual earns enough to provide food and shelter to his/her family it is sufficient to have a decent and comfortable life."
