        "Dear Sir/Madam,",
        "I am writing this letter in reference to an announcement in the India Times newspaper, regarding a shopping centre whose development is planned at Delta Avenue, Sector-103. To be specific, this advertisement was displayed on 23-09-2020 in the Real Estate section.",
        "Firstly, I am not enthusiastic about the update as being a resident of that location from the past few years, not only I, but all the fellow residents deserve to know such information beforehand. Already there is a lot of parking crunch, to which I certainly hope that builders have considered the situation and designed a workaround accordingly. Furthermore, there is a school in our locality, hence loud music will create disruption, especially during  festive times. Therefore, strict guidelines should be issued by the authority to the developer to minimize such issues.",
        "Moreover, I would sincerely request you to kindly share specific details about it so I can have an in-depth idea about the aforementioned and I will eventually share the information with everyone in the locality so it can be taken to the Resident\u2019s Welfare Association of nearby societies. Kindly find an enclosed visiting card with my contact details where you can revert.",
        "Looking forward to hearing from you.",
        "Regards,",
