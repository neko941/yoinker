        "It is commonly known that an unlimited amount of sugar was added to the vast majority of manufactured food and drink which is truly harmful to the consumer's health. Therefore, people advocate that the products with too much sugar must be way more expensive so that people will opt for  healthier options. In my opinion, I genuinely agree with the view. By doing so, it can prevent, at least mitigate, the consumption rate of sugar and lead to a healthy and happy lifestyle.",
        "Undeniably, a drink or food with a huge amount of sugar is truly captivating the user's quest easily. For example, most   people tend to choose  artificial drinks instead of  fresh juices when they are feeling tired. Subsequently, this behaviour will lead to detrimental effects on their well-being such as obesity and  other serious health problems. Thus, the price of such kinds of products should be double compared to the items with less sugar.",
        "Another significant disadvantage of this unhealthy eating habit is that it has a profound devastating impact on the country's economy. It becomes mandatory to spend a large sum of budget in order to treat those diseases. Consequently, they have been left with no option but to take it from the other critical sectors such as education and transportation. That's why the governmental organization should increase the tax to limit the  consumption rate.",
        "In conclusion, it is irrefutable that  food and drink with a high level of sugars are prevalent  these days. I totally believe that the price must be extremely high by taxation so that the residents will eventually purchase  healthier products."
