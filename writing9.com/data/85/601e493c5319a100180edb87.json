        "It is currently a contentious argument over the change of shopping way. In my perspective, this development, at this moment, has more merits than drawbacks. This essay is going to analyze comprehensive preferences to demonstrate my idea.",
        "On the one hand, we are living in the digital era. In other words, people are more likely to stay at home to purchase almost all goods not only in nations but also all around the world via high-ended technological devices. This shopping method, therefore, could make a huge number of residents follow the social distance policy, especially in the Covid-19 pandemic. Moreover, it is undoubted that the establishment of digital shopping creates a developing opportunity for the logistic field and job market. Taking Viet Nam as an instance. Shipper, nowadays, becomes a legal career for numerous citizens and helps them make ends meet in a short period when seeking more appropriate careers.",
        "On the other hand, it is absolute that direct shopping brings some special feelings. However, Coming to stores or crowd locations, especially in this pandemic, has more negative impacts. What I mean by this is that it is aimed to limit the spread of this extremely dangerous virus when people stay home. For example, when the Vietnamese authority implements the \u201c stay home\u201d campaign, people could witness a significant decrease in the number of cases and mortality rate.",
        "In the conclusion, although both shopping ways have their own advantages, I strongly believe online shopping is better, at least while the global pandemic is still uncoverable."
