        "Nowadays, there is a debate about the fact that many think it is crucial to learn about other countries where they need to travel while others believe that we can find any information about these countries on TV or the internet. In this essay, I will discuss both views and give my opinion that the information obtained through the internet is more reliable.",
        "to begin with, many people fly to foreign countries to boost their moods and to get away from the monotony of everyday life. During their trips, they will not only learn many things about the culture, traditions, and foods but also they have a chance to communicate with the locals and eventually, they gain knowledge about these countries. For example, every year many people from all around the globe travel to India to see the Devali celebration and experience it. Therefore, this is one way to find out about other nations by visiting them.",
        "By contrast, a lot of individuals prefer to find out about other nationalities by watching TV or searching on the internet because the cost of travel can be very expensive and everyone can not afford it. Hence, the technology provides a platform that everyone can access easily and gather  data from the nations through it. For instance, learning a new language while travelling is roughly impossible whereas, this can be achieved through online courses.",
        "In a nutshell, humans can find out about a society by visiting there which is too expensive in most cases. In my opinion, individuals can get knowledge about new places, different cultures, and costumes through the internet or TV. This will help them to learn in detail which is approximately hard by visiting there."
