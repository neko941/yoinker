        "Dear Mr Paul,",
        "I am writing to express my enthusiasm to join your family and care for your kid. I have some justifications to choose this job. The first point is that I am an extroverted person and I can adapt to new people very quickly. Another ground is that, due to having several nieces and nephews, I am able to communicate with children and have a good relationship with them. Moreover, I have  studied a lot of books and articles about babies and teenagers and learned how to deal with them.",
        "If you are looking for a babysitter who has a certification in first-aid, I am graduated with a senior emergency-care certificate. It should be noticed that I visited Australia recently and I have some plans for my spare time. I will have visited many tourist places in Australia, then I will also have tasted local food since I am going to take a cooking course.",
        "Thanks in advance for your kind consideration. I am looking forward to hearing from you.",
