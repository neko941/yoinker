        "Dear Sir or Madam,",
        "My name is Smith, and I visited your west gate store on Tuesday, 12TH June. I bought a game DVD titled Harry Potter, my invoice number is YH5678899, and payment was made by credit card. I am writing this letter to show my disappointment regarding its quality as it turned out defective.",
        "Let me elaborate on the situation. When I inserted the disc into the DVD player, my disc was not deducted. Therefore, I referred to all the instructions mentioned on the backside of its cover and tried to play it again, yet it shows the same message. Afterward, I tried to play a different CD, and it worked properly; hence, I assumed that the disc was defective because others had been playing nicely.",
        "For this reason. I would request you to replace it with a new one as it is under warranty. If a new version of the game is not available, kindly return the money. I made the payment of 90 dollars and would request to initiate a refund on the same credit card.",
        "I solicit your cooperation on this matter.",
        "Yours Faithfully,",
        "Smith."
