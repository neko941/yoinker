        "Dear Sir",
        "I am Praveena enrolled on the Mechanical Engineering stream in your college. I completed my 12th with 95% marks and was among the top 50 in the entrance exam for your college. I was offered many choices from all the available branches of engineering. I opted for Mechanical at that time as I was interested to learn about the mechanics of running a machine, which now is getting over my head and I think I am not cut for that course.",
        "Recently, I attended a seminar on AI/ML and its impact on future generations.  After attending the lecture, I became interested in computers and am giving a lot of thought to change my course and pursue Computer science. The current job trend also showcases a lot of opportunities moving towards AI/ML implementation.",
        "Currently we are just getting started in the course and I think changing career at this point will have minimal impact. I would like you to allow me to alter my stream to computer science.",
        "Waiting to hear back from you.",
