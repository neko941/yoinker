        "Due to the increasing prices of all goods, more and more people have started applying for jobs. A large number of the applicants who apply for jobs are students who have recently graduated from high school looking to pay off their student loans. Nonetheless, there are a small majority of individuals who strongly believe that students should not be paid while employed in their jobs. In my opinion, it is wrong to deny a paycheck to students who are working. After analysing the difficulties of students who are working to improve their financial situation as well as those who are looking to gain life skills while working in a job will prove this.",
        "Firstly, most pupils who are working in a job are often looking to make some money. The money they make is mostly used to pay off their student loans or to even help support their family. For instance, a survey conducted by the New York Times in 2017, has stated that 87% of those who are working a job are in need of some money to help pay for their college and this cash can help support them financially. Therefore, it is clear that denying students a paycheck even after working a job is wrong as they are exploited as free labour.",
        "Secondly, most students take up a job because they want to gain some knowledge and life skills. As a result, when companies offer unpaid internships in exchange experience, it seems attractive to these candidates. A study conducted by Singapore's ministry of manpower in 2018, has concluded that unpaid internships often lure applicants and use them as free labour. Furthermore, it is said that pupils can work on something worthwhile like either working on projects or attending seminars on their subjects of interest and gain knowledge in a better way. Hence, it is apparent that a few high school graduates are attracted by unpaid job offers that offer experience but in turn, need free labour.",
        "In conclusion, I believe that unpaid employment offers affect students in a negative way as it not only wastes their time by not providing them with the money they need to pay for their loans but also exploits them as free labour by convincing them they are providing valuable experience."
