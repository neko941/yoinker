        "As people grow older, they start to require special attention. While some people believe that old age homes tend to cater to the needs of the elderly, others feel that this can also be accomplished with their families. In this essay, I will be discussing both sides of the argument and sharing my own opinion.",
        "To begin with, as you are ageing, you become fragile and are unable to take care of yourself. Oldage homes serve exactly for this purpose. For instance, in a special needs home you have nurses taking care of you all day, providing you with meals and medicines in a timely manner. Moreover, at this age, it is challenging to go out and meet friends of a similar age group. This can be solved in an elderly home, as you get to spend time with people of your age who can relate to you. Although special homes are very capable of taking care of old people, they cannot replace family.",
        "As you get older you want your family to be by your side. The care that children provide for their parents is unrivalled. For example, an individual may feel uncomfortable asking a nurse to change their diaper whereas with a son/daughter they will make you feel at ease. Additionally, the attention that a loved one provides, especially when you are old cannot be seen anywhere else.",
        "By way of conclusion, despite special care being available for old people, the attention provided by an adult child is significantly higher than that of a nurse and it is the duty of the children to take care of their parents."
