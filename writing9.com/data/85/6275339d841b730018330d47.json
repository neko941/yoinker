        "Dear sir,",
        "I am writing to you to inform you about a lost handbag. I am the passenger of Flight no. A251 which flew last Wednesday at 10 AM from London to Vancouver.",
        "While I was on the plane I am well aware that I had my bag with me but when I reached home it was missing. I fear that while unboarding the plane in rush I possibly may have forgotten to collect my bag from the storage cabin.",
        "The bag is black in colour with a chain strap. Also, on the front ,side there is a brand logo of Gucci and on the other ,side there is a zipper pocket. It contains a small wallet in it filled with cash and a credit card. As from these details you can understand how important this handbag is to me and therefore I would like to request your Airlines to search for it on the Flight no. A251 and contact me on my cell number which is available on my enclosed business card.",
        "Looking forward to your response.",
        "Sincerely,",
