Firstly, could you please let me know what kind of historical items are being exhibited, I noticed that most of the items are handmade and certain items are made by disabled children. Please give me all the details of the articles being exhibited.",

Finally, as many of the group come from low-level economic backgrounds, they are unable to afford the full price of the ticket. Please let me know if there are any discounts available for school students. Moreover, it would be great if you could let me know beforehand as I need to organise the project.",
