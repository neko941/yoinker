        "This letter is written to inform you of my disappointment in stopping the activity of the cafeteria. This holding is famous for the services it offers to their employees and this cafeteria is one of the positive points of working here.",
        "As the main reason for its closure is the decreased usage, it is sensible to explain the reason first. The main reason is the workers of it do not act professionally. They usually speak loudly on their phones and it makes the atmosphere not a relaxing one.",
        "However, the existence of a place for the personnel to spend some time together eating and dining is inevitable. This will enhance their job satisfaction, and as a result, their outcome will be increased.",
        "The best way to improve its usage is to change the team that manages it. High-quality chefs and waiters should be employed and they should be trained how to act more formally.",
        "I will appreciate your actions to keep this place working.",
