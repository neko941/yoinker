        "I hope you are doing well. I am writing to express my sincere apology for not showing up at the meeting, which you have organized for us on 6 June.",
        "To begin with, I was extremely excited about our get together; unfortunately, I could not meet you on that special date due to some physical injury. Besides, I get to know that you have been there for the whole day waiting for me, and I felt guilty for not updating you by a text message about the incident. As you know, before I left from my home, I had texted you that I\u2019m on my way, but later I had met with an accident on the highway and my car has been completely crashed even I lost my cell phone and I went into an unconscious mind after the big hit with another car. In addition to this, rescue people came and taken me to the hospital as soon as I wake up I was searching for my phone to give a call to you, while I could not find and make you wait for me.",
        "Hence, I would like to set up another meeting with you on 28 June, I hope this time I can meet you if you can attend the meeting on the same date. If you have any inconvenience, please let me know.",
        "Looking forward to hearing from you.",
        "Yours sincerely,",
