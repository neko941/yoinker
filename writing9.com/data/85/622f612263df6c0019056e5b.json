        "It is often argued that it is more advantageous to choose a job with a high wage, even if it doesn't appeal to you at all. I completely disagree with this opinion and think that appointment happiness is much more important than wage.",
        "First of all, I believe that job comfort gives people a sense of fulfilment that no money can guarantee. Even if someone is earning  high earnings, but feels tense and compromises with his conscience, this person won\u2019t enjoy his life. While pursuing one\u2019s interests will always bring pleasure and a feeling of satisfaction. For example, a lot of famous researchers made their career choices ,not because of appealing wages, but because they were passionate about science. That\u2019s why it\u2019s more important to choose the kind of work that makes you happy than to look only at  high pay.",
        "Secondly, doing what you like keeps you motivated and therefore leads to  career growth. In other words, there is a strong relationship between activity achievement and productivity. People who love their jobs can easily excel in their fields of work and achieve better results than those, who put salaries in the first place. For instance, Henry Miller decided to leave his everyday career despite a good wage and ventured to become a writer. And after enduring years of ups and ,downs he became one of the most famous and well-paid authors of the twentieth century. Thus, the advantages of jobs that keep you satisfied outweigh the drawback of a low salary from a long-term perspective.",
        "To conclude, I strongly believe that job achievement is more beneficial than  high earnings because it makes people happy and motivated."
