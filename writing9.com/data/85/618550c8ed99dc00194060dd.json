        "My name is Honey Linn, a junior student from Pharmacy University, and I am aiming to be a professional gym trainer in the near future which is my dream. Generally, Pharmacy is a specialized course on medicine and medical-related institution while the school is not offering any physical activities and is significantly different from my hobby. When I have seen the amazing club advertisement on the main road billboard, it was amazing and perfectly matched what I need right now. I would like to join not only the weekly sports activities but also the daily Zumba club as well as a cardio workout class.",
        "In addition to this, if you don't mind, you would please let me know the membership fees which are monthly or yearly whether I can get a discount with my student card or not, and what kind of facilities I can join after being a regular membership as well.",
        "Looking forward to hearing from you with the great news.",
