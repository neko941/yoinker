So, when I arrive to find the class is not running, this is a real problem for me because I need to travel thirty minutes each way to get to your centre and I could spend this time much more productively.",
        "I know at other centres there is an online booking system for all exercise classes and I would love to see this type of technology at your centre. You will be able to notify customers in advance if the class were going to be cancelled and this would save everyone's time.",
