        "In modern times, it is becoming increasingly common for people to use social websites to read recent news. In this essay, I will examine why people do this and explain why, despite the easy access to information, I feel that it can negatively impact society.",
        "The main reason that people use social media is to check the news because it is significantly accessible  from anywhere around the world. Indeed, information is available instantly in our hands instead of waiting for the TV news at 6pm or a newspaper in the morning. As soon as we click on Facebook or Twitter, for instance, we can see the local headlines and development without even search for it. Such activity assists our society to be updated about local or global information. Clearly, instant access to information is the main reason people are turning to social media rather than traditional news sources.",
        "On the other hand, the content provided from social platforms  may not be reliable. Even though social media feeds are significantly available  at any time, the news provided could not be totally trustable as there is much fake news on this type of platform . For example, people create fake news or unreal stories about important subjects to receive likes or increase their number of followers. Unrustable source encourages people to spread false content to others and may affect the real story. Therefore, an unreliable source can impact on the real news data in our society.",
        "In conclusion, people use social media to follow the news because it is an easy way to stay informed. While this potentially  valuable, individuals need to know a reliable source because there are many false contents on social media websites. In my view, the effect of accessing the news via social media can be damaging as untruthful news can be spread easily."
