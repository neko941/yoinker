        "In this contemporary era, everything is going to change because of  technology. Eating habits also have been changed in this modern life and people like to take fast food in their daily routine. According to my, both benefits and drawbacks are at the same place which I will explain in the following paragraphs.",
        "In the beginning, prons will be disputed in this paragraph. First and foremost, in this fast life, masses have a hectic schedule and sometimes, they do not have enough time to make meals for their families, that's why they prefer to buy foods from restaurants which are the easiest or time-consuming way. Moreover, it is a good business to get profit because youngsters like to have western foods especially at birthday parties, functions, picnic and on get together as well.",
        "On the contrary side, it has many cons to have these meals. Firstly, these types of foods are very oily which are not good for health and could be the reason for some diseases like sneeze, cough and other neck or stomach  problems. Furthermore, obesity is the most dangerous malady that could be happened by this meal. For instance, the bread and the burger are the main sources of fat. It has been searched that mostly, in the developed countries, individuals are used to taking fast foods for their daily routines which are not good for health. In spite of, this food has negative effects for pregnant lady, sick person etcetera.",
        "In the conclusion, no doubt, fast food is unhealthy that can create many complications in our body but still it is the most popular in every age persons. It is not bad if we are having in some occasions or festivals because it is good to change the taste."
