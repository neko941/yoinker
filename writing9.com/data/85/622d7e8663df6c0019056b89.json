        "Nowadays, it\u2019s not uncommon to see young parents attending a preparation course in baby care. Indeed, these parents long for the best development of nursing knowledge. Attending a preparation course as early experiences in young parents is considered as a way to ease nervousness and confusion by some modern experts. Nonetheless, the drawbacks of such gestures cannot be overlooked. In this light, I disagree with it.",
        "For some, attending a preparation program as early experience allows mothers and fathers with desires to maximize their notifications. This way allows young parents to develop and explore their unknown field of nursing. Without the participation of these courses, some parents may not even be aware of the ignorance they possess. For example, some mothers and fathers in Taiwan have already adopted establishment preparation programs as mandatory classes, which nudged them to explore their experiences. Thus, attending a preparation course as early experiences may provide the satisfaction of desires among young couples.",
        "However, the practicality of the construction course is limited. Young fellows should assess aspects of reality. To date, caring babies still value practice rather than theory. Besides, the preparation classes are expensive and impractical. For instance, the average household income of Taiwanese appears to be lower in comparison to other countries. If the young couples are coerced into investing their money in the preparation course, their savings will possibly be impaired. In light of this fact, juxtaposing nursing abilities with the preparation course will most likely create significant problems.",
        "In summary, although attending a preparation course as early experiences allow the public to satisfy their knowledge, their limited monetary resources will possibly be reduced. This consequence severely affects the parents' perspective on economic development."
