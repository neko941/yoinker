        "With globalisation, many people choose to study, work or live in another country where they are expected to speak a foreign language. Some people perceive this can lead to severe problems both practically and socially. In this essay, I will explain why I support this idea.",
        "One of the most significant reasons is that it can cause misunderstanding. This is because one finds it hard to express his ideas correctly and thoroughly, especially when he needs to explain his own culture. For instance, some behaviours or customs of a nation are viewed as strange or even impolite by other nations. When a foreigner wants to explain his unconscious habit to his acquaintances who think it rude, he can't come up with proper words or accurate expressions and is finally misunderstood.",
        "Another factor is the lack of interpersonal relationships. Even though many people are fluent when speaking a foreign language, they are not as sophisticated as native speakers. Hence, if a foreigner can't understand the whole conversation with his native friends or feels uncomfortable speaking the language, he will be prone to avoid using the language again; that is, he will avoid many interactions with natives. For instance, one prefers to refuse an invitation to a party because he had an embarrassing experience at the previous one. He will become introversive in the end.",
        "In conclusion, people will encounter various problems when they are required to say everything in a foreign language, among which the most serious ones are misunderstanding and lacking relationships."
