        "My name is Ekaterina Shadenkova and I would like to ask for your help in covering the story about the situation that has been going on in our local area, in Antalya, Kepez Karshiaka district. There is an old building that causes a lot of trouble for people who live nearby. It's at 3839 Sokak street, building 8.",
        "As I said before there is a house that is located beside  our home, it is damaged and it's very old, not a single person lives there, but the cats and dogs.",
        "It is damaged from the roof to the bottom and it's made out of wood. It has only one floor and a small backyard with a lot of cardboard on it.",
        "There were several cases of fire that have been in that building, probably caused by heat or from thrown cigarettes close by.",
        "I think that city's government should read about this building in your newspaper.So your article should make an effect and they would finally demolish it. I hope that you would consider writing about this story and bring attention to those who are in charge.",
        "Best regards,",
