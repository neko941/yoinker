        "In  recent times, a greater number of hours are spent in front of the television by pupils. While some believe that knowledge gained from television is not that  effective as books and knowledge of  children are restricted. I  disagree with the aspect due to certain reasons coupled with some reservations which will be explicated further.",
        "The first and foremost reason is that television is an audio-visual aid and one can retain things for a prolonged duration by this method. Due to advancements in technology, there are several ways through which difficult topics are made easy via animation or in form of narration. Moreover, there are certain programs broadcasted which involve facts and figures of the world apart from the academic curriculum. This eventually, leads to the enhancement of the knowledge of learners. For example,  show names of Historical events proved to be very useful in learning  history. Hence, stuff can be retained for a long time when learned through videos or series.",
        "Adding further to this, learning from textbooks became quite monotonous and children find it boring to grasp  things. Due to which they lose interest in  reading whereas, inculcating things with the assistance of modern gadgets make minors  learn in a smarter way. On the contrary, this method has a detrimental impact on the vision of the individuals as the light of different wavelengths is emitted from the screen. To illustrate, most of the schools upgraded themselves to smart schools with the installation of television and projectors in classrooms. Therefore, learning through a screen makes reading interesting and a person can instil other facts apart from the academic curriculum.",
        "In compendium, the television in this modern time is considered as one of the smartest ways to learn things. Although its repercussions on vision cannot be overlooked."
