Unfortunately, no card was enclosed in the envelope when I opened it. I am hoping that you would issue me another card and hold the delivered one to stop any misuse.",

Immediately after the occurrence, I telephoned the bank to explain the problem, but I could not get through to the right department, even though I waited in line for over half an hour, which was extremely annoying.",
