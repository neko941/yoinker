        "A professional career is something extremely important in adult life. While some people think is better to work in one company for a longer span of time, I believe is better to change horizons every now and then. In this essay, I will expose the benefits and drawbacks for both scenarios.",
        "On the one hand, there are some people that see disadvantages in changing jobs at one point in professional life. One of the arguments is that such a decision takes time to adapt and this time may be harmful to the worker. For instance, some researches have shown that an adult takes at least two months to adapt to a new work environment. Additionally, a decision like that may cause some mental issues if someone does not adapt properly to the new company.",
        "On the other hand, some people think there are some positive sides to change companies during career life. For example, changing usually brings personal development and exploring new horizons possibly can, in the end, makes life better. In my opinion, The advantages of changing companies outweigh the disadvantages. I have already had some personal experience in changing enterprises and I had learnt with these new challenges and I also have made new friends, which is certainly an incredible experience.",
        "In short, changing companies may take a while to adapt or cause some mental issues, nevertheless, I believe the positives sides are more advantageous than the negatives. I have already had this experience and it was definitely a great personal growth."
