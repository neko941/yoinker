        "There are many concerned parents who believe that organized group tasks can be helpful to students. Others, however, think that we should allow them to decide which activities they want to perform.  I completely agree with the former statement, and in this essay, I will explain both sides of the topic.",
        "On one hand, I have seen some child's choosing the right paths, in order to succeed in their coming tasks. Nowadays, the youth is alert about what is beneficial for them. For instance, the current generation is more active as compared to the older generation. They are more familiar with the latest technology and due to that their IQ level has increased by playing  difficult games on mobile devices.  In such a scenario, if we try to control their performance then it may impact their free mindset.",
        "On the other hand, the younger generation enjoys playing virtual games more than focusing on their studies. In such a situation, if we freely allow them to take their own decisions then it can be harmful to their future. For example, I have seen the youth wasting their valuable time on computer games or using mobile devices for entertainment purposes. Thus, in order to have a safe and bright future parents should take the right decisions from the beginning. This will help them to be in discipline and remain more focused on their studies. Also,  teenagers are not aware of the current world and how can they shape their future. Here parents and school authorities play a crucial role to secure their future.",
        "In conclusion, Although there are good arguments in favour of people claiming that kids know how to utilize their time, I strongly value that the parents and the academic institutes should guide kids to have a successful future."
