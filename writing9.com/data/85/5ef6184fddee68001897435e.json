        "Nowadays, in some developing nations, many youngsters in the countryside regions have difficulty getting an education. While there are some people exert that the provision of educational institutions and teachers can address this dilemma, others state that this problem can be tackled by computer-based and internet-based learning programs. I agree with the latter view.",
        "On the one hand, some understandable reasons could explain why schools and teachers can resolve this issue. Firstly, educational organizations allow students to considerably develop their social skills such as leadership, communication, negotiation, to name just a few. This is because the schooling environment provides students recreational activities including teamwork projects, team building, clubs,\u2026 which in turn strengthen their relationships with peers as well as improve their interpersonal skills. Besides, teachers are the ones who can distinguish between the best and worst students, therefore they are able to generate suitable and appropriate lessons for each individual, which could hardly be mimicked by a computer or the internet no matter how useful they are.",
        "On the other, I believe that distance learning programs have their own merits. To begin, due to the insufficiency of transport infrastructure in remote areas, learning through the internet would reduce the amount of time spent going to school. As a result, it would help students who come from impoverished families save money, time, and efforts. Moreover, having internet access would give children the opportunities to acquire knowledge despite geographical location. To be more specific, google is a great source of information ranging from science-based subjects to art subjects. For example, Courses is a well-known website that provides students over 1000 online courses, which conduces to help them obtain whatever knowledge they need as long as they have an internet connection.",
        "In conclusion, although schools and teachers might help children in rural communities to have access to education, I believe that the remote learning method can also be a fruitful measure."
