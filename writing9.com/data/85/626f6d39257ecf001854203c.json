        "Dear Peter,",
        "I am writing to thank you for your invitation. It's very kind of you but unfortunately I won\u2019t be able to visit you this summer due to my hectic work schedule.",
        "Let me explain my situation in detail. I\u2019ve recently been promoted to teach the higher classes and though I am thoroughly enjoying my job, it has been extremely hard to cope with and manage the deadlines. I am in no position to ask the management for a holiday as it was me who was after them to promote me. Also, during summer I have to undergo a teacher's development programme. It has been made mandatory by the school authorities. The programme focuses on the different skills and teaching strategies that need to be implemented to bring about a fruitful teaching and learning experience for the students.",
        "Could you inform me of another time you will be free? I\u2019m excited to visit you. I was looking forward to staying at your new place and spending some quality time with your wife and children. I can travel to your place during the Christmas holidays and we can celebrate Christmas and ring in the new year together. Let me know if you are available.",
        "I look forward to hearing from you.",
        "Best regards,",
        "Susan."
