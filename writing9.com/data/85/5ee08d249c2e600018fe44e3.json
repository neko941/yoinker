        "In the recent times, the scarcity of residences in urban areas. However, there is an ample space available in the rural region, many intellectuals reckon that the natural habitat of the countryside should be preserved from the concrete jungle. In my opinion, the beauty of the rural area should be preserved and the supporting arguments are given in the following paragraphs.",
        "To begin with, the predominant adverse effect of dwellings in the rural area is the impede to its inhabitants. Consequently, this practice would collapse the aboriginal ecosystem and elevate the environmental issues. For instance, the concrete jungle in the city area has demised the home of many species on the earth which endangered their existence. Moreover, the unsustainable development of the countryside would have a detrimental effect on the environment too. The increasing amount of fossil fuel accelerates the effect of global warming; this causes many more saviour troubles to the people. Therefore, the countryside should be protected from such development to secure species and the environment.",
        "Furthermore, building home in the rural area lead to the problem of paucity of the natural resources such as water, food and fresh air. This limited resources are exploited without wisdom, creates great trouble to the people. Lastly, the people from the rural region, mostly rely on the agricultural work. If this land is utilized for building the colonies, then agricultural sector will collapse. As a result, there will be reduced food production as well as many people will get unemployed. Thus, the countryside is the most important part of the national economy and it should be protected to achieve a sustainable economy and resources.",
        "To conclude, the paucity of landscape for the urban area should be solved with the preserving the countryside for the betterment of the nation. The government should provide security to the countryside by imposing stringent policy."
