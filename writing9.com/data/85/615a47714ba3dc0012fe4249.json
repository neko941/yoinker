        "It is clear that with the development of technology, especially computers and the internet, methods of studying have varied as we are now open to more diverse sources of artificial intelligence and study materials. Moreover, the roles of tutors have changed, from only rendering know-how to a mentor, setting specific directions for scholars as well as the function of schools. This essay discusses how both are essential for effective teaching and learning.",
        "To start with, computers and the internet are crucial study materials as they allow children to delicately prepare for their class and grade. To elaborate, the technology provides children with specific and diverse data, allowing them to actively participate in grade discussions regarding certain topics. For example, the tutor may have set the agenda to learn about the law of entropy in the next class and grade. Scholars can gain background observation on entropy production beforehand, allowing them to discuss freely and show active participation in online classes which can enhance the quality of self-education.  Furthermore, these preparations can efficiently facilitate learning at school, as it helps save the treasured time required for school teachers to render instruction.",
        "However, this is not enough for the most effective academic achievements. When pupils come to school prepared and eager to learn, educators should act beyond the coach, being mentors.  They should set directions for the flow of the discussions in the most effective and efficient way for students to perceive the acquired knowledge as their own. For instance, instructors should differentiate activities so undergraduates can acutely understand and participate in classroom activities. In detail, a teacher could open a debate on how to better master the Schrodinger CAT classical theory, so as to gain excellent experience in their daily life and learning time. Assuming that all undergraduate students have reaped the benefits from some background suggestion. Pupils can share their smart wisdom and points of view while interacting and cooperating with other scholars,helping them to always think from a different perspective. This, by allowing them to definitely believe in the most advantageous and beneficial dreaming education.Fantastic!",
        "In conclusion, we can conclude that not to determine which is more essential for the highest education, because both are required for complete academic achievement. Therefore, we need to recognize and utilize both learning methods for our kids and children at the next stage."
