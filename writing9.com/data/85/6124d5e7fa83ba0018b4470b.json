        "It is a major problem these days that is an increase in body weight is quite common in some countries, while the level of fitness and health are declined. In my opinion, the reason for this dilemma is related to people\u2019s life and a possible solution is enlist further in the ensuing paragraph.",
        "There are many reasons behind the cause of this complication in an individual\u2019s life.

It can be a cause of an unhealthy lifestyle. For instance, obesity, high sugar and blood pressure, cardiac diseases and many more. On the other hand, unhealthy eating habits are responsible for losing health. Individuals live a busy life in a big city and have no time for making a healthy and decent meal. In addition, this tends to eat fast food items and ready-made items with high oil levels which can be unhealthy. Furthermore, many experts suggest that people should avoid eating over-processed food from local streets and restaurants.",
        "To the solution, some effective approaches could change these unhealthy habits to solve the over-weight problem. Firstly, playing a sport can be a good remedy for this obstacle. For example, having jogging and walking is good for most fitness beginners. Secondly, people who are obsessed with fast food should control their eating habits and change their diets.

In other words, having unprocessed cuisines can improve their strength as well as it is good as a diet also.",
