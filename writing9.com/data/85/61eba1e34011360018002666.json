        "Let me explain my situation,my office working hours starts from 8:00 pm in the night and it ends at 7:00 am.Thus,after returning to my house from work and getting to bed for sleep I constantly heard lot music that has been played by our new neighbours.They live just adjucting to our apartment.",
        "Though,I don't mind if they play music but the sound is very high which disturbs me a lot.As a result,its been around two weeks I am not able to sleep properly.Due to this reason I am not as much productive in my work as the company expects.My manager has also warned me that if there is no improvement in my tasks then I may get demotion.",
        "Furthermore,From my point of view you should address this problem immediately by contacting the landlord of the apartment where the new tenants are living inspite of requesting them several times to low down the volume of music they have ignored my words.",
        "I hope to hear from you soon",
        "Yours sincerely,",
