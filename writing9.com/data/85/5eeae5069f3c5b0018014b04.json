        "The starting age for schooling has always been a debatable issue. Some believe enrolling at a younger age has more upsides, while others are of diverse opinion. This essay will discuss the pros and cons of beginning school at 4, and provide a logical conclusion.",
        "There are twofold advantages of commencing education for 4 years. Firstly, the young ones have more chances to succeed in life, if they start learning earlier. It has been proved by a research that between the period of 2-5 the human mind is the most impressionable, which makes it easier for the kids, to grasp the knowledge at that stage. Additionally, they can master different subjects earlier, compared to the pupils, who start studying later, which gives them a head start. Secondly, the majority of the time will be wasted in useless activities of the child, if he stays home till the age of 7. In contrast to that, in he will learn numerous new things as well as stay engaged in knowledgeable tasks, in kindergarten. To cite an example, the nurseries often teach the students various board games, arts and crafts which are essential for the overall development.",
        "On the other hand, it is prominent for the little ones spend as much time as possible with their parents. It has been found that for the cognitive and mental advancement of the child, he requires safe environment, which can only be provided by family. Also, virtues such as honesty, courtesy and respect can only be taught by loved ones. Furthermore, it is inevitable for kids to develop social relations and engage in physical exercises, as they are still growing. This might not be feasible if they are in school, due to homework as well as long hours. Hence, for the all-round growth of tomorrow\u2019s youth, it is important that today, they have enough time with their guardians.",
        "To conclude, commencing learning early, has both benefits and drawbacks. The latter,however, can be eliminated through striking a right balance between the school hours and home hours. Therefore, it can be said that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages."
