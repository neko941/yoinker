        "In recent years, the modern world  had numerous issues with human beings. Moreover, these obstacles must be solved by national cooperation. I will explain with two sides and elaborate in the following paragraphs.",
        "On the one hand, nowadays, many countries have been facing numerous problems with living conditions. For example, the world population are increasing  the current days, therefore, they need more food for their living conditions. This case can be  vital trouble in people's lives because of the fact that  food can cause to die numerous societies and animals. Another issue is that climate change is an essential factor for  human beings   these days. Many  individuals can be adversely affected  nature by living conditions. To illustrate, using vehicles is impacting negatively such as owning cars has ensured gas emissions so their choices are a major effect on the environment.",
        "On the other side is that government and national companies have been establishing too many cooperations due to solving vital obstacles  during the period. For instance, producing food can be increased  by farmers but they are supported by authorities and big national companies and also production period is regulated by experts after the world population can  access numerous food anywhere or at any time. One of the greatest solutions is that climate change must say that any of population because they know that it is  important to the trouble to them thus they have some methods of solving this issue and many societies can learn how to deal with this case and what we do solve in this case.",
        "To sum up, urgent troubles must be known all over the world populations and they should learn how to impact  their life drastically. In addition, whole societies and companies must be supported by campaigns which make use in order to more convenient life and environment. From my position, the entire world would  pay attention to their usage and effects on nature."
