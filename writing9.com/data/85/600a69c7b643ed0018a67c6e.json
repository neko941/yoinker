        "In modern days, people are squandering excessive amount of money for their wedding ceremonies. A lot of people realize that lavish weddings can bring about some difficulties for couples. I agree that newlyweds are troubled due to organizing grand and luxurious wedding functions.",
        "Firstly, newlyweds take the almost unbearable burden on themselves by borrowing money from friends and relatives. They are required to return the loan after their marriage. Consequently, they need to surrender their extra earnings to their debt, whereas they could have saved this money for their upcoming family life. For example, one of my best friends who lives in the UK, after his marriage he had to live in a small house of low rent as well as had to delay family planning just to repay their debt on time. This indicates that couples would face issues due to spending substantially on a fancy wedding.",
        "Secondly, the bride and the groom invite many guests to the wedding, who are left unattended and unnoticed, for which the couples feel guilty later on. As there is a huge crowd the bride and the groom are unable to meet and talk to each of them, and often miss to greet their closest friends. For instance, I once attended a large and stylish wedding ceremony where the bride and the groom were busy taking photos with their family and a crowd were gathering in front of their stage, that I was unable to wish them personally. These newlyweds felt apologetic later on for not being able to communicate with me. This clearly proves that extravagant wedding results in an embarrassing experience for the couples.",
        "In conclusion, it is stated that great and glamorous wedding parties lead to debt and regret for the couples. Therefore, modern couples should try to arrange moderate and affordable wedding ceremonies to prevent falling in big troubles."
