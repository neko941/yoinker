        "Nowadays, the right to privacy has been a matter of concern, especially for famous people.  Many people claim that news about someone's private life should be shown cautiously while others reject this notion. Although the public wants to know about their favourite celebrities, it does not mean they get the right to invade someone's privacy. In my opinion, media should let them decide on how much information they want to release to audiences. However, the below paragraphs will discuss both views.",
        "Firstly, showing information about someone's personal life has become a business these days for journalists. In order to gain audiences and increase the number of views, they have forgotten basic ethics. For instance, if any famous person dies, they go to their houses to cover live scenes; they will focus cameras on crying faces; they will not even let people mourn in peace. Additionally, they also sometimes show unnecessary news like some celebrity's kid is painting for the first time or started walking, like how is it relevant for the public? Therefore, media houses should not invade someone's privacy and should focus on authentic news that can help people.",
        "On the other hand, many people believe it to be a positive thing as at times it motivates them to do something new or learn from others' mistakes. For example, kids these days get influenced by what they see on the internet or television and they try to follow their favourite sportsperson may be. But at the same time, it has a negative impact as well, as they might end up making unnecessary demands that their parents cannot fulfil. Hence, such news should be controlled.",
        "To conclude, I firmly believe media houses should respect individual's decisions and if they are not comfortable, journalists should maintain distance. It is everybody's right to live their lives on their own terms without thinking about how people might react to it."
