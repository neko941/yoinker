        "It is always good to learn about good and bad at an early age to stay out of the consequences. It is a hot topic to discuss, whether or not, we should incorporate disciplinary action to make them understand right and wrong. I opine with the idea of not teaching this lesson with the fear of punishments.",
        "Firstly, we should understand that every child is unique and possesses different capabilities to accomplish the assigned task. In this case, if we punish a slow learner, it will be an injustice to that individual. For instance, it was published in one of the articles in the newspaper, that stated about a kid who ran away from the home, as his parents were hitting him for improving his hygiene.",
        "Secondly, any task accomplished by force will nullify its significance, as it is done without interest. When we are liking the work assigned to us, we do it with interest, but when the work provided by force we finish it unreligiously. For example, one of my uncles always complains that his elder son never makes his bed in the morning for which he is not allowed to play. He is forced to do that task and thus he does it without interest.",
        "Thirdly, a child may undergo a mental trauma if that child is treated harshly because he or she is not able to learn a concept. Fear of harsh treatment can make you finish the given task, but you cannot realise its requirement and significance. Such as, a student became introvert as he was exposed to corporal punishments because of his habit of using slangs.",
        "To sum up, looking into  the aforementioned factors, we should not use corporal punishment to teach students; as it always results in a negative situation. Rather, we should learn to understand the challenges that a child is facing to learn. However, it is necessary to know about right and wrong at an early age, a learner should be given enough time."
