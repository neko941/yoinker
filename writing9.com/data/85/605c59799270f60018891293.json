        "Getting a high paying job is a competitive endeavour. Although some people argue that having a distinguished qualification is the only way to bag a higher salary, there are others who opine that having work experience is the best method to ensure better pay. This essay elaborates on both views and explains, why I believe that having hands-on training is more important.",
        "To begin with, there are some fields where without a higher qualification, the candidate is ineligible to get the spot in the first place. For example, to land up as a doctor in a hospital, the person has to pass MBBS at the very least. Hence in these cases, only a higher qualification will help the individual secure his place. In other fields, highly qualified candidates, like those from IITs are considered more intelligent and thus, more innovative. So they end up getting higher packages on the pay-roll.",
        "However, there is a caveat. Though such qualifications can help bag a good first salary, further progress depends on many other factors. Employers know that experienced people carry certain skill sets that freshers can rarely match and therefore, are willing to shell out more money for the same. For instance, a general practitioner working in Africa, treating Ebola patients will be vastly more experienced at managing the disease than an infectious disease consultant sitting in the UK. Not only does work exposure help people identify problems even before they arise, but also teaches them how to deal with situations in a mature way. For example, an elder doctor appears to be more convincing to patients than a trainee.",
        "In conclusion, though higher degrees are a necessity at certain places for certain employment profiles, I believe that because of the qualities that experience brings to the table like niche skill sets and better human interactions, it is a better way to get a well-paid job."
