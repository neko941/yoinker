        "Dear Ruchi,",
        "I hope you are doing well. As you already know I was preparing for my MBA in Canada for the last few months. Finally, I got an offer of admission to Smith School of Business, Queen and I will be joining them next summer.",
        "It will be a two-year full residential program with a specialisation in Finance and Marketing. The classes will be held on weekdays and I will be free on weekends. As you also know due to the pandemic last year, we had a loss in our business, so I was planning to get a part-time job to take care of my personal expenses. I hope you can help me get some references for the job.",
        "I remember last time during our conversation, you shared that your company is looking for a part-timer for their office work, and I think I can join them as I will be allowed to work for 20 hours a week. I also want you to ask your colleagues for any part-time jobs available and look for the classifieds section in the local newspaper.",
        "I look forward to your support. See you soon.",
