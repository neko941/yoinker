        "One thing I'd definitely recommend is to wander through the jewellery quarter. As you may know, Hamilton's being the leading centre in this craft for centuries, and the jewellery quarter is a beautiful area of old workshops, many of which are open to the public. If you need a bite to eat, have a look down by the riverside, where there's a great range of cafes and restaurants. And for some nightlife don't miss Legon street - that's where it's all happening. - especially the Jazz Club, where there's a gig most evenings.",
