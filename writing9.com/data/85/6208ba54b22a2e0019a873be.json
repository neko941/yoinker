        "Most people claim that  higher education has several   advantages  while others  suggest that the intention of it is to assist the graduates to have  wider chances and a better outlook for  a superior career . In my perspective, I believe that there are  several benefits to getting a good position  .",
        "On one hand, people recognised that higher education main purpose  is to make sure  that the students get  suitable jobs when they graduate as they attract their employers by their degrees . In addition, they  will have fewer challenges when applying for  a job with their qualification as most   organizations  demand . There is no doubt that they will get the position that  they deserve Furthermore,they will certainly get more respect ,unlike the ones who have not finished their schooling. Moreover, they will be promoted in  a short amount of time as they have more knowledge in management and a better approach to consumers than the others.",
        "On the other hand, the other  opponents  claim that there are more benefits than  for applying a job.  After finishing university, they have become more mature than before as they learned that things cannot be easy if they don't endeavour. For instance: they have  to overcome  challenges and hardships in order to pass  higher education. Additionally, they manage their time  quite well by doing things which profit them in the future .",
        "In my view, I  believe that there is a better value in graduating than applying for  a job. Not only does it help us to  reach our dream career but also we  are motivated and self-loved .  Further, we will be dominant  and appealing because of our success. For example:   We don't have to rely on our parents anymore and can support them with our salaries.",
        "To conclude, being graduated has made them gain more respect  than the other people who have only finished middle school. Moreover, they are independent and  sensible . In order to be a sucessful person , everyone oughts to be graduated."
