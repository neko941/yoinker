        "I am happy to hear that you are going on a camping holiday this summer for the first time and I will give you some advice about this.",
        "Going camping will be an extremely interesting entertainment way that you will enjoy. This activity can let the candidates be involved the whole time. SO it can improve the friendship between them. For example, you should cooperate to install the tent which is a challenging job. There are lots of steps you should follow to come up with that. So you will experience the teamwork spirit.",
        "However, the disadvantage of this is that some risks may appear. We usually choose the camping locations at some wild places where some natural disaster will happen. For example, many years ago, I met a heavy rain during the night when we have a deep sleep. The dangerous water Pushed us out of the tent which is really scary.",
        "In conclusion, I\u2019d like to join you and help you to do some plans. So that we can have a nice and safe holiday.",
        "Best wishes!"
