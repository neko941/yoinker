        "These days, more and more people sympathise with animals' life from being exploited  and should respect them as a human, while someone believes that it is necessary to take  advantage of other living things for survival for the purpose of food, medical, clothes, and so on. In this essay, both viewpoints will be discussed in detail before my perspective is reached.",
        "On the one hand, human is not the owner of the world.every creature loves their life  and has equal eligibility to live on the earth. It's not just because they are speechless, it doesn't mean that they're not afraid of being killed or hurt as humans. For example, sharks should not be cut fins  and died in the ocean just  to satisfy someones, who want to celebrate their birthday. Moreover, wild tigers and elephants should not be hunted because of an entertaining sport  or making home decorations. Every life is matters.",
        "On the other hand, it is undeniable that humanity needs animals as requisites to survive. In every activity of humans, animals are being involved including food, medicine, and clothes. Firstly, we need protein to create energy by metabolism, which 90% of the protein comes from livestock. Secondly, to evaluate the safety of medicine, scientists have to test their products on rats, and chimpanzees. Thirdly, humans need  leather and wool from cattle and sheep to make clothes to protect their bodies. Therefore, they are indispensable for daily life.",
        "In conclusion, both views are reasonable. In my opinion, animals should not be killed just only for entertainment or satisfying the needs of people, which they should be protected and conserved especially extinct species. However, people can take benefit in only farming animals such as chickens, pigs, cows,  etc."
