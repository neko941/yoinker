        "Taking risks can have a profound impact on both the good and the ill. In general, risks in terms of different aspects of life are crucial for people. I'm convinced that the advantages of considering risky options preponderate the drawbacks. Analysis of both positive and negative aspects of the concept along with the results shown by research studies will prove it",
        "Firstly, at a very basic level, approaching a risky decision might cause painful experiences sometime but the end product must not be ignored. For example, those who take uncertainty in some sort of personal matters in their lives may receive critical feedback or somehow discouragement from others. Besides, it can bring a chance for personal growth as well. Moreover, it enhances  confidence and brings joy to life. Therefore,  following one's conviction, can benefit at large.",
        "Secondly, the drawbacks coming along with opting for risks mainly include the idea of ambiguity and uncertainty. This might limit a person to put himself out on the line. However, taking prospects is necessarily important for one to get a step ahead in growth. For instance, believing in what you are pursuing without being scared of failure can open many doors to success in your professional as well as the personal life",
        "Finally, according to research, those who opt to take risks and bold decisions are more likely to learn, get experience and become successful in their lives.",
        "In the nutshell, I firmly believe that while looking after the precautionary measures, the concept of taking opportunity is immensely significant and is more advantageous than its demerits."
