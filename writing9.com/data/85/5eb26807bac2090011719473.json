        "Taking a study break after high school and before joining university is very common in some countries. Many people spend their holidays as travelling all around or doing full time job. There are many demerits for young people who decide to do this.",
        "First of all, sometimes people are confused regarding their future career, travel and work during study break gives you the relaxation and motivate us to choose appropriate course in university. For instance, when teenagers are in high school, they live under a strict environment where they do not have the confidence and experience to think about future requirements. So when you travel, you gain lots of experience and face so many problems and also learn something new by deal with the situations. On the other hand, if you are not aware about your interested field so taking up a job can help with identifying your field of interest and provide relevant experience. Moreover it makes them financially independent. This gives you an experience and confidence to get succeed in future.",
        "On the contrary, there are some drawbacks of taking a study break. During jobs, the student may show less interest towards higher studies and with this reason, education process will be disturbed. Some of them become greedy to earn money from job and some of them incline towards bad habits such as smoking, alcohol consumption, drug addiction and so on. Similarly, taking a trip for a long time can affect the financial status of the students",
        "To conclude, the disadvantages outweighed the benefits of encouraging youth to work or travel. In my opinion, young people should have continued in their studies to prosper in life."
