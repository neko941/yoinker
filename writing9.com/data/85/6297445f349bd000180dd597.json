        "We all had a good time at the meeting last week which was held at Sydney Airport Hotel. All the participants liked the decoration in the meeting room and were happy with the big powerPoint screen as well as the desert supplied during the break time.",
        "However, some of my workers complained about the lunch supplied that day was not very healthy. Firstly, it had too much oil in the dishes, which made them lose their stomach. Another thing is that there was too much meat on the menu but not enough vegetables, thus making the nutrition balance not even.",
        "To sum up, It was a nice time to stay at the hotel, but I think there are some aspects that you can do better in the future.  To begin with, supply more vege food for people who don't like meat. Moreover, tell the chief don't add too much salt and oil to the dishes. Last, could we supply various fruit after lunch? that will make ladies and gentlemen more comfortable.",
