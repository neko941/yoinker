        "Nowadays, it is believed by some that it is essential to spend a noticeable amount of money on the construction of new railway lines for very fast trains between cities. However, others reckon that these resources should be invested in the improvement of existing public transport. In my opinion, it is best to invest in public transport first. In this essay, both views and the main reason for my opinion will be discussed.",
        "To begin with, some think that we must invest in constructing new railway lines for very fast trains between cities. This can have many benefits for those who travel often. For instance, many businessmen and businesswomen have to travel constantly between different states and cities and constructing new railway lines can facilitate their travel. Moreover, trains are cheaper for travelling between cities and states and they are also more convenient and more comfortable than other types of transport such as aeroplanes. In contrast, not many people use this mode of transport. Therefore, a huge investment in trains may not be a wise choice.",
        "On the other hand, some reckon that this investment should be in existing public transport. expansion in the capacity of public transport and their facilities is more beneficial. It is best to enhance the quality of buses and subways in the city. Taking Japan ,for example, they have placed libraries in subways that allow the public to read books and it encourages them to use this mode of transport more often. Thus, many improvements can be seen in public transport.",
        "To conclude, some think that it is necessary to spend a large amount of money on constructing new railway lines for very fast trains and some reckon that we should use it to improve public transport. In my view, it is best to focus on public transport because it has a bigger effect on society. Given the current circumstances, a rise in the usage of public transport will be seen."
