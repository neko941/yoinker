        "As a widespread fact, gaining work experience is crucial in today's society. Many children participate in such paid business so that they can benefit from it. Some argue that having some job experience is grist for the mill to the child's education and development, while others are not in favour of this opinion. I advocate this given notion in terms of several reasons.",
        "To initiate, paid task gives teenagers real-life employment practice and helps them strengthen their personalities. For instance, children will have to be aware of and learn, work ethics such as punctuality and respect to the superiors. Moreover, they are going to learn to be responsible for any given jobs is necessary when they  are working for other people; besides, they have to learn to take care of themselves and how to coordinate with their associates at the company.",
        "Last but not least, paid-works allow youngsters to understand the value of the money they earn and be more frugal since they are going to perform for hours to receive a salary that is the equivalent of their labour. To exemplify, if a teenager gets along only with the salary he gets from his family, there is no way that he can know the value of it and as a result, he will waste that money. On the other hand, if this person earns the salary with his own 4-5 hours of effort, he will know the value of the money far better.",
        "All things considered, although, some people think that it is wrong to allow children to undertake paid employment, I  strongly believe that children should take on paid tasks such as part-time or full-time jobs since it is a valuable business experience, helping them develop their characteristics and become more frugal."
