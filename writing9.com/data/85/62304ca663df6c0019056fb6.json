The festivities will begin at 7:00 p.m. and will last until midnight, as there are numerous activities planned, including games, dancing, speeches, and food.",
        "Because this is a special party with more than twenty-five college students, there may be some noise, so please accept my apologies ahead of time. To avoid causing too much noise, I'll make sure to keep the music volume low. In addition, I will remind everyone not to toss trash on the streets in order to keep our surroundings clean.",
        "You've always encouraged me to pursue my objectives, and it's thanks to your abundant blessings that I was able to accomplish my goal. It would be fantastic if you could attend this meeting to make it more interesting and to contribute a few words about life that might motivate my friends to achieve their goals. I hope to see you next weekend at the event.",
