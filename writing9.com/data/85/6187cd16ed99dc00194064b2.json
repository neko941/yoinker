        "The authorities from many countries argue that economic advancement is their most crucial goal , while other people think that another kind of improvement is equally important for a nation . In my opinion , other progress is also playing a vital role  for a nation .",
        "To start with that why might government reckon that economic development is more important . First and foremost , it provides a good salary and services to the citizens . To illustrate , if there is  good progress of economy then the individual can be able to get a good price for their work or job , even somewhere it also generates the employment for the public . Secondly , the name of the country is internationally known  . For instance , the rate of exporting the goods will increase and there is a decrease in the importing of goods due to the progress in the economy and an  increase in manufacturing of the goods .",
        "Nevertheless , improvement in the education system is also important for a country . Even though there are many people who do not know how to read or write , they are not able to work in a good company or anywhere else . Although nowadays everything is based on technology , there is a big need to be educated to do the job or for any kind of employment . Adding to this , there should be  an improvement in the health facilities . For example , the fitness facilities are improved then the life expectancy , working efficiency and many more things are coming in front of the country . As \"health is the wealth\" .",
        "In conclusion , however , economic development can lead to service , but education and well-being are also important to do that job ."
