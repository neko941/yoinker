        "For many people, boarding schools have become increasingly popular these days; inasmuch, students stay during the term. However, some pupils and their parents do not support this idea. This essay will now examine both sides of the arguments and present a conclusion.",
        "On one hand, a number of people hold the idea that living around the school zone is providing favourable terms for learning. Living at home students, if their home is located far away from university or must travel by vehicle to their lesson, that takes a lot of time. Perhaps by spending that time in class, opportunities for successful learning will increase. Secondly, living in a dormitory has many advantages for individual behaviours. For instance, as often under the supervision of a teacher, students learn manageably. Furthermore, they learn adaptability and work with a team from other pupils living together.",
        "Turning to the other side of the argument, there is another group of parents and pupils who oppose the idea of living in boarding schools due to the several drawbacks of such schools. In some cases, cultural differences are a major problem, which means that leaving the home where you were born is a difficult task. These circumstances contribute to them being antisocial and introverted. Another major reason is that, in recent years, students face peer pressure. That becomes very desirable stress on their minds and body. As a result, pupils dislike lessons and avoid the schools. Furthermore, it is also a cause of their suicide.",
        "All things considered, living in a new environment away from parents is a challenge, but overcome it, and have a lot of opportunities to learn a new lifestyle."
