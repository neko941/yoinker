        "A year gap between school and college has been becoming immensely popular among children nowadays. This advocacy ,however, provides numerous benefits like financial stability and timeframe to think about a future career. On the downside, it can also make children lethargic towards the study and increase their desire for money. In this essay, I will put light on both advantages and disadvantages.",
        "On the one hand, there are multifarious advantages of having an education gap between secondary and tertiary school. The predominant one is students can earn and save money for their future prospects. By saying so, I mean that the school graduates can work in companies like McDonald's, KFC and Hungry Jacks to earn their livelihood and save some extra cents for their tuition fees.  Lastly, teenagers will get time to think about the field in which they want to pursue their career. They can take suggestions from their elders or co-workers and then decide about their future. For instance, my friend took one year gap from studies to travel and grasp others thought about  social work. Currently, he is working as a case manager in Anglicare Victoria.",
        "On the other hand,  demerits can not be ignored. First of all, some students might become lazy to go back to their studies. This is because one year gap can change their state of mind in regards to education. They might develop a thought that practical knowledge outweighed the academic degrees, which would result in a less number of students in colleges. Apart from this, the desire for money among young adults during the gap can proliferate, as a result, they would continue to work rather than studies to fulfil their thirst. For example, my father after completing secondary education never went back to school or college because his hunger for money increased during the gap between school and college.",
        "To conclude, having an education gap has both merits and demerits. It entirely depends upon an individual that how he handles his one year and what are his future plans. I suggest that a gap in studies is worthwhile as it can make an individual financial stable and give some time to think about his future."
