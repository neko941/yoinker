For example, it is noticed that in Asian countries majority children have mental issues by playing online games like Pub G ,GTA and so on. In addition, in schools teachers are given more concentration to frontbenchers or those who good in results they are not interested in weak students. Thus, weaker students face the difficulties to understand the things and they also show a lack of their interest in their studies.",

Firstly, parents should have to do proper check balance of their kids and give them proper time and try to make friendly relation because by this relation young generation share their activities with their parents than it is easy to counsel them for their wrong activities.
