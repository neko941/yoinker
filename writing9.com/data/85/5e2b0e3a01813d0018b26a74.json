        "To make business more productive and profitable many organisations rely on advertisements in internet, magazines and billboards. This selling method can make consumers buy unnecessary products, attracting  them by beautiful pictures or appearance. This essay will show good and bad sides of using this method.",
        "Firstly, the main benefit of online advertising is that you are always familiar with the recent, modern goods which are popular. Moreover,  it is convenient and comfortable for people in searching for particular items in online. For example, if you want to buy  furniture, there are a lot of online adverts , you can find out about this product via mobile  sitting at one place. Another advantage of billboard advert is that products which are on a big screen are most reliable and worthwhile because they are often controlled by government or tax agencies. Thus, it makes us clear why advertisements are effective for consumers.",
        "On  the other hand, this type of selling product is forcing people consume unimportant items especially parents. For instance, children watch many adverts on TV about toys, sweets etc. Then they make parents get them. Also, people often rely on the product too much which are advertising, but the quality of that item can be low. Furthermore, adverts in magazines are not good for the ecosystem, as we know paper is made from wood in order to get them people cut down trees consequently they destroy forests.",
        "In conclusion, making profits thanks to online, paper advertisements is becoming the main tool in the business industry, although they encourage clients to buy unimportant things. Despite the disadvantages of this method the advantages outweigh drawbacks."
