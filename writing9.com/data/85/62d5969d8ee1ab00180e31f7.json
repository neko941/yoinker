        "Human beings as the smartest creature on earth have affected the environment considerably more than animals. Since  industrial and technological advancement has become our first priority in recent centuries, our planet has been deeply damaged.",
        "Nowadays, Fossil resources including oil and gas are our first choice of energy, for example, most vehicles consume gasoline and diesel, moreover, hydrocarbon sources of energy are being used in the industry more than ever. Consequently, the global gas emission rate has seen a peak recently. Unfortunately, if we continue emitting greenhouse gases,  global warming will increase as well. In addition to global warming and greenhouse gas emission issues, due to the irregular water consumption for agricultural porpuses, underground water resources have been declining in  recent years, and this problem can lead us to a shortage of drinking water resources in the near future.",
        "Although governments have started to adopt some approaches to diminish environmental damage, we still have a long way to tackle environmental problems that have  happened because of our activities. There are some steps which governments can take to decrease environmental harm. Firstly, they can invest in environment-friendly industries like manufacturing electric vehicles. Secondly, each country instead of exploiting fossil reservoirs needs to focus on producing more reusable energy including wind or solar power.",
        "People personally can be impactful by following an environmental-aware lifestyle. For an instance, we need to decrease water consumption and consume it wisely. Likewise, should we commute by public transport, we may take part in the decrement in carbon dioxide emissions. In general, no one can deny the fact that the environmental situation is not good and both individuals and governments have to take their responsibilities and be accountable to tackle the issue."
