However, over the past century there has been a decline in the quality of prize-winning artwork and it is now possible for quite ordinary pieces of art to be labelled \u2018masterpieces \u2019 whilst true works of art pass unnoticed.Do you agree or disagree?",

        "The work of art, painting, sculpture and many other art forms should display specific types of qualities that are unique. But, over the previous decades, the quality of prize-winning artwork has been a decrease and now most of the simple artwork has been listed as masterpieces whereas real artwork passes unnoticed. In my opinion, I totally agree with this statement that real artwork doesn't get enough attention as compared to ordinary work. In this essay, the reason will be explained with relevant examples.",
        "On one hand, the real evaluation of the artwork has been lost its importance. Nowadays, most of the students are encouraged by their teachers and parents to be a doctor, engineer, scientific scholar, good athletes and so on. For example, in Bangladesh, most of the pupils choose their career paths as a doctor or Government employee (BCS cadre), unfortunately, no one has been grown interested in artwork like in previous days. As a result, the true evaluator has not emerged in recent decades. Thus, the fake work gets the award prize, on the contrary, true work achieves no reputations.",
        "On the other hand, true artworks have declined their value because of the fake artworks in the market. There are many phoney artworks that exist in the market which looks like real artworks. Consequently, it is really difficult to separate the fake works from the true ones. Although, nowadays, it is easily possible to identify the copy work by using highly advanced technology.",
        "To conclude, both personnel artwork evaluation quality and broader uses of technology must need to ensure correctly evaluate the true artworks."
