        "Dear Mrs Walker",
        "I am writing in connection with my upcoming training course at your college in Sydney, Australia. I will be there to attend the Brain-Based Learning program at Victoria College for a period of three weeks from July 2nd to July 22nd, 2022. I am hoping that you will be able to assist me with my accommodation arrangements.",
        "As I am slightly older than most of the other participants, I would appreciate it if you could find a private studio apartment for me, close to the college. It would be ideal if I could walk to school each day, but if not, I would need access to public transportation. I understand some of the events on campus finish quite late so I would prefer not to walk in an unfamiliar neighbourhood after dark. In terms of the apartment, all I require is a bed, a desk, a TV, an internet connection, a kitchen and a bathroom. My budget is around US $1000 for 3 weeks.",
        "As I will be arriving on July 1st, I would need the apartment to be available from that night until the day of my departure, which is July 23rd. My last night in the apartment would be July 22nd.",
        "Please let me know if you are able to find such an apartment and if not, please suggest other suitable arrangements. I look forward to hearing from you,",
        "Yours sincerely,",
