        "Let me elaborate on the situation. I applied for a new passport on 15th April 2021 as the expiration of my old passport was 1st June 2021. Thereafter I had a flight to Canada and I was traveling abroad for my further studies on 3rd July 2021. As per the passport office website, the standard processing time for a new passport is 30 days, however, in my case, it took more than a month. This delay caused me to miss the 2021 intake.",
        "For this reason, I would request you to do an investigation on this matter and share the reason for the delay caused. Lost time would not be compensated by any means but I would like to have an apology letter from your department.",
