        "These days, there are presumptions such as a great stake of hiring people should take place by giving due consideration to characteristics rather than just the certifications and past experience. I partially agree with the given statement because humans always strive to upskill themselves and their past plays an influential role in allocating the work but not the only part. In my opinion, recruiters should put significant concentration on the fresher's characteristics rather than on experience alone.",
        "To begin with, firstly, there are a plethora of circumstances that could intervene in a student educational options like finances, resources and pressure. Thereafter, under the influence, a student would possibly enrol in a course even if it is not what he wanted. However, his motivation and inspiration are what makes him learn things. Secondly, there is no assurance that an extremely qualified person achieves exemplary things . Furthermore, the nature of the person makes him feel accountable for it and guides him to finish it. For instance, a friend of mine who hails from a small village with little education because of his interest now works on par with candidates who hail from top most universities. Thus, the past is not only the deciding factor.",
        "On the other hand, there are a few scenarios where this decision could also turn out to be wrong such as making a person from the technical domain work on the finances of the association. Next, without proper qualifications, the employee would actually cause a decline in the productivity of the association. To illustrate it, an ex-employee of my company who had great technical knowledge was made to work on the company marketing side it caused severe disasters to their economy. To sum up, a variety of factors needs to be involved while hiring a newbie.",
        "In summary, behavioural tendencies need to be genuinely valued during selecting a candidate while also being aware of their academics and knowledge."
