        "Dear John,",
        "I hope you're doing well and It is amazing that you're planning  a camping trip in Canada. I'm pretty sure that you'll have a lot of fun, and it'll be a memorable and adventurous vacation. However, since you ask for some advice I'd like to give you some tips.",
        "First, I think Canada is one of the most beautiful countries that I've ever visited, and I believe you'll love its virgin nature. Although there might be some disadvantages, you'd be able to find a solution for them if you know them in advance. For example, you are not allowed to camp anywhere you like, while there are some designated areas where you could do so. Actually, it is more to preserve you and your friends from wild animals and to keep the environment clean and safe. Therefore, do some research about camping sites and book them priorly. By the way, keep in mind that most of them are not free!",
        "Also, thanks for inviting me for the trip, however, I might not be available in August. Hence, since I already planned another trip to Toronto, it seems I can't accompany you. But I wish you a fantastic camping holiday!",
        "Best regards,",
