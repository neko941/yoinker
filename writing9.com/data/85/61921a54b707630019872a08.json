        "Nowadays ,it is argued that  some people are  joyful to live in the same place for their entire life whereas , other opponents  want to live in many different places if they have a chance . In this essay ,  I will explain more detail on both views in the following paragraphs and then I will present my own opinion.",
        "On the one hand , some people want to stay in their native place as long as they can . They do not need to learn new things in a new environment and,  also do not require to leave their  childhood friends and relatives . In addition , some families are building their businesses generation by generation.So , it would be difficult for them to start their lives  in strange locations again .For example , some Japanese and Chinese families believe that inheriting the family business is their duty and responsibility. As a result , they can maintain their own culture and customs as long as they want .",
        "On the other hand , other people believe that staying in many different locations can get many benefits like a multi-cultural environment and some good opportunities . Obviously , people have to capture and practise new things like languages and food  if they are moving to a new location . Undoubtedly , they may have more new challenges and problems in their new place like following the local's traditions .For instance , the region where restricting to wear specific clothes only can suffer the person who loves to wear whatever he or she wants.",
        "To conclude , whether people are living in their origin or different locations , they should contribute their experiences and knowledge to the particular society where they are living  . In my opinion , it does not matter where we are living but we need to be  useful people for our communities ."
