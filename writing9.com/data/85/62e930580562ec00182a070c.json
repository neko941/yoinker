        "The Internet advances enable the wide usage of computers and mobile phones, particularly among the young. They spend more time on interpersonal communication through these technology devices. Some think that this may affect teenagers negatively on their writing and reading ability but I tend to disagree.",
        "On the one hand, using social media more may have detrimental impacts on teenagers. Surfing the Internet may take account  more time for teenagers. Therefore, the energy allocated to reading and writing will be reduced greatly. Compared to their peers in the last century, they had no choice but to do reading books and even write a letter to contact their friends. Moreover, juveniles on social media, like Tiktok, Facebook and Youtube, would be more likely to watch videos or browse pictures. Thus, it is difficult to improve their literate ability.",
        "On the other hand, soaking in computers and cellphones may also improve the literate abilities of the juveniles. Numerous famous writers and news viewers also open accounts on social media and they would share the latest essays. By reading these and writing comments, their writing and reading skills would also be improved. Besides, the content shared by their idols may also motivate them to read more relative articles and even write to refute or support others\u2019 opinions.",
        "In conclusion, admittedly, wide usage of technology devices for communication may have detrimental influences on juveniles as this may take a lot of their time. However, if they can manage it well and read high-quality content from famous writers and their idols, their literate ability would be enhanced."
