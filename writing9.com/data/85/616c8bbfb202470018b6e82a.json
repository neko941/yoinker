        "Dear Sir or Madam,",
        "I am writing to evidence my complete dissatisfaction with my last stay at the Four Season Hotel located in London. Moreover, I would like to require a total reimbursement of the charges that I paid for this reservation.",
        "Last week, on October 17th, I reserved 3 nights at the 5 stars suites, which are considered the best room at your hotel. We were celebrated our wedding anniversary, and that is why we chose a room with special facilities, such as a balcony with a lake view, and also a whirlpool bath. Unfortunately, the temperature was extremely low in London due to an unexpected snowstorm. The heater in our room did not work accordingly and we could not regulate the internal temperature. Because of this, we just had a horrible night.",
        "With regard to face this inconvenience, your staff informed me that we must move from that room because the service of repair did not be available at that moment. After that, we stayed for 2 more nights at an inferior category suite, with 2 single beds and no special view or luxurious bathroom.",
        "Considering our strong disappointment, I would like to require a full reimbursement of the value paid, because we did not enjoy your exclusive accommodation during our stay. Furthermore, I would appreciate it with you offer a discount for our next time at your hotel.",
        "I look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible.",
        "Yours faithfully,",
        "Sarah Parker."
