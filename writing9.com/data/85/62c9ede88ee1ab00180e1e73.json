Therefore, next Sunday my friends want to celebrate this achievement at my home in which we have a BBQ party in the backyard and have a movie planned for Sunday night in my home.",

        "I would be thankful if you could join us. You always motivated me when I was feeling sad while studying. Thus, I am really excited to celebrate with you.",
