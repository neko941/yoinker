        "Last Sunday, I purchased a beautiful wooden house from your online store. When I received the package, my excitement turned into discontentment as the entire was scattered. Moreover, the roof sticks of this toy were totally crushed, and the lighting system was also not working properly.",
        "As far as, I can imagine, one reason behind this is poor packaging. All of the parts were packed usually in a plastic wrapper, without any sturdy covering them. Thus, the scattering would have happened during delivery. To prove my points, I am attaching the photographs of the courier I received.",
        "I would like to replace this wooden house with a new one. If it is not possible, following that I would like to request a full refund.",
        "I look forward to your quick action.",
