        "In this present world, the usage of automation is constantly on the rise.It has become a crucial part of our lives and no day to day activity can be imagined without automation. I agree with a bunch of people who believe that  automation is imperative.The ability to communicate with others, as well as the innovation of the apparatus will prove this.",
        "To begin with,the introduction of gadgets such as mobile phones, laptops and computers had made it easier for people to connect with  others across the globe.Our dear ones are just a phone call away even the features like video calling is available these days if we wish to see someone but cannot visit. For example, with the help of skype, an international video and audio calling platform, communication is free of cost, therefore,technology is considered as a boon for students or family members who settle abroad for higher studies or better employment since it eliminates the emotional tension one might face in another country of being away from home.",
        "Secondly, innovations of the instrument like washing machines, juicers and toasters have made daily chores simplified.For example, Working professionals can now wash their clothes while preparing breakfast.Similarly,there are many other tasks that had been made easier with the help of machines.thus, it is needless to say that technology is the need of the hour.",
        "In conclusion, Even being away from home one may not feel alienated because  the presence of mobile phones and video calling platforms and the foundation of machinery had made tasks easier to perform in every sector of the job."
