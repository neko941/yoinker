We have never been to your resort before so we have questions regarding our stay. I hope you could accommodate 4 sea view rooms for three nites.",
        "Secondly, we are excited and full of energy as we are quite young. Where during our stay we want to challenge ourselves by getting involved in some outdoor water activities. We also are interested in some fun sporty events on the beach. We would greatly appreciate it if you could recommend some ideas that could be of interest to us.",
        "Finally, just to let you know all the adults are vegetarians and two children are only 3 and 5 years old wanting to go to bed early in the evening. Therefore, we need a restaurant with a plant-based diet and also that has a family food menu. We wonder if you know of any places that are close by.",
        "I look forward to hearing from you soon.",
