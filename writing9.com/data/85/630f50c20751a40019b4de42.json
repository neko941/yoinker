        "With the progress of science and technology, nowadays, most parts of society and the world are affected in aspects of both advantages and disadvantages by environmental issues. some insist that the best way to preserve our world and environment is to consider the seriousness of the development of technology, while others discuss that advanced science and technology can resolve  environmental matters. both views will be discussed, and I opine that the former view is more convincing.",
        "On the one hand, some people think that developed science and technology have a detrimental impact on environmental problems, particularly atmospheric issues. First and foremost, most of the facilities are burning fossil fuels and releasing a large amount of contaminated gas. Regarding, these gas are contaminating the air and polluting the meteorological state so that the greenhouse effect will become serious and deleterious. Moreover, the biodiversity of breeds would be sharply decreased and many species would be extinct just for a few decades for deforestation is caused by the rising temperature.",
        "On the other hand, others believe that future technology can solve environmental issues. Firstly, the newly invented energy like solar power, wind power and cleaner fuels will enable corporations and facilities to replace nuclear and present energy to them. This means, we can anticipate the noticeably decreasing emission of harmful gas for us. Secondly, the new biodegradable packaging by the advanced technology help to reduce the byproducts of the usage of disposable items which result in air pollution when they are burning.",
        "In the conclusion, although the advancement of technology and science can help make better quality of our life and settle environmental issues, I believe that the extreme development of technology will cause more terrifying situations."
