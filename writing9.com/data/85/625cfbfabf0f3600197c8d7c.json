        "I am writing this letter to let you know  to remind our last trip from Chennai to Coimbatore. I think you won\u2019t forget our very first meeting since we shared so many things during the journey. In our discussion, you mentioned that there is a requirement for Finance-Head in your Coimbatore Branch. You added that the responsibility should be more for that position and also informed me to share my profile if anyone is available. I am a Qualified Chartered Accountant and had an experience of over 7 years . I hope I am an eligible candidate for your requirements and If you are fine then I will share my profile for your review. I am very much interested to be a part of your organisation and working with you.",
