        "The call for raising international funding from famous celebrities has become a widespread phenomenon towards the advertisement. More often, they actively call for help with social poverty and needle people. Some people tend to assert that their support towards non-profit organisations plays an important role in dealing with issues. However, there are also many people who firmly advocate that the occurrence of celebrities reduce the importance of problems. It is quite understandable that views on this issue vary from person to person.",
        "Those people who strongly believe that the support from famous people is beneficial to social affairs have cogent reasons for it. Firstly, the promotion from celebrities serves as a good role model for their fans. For example, people would be more concerned about the poverty issue with South Africa's rural children if their favourite people call for attention. Secondly, their considerable financial support to the international aid organisations could be a good starting point to improve social issues such as disable and autistic children. People would start to donate to it no matter if it is less or more. Thus, this movement would bring a positive effect on the social atmosphere.",
        "In spite of the above arguments, I support the view that the help of a noted person would undermine the significance of problems. International charity activities might become tools to strengthen celebrities\u2019 images. Some of them might take advantage of it to generate more popularity. For this reason, the social issue itself would not be the focused point for the general public to support but their celebrities or the businessman. Many marathon races, for instance, use the title of supporting disabled people to raise the fund by inviting some famous individuals. In this sense, charity support from them might be  a surface of a kind-hearted illusion toward the camera.",
        "To sum up, we cannot deny that both sides are well-grounded. For my part, I completely agree with the latter view that the call-for-attention activity from famous people might ignore the essence of social problems."
