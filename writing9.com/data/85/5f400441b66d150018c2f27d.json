        "The grant to unemployed people is paid in many countries. It definitely affects both the society and the government.  In my opinion, I do not agree with the idea of giving benefits to people who do not have a job and there are many reasons for that.",
        "Firstly, the authorities should spend the money wisely, there are more significant sectors of a country's economy which need money than people out of a job. Moreover, paying unemployed people weekly basis leads to laziness and increase an unemployment, which the government is responsible for. Although, it seems to help some people, it is definitely not fair to the others who work very hard to receive salaries. For instance, residents without a job are not going to look for it, knowing that they can get the money from the government. I think that, the benefits for people out of job only discourage them from applying and developing themselves.",
        "Another point to consider is the fact that spending money to unemployed citizens decrease the amount of funds to support different sectors of the economy such as healthcare or education. Furthermore, instead of giving money the government can fund the education of residents without a job.  For example, professional courses and trainings should be organized as a method of supporting unemployed thus it is both helping residents and raising the level of the education. The health care is another crucial section of any country which should be funded by the authorities before residents who do not work.",
        "In conclusion, paying unemployed people grants is not beneficial for society neither country's economy. It should be reconsidered and the money should be used in the healthcare or the education."
