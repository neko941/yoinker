        "There are those who argue that college going students ought to choose the area of study based upon their individual talents, whereas others believe that the state of job market should dictate one's choice of subjects. This essay will discuss both points of view and I shall argue that students should focus more on their abilities and likings when opting for any professional education.",
        "On the one hand, there are people who believe that it is the prevalent demand for different jobs which should influence one's decision in choosing particular subjects in college. To begin, this approach is practical because after completion of the studies, there are better chances of securing an employment. For example, nowadays, there is a lot of demand for IT professionals. If a student completes his IT degree from a reputed college, he has better chances of getting a good job. Therefore, basing the choice of professional education on expected future demand, promotes the chances of finding the right job at the right time.",
        "On the other hand, others argue that an individual's unique qualities and likings for a particular line of work should be the main determinant of the type of chosen subjects and I agree with this argument. Firstly, choosing a profession is like choosing a life partner. What I mean to say is that one has to cope with the chosen occupation for a better part of one's life. Apropos, the chosen area of work should match an individual's interest. For instance, someone who likes to interact with people and enjoying travelling, would never be satisfied with a desk job. Secondly, people do best when they are doing something that they love. In other words, enjoying a profession increases the productivity and overall quality of life. This highlights the importance of aligning the college education with a person's own personality.",
        "In conclusion, it is abundantly clear that people enjoy their job, their life as a whole and become more productive when they choose the study subjects based upon their chosen profession of choice. It to important for colleges to arrange regular career counselling sessions, so that students could better recognise the employment fields that match their abilities."
