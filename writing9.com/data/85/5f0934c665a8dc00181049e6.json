        "Lots of museums charge a fee while others do not. I concur that making these places free of  charge can have more benefits that downside.  This essay thinks that the benefits of charging do not outweigh the drawbacks because open access to relics and art is more important than generating money that the government should supply in any event.",
        "The prominent upside is that high fees exclude a large proportion of the population, especially in less developed countries. A vast majority of people in poor countries have just enough money for food and shelter. Undoubtedly, exhibits\u00a0 are one of the few cultural activities they can enjoy free of charge. For example, Egypt has millions of people living in poverty, but also a rich and ancient culture and it is therefore important that everyone gets to experience these artefacts. Another big negative is that students and children who are learning about the world may not be able to visit. It would be a huge shame if art students could not see their favourite painters or sculptor\u2019s work in real life because their finances could not cover the cost.",
        "Despite this, there are some who say that museums are unsustainable without the money they might get from ticket sales. They say that this allows the building to remain open and it is better that some people get to experience it, rather than none at all. To this I would say that the government should step in and cover the cost because culture is as important as anything else it spends cash on. For instance, in the UK there have been huge government spending cuts over the last few years, but the museums have not had their funding reduced because of their importance to the country\u2019s cultural heritage.",
        "In conclusion, although some might say that places of culture should be run like a business, the cost to the education and heritage of the country is too great and they should remain free to all. Nevertheless, I agree with the free entry to historical places. Lastly, authority should allocate their funds in the maintenance of these buildings."
