Some citizens accept that information should be shown worldwide such as technology, economic, and education. However, those who argue that documentaries are vital should not be widespread freely. In my view, I agree with this statement that the information must exposure for learning in real life and also will discuss two both these views.",
        "On the one side, vast amounts of data assist people to follow real situations immediately. Some information is adopted to develop a livelihood and prepare with changing of the environments at present. For example, the statistic of the metrological department in Thailand, where provides the data of sea level, the volume of water has higher than the last year because it has been constantly all day. These are the cause of flooding in each land, so Thai citizens look for data of other countries on the internet to generate innovation to prevent this cause. Therefore, much information which posts on the internet without purchase is a benefit to improve living.",
        "On the other hand, financial information should not reveal to the public. These data are significantly essential and underground of personality.
