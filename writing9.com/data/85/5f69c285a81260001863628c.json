        "It is believed by a certain populace that success is a result of top-quality teaching, whereas people with a contrarian view give more credit to the student\u2019s attitude for it. Whilst the discussion of both sides is worthwhile, in my opinion, a student\u2019s passion towards being successful is what drives them closer to their goal.",
        "On one hand, when children join a school, it is the teachers whom they spend most of their hours with. It is the teachers who manage to observe each student\u2019s fear, help them overcome it, teach them values and help turn their weaknesses into strengths. As a result, this supervision and guidance help in the overall development of children which help them become successful human beings. For example, a survey by the esteemed New York Times said that 78% of graduates give credit to their teacher for their own success. This illustrates that good quality teaching is an essential factor in the journey to success.",
        "On the other hand, passion can be taken into perspective as it drives students to their own success. Elaborating further, when the child is passionate about learning, they automatically become keener which leads them to become experts in the specific stream. This by default helps them develop a niche for themselves where they get highly paid for their skills in the job market. Case in point, a Google report from last year stated that 28% of millionaires claim that they focused on one thing across their life and became successful. Furthermore, we all grew up with the notion that it is our own efforts and interest that will give us our deserved success.",
        "In conclusion, there is no alternative to receiving education. In my opinion, while teachers should be given credit where due, it is the passion from within children that fuels the journey of being successful."
