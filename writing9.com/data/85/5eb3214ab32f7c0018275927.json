        "Nowadays, many people think that the behaviour of the children should be controlled by their parents since their childhood while others believe they should be given more freedom. In my opinion, parents are responsible for their children and they have to learn them how to behave yourself in the society. At the same time, they must give some freedom.",
        "The argument in supporting the first idea is that children are not amature. They have no idea what is going on around them. In other words, parents should be an example of good manners, but if they do not do it, children can absorb bad things such as violence and cheating that is shown on the TV because they do not  understand  what is bad and what is good. For example, my cousin has grown up in the family where he was not noticed by his parents because they did not devote enough time to their son,  and as a result, he has become a cruel and cold person.",
        "On the other hand, freedom in education can bring benefits for the children. To begin, it will allow them to make their own decisions. In this way, they will be able to solve any problem  they will meet on their way, and in this case, the only thing that parents should do is to support and help them.  All children in this world have a choice to do what they want in this life.  For instance, a daughter can make a decision not to go to the university because she has a passion that makes a profit. Thus, mother and father should not insist on their daughter if she does not want to embark on the college.",
        "In conclusion, I strongly believe that by learning your children manners and devoting your time to the education, you can grow an excellent person. However, if you will not allow to make own decisions , it can have a negative impact."
