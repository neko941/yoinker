        "Firstly, I am looking for a two-bedroom flat. Moreover, a fully furnished apartment will be a good option because I don't think, I can spend much time buying the furniture and necessary things. Furthermore, it will be good if it has one playing room for kids and a balcony. In addition to that, it should have one parking space, as I was thinking, I will have to buy a car, maybe after two months.",

So, it will be great if you can arrange the apartment either in the Mascot or nearby suburbs like Glebe or Surry Hills because I don't want to move very far from my job location It will be helpful if you can help me to find such kind of an apartment.",
