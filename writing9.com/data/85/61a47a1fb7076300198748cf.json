        "Issues related to happiness are frequently discussed these days. Some people believe that economic success has an impact on humans\u2019 happiness, others criticize and argue that happiness relies on many factors. Both sides of view and the explanation why I prefer that others have an impact on happiness will be shown in the following paragraphs.",
        "On the one hand, there are various reasons why personal enjoyment is relevant to economic status. The principal reason is that due to economic success, people often gain opportunities in terms of healthy living standards, such as great education and privileged societies, that can lead humans to feel secure and happy. In the modern world, most joyful activities are generally supported by money. Hence, a successful economic position has a positive result in living in a nation, such as working, travelling and health care service. For instance, in Thailand, only the upper class can travel to Europe in order to gain mRNA vaccine during the COVID-19 period.",
        "On the other hand, some opponents argue that apart from economic growth, there are other conditions significantly associated with individual well-being. The main reason is that humans are different, thus personal pleasure depends on each person. This means that the enjoyment of some people just relies on their balancing life between their health and sufficient assessment. Besides, having overwhelmed money cannot ensure that humans always have healthy minds. To exemplify, many people have paid unnecessary money for recovering their bodies, as a result of working overtime.",
        "All things considered, I am of the opinion that not only economic success is related to happiness, but it is associated with many conditions which depend on each man. Therefore, individuals should carefully realise balancing between their well-being and economic status."
