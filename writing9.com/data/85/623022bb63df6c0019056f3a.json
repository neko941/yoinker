        "My name is Naomi Umami.  I am writing to apply for the position you advertised in Kyoto City newspaper, 3rd March 2022.  I believe that my qualifications and personality will make me a perfect candidate for the job.",
        "I am currently a student at Kyoto City University, majoring in undergraduate Business Administration, and will be graduating in 2024. I have experience of a part-time job as a cook at a hotel which is located near the Kyoto City Museum. I have gained communication skills, team working skills, and as well as time management skills, which I am sure will be helpful to take a part in your home.  As there will be no classes during the summertime, I am looking for a temporary job. I will be able to help you with your daily chores and prepare some meals for you during the summer.",
        "My classes are usually held during the weekdays, so I will be available for an interview on the weekends.  Please do not hesitate to contact me for further information.",
        "I look forward to hearing from you at your earliest convenience. Thank you for your consideration.",
