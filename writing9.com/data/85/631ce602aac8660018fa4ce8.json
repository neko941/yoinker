        "Nowadays, a lot of people argue that money is the most important thing for young ages. Personally, I agree with this opinion. I describe both sides, positive and negative.",
        "First of all, on the positive side that we consider that money is the best gift for teenagers, it is able to provide a lot of good experiences. For instance, if our children have enough money, Put simply, if we don't pay for young, they have never got these chances! they have choices to study abroad and join summer schools. In my own case, I think that these experiences are especially important for young generations because adults have no times to get these experiences even if they have enough money. These experiences will work good in their future.",
        "On the other hand, there are not affected by these experiences when youngers are not motivated well. Motivations are one of the most important things to learn somethings. When they are enough motivated, they could learn a lot of things themselves.  For example, there are many ways to learn in my country. They will learn a lot from textbooks, TV shows, the internet and books even if they don't have much money. People who say that money is not the best way to learn think that young individuals who are not motivated learn nothing even if we pay  money for them.",
        "In conclusion, both are very important to educate the young. However, in the current situation, these experiences will be advantageous. Therefore, I believe paying money for our children is a good way to teach them methods to live as individuals in society."
