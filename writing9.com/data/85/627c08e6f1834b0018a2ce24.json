        "My name is Jay, and I live in Athens close to Athens technical college. I am writing to let you know that I am ready to help you next summer. I saw your announcement on  Facebook recently, and I think I will be able to give you a hand.",
        "Let me describe the things that I can perform. Regarding the outdoor activities, I can cut the lawn, and feed your animals if you have any, and I can also fix gates since I have my complete set of tools. The indoor activities, though I can clean, paint, and lift heavy stuff, however, I am not helpful when it comes to laundry as I never learned how to use the washing machine.",
        "I have been helping others for three years so far, and I really enjoy supporting them not only in the locality but also across our nation. I have recently joined the food bank services across Egypt to provide food for those who cannot afford to buy it.",
        "I will be available three days a week from 9:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. I can start on the first of May, so please let me know if that is convenient for you.",
        "Waiting for your reply,",
