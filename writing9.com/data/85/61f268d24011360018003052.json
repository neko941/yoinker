        "The latest news about wildlife shouts quite loud that the population has been cut in half in the past fifty years. Sadly, this trend is easily observable in all areas and climate zones. For sure, powerful human civilizations could apply some force to reduce a significant part of the harm caused and potentially restore wildlife populations. Let\u2019s think about what could be done in the first place to help protect our planet neighbours.",
        "First and foremost, it\u2019s required to preserve habitation and conditions of the essential needs of rare breeds and species in danger. This also includes applying high environment protection standards and ecology technologies. For example, water sources are highly important for wildlife populations surviving, so industry and manufacturers should use isolated water cycles to prevent waste. With the wide availability of clean water as a base for new green areas and reforestation, it will be possible to repopulate woods with animals and birds again.",
        "Furthermore, the power of the human is quite often aimed at the lives of animals with some pretending that it\u2019s required for human survival. But, in most cases, that\u2019s not exactly true because people could instead eat a lot of different greens, vegetables and nuts, replacing meat, fish and eggs. For instance, purchasing new shoes made from alligator skin isn\u2019t about  basic human needs. According to eastern philosophy, all these little and big creatures have little and big souls inside, so the human soul could give a hand to reduce pain and save lives. This way, humans should save and protect their smaller brothers with ideas of true kindness and humanity in everyone\u2019s head.",
        "In conclusion, being the most powerful creatures on this planet, humans have to be responsible for how this power is used and what it causes. It should be more attractive in society to be a protector of Mother Nature and all of her children and that\u2019s what we should teach our kids about."
