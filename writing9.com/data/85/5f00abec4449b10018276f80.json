        "It is expected that in the future, people will read their favourite books and newspapers online for free instead of purchasing printed copies. In my opinion, I completely disagree with this statement as there will always be people who enjoy buying books and newspapers.",
        "Many people dislike reading online without paying for many reasons. Firstly, staring at a computer\u2019s screen for prolonged periods is uncomfortable and damaging to the eyes. For instance, if individuals already have bad eyesight and wear glasses, then they cannot read anything on their mobiles or computers as their eyes would weaken and they would have a headache. Secondly, fans feel obliged to buy their favourite authors\u2019 books as a way to thank them and, consequently, cannot download a free version from the Internet. In other words, they feel as if they are stealing from others when they download something for free, which is ethically unacceptable.",
        "Reading printed books and newspapers is an enriching and memorable experience that is cherished by many. Printed books will always be favoured by countless people as they love holding a book in their hands, smelling the papers, and flipping through its pages. Some individuals also collect books that they are obsessed with and store them in their personal beloved libraries. Regarding newspapers, a lot of their fans purchase them every morning to enjoy flipping through the large newspapers after breakfast and read their favourite news. Such people find it hard to let go of their morning routine in favour of free online newspapers as they find them not as enjoyable.",
        "To conclude, despite online reading being popular with certain people, I believe that printed books and newspapers will always have their loyal fans who would never want to read online, even if it was free."
