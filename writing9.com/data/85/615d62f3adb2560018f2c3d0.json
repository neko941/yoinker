        "Although many people think that zoos should be closed as it is cruel to keep animals in zoos, I think that zoos play a key role in wildlife protection.",
        "First, it is believed that keeping wild animals in captivity might deprive them of their freedom. Wild animals are caged in a limited space and fed by humans while they long for a natural way of life. Therefore, many of them might suffer from boredom and confinement. Second, many governments might see zoos as an opportunity to make money. For example, many wild animals are exhibited and performed to entertain and attract visitors to the zoo. Many people claim that we have no right to use animals for entertainment and profit, so they think that zoos should be closed down.",
        "However, those who are against zoos might ignore the important role of zoos in protecting wild animals. In fact, most of the animals kept in zoos are endangered as they are unable to survive or experience difficulty finding mates and reproducing in the wild. Zoos are the only safe environment to protect them from poachers, predators, or help them breed. Furthermore, these animals are saved by scientists working at zoos to closely study animals and their behaviour to help with environmental protection. As this type of research is often carried out away from the public, many people might not realise the useful purpose of zoos in wildlife protection.",
        "In conclusion, the view that zoos keep wild animals in a cruel way is reinforced with a lack of awareness about the role of zoos in protecting the habitat. I think that zoos should allow people to view what they are doing in wildlife protection to gain appreciation from the public."
