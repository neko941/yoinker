Hence, it is significant to bring responsibility in them by giving a piggy bank and restrict it to put a small amount every month for their pocket money. This mode of collecting economy gives them a sense of investment and restricts their spendthrift habits.",
        "Furthermore, one of the striking benefits\u00a0of managing funds at a primitive\u00a0age, it stabilizes the future of teenagers when they step out into\u00a0adulthood. Simply stated, the investment can be utilized to fulfil the further need, for instance, higher education, purchasing accommodation, marriage, and medical emergency.
