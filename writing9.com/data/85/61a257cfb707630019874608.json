        "I am writing to you seeking information about the new course on Basics of Cryptocurrency, starting next month.",
        "I am a 3rd-year student of Bachelors in Finance. I believe that participating in such courses will only increase my knowledge spectrum and can also help me to get a job. Furthermore, this crypto topic is talk of the town nowadays and many people are still unaware of the basic concepts. It is mentioned on the college website that the registrations for the event have already started. However, the information about the deadlines of enrollments, duration of program and fee details are still unclear. Additionally, the website has mentioned only cryptocurrency and nothing about blockchain technology.",
        "I need more information about the timelines and the fees, and if I can pay fees in instalments. I would be grateful to you if you can send all the details over email which will help me to decide whether to pursue this opportunity or not.",
        "I look forward to your response.",
        "Yours sincerely,",
