        "It is often argued by many people that working is an important thing in their life. While others believe that life is useless without a successful career, I completely disagree with this statement since prioritizing work would lead to severe health issues.",
        "There are two major points why dedicating life as a worker does not play a significant role in the happiness of one's life. Firstly, when we are working for companies, it means that we have to be able to obey the rules and meet the company's work ethic and standards. In other words, if we do not finish the workload, taking longer hours is unbearably becoming an agreement or even worse being fired which leads to a high level of stress. Secondly, working for a factory means that you sacrifice your weekdays for work life and only have two days of the weekend for leisure time which sometimes is taken by your family for get-togethers. Consequently, you have little time for yourself to spend on activities you like.",
        "Another prominent reason is the fact that there are many detrimental effects ,especially on health due to prioritizing work over any else in life. Sedentary life, for example, is reported by the Indonesia Ministry of Health as the key factor contributing to severe health issues among workers because workers lack physical activity, thus generating heat stroke. In addition, balancing work and life is seemingly a great way to overcome health problems. Therefore, managing a healthy lifestyle by doing physical activities and not considering work as a top priority in life is a better way of life.",
        "In conclusion, if people pay too much attention to their careers, it would increase their stress level and lead to several health problems. Hence, balancing work and personal life is undeniably shaping a healthy and worthy life."
