        "I am writing this letter to apprise you regarding a piece of false information mentioned in your commuting magazine of the present week edition.  It declared that Hyderabad is not a reliable place to work in an IT field, which is totally untrue.",
        "It has been noticed on the front page of the pamphlet that my hometown does not offer the best jobs in the software companies, whereas it is completely the opposite.  The Nizam city is ubiquitous as IT Hub and many people rely on this industry and migrate from different cities here to work.",
        "It was a surprise for me to read such forged particulars in a highly reputed journal, where many allies depend on the instructions and take necessary steps for their careers.  The publication should be published diligently and crosschecked before launching as it is a sensitive matter when it comes to believing it.",
        "If I may, it is highly recommended to correct the topic and rewrite it with an apology note mentioning the actual reason for the spurious details.  It will be highly appreciated if it is done in the very next edition so that no one will be misled by it.",
        "It will be highly obliged if you can look into the matter and do the needful.",
