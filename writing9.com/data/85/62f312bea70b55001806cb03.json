However, the hot water from the tap just occasionally drops out when we are taking a shower and the heater does not work many times during cold nights. This abnormal situation has largely affected our daily lives and made us suffer.",
        "As you may know, according to the plate on the boiler, it has been used for more than 10 years. Workmen have tried to repair it several times but failed to make it work properly. This indicates that the boiler is not repairable. We asked the manufacturer and they strongly suggest replacing it with a new one as soon as possible,otherwise there is a risk that water will leak and make further damage to the floor.",
        "Please let me know if you can arrange a new boiler for the apartment and we will spare our time to let any installation be finished.",
