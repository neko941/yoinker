Our company chose your hotel for our appointments because we believe that your meeting room is perfect in our city. Our friends did agree with us. Also, they told us about your restaurant too. They said, \" your architect was fantastic and your furniture was comfortable\". Besides, you tried to use modern design. It was wonderful, but some of them were unsatisfied with the food. They order a stack which was not roasted. They said, \" it served cold, raw and salty\".",
        "May I suggest that  you should say about it to your chefs? Perhaps some of them do not have enough skills in cooking and they need to take part in several courses to improve themselves.",
