        "There is no denying the fact that we are dwelling in the age of modernization and old rituals has increasingly become a part of the past. Abundance folks claim that old practices should be terminated. I firmly believe and withstand the given view. This essay will further elaborate on my views in the upcoming paragraphs.",
        "firstly, to comment with, The world has increasingly become advanced and technological undoubtedly there is no need to carry out old beliefs because they have little or no value in the current age in order to explain detail in past there was a ritual of sending gift cards to near and dear on a special occasion and greeting to each other through letter although, presently old tradition died out owing to the technology particularly emergence of the smartphone and replaced with Text-Message and Whats-up. Secondly, old practices are now considered a waste of time and energy. to illustrate,  owing to the advanced tech new machinery is available that was not possible in the past and they are prone to exercise it. such as in past women sewing the cloth with their hands but not in the current case owing to modern sewing machines available that do not make the work easy but also time-saving, therefore, the custom of sewing cloth by hand faded out increasingly as well as not practical in the modern age nor need it.",
        "On the other hand, In the Modern world, gender has equal rights and importance which was not the case in the past, to explain it was considered that women are responsible for household chores and with time, the role of genders and family members has changed. Earlier, women were supposed to do domestic chores and were not given the opportunity to attain education. However, today, it is a daunting task to manage family expenses with one income; therefore, the woman has to go out for work, and in turn, the man has to assist her in managing the household. Admittedly, the old customs do not hold ground anymore.",
        "finally, to recapitulate, according to the aforementioned arguments I would like to restate my position that some practices fade with the passage of time when they become obsolete or outdated as well as when there is no need to carry on further in the future."
