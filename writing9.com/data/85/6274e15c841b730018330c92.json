        "Dear Sir,",
        "I'm writing this letter in reference to your request to provide a contribution from its readers for an article  called 'The book that influenced me most' for your magazine and I would like to take this opportunity and provide details on the book that influenced me the most.",
        "My name is Savita Srinivasan and the book that influenced me the most is 'Stay hungry Stay foolish' by Rashmi Bansal. This is a title which provides insights on most entrepreneurs. For instance, the book contains the struggles of people like Sanjeev Bhikchandani the founder of 'naukri.com' or Aman Gupta the owner of headphone company 'Boat'. This book is really an inspiration for the people who want to do something different or for themself.",
        "This book guided me in a way that no matter how big the problem is like financially or mentally, I will get through it. It helped me to think out of the box and figure out a way to deal with the situation. I personally feel that after reading this title, many will be influenced and will be able to get themself out of an entangled circumstance.",
        "With that, I would also like to tell you that this title is available on audible.",
        "I hope this information was sufficient. Should you require any further information then you can write me back on the same.",
        "Yours Faithfully",
