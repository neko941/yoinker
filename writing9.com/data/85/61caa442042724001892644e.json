        "I'm writing this letter to you because I know you want to find a place to live at the university where I studied.",
        "When I was a student at the university, I lived in a dorm with my friends. This is a good place for students because it is near classrooms and its fee is really cheap. I stayed  there for 4 years. I think if you want to look for accommodation with a low fee you can choose this place to stay, and if you want to make friends and can learn from your friends you should choose that dorm. However, if you like a quiet place to study you can hire a motel near the university. It's convenient but motels have a quite high fee to stay alone. I just recommend it for you in two ways and you can choose the way that may fit  your situation.",
