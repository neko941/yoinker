        "Recently, I have been shifted to my new house which is right next to your apartment. However, I decided to celebrate this special moment with my family and friends that's why I am having a party at my place.",
        "I wanted you to join us tomorrow and bestow me with your best wishes. I would be so grateful to you if you come, celebrate and become a part of this event.",
        "All the necessary arrangements have been made so far. The decorations will be started in the evening. The gathering will start at 9 p.m. as most of the people have their offices and they usually come home around 7 or 8 p.m. Then it will be followed by dinner at 10.30 p.m and lastly, there will have some music show which will be continuing till late night. One thing, I wish to bring in your knowledge that there is the arrangement of speakers with woofers to play the songs which will create loud noise and may disturb you. I know this would not be easier for you to bear therefore I extremely apologize for that will try my best to keep the volume as low as possible.",
        "I look forward to your kind support.",
