        "Nowadays English has gained popularity in schools which, to some extent has overpowered the usage of vernacular. If such a practice is not checked, local languages may go to the verge of extinction. In my opinion, learning English is vital in today's era. Nevertheless, at the same time, we cannot ignore the importance of our mother tongue.",
        "To begin with, there can be a number of reasons for everyone to study English. The first reason could be, it is universally used as a means of communication in major working industries. For instance, a person with having knowledge of the language can be eligible and could opt for a job anywhere across the globe. Moreover, a great amount of information is written and accessible in English. Knowing the jargon, an individual can get access to a vast amount of data.",
        "Despite the fact English is favoured by many as a means of communication, one ought to try to protect the waning rate of native vocabulary, not only for its verbal usage but also to preserve its rich heritage. The local speech is a part of national treasure and identity. Thus, its' state cannot be ignored and should be under control. For example, in the past, many nations lost their identity and disappeared because they started speaking only in a foreign language. This potential threat could be prevented by effective policy from the authorities. Firstly, the medium of instruction in school should be in local accent and English can be treated as a subject. Secondly, a person who is linguistic should have higher priorities in the labour market. So, that more and more people can be motivated to learn their local language.",
        "To conclude, bearing in mind the above information and deliberating all facts, it can be deduced that although it is believed that English is necessary to succeed in all walks of life as it makes one more confident; however, both international as well as native languages, need to be respected equally. Equal efforts should be made by the public to learn both languages either international or local."
