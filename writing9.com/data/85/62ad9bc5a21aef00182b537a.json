        "These days, there are significant plans about bringing driverless vehicles to life. Years later, vehicles like cars, buses, and trucks will be autonomous, and the individuals who travel with these vehicles will be solely passengers. Some feel that there exist a plethora of drawbacks; however, I am of the opinion that the pros outweigh the cons.",
        "Regarding those who see more disadvantages, there are many reasons. One supporting claim is the specific controversy about whether travelling with autonomous vehicles is entirely safe or not. Giving our safety to a robotic system may not be the choice that all people will make. In addition, many individuals earn their money by driving. If self-drive cars become a reality, numerous people will be unemployed; therefore, they will have to face unwanted circumstances such as not being able to pay the rent.",
        "Nevertheless, I firmly believe particular benefits will come with autonomous cars that we cannot deny. One positive side is that autonomous automobiles function with electricity. In fact, they are eco-friendly and aid the world in using fewer fossil fuels. Hence, they will assist in mitigating global warming. Additionally, people will not have to drive. More specifically, when they take a long-distance trip, they will get tired because of driving because they will become basically a passenger. As an illustration, people can read, eat, and even sleep in their private vehicles if their car is driverless. In fact, above all the positive sides, this is the one advantage that will outweigh all the possible adverse effects. For that reason, I firmly believe that the advantages of self-drive cars outweigh the disadvantages of it.",
        "In conclusion,\u00a0 the benefits of possible future self-drive vehicles overshadow the drawbacks because of being eco-friendly, and individuals can unwind in their cars. I sincerely wish this statement to come true in the near future."
