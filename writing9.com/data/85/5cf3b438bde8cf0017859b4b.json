        "I am a frequent visitor to your restaurant, the food and ambience of which I greatly admire. However, my last visit to the restaurant yesterday was an utter disappointment. My family was accompanying me and were excited for the fine dining experience your restaurant promises, especially after the wonderful reviews I have always been giving them. However, there were several issues making our experience quite distasteful.",
        "Firstly, the food was cold and tasted like it was prepared quite some time back. The ingredients didn\u2019t seem fresh either. Moreover, the service seemed to be rushed and negligent of our special instructions. Owing to these reasons, we could not enjoy our meal. Even when we raised this with the staff, nobody seemed to bother or make up for the poor service.",
        "I wish to continue my frequent trips to your restaurant for which I have developed a fond liking. Would request you to take some action. Hope my constructive feedback will help you fix these gaps.",
        "Regards",
