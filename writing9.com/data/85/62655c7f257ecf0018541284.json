        "It is rightly said, Health is Wealth.  Nowadays, it is been seen that people in few countries are facing weight and health issues. The analysis contained in the following paragraphs will focus on the reasons for weight problems and measures to keep oneself fit and healthy.",
        "The major cause of being overweight is an unhealthy diet of people. People prefer to eat various junk foods like pizza, burgers etc. instead of eating healthy food like green vegetables and fruits. Another reason is the work pressure and hectic lifestyle of people. In this covid time, people are working from home which is making them lazy and lethargic. Furthermore, a lack of exercises like yoga and meditation is missing which actually help to keep the body fit. For example, my husband who works from home is facing the problem of back and muscle pain. Due to constant sitting on a chair his body posture is not proper which in turn is affecting his health.",
        "Measures should be taken to get these problems solved. Firstly, people need to monitor their day to day calorie intake and only eat fresh and healthy food. They should have a properly balanced diet. Secondly, although having busy life everyone should give some time to exercise. Going to the gym or walking every day can make a huge positive change in the body. It can solve various health problems like obesity, joint pain, blood pressure and diabetes. As it is said All work and no play make Jack a dull boy. People who enjoy sports can play different games in their leisure hours rather than wasting time on mobile phones and laptops.",
        "In conclusion, being healthy is the most important part of our life and everyone should take care of their body to stay fit and strong."
