        "It is true that the development of driverless has a remarkable improvement in recent years and we will be able to experience scenes that only passengers in running cars showed in science fiction movies. The experience has some disadvantages in personal and social aspects, while in my opinion, the advantages outweigh the disadvantages.",
        "To start with, automatic driving helps to improve efficiency. For instance, when businessmen are on the way to the office, it allows them to address other issues simultaneously, like making phone calls, attending video conferences, sending E-mails. In addition, operators can have a rest on their journey to avoid being tired and the traffic accidents caused by tired drivers are able to decline dramatically. Moreover, it enables companies to find an effective solution and reduce the risks in some sectors which are dangerous for workers, like logistics.",
        "However, there are some drawbacks to automatic driving. Firstly, without a well-trained operator, passengers are exposed to the threat. For example, if a car\u2019s artificial intelligence (AI) system was crashed down on its way and could not be taken over by humans in Standard Operating Procedures (SOP), passengers might be harmed and even killed by accidents. Secondly, employees related to the area of driving and service may lose their job opportunities in the new trend, which will lead to a heavy burden for society. Finally, if the new technology were widely applied, the old vehicles that are not suitable for it anymore have to be abandoned, which may cause damages to the environment.",
        "In conclusion, although applying the high technology of driverless offers several benefits, the drawbacks should be concerned. After research by scientists, the funding of governments and the efforts of car manufacturers, it is predicted that the positive effects of the debate over it  will always be greater than the adverse effects, and because of this, travelling by automatic car is touchable in the future."
