        "Since the last few decades, there is a widespread internet addiction among  people. Therefore, some people contend that electronic gamification is vital for youngsters which makes them skilful, whereas others have a contradictory viewpoint and consider the games a wastage of time. In this essay, I will discuss both sides of the arguments in a detail along with my personal preference as I also take a view that, for teenagers, games are the waste of time.",
        "To begin with, it is true that while using the computer or other smart devices in order to play the games makes the growing children critical thinkers because they have to cope with the complexity and use the logical ideas so that they could be perfect in that particular game. Likewise, they tend to choose  more and more difficult levels in the games and try to solve the puzzles which again develop their confidence. For example, a video game named as Pokeman, in the game players has to achieve  certain targets which are quite hard to meet, so that they could reach  the final stage. Overall, gamification enables the young children to solve the complex series which ultimately a great step towards the holistic development.",
        "Conversely, the other group of people contend that adolescents are getting addictive to the games and totally neglect their other priorities. As a result, they waste their ample time. It is seen that the children who indulge in  online games, prefer the gamification over the study and consequently they adopt the sedentary lifestyle which leads towards them isolation without any social life. For instance, according to a survey in 2019, 60% of teenagers spend 5-6 hours daily in  front of the computer with the purpose of gamification. Thus, rather than studying or taking part in the outdoor sports activities young generation opt  electronic gadgets.",
        "To conclude, with the advent of  technology, the trend of using computers for  recreation is escalating. However, some people consider the approach best, while for others it is useless. In my perspective, long screen time for playing games drag the users towards the persistent health issues and at the same time games do not educate the children so eventually they waste their time."
