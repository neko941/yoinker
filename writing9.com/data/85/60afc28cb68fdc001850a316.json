        "In the past few years, the environment has been damaged a lot due to  industrialization and other more activities related to technology and scientific development. While some individuals opine that only government should take care of the environment. However, others and I claim that everyone has responsibility for the environment.",
        "Many people believe that the government should protect the environment. Proponents of this view may suggest that the government has an official forest department in every country whose main duty is to protect the environment, forests, and wildlife. Furthermore, people pay taxes to the government and they should utilize this money to the wildlife reservation to an environment as well as wildlife. In addition to this, people are busy in their life to maintain their lifestyle and basic need. If they protect the environment instead of their job then they face consequences in life such as salary deduction or fire from their job.",
        "On the other hand and I believe that people are responsible for protecting the environment because everyone is a part of this ecosystem. Further, people can grow trees and make a small garden in their house. These little efforts make a lot of to protecting the environment. For example, in India, an old couple grow more than 5000 trees in their surrounding and adapt many animals including wild animals. Their story becomes an inspiration to many other people to do something to protect this world.",
        "In conclusion, we, people are dependent on this world. If the earth becomes healthy and grows then a human can survive on this. I feel that protecting the environment is not only a government duty, but it is also everyone responsibility to protect it so that our future generations can breathe freely and drink  safe water."
