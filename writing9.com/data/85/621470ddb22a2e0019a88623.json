        "My name is Kamaljeet Kaur and  last Sunday I visited your supermarket which is located at 6640 finch avenue west, Etobicoke. In this , letter i want to tell you about what happened to me when I go there. When I enter to your store floor is too wet and I have an accident there. My back is badly hit by the floor and now I am unable to sit and stand properly. I consult my family doctor about that but he said that I have to rest for at least 2 weeks.",
        "I want to take this accident into your knowledge because I do not want that any other person will also be injured due to careless of your staff. I strongly recommend you to give proper instructions to your staff  that if the floor is wet then hang or put some signal before that place so people who are entering will take care of themselves.",
        "I hope you will understand and surely take any action on this matter.",
        "Your's sincerely"
