        "Education is not just about going to school or university and getting the degree or certificates. Lately, institutes are putting a lot of pressure on children for the test and the same on the teachers to prepare tests every now and then. In this essay, I advocate my agreement with the statement.",
        "Firstly, academics are putting students under a colossal amount of stress by taking frequent tests. Secondly, the increased syllabus in every test adds up the burden to them. Then, students are left with the lesser time of understanding the concepts, therefore, they run towards cramming of the topics. For instance, a survey conducted by the government states that frequent tests have become a regular practice in schools which is leading to enormous pressure and resulting in more failed students.",
        "Furthermore, educators are also under the burden of preparing tests every now and then. They are forced to complete, the unnecessary curriculum in a stipulated amount of time, which then shifts their primary focus of teaching to complete other assignments. Consequently, the main agenda, then moves to the other activities resulting in degraded quality of education. This increased weight on educators may lead to dangerous disease like Depression. Thus, tests should be taken at a specific time of the year instead of frequently.",
        "To sum up, tests are a vital part of education, which helps to access the student's ability and understand how much more effort a pupil. So, the government should make sure that the academic assessment should not be done in a short time of span to avoid unwanted mental illness for both pupils and coaches."
