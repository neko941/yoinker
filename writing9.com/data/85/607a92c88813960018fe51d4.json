        "I am so sorry to hear about your incident and hope you are feeling better now.  I am writing this letter to share that our team Chennai Sharks XI won the tournament last week. It was a tight match, which you missed.",
        "As you know, you are the best in wicket keeping in our team, we had lost our confidence to win the game without you. However, our substitute  wicketkeeper, Dick gave his best in the match and caught 5 brilliant strikes. Like always, I played as a midfielder  and was excited to assist in two run-outs made by our team.",
        "In the first minute of the second half, we had obtained a chance of a no-ball that I could not capitalize into a boundary but it was very close. Unfortunately, Mike, our all-rounder batsman had a terrible knee injury in the additional time of second half., fo whom I was the by-runner and made a strong score of 64 in 8 overs. Anyway, he is fine now after simple treatment. Everybody missed you during the game and  are praying for your fastest recovery.",
        "We all are planning to go on a trip with the cash money won from the match. But, it is only when you are all okay and can join us. As soon as you are normal, we will decide on the destination of the trip.",
        "Hoping for your quick recovery. May God bless you.",
