        "There are different preferences in studying. The majority of people think that studying in a group gives more advantage compared to studying alone. I agree with that standpoint. There are similar benefits when approaching studying in a similar manner. Nevertheless, studying alone also can sometimes provide positive outcomes, making me in favour of both study methods depending on the situation.",
        "There are several advantages of a group class. Exchange of ideas is one positive example that is more likely to occur in a similar setting. It is preferable to use such an approach when working on complicated tasks or group-project assignments because this generates the opportunity to discuss multiple views and challenge different perspectives, collectively solving the given problem. Furthermore, this practice provides a positive effect, increasing our communication skills by learning to listen and also responding accordingly to other individuals' standpoints. Consequently, improving our social skills.",
        "Studying individually, on the other hand, provides different types of benefits. One of the advantages of a quiet setting when studying is that it allows us to be more focused and think clearly. This particular environment is usually preferable at times when we need to write or read. Libraries, for instance, are designed to provide personal space and limit noise so that individuals can benefit from a peaceful environment. In addition, another plus from personal learning is that it can be more efficient by avoiding unnecessary discussion as people working in groups tend to talk about unrelated topics.",
        "In summary, group and personal study have different merits. We have the option to choose which one that we need considering the purpose of the study and the positive benefit that we want to gain. As a result, I would recommend opening both options discussed above."
