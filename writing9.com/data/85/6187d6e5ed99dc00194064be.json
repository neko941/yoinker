        "Dear Mr Smith,",
        "I am writing this letter to draw your attention to the issues that I am facing while staying with another student in the accommodation provided by the college. I am pursuing my masters in the field of Microbiology and often have assignments to be completed at my residence. Because of the new student joining my room month, it has become difficult to concentrate on my work and study as I have exams scheduled next month and this situation can negatively impact my performance.",
        "There are two problems that I would like to bring to your attention. Firstly, She prefers to play loud music in the evening. Additionally, she often invites people to the room for parties. I have already requested her to lower her music volume and plan parties occasionally, however, she has shown the same behaviour. These problems have become a huge inconvenience to me in terms of my studies and work. As a result, I am writing this letter to request a room transfer.",
        "I do not have specific requirements but I would appreciate it if you could process my transfer to another accommodation preferably where the students are from my course or a single room with no roommates; therefore, it would help me to focus on my assignment completion and exam preparation.",
        "Looking forward to hearing from you.",
        "Yours sincerely,",
