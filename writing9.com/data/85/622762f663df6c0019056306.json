        "Dear Arijit Singh,",
        "I am a huge fan of your music and I am completely engrossed whenever I listen to your albums. Luckily, I was present at your concert which was held on 10th March at the carnival festival in Mumbai and as expected you delivered a breathtaking performance. To be honest, I have enjoyed it thoroughly.",
        "I am an aspiring musician and have been playing the guitar since I was ten. Along with playing the guitar I used to sing in my school choir. Moreover, I won the award for the best performer of the year during the annual function of the school when I was in grade 11 and my performance was appreciated by everyone at that time. In fact, I have been a member of a local music band called \"Window of Dreams\" for the last six years.",
        "I am sure you are terribly busy, but if I get an opportunity to perform with you, it would be a dream come true for me. I can play the guitar in the background or sing in the chorus. I am prepared to give an audition anytime if I receive a call and you can contact me at 8746736478.",
