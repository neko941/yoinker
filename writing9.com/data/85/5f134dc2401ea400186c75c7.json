        "The life satisfaction of the older generation was thought to be higher in the past as they were more physically and socially active, but now many live alone and suffer from health issues. While there are two main causes which engender this situation, governments play a key part in tackling it.",
        "Lonely and unhealthy lives of many elderly people seem to be associated with youngsters\u2019 lifestyle and eating patterns. Young people tend to work harder and harder to meet their materialistic needs and often forget to spend time with senior family members. Even though the old have a desire to socialize with their children or younger relatives, they simply cannot have an opportunity to do so due to the hectic ways of life. As a consequence, they seem to have no chance, but live lonelier and unhappier lives than they did in the past. Moreover, because the number of fast food companies has increased significantly, some older people find it effortless to eat in those outlets. This food, which has no nutritional value, is a trigger to illnesses, such as obesity and diabetes.",
        "To remedy this problem, governments can take a number of steps. Firstly, they should consider reducing the working hours of employees who have older members in their family so that they can spend more time with them and show affection. Alternatively, governments can organize events that bring community members together. In no way will older members feel lonely if they meet with their acquaintances and neighbours on a frequent basis. Ultimately, governments should limit older people\u2019s consumption of junk food by, for example, imposing high taxes on purchasing this food. As a result, aged members of society tend not to suffer from health issues as they turn to buying healthier food options having been discouraged to consume fast food.",
        "In conclusion, the reasons why many elderly people lead a lonely and unhealthy life probably has not only to do with today\u2019s fast life but also with changed consumption patterns. The government's actions mentioned above can certainly be helpful in dealing with this scenario."
