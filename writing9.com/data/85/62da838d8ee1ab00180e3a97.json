        "I am writing this letter to express my dissatisfaction with the one-week course on Basics of C and C++ programming languages that is being conducted at your university.",
        "According to the brochure that was distributed during the admission, fundamentals of both the programming languages are required to be covered. However, during the orientation, I was informed that only C programming techniques will be taught. Moreover, the practical hands-on experience specified in the prospectus was missing from the agenda of the course.",
        "In reference to the details in the brochure, I paid Rs.2500 for enrollment in this course, which proves to be non-beneficial. Therefore, I request you to kindly update my enrollment and assign me to the appropriate course that covers all the fundamental concepts of these programming techniques. If no such course is available, I urge you to refund my admission fee.",
        "I am looking forward to hearing from you.",
