        "The significance of art has decreased when compared to primitive times and it is evident that the value for corporate, science and technology has increased drastically over the period. This essay will discuss the factors that lead to this phenomenon and explore  effective solutions.",
        "There are a number of reasons why individuals pay more attention to technological advancement and business. Firstly, the lifestyle in this contemporary society is highly stressful, where one does not have enough leisure time to spend in arts such as music, dance, ancient sculpture. Secondly, the hectic work schedule  makes everyone rush towards achieving their deadlines adding to it, in order to not be obsolete mostly they are engaged in upgrading their skills and learning new technologies.  Lastly, as many lives as a nuclear family, there are no elders to educate on cultural and traditional aspects which were followed for generations. To illustrate, a couple of decades ago classical dance was widely popular in India, but, now hip hop and western dance have taken over; because people believe it is superior.",
        "I strongly suggest a few effective solutions which could contribute to attaining people\u2019s attention towards traditional habits and art. It is essential to create awareness of the importance of one\u2019s heritage, as it could be an eye-opening moment for every individual to look back at where they belong to. Also, the government should encourage people who are knowledgeable about customs and rituals and provide some privileges accordingly. For instance, in Burma, a citizen who knows Yein traditional Burmese dance will be offered a job opportunity in their field expertise by the government.",
        "To conclude, in this modern society the work, technology and scientific development are highly demanding which leads to overlooking tradition and cultural behaviour. However, I am convinced that some steps can be taken to alleviate this disturbing circumstance"
