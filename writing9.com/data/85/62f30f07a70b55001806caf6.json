        "I am writing this letter to show my dissatisfaction with the furniture which is present at my rented residence.",
        "I am one of your tenants, living at house number 04 on the sixth floor in the Supershine Building near the North-West side of Downtown. A month ago, I signed a lease with you for 24 months and you assure me that this apartment has great quality furniture and other modern facilities.",
        "However, I would like to inform you that the quality of some items present in my flat is poor. Firstly, the bed in the living area is causing an irritating sound when I sleep on it. Secondly, the chair which is kept in the study room has gradually been ingested by termites. As a result of termites, it is likely to get broken. Finally, the table near the entrance has draws which are totally jammed. In short, there are a lot of problems with these furniture items.",
        "I would like to request you to either replace these items or fix these issues by calling the carpenter. If it would not the case, I am afraid that I have to cancel the contract, but I do not want to take this action.",
        "I hope you will resolve this issue as soon as possible.",
        "Your's Sincerely,",
