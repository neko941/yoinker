First of all, the members participating in the meeting  would like to thank you for the hospitality and appreciate the outstanding of the grinding staff. Although, I am writing regarding the food quality because all participants were upset to the food served at the lunch.",
        "Firstly, the meats were a bit salty and so oily, and the vegetables were not cooked freshly. Consequently, no one finished their meal and started complaining. Thus, I and my manager who was hosting the event felt embarrassed as nobody eating the food.",

I would like to suggest that more care must be taken about salt and oil standards of the meats, and the vegetables must be cooked freshly. In addition, I would like to recommend that offer some desserts and ice cream pre-lunch.",
