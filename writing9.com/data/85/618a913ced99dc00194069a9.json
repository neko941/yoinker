        "It has always been a heated debate that the growth of digitalized media can affect the key role of libraries for university students or it is impossible to replace textbooks and their merits and demerits. I personally believe both of them play a crucial role in academic studies, although online classes and materials significance cannot be overlooked.",
        "On the one hand, digitalizing the materials is an inevitable alternative that is taking the place of old sources. In other words, having access to mass media can broaden your knowledge and universities have opted to offer their physical materials on their newly established websites, because they take smaller space and enable students to carry out their studies online. For example, if one requires to look for reference resources, it would be much easier to browse through online e-books by clicking on the computer rather than the effects of television which have become obsolete.",
        "On the other hand, textbooks are bound to disappear in the near future since they are not environmentally friendly and they are destroying the environment particularly trees. To clarify, producing such essays consumes numerous trees and demolishes nature which can lead to global warming. As a result, visiting libraries in order to find paperback magazines will give way to digital networks that can be accessed online at universities. Consequently, everybody tends to save trees and articles by doing academic research on the internet to benefit from modern libraries.",
        "In conclusion, reading textbooks instead of modern digital mediums will vanish in the future which means people would prefer to preserve the environment rather than going to universities to find suitable material for their thesis. In the future, it is likely that people will only use e-books."
