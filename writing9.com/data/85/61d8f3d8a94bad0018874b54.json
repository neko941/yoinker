        "Firstly, I would like to purchase a three-bedroom apartment where all four of us could stay together. It must have facilities like electricity back up, laundry room and uninterrupted gas supplies. Furthermore, I wish to get one that falls within my budget between $600000 to $700000.",
        "I am looking for this property in the city centre, close to amenities such as good schooling, convenience stores and entertainment. In addition, if the location is closer to a health care centre would be more convenient because my younger son is having health concerns.",
        "I would be grateful if you could help me in finding a suitable accommodation with the above-mentioned requirements. I look forward to hearing from you soon.",
