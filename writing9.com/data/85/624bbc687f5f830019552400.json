        "Let me tell you my personal interests and hobbies and activities I like to do the most when my free time. I like jogging and hiking so I usually go out at weekends to the parks and recreation centres wherever it suits me to do my favourite activities. Normally, on weekdays, I seldom go out after I back from work and I spend my time reading because I find that reading is a kind of relaxation. I hate swimming and doing exercise at the gym. Sometimes, I play football with my old schoolmates. Although football is my favourite childhood sport, nowadays, I am doing very less on that.",
