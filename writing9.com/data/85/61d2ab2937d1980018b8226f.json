        "Dear Taylor,",
        "I am writing this letter to express my feeling and deep love for you, and to request if I could perform in your future concerts.",
        "I have always been one of your huge fans. You are not only a really great singer and musician, but also a very talented songwriter. There is a lot of emotion in your songs. And the way you perform is extraordinary. Your last night concert delighted us. Your performance was unique, full of emotion and energy. Since the pandemic began, we all had been waiting for it.",
        "I am a pianist. I have been playing the piano since I was five years old. I have staged some orchestra concerts in Europe and the US. Elton John and I did a piano duet on a live TV show in 2019. Now, I am playing in the Canadian national orchestra.",
        "My dream, however, is to sit down at a grand piano on the stage and accompany you while you sing and to have a duet with you, too, at the end of the concert. I wonder if you could kindly provide me with this fantastic opportunity. I would be really grateful if you could help my dream come true.",
        "I look forward to hearing from you and seeing you.",
        "Best wishes,",
