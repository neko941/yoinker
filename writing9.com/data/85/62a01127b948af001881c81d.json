The first paramount thing I want to know is the best hotel near the visitors' area to stay for at least 4-5 days, which can provide breakfast as well.",
        "My parents decided to see the Durgiana Temple and the Royal View park. Could you please recommend some other worth seeing places to visit during their stay? As you were keen to meet my parents since we were studying together, so I think this is the best chance to spend some leisure time with my parents. You can take them to dinner, as I know you have a very tight schedule.",
