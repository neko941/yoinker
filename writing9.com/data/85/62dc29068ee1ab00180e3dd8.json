        "Dear Mr Lawrence,",

        "Please allow me to explain my situation in detail. As you would see from the attendance records, I was not able to attend any classes for the last 2 weeks. The reason being I was diagnosed with COVID-19 and was hospitalised for 1 week. After getting discharged, the doctors still recommended staying quarantined for one more week. Due to this, I missed all my lectures.",
        "I have managed to get notes from my peers and have already started with the reading list. I would ,however, need some more time to get a complete understanding of the topics before I start with my assignments. Therefore, I request you to kindly consider my case and extend the deadline for my submissions by at least one week.",
        "Hoping for your kind consideration.",
