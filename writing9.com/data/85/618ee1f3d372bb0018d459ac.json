        "I am writing this letter to express my interest in participating in the college\u2019s program about sharing job experience with students, which has been published in BBC journal.",
        "If my offer was accepted, I would like to talk about my working experience in actuary practice in a Non-life insurance organization. During the meeting, I want to put a special accent on the best practice of making insurance reserves. Despite this, I want to talk about some relevance between a tax rate and provisions.",
        "During the period when I was a student, I remember that academic materials, which I have studied in college, did not give me enough explanation, because all these materials did not content practice experience. Moreover, legislation is changing constantly, and new best practices become known. The academic basis does not have an opportunity continuously updated. Thus, in my perspective, the data, which I want to be shared, could be very useful for current students.",
        "If you consider my offer positive, I would be able to do this meeting during my vacation, in the next week, at any convenient time, which you prefer. I want to point out that after the 21st of November my vacation time will be finished and my free time would be limited, thus, time for this talk should be arranged in advance. However, before that date, I am free.",
