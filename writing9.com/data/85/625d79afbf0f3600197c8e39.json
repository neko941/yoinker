        "With the advancement of medical technologies, people live longer than ever before. While some people argue governments should pay for the care when the old generation resides in a home, others believe that it should be paid for by their families. In this essay, I will discuss why both governments and families should take responsibility for the elderly.",
        "To begin with, old people would benefit from living with their families. First of all, the aged can lead happy lives when living with their families. For instance, research shows that the old feel belonged and feel respected when they spend a lot of time with their families. Second of all, as offsprings know their parents very well, they will receive tailored care from their children. Unless they were separated and lived in a different place, children would know what would best serve their parents.",
        "On the other hand, governments can also provide support for elderly individuals. Given that they have made significant contributions to the economy, they deserve to be looked after by the country. Moreover, if they had paid taxes or made contributions to superannuation, governments would have to make sure for them to receive appropriate care from a nursing home. For example, residents in a home will be taken care of by professionals who have enough knowledge and experience.",
        "To sum up, both governments and the families should be responsible for the care provided by aged care facilities. Therefore, both authorities and the relatives of aged people should work together in this venture."
