        "To begin with, as we know well painting or lettering is the product of art, but, painting without permission can destroy people's assets and be illegal. A higher penalty can stop them from creating a dirty place, but, this statement did not solve the root cause of the problem, hence, I somewhat agree with those statements. The following reason will be outlined in the next paragraph, it needs coordination between the government and the majority.",
        "Firstly, as a government, their role is to declare the serve regulation to protect people living in the city. The higher fines the higher fear, the majority can acknowledge this logic because it was implemented in other regulations in many countries, for example, the regulation to charge with a maximum penalty when drunk people driving. I suppose this idea will surely more or less solve the issue.",
        "Secondly, a solution for some folk who is not really a bad one, but, they only lack the resource to express their talent. In this case, establishing a learning centre for them is a good idea because they can release their talent by utilizing the appropriate equipment in the legal area without being illegal. Additionally, the most talented individuals can become valuable resources for the city or talented artists in the future.",
        "Finally, the most important factor that can help prevent this issue is nurture. In my opinion, to prevent this crime, we can start with teaching our current children to become good adults, parents should take care of their children appropriately, be reasonable, and listen to them with empathy, I strongly believe that they would never think about being a bad person in the future."
