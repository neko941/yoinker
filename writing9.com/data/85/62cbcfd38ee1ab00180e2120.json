        "Success is something everyone strives for,moreover,it  is about achieving a goal with  enormous ardour and determination.Even though schooling is  a predominant stage as far as the human life cycle is taken into consideration,in the current scenario,there are some people who are regarded as successful  nevertheless contempt as a failure in school.The reasonable reason for this, as well as ,the predominant factors that enable one to achieve triumph will be discussed in this essay.",
        "First and  foremost,the conventional methods of teaching have to be blamed which emphasise  academic subjects while considering extra-curricular activities as hardly important for the students.Excelling in academics should not be taken as the sole parameter to measure the success of a person,as human beings who have low educational background could be triumphant in other fields,for example,painting,music,sports,acting and so forth.To be more precise,a pupil who secured higher grades in an educational institution is deemed to be successful ,however,according to the norms of society, an individual who has been gifted with a plethora of talents, and practical knowledge and managed to secure  employment with high salary package and hence the financial stability  is believed to be victorious.For instance,M.S Dhoni,a veteran in the sports field was unable to complete his matriculation but eventually became an expert in Cricket owing to his talent  addition to  perseverance.",
        "Furthermore, the predominant criteria that lead a person to an impressive growth trajectory are his/her strengths,both physical as well as mental.Undoubtedly,these two aspects play an eminent role that aiding people to endeavour for their aim on a daily basis along with warding off   negative thoughts.Additionally, passion, as well as dedication towards  ambition, are the flag-bearers in the universe of success.This point can be illustrated by taking the example of Thomas Alva Edison,the man behind the invention of the light bulb.Edison happened to struggle around the clock for several years but never gave up  until he accomplished his advent.Due to his hard- work, he became a pioneer.",
        "To sum up,despite being a failure in school which is mainly measured based on academic performance,one could succeed in life as a result of  effort,practical knowledge, the well-being of mind and body and so on."
