        "I am writing this letter to express my concern about the couple of problems that I am currently facing in sharing a room with my fellow.",
        "My name is Arsalan Farooq and I have recently gotten admission to this engineering college. I shifted to Karachi to pursue my engineering degree last month and was facing problems in finding suitable accommodation to live because of my low budget. Therefore, I decided to hire a shared compartment in the college in order to save on my living and travelling expense.",
        "I have never shared my space with anyone before due to which I have to face many issues. Firstly, I usually wake up early in the morning and go to bed early at night but my partner has a totally flipped schedule as he is used to waking up late in the night and listening to music late at the night.  As a result, there is a lot of noise in the room due to which I am not able to sleep well. Moreover, the guy with me is habitual of smoking whereas I have a lung disease so, I always feel suffocation in the compartment and don't feel better throughout the day.",
        "You are requested to move me into another room where I can live alone so, I can follow my routine and focus on my studies as well as on my health.",
        "I look forward to hearing from you soon.",
        "Yours' Faithfully,"
