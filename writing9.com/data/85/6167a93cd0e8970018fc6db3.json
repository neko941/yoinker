        "My name is Sonia M., I stayed for a night at the Hilton Hotel, on August 28th. I am writing to you because I am still waiting to hear from you regarding our compensation after a horrible night at your establishment.",
        "As I explained at the time, there was a terrible noise that woke us up and didn't allow us to sleep properly. What is the point of paying for a hotel if you can not rest? You might as well sleep in your car. We came from a long trip and obviously, under those circumstances, I was highly unpleased and disappointed.",
        "Additionally, when we were notifying our issue, you seem really stressed with other guests, I am hoping that you didn't forget about us. While I understand you are an extremely busy person, I would have expected you to at least have already contacted us apologising.",
        "Unfortunately, if this is not resolved immediately, I will be forced to write a negative review on Google Review and/or other social media platforms.",
        "Looking forward to speaking with you soon",
        "Best regards,",
