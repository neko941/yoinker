        "It is often believed that mobile phones would adversely affect the children, whereas some parents hold an opposite view encouraging children to use them. In my opinion, the use of cell phones could do more harm than good to young children and therefore should be limited.",
        "On one hand, many parents show concerns about the harms of cell phones among children since it hinders their development and I agree. A great number of scientific reports had already emphasized that long screen time is likely to result in low creativity, especially at an early age. In other words, young children are encouraged to actively explore the surroundings for brain stimulation such as touching, smelling, and grabbing.  In addition, it is dangerous that young people can access massive information via mobile devices anytime without parental guidance as they often are not mature to judge. For instance, thousands of kids over the world accepted the \u201cTide pods\u201d challenge on social media to ingest laundry detergent which sadly caused some deaths. Thus, children should utilize mobile devices under parental guidance and better restrict screen time, in my perspective.",
        "On the other hand, some believe that cell phones are beneficial for children. Firstly, mobile phones help to expand social networks outside of schools. Since children can easily make friends by exchanging phone numbers, their social circles are no longer limited to classmates.  Secondly, youngsters are suggested to reach out for help by calls and have more social support. Finally, mobile devices nowadays are not only used for communication, but also for learning. For example, many parents make use of phones to facilitate their children to gain knowledge through online materials other than books.",
        "In conclusion, while people may vary in their opinions, I do consider that mobile devices do more harm to the growth of children and at worst risk their lives when parents do not supervise their use."
