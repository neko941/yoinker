        "One of the most conspicuous trends of today,s world is the colossal upsurge in the number of people who believe that nowadays, lifestyle is changing drastically and adversely affect on the family relationships. Here, in this essay, I will discuss the negative impacts of this trendy behaviour.",
        "There is a widespread worry that this will only lead to a myriad of concerns in the soul of various people in different ways. Firstly, the family members are entirely devoted to their world and their own life and they do not have a time for their other relations likewise, parents and partners so in this case the most  the families are facing breakdowns and sometimes it causes  depression so basically, it affects in a bad way if someone adapting a trendy style. For example, the most famous celebrities are known on the whole earth as  glamour faces but somehow they try to hide but they are carrying a lot of stress and situation because of broken relationships in the lack of time, additionally,there are a lot of examples on the film industry who are deprived of true relationships but on high in the glamourous world.",
        "Moreover, today,s generation is sinking into social media and social status as a follower so in this scenario they are forgetting real happiness as running behind reel growth and lifestyle so which means, the family got affected if someone is not in a real and living in the imaginary life as per following styles in own way. For instance, lifestyle makes a person more materialistic as per this dilemma  human beings are not improvising and mainting in their relationship as a member, which causes a broken family even though , despite they are having a lot of medium to be connected to each other.",
        "In the conclusion, in view of the arguments outlined above, it can be observed that behaviour and trends are beneficial to some extent in life but not for the sake of relations."
