        "Dear Sir ,",
        "My name is Alex and I am writing this letter to  complain about the lack of  car parking facilities on our  office premises.",
        "I have been working here as an iOS Developer for the past 3 years and this company is indeed  employee-friendly but parking is still a major concern for everyone. Most of the employees come from other cities and they prefer to use their own personal vehicle to commute to the office as it saves their lot of time However, due to the lack of parking space they tend to use public transport, which is totally unsafe for female employees especially at night.",
        "Moreover, searching for parking spaces nearby is a time-consuming task for both clients and employees. Furthermore, our business is expanding,  which increase client visit and the problem of parking is worsening day by day. It always put a bad impression on new customers.",
        "So, parking zone is a serious problem and can not be neglected. Therefore, I would recommend you take some prompt action to resolve this issue. Firstly , We can provide parking facilities on the ground floor of the building by shifting the marketing team to the fifth floor. Alternatively, We can talk with the municipal corporation to allocate some reserved space for the parking in the nearby area.",
        "I am looking forward to hearing from you.",
        "Yours sincerely",
