        "I am Raquel Prudente from WTW company and I recently organized an event at your hotel on April 1st. I am writing to give you  feedback that I have received from my coworkers.",
        "The participants really appreciated the arrangements of the seats, they were also extremely comfortable, and the size of the screen was excellent allowing even the last line of seats to see everything perfectly. Furthermore, the restrooms were tidy and the air conditioning worked perfectly letting the place in a pleasant temperature.",
        "However, almost all the guests were unhappy about the food served during the meeting. There was no option for vegetarian people, and the salad seemed  to not be fresh. Also, the quality of the beverages was terrible, the juice tasted artificial and the coffee was almost cold.",
        "I would like to suggest that you include food options for vegetarians on the main menu, the juice should be made from fruits. Also, it is crucial that the coffee served is hot, cold options can be  extra if you want to please your customers.",
        "I wish you a good day and hope  that you will consider my suggestions.",
        "Yours faithfully,",
        "Raquel Prudente."
