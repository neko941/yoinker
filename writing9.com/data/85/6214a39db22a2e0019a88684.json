        "In recent times, countless learners opt to travel to faraway places in order to further their studies. Does this result in more positives than negatives? , I believe the long term advantages of improved service delivery can not be overemphasised. Therefore in this essay, I will tackle both of these views.",
        "First of all, whenever students leave the country for higher learning elsewhere, they weaken the education system in their country of origin. To put this in perspective, the chances to study abroad are only available to the most intelligent students of a country who if they remained there would have added value to the country and its education system. Take, for example, the current scholarships to study overseas that are being offered to students in Zambia, they are  given only to the best and most intelligent at a given period in time. This means all the bright students that the country depends on, leave to develop another land instead.",
        "On the other hand, allowing learners to attain scholarships to study abroad, has a long term impact of introducing new ideas that have been acquired from a faraway place. In other words, students who study abroad bring with them the newest methods of improving service delivery to a nation. For instance, an individual who attains a degree in medicine from abroad  brings with him the latest way of treating illnesses to a country unlike what he could have had he stayed behind.",
        "By way of conclusion, I reaffirm my statement that the long term influence of the students who study from faraway places results in new methods of doing things. Going forward, this should be allowed for all students."
