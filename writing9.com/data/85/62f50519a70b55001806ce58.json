        "Firstly, I incorporate music into my workout sessions each and every day, without fail. That being said, I was not aware of the fact that you were being bogged down by it, honestly speaking. Secondly, there are no such restrictions on playing loud music in our society, The Santushti Apartments. So, I didn't think of taking any approvals beforehand.",
        "Considering all the above, I would like to apologize for my innocent mistake and I will certainly make sure that I am under the limit when it comes to playing music. Also, I am willing to use my headphones if I start my fitness session in the evening, ensuring that neighbours are left undisturbed, especially the children who study at such hours.",
        "Anyway, It has been a while since I last saw you personally. Let us meet on the weekends over a few drinks.",
