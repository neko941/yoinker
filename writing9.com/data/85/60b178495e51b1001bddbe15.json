        "As for the vacancy, it was yesterday that my manager told me that there are few job openings and asked me for any reference. Your name strike first to my mind and I thought of sharing this news with you. You'd definitely be a strong candidate to fill this position.",
        "I think that this would be a wonderful opportunity for you to switch job, as you mentioned during summer vacation that you want to return to your original IT career from the sales job. Moreover, the job location would be the same as your current location so Sarah's school won't be impacted by the job change. Maybe you should consider all the positive aspects of this role and decide.",
