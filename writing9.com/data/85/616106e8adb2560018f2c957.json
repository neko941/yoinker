        "I am writing this letter to draw the attention of your newspaper regarding local authorities  locking the deal with the food chain to sell the park available in the Markavenue residential area . My name is James Austin and I am residing in the Markavenue residential complex and  we are having a small park near there this area which local council is planning to convert to the shopping complex.",
        "Let me explain the situation to you that this park is very important for the locality as people mostly walk or play various sports activities in this place .This park is about 50 years old and sculptures installed in this park of historical importance and localities will be left with no option to relax or rejuvenate if this place is handed to big corporations .Additionally, due to the building of some shops at its outer premises now local authorities are further planning to build a shopping complex by demolishing the park to increase their revenue.",
        "Lastly, people are planning to run a campaign against the local authorities and we are planning a strike so that to prevent the commercialisation of the residential place . I want your newspaper to publish  this in paper and create awareness among the people.",
        "Hope I will get a favourable response from your side.",
        "Yours faithfully ,",
