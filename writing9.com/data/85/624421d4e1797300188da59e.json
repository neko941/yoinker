        "In the modern era, public driving daily for many purposes such as education-related, work or shopping and so on. As a result, they use their private car or bike and increasing the service problem. S0 I completely agree with this statement that the community should reduce the trip from home for any tasks.",
        "To commence with, Firstly, In cities, society travels in their private vehicles and avoid  Public transport. And that is why  Today the transportation problem is increasing. In addition, Students are daily suffering from their studies. Moreover, most of the students choose their own bike or car for a trip. It is a great  service. As a solution, the academy has to provide their university bus or van. For example, in  one area, where many students  are living who are studying in  one institute.So they daily ride by car or motor. However, institution arranges their own buses or vans  area wise so it is helpful for every student and also reduces the amount of movement.",
        "Secondly, Due to ,work every nation travels by using  different transport. By contrast,  citizens should use public transport for travel like public buses or trains. which is beneficial for humans. Furthermore, In  traffic areas. And another thing is that the crowd should travel from home for shopping. In the same way,  many people are going to  one place. Then they should go by  bus or  auto. So it is helpful to decrease the service.",
        "In conclusion. There only method to bring down  traffic problems in cities is to use  public transportation rather than own vehicles."
