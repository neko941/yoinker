        "Childhood will play a crucial role in every individual life. Few of them urge that suitable environment for youngsters in rural areas like villages compared to in urban areas. In this essay, I will discuss the merits and demerits of both statements.",
        "Firstly, villages people to tend be more interactive because they live in joint families. This helps young teens to develop a strong bond with their families. And also children start interacting with different people and they know how to respect them. In ,villages every school management will conduct some visits to farm fields, nearby small scale industries and historic places teachers will explain how crops are grown. Eventually, after yielding how crops reach nearby industries for the end products (for example rice). This kind of visit help young teens to know how they get essential food products to consume from base Additionally, it helps them to think broad. Villages will provide teens healthy environment to grow as there is less pollution compared to in cities.",
        "Secondly, besides the advantages we have a few disadvantages ,for example, In,India in rural areas they don't have many facilities in schools like clean washrooms, neat classrooms and sufficient faculty to teach. These are some reasons for parents are unlikely to join their children in rural schools. In urban ,areas children tend to have good facilities for study and varied courses to join. Even teaching facilities are much better in cities compared to rural spaces.",
        "In conclusion, we have both positives and negatives for a child to grow in villages and cities. One should really consider every aspect and decide how they going to raise a kid."
