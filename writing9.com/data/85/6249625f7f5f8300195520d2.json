        "Based on the released information,the rate of juveniles delinquency has skyrocketed in the majority of  places around the globe.Therefore,not only are some of the probable radices behind it uttered here but also different remedial ideas are suggested to cope with the drawbacks.",
        "One of the most dominant factors of lawbreaking functions from young folks has to do with financial issues as an offspring of being abandoned by both their guardians and  society.As a vivid case, the economic issue is something that children have to struggle with if their parents get divorced.Furthermore,adverse data that is released in the virtual world can be the other contributor.For instance,on some occasions,not only youngsters are invited to ignore the logistical rules that used to be implemented by governments but they are also encouraged  to get involved with some illegal activities,such as hacking others to utilize their identities in order to access their bank accounts.",
        "To iron out this crisis,allocating some fortune by either authorities or philantrotrapists to provide occupational opportunities for juniors may be effective.To enlighten,preparing some courses to enhance their abilities to resolve in the vocational market or even bestowing adequate job vacancies to absorb them.Moreover,imposing some laws to supervise the internet seems to be vital to stop  its devastating impression on individuals.To illustrate,neither occupied censorship nor penalising systems are not adequate to restrict the abusers of this realm,hence,fortifying them can have some positive footprints as well.",
        "To conclude,it would not be an insurmountable problem if the reasons behind the increasing rate of crimes committed by juveniles be discovered.Controlling the internet or the emergence of enough occupational opportunities,for example, can be recommended to limit its rate."
