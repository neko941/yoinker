        "To begin with, when moving to a foreign country,\u00a0 one\u00a0will find himself amazed by what its\u00a0culture\u00a0possesses\u00a0to\u00a0offer.\u00a0This might be regardless if it is extremely dissimilar from what\u00a0an individual is\u00a0used\u00a0to.\u00a0Furthermore, it\u00a0can\u00a0be\u00a0perceived\u00a0in several\u00a0ways,\u00a0such as the different tourist attractions and its\u00a0architecture, the\u00a0way\u00a0people\u00a0socialize\u00a0during\u00a0gatherings\u00a0and even in\u00a0foods\u00a0and\u00a0delicacies.\u00a0Undoubtedly, these\u00a0can\u00a0merely be the few concrete reasons why living overseas makes it fun and exciting.\u00a0Another apparent advantage\u00a0can\u00a0be\u00a0the\u00a0fact\u00a0that upon\u00a0studying\u00a0or working abroad, a person will be capable\u00a0of\u00a0improving his cross-cultural knowledge and\u00a0skills.\u00a0Consequently, \u00a0that could be\u00a0a vital\u00a0positive\u00a0factor\u00a0contributing\u00a0to future job application, since most companies value international background and\u00a0diversity\u00a0to its\u00a0employees.",
        "Turning to the other side of the\u00a0argument, the particular thing that\u00a0makes\u00a0moving\u00a0to an unfamiliar country terrible\u00a0is\u00a0the adaptation period.\u00a0It\u00a0is when expatriates face most of the\u00a0challenges\u00a0of living abroad including culture shock and homesickness.\u00a0Some\u00a0people\u00a0might\u00a0find\u00a0it uncomfortable when being immersed in a completely unusual environment.\u00a0A typical example of which\u00a0is\u00a0in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, where\u00a0women\u00a0are\u00a0prohibited\u00a0to\u00a0mingle\u00a0with\u00a0people\u00a0of the other gender especially with the\u00a0locals.\u00a0Looking\u00a0at the other disadvantage, homesickness\u00a0might\u00a0represent\u00a0a general\u00a0struggle, but others\u00a0might\u00a0experience\u00a0it regardless of the\u00a0number\u00a0of\u00a0years\u00a0of\u00a0being\u00a0away from his\u00a0family.\u00a0However,\u00a0technology\u00a0makes\u00a0it easier to\u00a0connect\u00a0someone to their loved ones, through the\u00a0help\u00a0of\u00a0today's social media platforms.",
