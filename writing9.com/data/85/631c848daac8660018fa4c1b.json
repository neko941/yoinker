        "Yesterday night, I received an invitation to attend a conference on the 1st of December, and as I've never been there before I'm thinking to head to London two days earlier to explore the spectacular city. if it is not inconvenient, I would like you to check up on my apartment and my cat-Toby- while I'm away.",
        "Apparently, looking after my apartment would be fairly easy, as I have a few pots of plants to water and regarding Toby, already, I got him an automatic food dispenser. Toby is always happy as long as his favourite food is there. you need to strock him for ten to fifteen minutes only. and guess what! Last month I subscribed to Netflix, I know how much you like movies, thus , you are most welcome to stay over during my stay in London. I'll be heading on the 28th of November and coming back on the 6th of December.",
        "If you have other commitments and my request doesn't suit you please let me know to arrange the things with the boy downstairs to pop in and look after my apartment and toby.",
