        "I am writing this letter to share my advice for your new TV show.",
        "In my opinion, your program should report Docklands, which is a modern and unique area in Melbourne. Since I came to Melbourne, I have been living in an apartment which is located along the docklands\u2019 coastline. I always go for a walk in the public parks and appreciate different cuisines when I have some leisure time. These contribute to my familiarity with this suburb.",
        "First of all, I think you should report a significant proportion of  iconic architecture which cannot be seen in other areas. Additionally, making a series to present the various types of dishes in this suburb, such as Asian and European cuisines, is an attractive feature of your program.",
        "Narrating buildings and food would be suitable for your new TV show. The first reason is that individuals are extremely interested in trying a wide variety of restaurants currently, and if you talk about several restaurants in Docklands, the program rating will soar. Furthermore, local residents and holiday-makers are more likely to come to Docklands to enjoy their spare time, which can be beneficial to the local tourism industry.",
        "I hope my ideas are helpful to make your show successful. If you would like to discuss my ideas further, please contact me without hesitation.",
        "Yours faithfully,",
