To illustrate, one of my friends has a sinus issue, he keeps on getting ill due to the extreme climate in Vancouver, hence, ended up having a pulmonary disease.  Thirdly, people have problems with cooking and doing household chores due to their gruelling schedule and also no maids available to do this.",
        "To conclude, the public in ancient times used to stay in their birthplace to complete their higher education, but as the world is developing, many of them are migrating overseas for educating themselves.  The pros and cons of it are delineated in the above paragraphs with viable experiences"
