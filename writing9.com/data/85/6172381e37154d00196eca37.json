        "In many recent years, business competition is always in the red ocean. Companies strongly believe that they can conquer their competitors by emphasising their commodities as a novice in various methods when launching them to the market. This marketing way should be seen as a positive development because new features respond to consumers' new needs and serve their lifestyle changes every day. I cannot entirely agree with that; this essay why the business does in that way and will discuss both views, which is described with the supporting reasons in the following paragraphs.",
        "Looking from an overall perspective, it is readily apparent the mentioned advertising method are both benefits and drawbacks, depending on what corner we stand. On the one hand, the mentioned advertising approach can be highly beneficial to companies to easily attract their target group to consume their goods and services. It can effectively compete in the trade war. Additionally, the sell sharing could be highly increased within a short time from customers who have a quick decision behaviour. For example, Apple allows their customer to preorder the iPhone13 before the official launch date, even though they just saw the rumour news on online media and have not touched the actual phone.",
        "On the contrary, some commodities have minor changes, but media communication is exaggerated. Consumers might be disappointed with the brand. As a result, it might not endure on the shelf for longevity. For example, the series of Android advertise the new functions on the phone, but it is minor changes or even not new things. Furthermore, the sharing market proportion cannot be reliable. It might be fashionable.",
        "To sum up, the organisation currently faces an unavoidable situation to emphasise marketing their products as a novice. This marketing development would encourage businesses to continuously create innovation and provide a new experience to the customer to stand out from the competitors. This is a positive development because new features can meet customers' new needs."
