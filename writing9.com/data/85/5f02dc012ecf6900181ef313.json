        "This modern era of fast-growing economies has indeed helped some outstanding individuals to become multi-millionaires or even billionaires. While I share concerns with people who worry about the detrimental effects of income gaps and want to limit earnings, I believe that successful entrepreneurs will bring more benefits to society.",
        "On the one hand, there are sensible arguments in regards to how the income difference between social groups at a high degree can negatively affect the welfare of society. People who struggle to find well-paid jobs may diminish job satisfaction and lose their career motivations. In more extreme cases where envy arises, serious social issues such as thieves, bank robbery, and illegal drug dealings establish. Introducing income thresholds is considered by many to be the solution. Supporters of this idea claim that only a narrower income gap will bring equality and hence, sustain the well-being of a nation.",
        "On the other hand, all the people who earn extremely high salaries run very successful businesses; they are backbones of a country\u2019s economic system and deserve corresponding salaries. Jeff Bezos and his giant company, Amazon as a good example. Every year, Amazon not only remarkably contributes to the American domestic and international trades, but also create thousands of employment positions for the public. Therefore, Bezos\u2019s earning is justifiable for his great achievements. Besides that, highly wealthy people can financially devote more to society. Bill Gate\u2019s charity foundation, for instance, proves how investments can improve countless lives.",
        "In conclusion, I think that income control is a superficial method that should not be implemented and that having rich individuals are advantageous for a country."
