        "First of ,all I am thanking you for accepting my application for joining the graduation course at your college, starting  next month. Unfortunately, I could not attend the class from next month, due to some personal problems.",
        "I have had a keen interest in learning computer science since my childhood, which forced me to apply to the best college in my state. Although  your college provides the best teaching faculty, the fee structure is a burden for a person like me who comes from the outskirts of the city. Furthermore, my enquire about the scholarships for the applied course are currently not available for this academic year. According to these ,reasons I cannot join the course  this academic year. However, I would arrange the educational loan and it will be granted to me  next year.",
        "So, If it is possible I am requesting you to consider my application for the next academic year. It will be a great support for me to achieve my dream to become a graduate in computer science. I am waiting for your valuable reply.",
        "Yours sincerely,",
