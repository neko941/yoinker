        "Dear Eve,",
        "Hope this letter finds you well. Last night, I met Frans and we talked  about our schools' memories. He also told me that you just had your engagement recently. Furthermore, he said that the party was going well and glamorous and you look so pretty in the light blue dress.",
        "It is such wonderful news for me and I feel so happy for you. After a full hard week, I heard a piece of good news and it was about you, my dearest friend. Therefore, I think we should celebrate it.",
        "Here is the plan. Soon after the meeting, I had a discussion with Sisca and Irene about the idea to have a party in our hometown. We plan to have some days off to visit you because we, of course, must have a great celebration before your wedding day. Thus, we agreed to have a night party followed by a ladies' night in Sheraton Hotel, near your parents' house. In writing this, I already imagine how excited our gathering will be.",
        "Nevertheless, please let us know your availability time so we could book the tickets and accommodation soon. Hope to see you soon, Eve.",
