        "My name is Manpreet Kaur and I am a student of commerce department in your institute. I am writing this letter to request you please issue a new identification card. Please allow me to explain my situation.",
        "A Couple of days before I had lost my photo ID. Last Friday when I was travelling by train after finishing my Wallet. I did not realize that time because the train was overcrowded. When I have at home, then I noticed that my wallet has some money and a school card that was not with me. I tried hard to find my student ID Card, However, all effort was useless. It created some problem for me because school annual exams will be started in a few days and it is essential to carry an identification along with roll number slip. Without having it, I could not appear in examinations. So, I request you Please issue a new student ID, so that I can give my exam. I promise you that I will take care of it hereafter.",
        "Thank you in advance. I hope that you will solve my problem as soon as possible.",
