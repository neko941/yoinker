        "It is argued that the progress of people in some particular fields like art, is completely related to one's god-gifted talents. While other people think that everybody has the ability to produce artworks. Personally, I believe that, although having  special capacities is definitely helpful in making some art pieces, everything is possible by hardworking.",
        "Firstly, every man has his desires which can be noticed  from early ages, being passionate about art is one of them. For example, recently, it has been revealed that a number of children are able to draw some sophisticated pictures compared to their counterparts, without participating in any painting classes. Therefore, some individuals are capable to create artworks naturally.",
        "Secondly, some men or women are interested in particular fields without having special talent in those. However, it does not mean that they would not be successful in that areas. They need to be goal-oriented and hardly determined to achieve their targets by practising and attending a variety of related courses. For instance, these days almost all  teenagers can play the guitar but are all of them god-gifted in this issue? Absolutely not. Thus, becoming professional in favourite fields is affordable for everyone. Finally, I am of the opinion that  probably many human beings are not empowered to make poems, whereas when it comes to music and drawing, many individuals can develop by my intensive practices. Nevertheless, these ordinary people may never go for some masterpieces.",
        "Taking everything into consideration, although there are different views about individuals skills in creating artworks, from my point of view, everybody is enabled to gain his/her dreams. The more she or he tries, the most straightforward acquiring the skill would be."
