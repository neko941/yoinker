        "It is often said that people who are skilful in sports have the capability to earn  noteworthy money. Many opine that this is definitely justified ,however, some people believe that this is not fair. From my point of view ,I believe that this is true that a professional sportsperson should earn a lot of money. I'm going to explain both of these ideas below.",
        "Firstly ,in my opinion ,people who conduct difficult fields in sports should earn a lot of money. For example ,we all know runners should have strong feet and for reaching this goal they have to spend time and money to exercise diverse rehearses. There is no denying that merely by receiving much money they can become successful. Additionally  ,a sportsperson is required to eat nutritious meals that habitually are expensive. Therefore ,this makes it clear why the population who are skilful in terms of sports after his or her difficulties can earn much money.",
        "By contrast ,some people claim that this is unfair. For instance ,this is true that this  skill is hard to conduct ,however, these humans believe that there are multiple works that are more difficult than being professional in sports such as becoming a skilful doctor or psychologist. This means they also should earn  noteworthy money. This would probably make a better situation for the population who want learn other subjects instead of sport. As a result ,it becomes apparent there is a noticeable reason behind each claim via societies.",
        "To summarise ,I completely claim that sports professionals should earn a lot of money than others. It is predicted that to continue receiving high salaries the population who decide to become professional sportspeople will increase in the near future."
