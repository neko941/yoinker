        "Hope this letter finds you well. I landed safely in India yesterday. Firstly, I want to thank you once again for the warm hospitality you provided me. I really enjoyed my time with you. It was a much-needed break for me from the daily life and work stresses and the time spent with you refreshed me. For, next holidays, I invite you to my place.",

        "However, luckily one of my first cousins Ramesh, went to your city for an office meeting today. I asked him to bring my wallet from you and he agreed to that. I gave your phone number and address to him and he might call you once he will be free from the meeting. Give my wallet to him. Rest everything is fine and hope all is well from your side too.",
