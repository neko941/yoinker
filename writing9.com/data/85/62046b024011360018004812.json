        "The world is becoming more and more populated which is an increasing concern for food shortages. To contribute to food security, one solution that has been proposed is that people ought to produce more bioengineered food. But what are the benefits, and what are the drawbacks of producing genetically engineered food. This essay will examine both sides of the issue, taking into account their potential effect on human health and the environment.",
        "Let's start by looking at the benefits of producing bioengineered food. One of the advantages of this type of food is that manufacturers have more ability to use genetic modification and give food desirable traits. For example, apples are less likely to turn  brown once they are cut or gotten bruised. Other pros of producing bioengineered foods are that plants are more resistant to certain types of diseases with genetic modification. In other words, crops failure would reduce significantly which prevent  shortages of farming supply for the population.",
        "Turning to the other side of the argument, genetical engineered food also brings disadvantageous impacts in a  few aspects. This is first because bioengineered food is still a relatively new practice and most scientists have little knowledge about its long-term effect and safety for consumers. This means that the observation of how genetically modified foods impacts  humans in terms of health and nutrition aspects needs to be long-term as scientists have to conduct research on if human genetic structure changes after a long time of consuming bioengineered foods. In addition, some people believe that genetically modified food increases the risk of being exposed to allergens. This is because they might contain mutation genes of allergic agents.",
        "In conclusion, although genetically engineered foods can be advantageous in terms of producing highly desirable foods and strengthening plants diseases resistance, I strongly believe that the adverse drawbacks outweigh the benefits."
