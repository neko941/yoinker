        "The meaning of locally traditional festivals has not been remembered by some of those who desired to only participate and enjoy themselves during the time. In my opinion, I do not agree that most people ignore what traditional events mean because they are taught by teachers and families; however, there are some counterviewpoints to consider about the enjoyment of nation these days. Both arguments along with my perspective linked to this topic will be outlined in the following paragraphs.",
        "There is one argument put forward against the forgettable meaning of local events. Recent years have witnessed an increase in the number of people who have not known how important festivals are. It is undeniable that they just joined these fantastic ones for fun. Most of them still not only behave incorrectly but also ignore some step-by-step processes of a holiday period; hence, the meaning is slowed disappeared. In \u2018Songkran day\u2019 in Thailand, for example, hardly any nation show respect to their grandparents, they only enjoy the activities that make them delighted.",
        "There are, nevertheless, a host of arguments in favour of those who remember the history of festivals. Almost all schools included the history subject in their curriculums. There is a universal consensus that adults such as teachers and parents pass their own knowledge of the importance of festival\u2019s stories to the new generation. By doing that, students little by little understand the truth of historical background, perhaps showing that all of the knowledge still existed. An outstanding example seems to be that all children who participated in \u2018Songkran day\u2019 always know the meaning of each important day during that period.",
        "To sum up, despite some only enjoying during holiday seasons, I am of the opinion that almost all people still acknowledge the festival background. Teachers and families are the crucial keys to encouraging their children to know the history. Unless most communities forget it, the next generation unavoidably recognizes the purpose of each holiday."
