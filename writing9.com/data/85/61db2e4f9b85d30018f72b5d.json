Although I agree that with globalization and population increase most problems may be the same, such as traffic and pollution, each city has its own peculiarities.",
        "The city where I have been living for over 25 years is a clear example of that. Here at Ribeir\u00e3o Pires the train station has more than 100 years and it is really conserved, so it is possible to observe a vintage atmosphere in the beautiful architecture. In addition, downtown the main square was restored and painted with different colours, becoming a pleasant place to spend time with friends and family. Not only that, but also nature here is extremely well preserved, so you could see trees wherever you go, and they help to soften the heat.",
        "All those factors are not seen in all town centres from my perspective. So that is why I would love to offer you a tour of my city with me as a guide.",
        "Thanks for your consideration.",
