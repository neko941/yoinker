        "It is considered by many people that have thoughts about the future, and plans are the simple waste of time. Also, have an opinion that it will be better if people live only in the moment, not thinking about any things. I completely disagree with the idea that these are a waste of time, and people should live only by one moment. I believe that people should plan every moment of their life, which will help themselves in the future.",
        "Live only by one second it is not a good choice, because every minute has the ability to finish. I used to be such a person, I procrastinated a lot  and did not see any positive effects from this. From this experience, I understood that this is only a phrase  since most people are lazy to plan their day, or afraid of their future. For example, I am now in my senior year, most of my classmates do not know what major they will choose, or in what city and university they will study. Maybe it is normal, but their phrase\" I want to give everything from this moment, and time will come to choose\", got me angry. Anyway, I know that this is their time, but it seems to be people with this mind have a probability that will suffer from everything, and from hurry taking a decision.",
        "There are several reasons why people should plan their future. Firstly, by this citizens can save most of their time, and will not be surprised by consequences. For instance, if a person will write something that comes to their head at that moment, they can collect these ideas, as what they want to do in their future, it will not even take their time.  Secondly, it gives confidence, that they are moving in the right way, and will not be frustrated by their future anymore. Finally, they can spend that time to do  something than bigger planning their future, because every time is vital.",
        "In conclusion, my view is that people should save their time, it is the most important thing we have in our hands  since we can not return our past, and it is better to plan everything than suffer from consequences of this."
