        "Problems on the streets are increasing day by day because people use these for their movement from one place to another. But, mostly, issues are arising with cars and cycles using the same roads. Let us discuss why this is happening and what can be done to solve this for a better understanding.",
        "To begin with, roads are not wide enough so that, cars and cycles could run comfortably without creating any problem. In other words, cycles are slower than cars and it becomes difficult for both passengers using the same road. For example, when overtaking cyclists, car drivers have to wait for a long time to clear the other side of the road filled with cars for their safety. In addition, Car drivers must follow some regulations applied by the government while, for driving a cycle, there is no rule. There are some roads where drivers must not pass other vehicles like cycles, rickshaws and so on. If they do so they will be fined and create traffic jams.",
        "However, To solve these problems the governments have to think of building separate tracks not only for the commodity of the vehicles but also for the safety of riders. For instance, they could build small streets alongside the big roads as they are already for footpath passengers. Therefore hazardous on the roads will not be created by these vehicles.",
        "To conclude, Same roads used by the cars and cycles generate many problems due to the insufficient width and rules for the commuters. But, these can be combatted with the help of the street authorities."
