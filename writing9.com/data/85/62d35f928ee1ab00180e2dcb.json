I feel that something went wrong and hence, I want to let you know the mistake which was done by the bank people immediately.",

In addition, I need to pay some of my debts and utility bills as well and I am worrying about payments and other commitments too.",
        "Since I have given everything information on time to the bank but still you guys are failed to deliver my card and I would request you to provide a temporary card until I received my own card and this would help me to pay my regular expenses. I am sure that next time there will not be any such mistake would happen.",
