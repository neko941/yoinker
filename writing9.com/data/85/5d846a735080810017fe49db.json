        "Consumer goods have become the mainstay of people\u2019s living. \u00a0This essay is an attempt to study the merits and demerits and provide a conclusion.",
        "In today\u2019s fast paced world, consumer goods are a boon to humanity. \u00a0Firstly, they are available in all categories ranging from automobiles, furniture, household appliances etc. \u00a0While they make life easy and comfortable, they do not cost an arm and a leg and are generally affordable. \u00a0For instance, one can cook up a pre cooked meal to satisfy hunger or reach any far off place in no time by taking a vehicle or perform all household chores such as laundry, dish cleaning, sweeping and mopping at the click of a button of the washing machine, dish cleaner, and vacuum cleaner respectively. \u00a0Hence, this definitely leaves some room for an individual to pursue their hobbies or passions, which leads to better living standards.",
        "However, consumer goods have their drawbacks as well. \u00a0 This results in obesity and other ailments such as cardiac problems, diabetes, joint aches, respiratory issues etc. For example, a recent study carried out in the U.S has shown that excessive use of smart devices can cause neural disorders in people as they emit harmful radio waves. Moreover,\u00a0excessive usage of automobiles is fast depleting our natural resources such as petrol, diesel and adding to the existing pollution levels.",
        "In conclusion, it would be prudent to say that while consumer goods still continue to be a boon to mankind, its usage should be regulated and monitored on an individual and government level to ensure it continues to be a boon and not a bane."
