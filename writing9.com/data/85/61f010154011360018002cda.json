        "Thank you for creating such an interesting course about the Java language, which give to beginners an opportunity to improve their knowledge and understand all aspects of this language.",
        "This was a really enjoyable time for me. I have received more useful information about the Java language. Now, in my perspective, I have totally understood all basic aspects of it. All good testimonials about your school and teacher are true.",
        "Currently, a have been starting searching for  a job in the IT-sphere. However, I think my knowledge is not enough, because I have only basic information. I hope you will create some courses for advanced users in the future. If you decided to start advanced courses, I would immediately participate in them. Hope it will be in nearby future.",
        "I want to suggest some improvements to your website. It does not contain the all needed information about courses in school, like curriculum, lessons' topics, educational sources. The course information pictures only general information about the course. Please write it more carefully and, I confident, this will increase the number of the participations.",
