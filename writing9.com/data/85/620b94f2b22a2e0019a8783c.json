Although,I have lodged a request for issuing me a new card to the bank ,however, they have told me that it will take a week to process my request. Till then,I have asked my parents to transfer the money to my account, until then I will not be able to pay my upcoming month rent on time and I assured you that I will clear my dues as soon as I received the money.",
        "Besides,  there are some flaws in the roof of the flat,as water is dripping from it in the kitchen, probably due to leakage in a pipe. you are requested to send a plumber to fix the fault as early as possible.",
