        "Last year, I applied to a short course, named \"Project Management\", at your college. Now, I fulfilled the criteria which you mentioned in your advertisement and thus, got selected for it. However, I have to move to the city to study the training subject and I will be staying there until it is finished and for this, I need a residence to reside in.",
        "I need an apartment which has a couple of things in it. First and foremost, it must have a separate room for the study where I can practice my work without any disturbance. Moreover, it would be near to the college so it will take me less time to reach there. Finally, it would be economical because I have a limited budget to spend so I would not be able to afford an expensive one.",
        "I am going to take the training in the next month and I will be there on 1st of October since it would be commencing from 10th of October. Therefore, you are requested to arrange it before the mentioned date.",
        "I look forward to hearing from you soon.",
