        "As you may have known, I participated in a course which was arranged by the CPA centre regarding the new taxation rules last Friday afternoon. At the beginning of this course, the trainer pointed out every regulation which has been changed specifically. Then, she explained how accountants and the general public will be influenced by those changes.",
        "I realized the amendment of taxation legislation is extremely connected with our daily tasks as our current job is helping clients to do tax returns. I consider it is necessary for our accounting firm to organize a meeting to discuss those new regulations.",
        "I have looked at the schedules of every member of our firm. I reckon the next Friday would be a perfect time as everyone will complete their current tasks before that time.",
        "If you would like to discuss my suggestion further, I would be awfully grateful to go to your office. I am looking forward to hearing from you.",
