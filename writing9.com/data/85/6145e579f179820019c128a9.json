        "In several countries nowadays, there is an increasing number of people who are concerned and believe that the past of their homes is worth knowing. Every person has personal and different reasons and has various ways to obtain information about the history of their abode.",
        "Firstly, one of the considerations as to why individuals desire to know about the past story of a property before buying is personal reasons. A person who bought a house might be a superstitious one who believes in paranormal activities which could influence the way he or she treats the asset because of this belief. Prior to occupation, there might be some rituals to perform in order to cast out the negativity that might have been caused by previous occurrences.  For example, in the US, there are several houses considered haunted because of unsolved crimes that happened in the past, the most common of these are in the countryside where there is an opportunity for evil-minded people to do such acts. So, for some individuals, it is paramount that every property acquired does not have a gruesome past.",
        "Further, there are several means to gather information regarding the house that is about to purchase. Among the basic details that need to obtain is the primary and succeeding owner of the house, how old and if there is any untoward incident happened for the previous owners of the asset. Also, it is important to know the reasons why the owner wants to sell it, there might have been a significant reason for it. For example, a politician sells his house because he wants to go abroad and decided to resign from his post according to him, but on the contrary, he wants to evade a possible investigation because of irregularities in obtaining it. Due to some other reasons that an asset is being sold, a buyer should seek facts before the acquisition.",
        "To conclude, it is important to inquire about relevant information before buying a property especially for the place people called home. There might be unpleasant experiences that might have happened in the past that will haunt the occupants if not properly considered."
