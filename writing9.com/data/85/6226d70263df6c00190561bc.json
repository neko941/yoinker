        "My family and I stayed at Kyoto Garden Inn. from March 3 to March 5. Although the room was decently furnished, we realised that the air conditioning system does not work after midnight.  As soon as we found out that the air conditioner had stopped working, we tried to figure things out and made sure the switch was on. However, we couldn't solve the problem, so we made a call to the receptionist.  One of the receptionists came to check the machine, and she immediately assigned us a new room and apologized for the inconvenience.",
        "It would be appreciated if you would take my suggestion to set regular maintenance checks for the machines in guest rooms.",
