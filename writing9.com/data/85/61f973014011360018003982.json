        "I am writing this letter to express my annoyance regarding the shared room you assigned to me last week. it is a bit noisy and my roommate is always turning on loud music all day long which distracts me and doesn't give me the room to focus on my studying.",
        "For instance, Yesterday I had to sleep early to catch the first lecture in the early morning but unfortunately, I couldn't sleep at all because of the music he was playing, and no matter how many times I told him to turn off the music and he didn't pay attention.",
        "In addition, his culture is different from mine so we could not reach a common ground or mutual understanding to solve our irritating issues, for example, he likes to invite his friends to share food in the room leaving behind some bad smells. All the previously mentioned issues created an uncomfortable environment that holds me back and struggling to meet my studying plan.",
        "I will be grateful if you consider shifting me to a single room or try to find another roommate from maybe from my country, I believe this can work the problem out.",
