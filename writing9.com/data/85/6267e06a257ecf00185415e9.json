        "I Bipin KC, one of your front desk staff would like to inform you about the increasing complaints by our clients about the front area.",
        "since  our reception area is not as big as it should have been, people are losing their patience while they are queue. There are no seats like sofa and chairs, as our clients have to stand for a longer time period. Also, some visitors were complaining that we don't even have any complementary or welcoming drinks while entering. Moreover, we have only phone call booking at the moment, because of this when two customers ring at the same time, we are only able to answer and book that person, regardless of losing another end.",
        "Although, I believe I can be improved by giving it an extra priority. As people walk in, visitors are entitled to expect the best service, as we provide only pay as you go service.",
        "For this, while putting more focus on customer service, if we would put some chairs on the side of reception place, I believe it would be great. Along with this, we can also put at least some water jars with filtered water at the front, so our clients will at least be able to get rid of their thirst. In addition, we should also get online booking facilities for our services as soon as we can.",
