        "For the past two weeks, I have been travelling for business and speaking at international conferences. Unfortunately, I arrived at the Tokyo airport over three hours delayed yesterday afternoon, due to the technical difficulties experienced by one of your company's aircraft. Consequently, I missed my connecting flight from Tokyo to Madrid, and could not attend the conference.",
        "As a result of the delay, my company had to send another executive to speak at the conference in Madrid. This is not only a major inconvenience on our end, but it is a costly expenditure as well. Additionally, I have had to pay out of pocket for my lodgings in Madrid.",
        "Since the delay was caused by your aircraft, I hope that you will compensate me for the cost of my lodgings in Madrid as well as my additional flight home to Toronto, Canada.",
        "I look forward to your response.",
