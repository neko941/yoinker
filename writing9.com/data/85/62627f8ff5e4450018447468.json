        "At present, in their marketing,businesses often promote the idea that there is something new in their brand. I think it has some positive and negative developments. This marketing policy helps businesses to gain benefits with products assurance which is a positive development and in a negative way,it encourages consumers to buy unnecessary things.",
        "There is ample evidence suggesting that the phenomenon of emphasis on products sales through advertising can develop creativity and profits for business players. Firstly, the marketing team will be encouraged to boost their ideas by making creative videos and stories to present the new products. Also,the qualified  product with a fresh design or looks,people are more likely to purchase the items and the potential buyers can make some comparisons between similar products and make their own choices. For example , Apple Inc had been attracting buyers from all over the world through variant advertising and trust products.",
        "However, every company rely on the advertising strategy and I am concerned about possible negative consequences. Surprisingly, all marketing departments trying to follow the common procedure is to convince the audiences. To be more exact, it can lure people to buy irrelevant stuff ,especially among the youngsters as they are always enthusiastic to purchase new products. For instance, a recent survey conducted by \"The daily star\",a prominent newspaper in Bangladesh, reported that one-third of Indian youngsters opt to purchase products immediately if saw any appealing TV  commercials,which can be the main reason for unnecessary spending.",
        "Taking everything into consideration, it can be said that advertisement strategy is beneficial as it draws in customers' attention which leads to better sales and this can encourage the marketing industry. I firmly believe that the negative developments outweigh the positive ones."
