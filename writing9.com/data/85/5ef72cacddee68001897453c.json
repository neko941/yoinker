I am holding a bachelor's degree in English literature and currently pursuing my master's in English and I have been working as an English teacher at a public school for eight years. Last year I volunteered to teach English in one of the remote villages in Thailand.",
        "After seeing your advertisement, I searched online about your programs and I would like to volunteer in any of the African countries. Let me know if there are any opportunities available. If that is not possible, I am willing to go to any other country. I am available from the start of May until the end of June.",
