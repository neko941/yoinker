        "It is said by many, earning lots of wealth eventually can bring happiness. This is an undeniable fact that money is a way to execute one's basic necessities. Likewise, there are various other means to be happy in life, like, taking a part in social work.",
        "As per the research by Times of India news magazine, earning additional liquidity brings more pleasure. To enlighten on this more, cash can be used to fulfil humankind's desired wants and needs. In another word, if people earn a huge amount in their life they can improve their standard of leaving by revamping branded wardrobe, purchasing a lavish home, visiting five-star hotels etc...Additionally, surplus paper coins will act as a cherry on the top and hence, humans can enjoy a stress-free life. For example, when there will be an emergency situation, one's don't have to beg in front of their relatives or apply for any personal loan with banks. Even, the public can put their children's in a renowned school for quality education.",
