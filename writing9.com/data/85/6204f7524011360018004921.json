        "Dear Sir/Madam,",
        "I am writing this letter in connection with my latest journey organized by your firm. I have travelled by your tour 10 times more or less and the last time I enjoyed the most as a tour guide was very knowledgeable and knew everything from scratch.",
        "The trip itself was very pleasant. We have travelled to Istanbul and stayed there for almost 5 days. The tour guide showed us all the historical places and we had a stroll on the main square of the city, Taksim.",
        "The reason why I enjoyed this trip the most is that Josh, the tour guide, had planned everything in advance and his timing was magnificent. Moreover, he tried his best that everyone involved in this tour has a whale of a time and to go back home with great memories.",
        "anyway, I would like to suggest a reward for your employee if it is in your interest. Honestly, there are not a lot of people who are fully committed and dedicated to their job. So if I were you, I would have considered a bonus for the tour guide which not only will make him proud but also will encourage other staff to work better.",
        "This is all I would like to share with you. Thank you for taking the time for reading this letter.",
        "Yours faithfully,"
