        "My name is John Smith and I am studying  Computer Science at your university as a first-year student.   I decided to live in a university hostel because I am interesting and exciting to meet students from different regions.",
        "There were several problems I experienced from the beginning of the time. Firstly, my roommate was playing the whole day a computer game especially at night time and I could not sleep properly due to the high volume. I already told him to reduce the tone of his voice but he didn't do it at all. Secondly, he used some of my clothes and didn't give them back. As you know, this was an unacceptable manner and attitude for a student.",
        "I would like to suggest you send a warning letter to my roommate to avoid the things that I explained earlier and if he failed to follow please do the proper actions as per the university's regulations.",
        "I hope you could help me and support my request.",
        "Best regards,",
