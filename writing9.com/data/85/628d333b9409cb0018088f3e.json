        "First of all, how are you doing? hope all is well at your end. I have received your letter about the idea of going on a camping holiday and was surprised to see that you have finally made up your mind for the first time to go on comping during this summer.",
        "As you have asked for my advice, I suggest going to Whistler campgrounds and staying for two nights near the lake and woods would be a great thought. You will love it being isolated from the bustling town, traffic sounds and close to plenty of nature.",
        "Although it is hot summer, it's going to be quite colder at night. So, better to carry some good woollen quilts. Furthermore, it's been all over the news that due to warm weather, wild animals would be out more frequently. Hence, we shall carry animal spray as a precaution.",
        "I feel like I would also take part in this activity, but never mind, I will not be able to join as I would need to go to college this summer for a short term course on communications.",
