        "Two weeks ago, I ordered a cover for my iPhone 11 Pro from your online store. I was excited when it arrived but very disappointed to find that the product was poorly produced and unusable. I am hoping you will replace it.",
        "In relation to the specifics of the order, I purchased this leather phone case through your website called \"iPhone Zone\" on September 18th using my Credit Card. The order number is UE#158745 and I am attaching a copy of my receipt.",
        "The issue with the cover is that it does not hold the phone securely inside and has some scratch mark on it. The picture of the item on your website clearly shows that it is black colour iPhone 11 Pro cover, but in reality, it is not made for this model. So I\u2019m sure this is either a manufacturing flaw or was mistakenly shipped to my address.",
        "As a solution, and because I really like the cover I ordered, I am hoping that you will agree to send me another one for free. Otherwise, I would like a full refund and I will be contacting by Bank complaints if I do not hear back from you in regards to this within a week.",
        "Thank you for giving the matter your attention and I hope to hear your reply soon.",
        "Yours faithfully,",
