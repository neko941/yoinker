        "Yesterday evening, I went to the supermarket to buy some kitchen and other domestic stuff. I paid bills at counter number 4 using my credit card. The shop was crowded as usual and I was also in a hurry as I had to return home to receive someone. Today, when I unpacked all the items and matched them with the receipt given by the counter girl. I found to be cheated with 142 dollars for a magic mop and a pack of vermicelli that I did not purchase.",
