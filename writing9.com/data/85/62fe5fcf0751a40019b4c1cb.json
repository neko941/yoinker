        "Dear Sir or Madam,",
        "I am a regular user of your transportation service and take your buses to travel to and from my office on weekdays. I am writing to bring to your attention a few critical issues inflicted upon me and other commuters who use your service. I am hoping you would address these issues promptly.",
        "First, during the last couple of weeks, your buses are making recurring delays and this is affecting our arrival at our workplaces on time. To add more grief, a few buses do not arrive at all. A number of times, I had to wait for more than an hour and then hail a taxi to reach my office. Finally, some buses are full when they arrive, and as a result, cannot take any more passengers from the Victoria Bus Stand. This situation forces me and many other travellers to either take the congested bus and stand all the way in a miserable condition or wait for the next bus. I believe if this keeps happening, it would reduce people's trust in your service.",
        "I suggest that you add a few more transport to accommodate the passengers and manage the timetable rigidly.",
        "Thank you for giving the matter your attention, and I hope to hear your reply soon.",
        "Yours faithfully,",
        "John Andrews"
