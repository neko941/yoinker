        "I am writing to you in order to the news about your decision to close the fitness centre in a few days because of crises in your company.",
        "Firstly, I am a permanent client of your centre and I have been visiting it since the 2015 year. Also,my friends join me every weekend because it is  quite fun to rest with them. Another reason is that in our district we have only your club, so anyway people come to you to have some activity as my community.",
        "Secondly, nowadays our country is developing sports games for their citizens and I believe because of this you can achieve your place in the market. If we look at statistics every fifth person is doing sports. We have enormous temperatures in wintertime, so we need to do it indoors rather than outdoors. We have a good opportunity to do exercises with your brand.",
        "Thirdly, as I said before, if we didn't have another club, people would exactly stop having physical activities, consequently,doctors would meet with  a huge amount of diseases, such as fatness, diabetes and so on.",
        "I am forwarding to get the answer from you. I wish you would review your decision.",
        "Yours faithfully,",
