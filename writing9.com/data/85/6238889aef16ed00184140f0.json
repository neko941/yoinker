        "Dear Mr Summer,",
        "I am writing this letter to inform you about the noise problem that students are facing these days due to the new campus restaurant. Even though we are pleased that we have such facility but this restaurant opens until midnight because of which there is a constant noise of music and motorbikes in the hostel.",
        "Basically, evening used to be the only time when we students get time to study or complete our assignments however, these days it is very difficult to concentrate on any activity because of loud music and traffic sounds. In addition , some pupils are also facing some health problems such as migration  and sleep disorders due to thunderous volume.",
        "One possible way to overcome this problem is to limit the time for playing music with some limited sound. Secondly, the parking nearby should be allocated for university students only.",
        "I hope you will take some action soon, thanks in advance.",
        "Yours Sincerely,",
