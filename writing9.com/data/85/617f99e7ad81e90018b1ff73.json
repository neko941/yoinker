        "Dear Mr. & Mrs. Smith,",
        "I am writing regarding an advertisement published in an Australian family and kid magazine last week. Since you are looking for a caregiver who can take care of your kid and live with your family for a short term, I believe that I am suitable for this job, and I would be appreciated if you consider my application.",
        "I, Jenny Lee, am currently working as a part-time assistant teacher at BCC school in Bangkok, Thailand. I have seven years of experience in looking after under 10-year-old kids. After reviewing your job description, I would like to apply for and take this opportunity because I want to learn and understand more about Australian culture. Since I plan to study for a Master's degree in early childhood education next year, I still have time to prepare myself before the semester starts. On top of that, I love taking care of children, and I believe that I have the most valuable qualities for this role, including patience, honesty, compassion. Apart from my personality and skills, I also got a certificate in-home care and driving license.",
        "As mentioned above, I am planning to pursue further education in early childhood education in Australia. Therefore, during my pastime, I will prepare for studying and joining the local communities to gain more experience about local cultures.",
        "I look forward to hearing from you.",
        "Sincerely,",
