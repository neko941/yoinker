        "Dear Chinelo,",
        "Good day to you. I am writing to inform you about a Project Management training course that I would  love to do. The program is about enhancing project deliverables and equipping individuals on how to manage and direct a project. I am bringing this to you, because this was part of our discussion during my last appraisal.",
        "So, In order for me to partake in this training, I would need the approval of the company's HR manager before I can register for it. Also, I would need the company's letter-headed paper to file in my application. Moreover, the good thing is that we can get a discount if we have more than five people registering for this same course.",
        "Furthermore, I have gone through the curriculum of the training and I can see that after the program, I should be able to handle delicate and high-level tasks for our unit.",
        "Finally, I do hope you can kindly consider this request with high priority. Thank you and have a wonderful day.",
        "Yours Sincerely,",
