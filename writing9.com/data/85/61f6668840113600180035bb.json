        "As you know my husband and I ran a family business of retail for more or less 10 years and our financial status was pretty great. Unfortunately, after my husband passed away last month our business profit has been a grave issue. Honestly, I was just been able to pay my staffs salary and I have not been able to even pay my children's tuition fees ever cents.",
        "The house is one of my biggest problems right now. Simply put, I do not need a seven-bedroom house anymore now that I am struggling and grieving. I cannot not only pay the rent but also pay the maid to clean my house.",
        "Anyway, I would like to ask you to change my residence to a three-bedroom cost-effective house or even an apartment if it is possible. This way I will be able to accommodate my family's needs and also I am able to pay the rent on time.",
        "This is all I would like to share with you. Thank you for taking the time to read this letter.",
