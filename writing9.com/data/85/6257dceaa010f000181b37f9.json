        "It is evident that wearing a uniform in companies and organizations has many benefits for some purposes and jobs  however I still believe it seems to be reluctant  for people to some extent.",
        "It is clear that uniform plays an important role in  particular professions  such as a doctor, police, flight fire and so on. It becomes a symbol of this job , citizens easily  distinguish them in the crowd and support them when  they are  implementing their duties. As a result , those who are worm dress code seem to know-how are responsible for their work . Additionally , private companies utilise dress for advertising their brand and images to the public. For example, the global company DHL  requires  their worker to wear uniforms with decorating yellow T-shirts and red letters\" DHL\" leading  that when individuals see this decoration they will think of DHL company.",
        "On the contrary , many folks feel forced and uncomfortable when they wear the same clothes as others , that they could illustrate their style trendy  or their personality through boring costumes. especially  with related employments of art , the population would be lost innovation and creativity and then they become outdated with fashional industry. For instance, actors, actresses, or celebrities couldn`t be standout at events or any projects if they use uniforms. Therefore, the number of individuals demand terms of fashion increasingly every day  developing many fields related to clothes.",
        "In conclusion, there are many advantages when government and specific companies use dress codes thus depending on the purposes and departments  people opt for clothes for that"
