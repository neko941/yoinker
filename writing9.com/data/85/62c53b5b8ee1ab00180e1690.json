        "I am writing to bring to your attention the issue that I have been facing due to the early closing hours of the library. I believe this is a cause of concern for many other students as well thus I would like to make some suggestions to alleviate the problem.",
        "I am Jack Brown, a first-year student at the university. Currently, I am pursuing Post Graduation Diploma Course in \"Advertising and Public Relations\" at the university. I have to visit the library quite often, almost every day to complete my assignments and refer to some of the books on course topics.",
        "Though I am unable to sit there for long as the library closes at 5 pm and I get only two good hours after the lectures. Moreover, the problem aggravates as the exam approaches as all the reference books are only available at the library and some are even not applicable to be issued by the students. Furthermore, it is very difficult for me to study in the dorm as I need a peaceful environment for that.",
        "I would request you to discuss the matter with the university management and request to extend the opening hours. In fact, even two hours extension would be of great help.",
        "I hope you will pay heed to my words and take prompt action. Also, please do not hesitate to discuss the matter any further.",
        "Yours faithfully,",
