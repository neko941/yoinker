        "In the modern world companies often, claim in their advertisements that their items are new in some aspects. The manufacturing plant's employees have deliberation that, through this , they can increase their profit ratio and also make a stable place in the competitive market. I consider  this to be a positive aspect  because it benefits  both, the public and the association.",
        "The community, considering its sell numbers, add minor alterations to its output in order to market that as brand new. Although  they have not made a considerable improvement that changes the whole production, they sell this with new labels, with confidence it can change customer lives. For instance, the Apple team sell their line of iPhones each year with minor technological improvements and we citizens, energetically buy that because of the trust we have in the brand.",
        "Furthermore, this development is positive, because, as it not only helps the brand to grow more in a number of their sales figures  but also by providing an advanced version of that device.
