        "In recent decades, the worlds' empty lands that do not have any use of them, have been under attack by the construction of buildings, industries, and the expansion of farm fields. They all create negative effects on the plants and animal species. Following this, some people believe that it is already too late to take any reactions to this problem, whereas others argue that this affirmation and effective measures can be taken to promote and reduce these situations. From my perspective, I agree with the latter.",
        "To start with, some people hold the view that the damages caused by human activities to wildlife are irreversible. The major reason is many species of plants and animals are disappeared from our planet, and it is impossible to get them back. For example, polar bears are not able to take a break while swimming because there are no lands for them to do that as the glaciers are melting due to global warming. Meanwhile, human activity is the main cause of global warming. Hence, in those people's opinions, nothing can be done to tackle this problem.",
        "The government should introduce new law about the restriction of deforestation. This is because the disappearance of forests will speed up the extinction of species. For instance, If the government outlawed deforestation, many people would not able to cut the plants which protect the habitat for animals to live. As a result, the variety of species is guaranteed. Similarly, individuals ought to raise their awareness of environmental issues, and spread it out to others. Therefore, reducing the bad influence on species of animals and plants is not a hard thing to do.",
        "In summary, although there are some hardships for solving save the plants and animals who all are in danger, it is our responsibility to save the world from the negative influence."
