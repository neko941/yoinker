        "Dear Sir",
        "I am writing this letter with reference to the complaints that have been received from various visitors about our reception area.",
        "Many people have complained about the furniture, ambience, and air conditioning. Based on my personal inspection, I felt the same as the chairs in the reception space are very old and no one feels comfortable sitting on those. It has been noticed that a false smell is coming out from the same old furniture. Apart from all these, the room for hot due to the non-functioning AC.",
        "Since the reception area plays a vital role in impressing our customers and many others, to evade further complaints, I would like to suggest the following to improve the situation. Firstly, the air conditioner should be made functioning to keep the air cool in the room and also the existing furniture to replace with a new one to provide a comfortable sitting place.",
        "I hope my suggestions are good to implement to reduce the negative feedback.",
