        "It is true that in many countries , people of all ages tend to choose to live alone and claim that it can be more advantageous for them .While some individuals argue that living with a roommate can have some obvious merits, I take the view  that living alone can be the best choice.",
        "On the one hand , there are some reasons that why the population choose to have a roommate at home . The strongest reason is that being  alone can lead to having a strong feeling of loneliness which could cause  some mental health problems. For example, many studies show that being alone for a long period of time may engender some mental troubles such as depression and anxiety . In addition , sharing a  house  with other humans can be an economic decision because that means the rent of a house will be divided into two or more sums of money and therefore they will pay less  money .",
        "On the other hand , living alone can be a suitable choice for several reasons . Firstly , this approach can help persons to build a strong and independent personality . In other words , facing  all problems alone and without help can undoubtedly empower the mindest and increase the will of a person also being responsible for all household and daily tasks can learn the population a lot of personal skills such as discipline and work hard . Consequently , those persons have more chances to succeed in life and achieve their goals in the future . Secondly , being without a roommate at home can give individuals more personal space because the entire place is their personal bubble . For instance , people who share their residence  with other humans  have less  privacy which is not healthy for the development of the personality .",
        "In conclusion , although I think that being with another person at home can have some advantages , I strongly believe that being alone is the best decision because it provides more privacy and helps persons to build a strong character ."
