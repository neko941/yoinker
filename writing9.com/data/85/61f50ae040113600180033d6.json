        "Dear Mr Grace,",
        "I am writing this letter in connection with the brand new printer I happened to know which will be quite helpful in our department. I believe it is in everyone's best interest to have the state of the art equipment which is also cost-effective.",
        "The printer launched last month and it is a compact inkjet with all features one could ask for. Although the printer speed is slow, it can duplex print and photocopy stack off up to 50 pages.",
        "As you know in our office we are bound to copy and print more than hundreds of contracts every day so I asked to make the job easier and get a better print quality I believe this printer would be the best for us.",
        "Anyway, I would like to offer some suggestions to be able to purchase this up-to-date feature. First of all, we should sell all our old printers in the department in order to use the fund to be able to buy a new one. Secondly, there is a chance in which we could use the office pond which we collected last month for buying a new air purifier.",
        "This is all I would like to share with you. Thank you for taking the time to read this letter.",
        "Yours faithfully,"
