        "Dear Sir,",
        "I am writing to you to inform you about the  incident, which happened last Friday while I was driving one of your autos.",
        "I rented  my motor from your Bishop  Stortford Branch of yours on the 15th of June at 12pm. After fulfilling the relevant paperwork and deposit, I started my journey towards Wakefield from your office at 12.15pm, which was scheduled earlier.",
        "About the incident, I was driving over 100 miles an hour on a comparatively busy road, and the rain was getting  heavier, which caused the road slippery and suddenly I lost balance of the rented motor near M15. Fortunately, the windscreen was only smashed, which cut my right arm.",
        "Therefore, I decided  to cancel my journey and called my office, car hire company, and insurance  company subsequently. My insurance company will repair the windscreen damage of the motor, and I am still waiting for the penalty from you.",
        "I am awaiting your response.",
        "Yours faithfully,",
