        "At present we are living in a modern era. In this modern, world we have the availability of modern technologies. By using this we can make new friends. Some people said that it is a splendid idea whereas others oppose and says face to face friendship making is a better idea. In my point of view, people should make friends face to face.",
        "To begin with, face to face friendship is better because it is safe. If people make friends by talking side by side they will understand their feeling and emotion. In addition, people can understand other people nature and their characteristics. Moreover, it gives us chance to know a person very closely. Furthermore, if people make face to face friendships it is beneficial in many ways, such as, they can help each other when needed, they can spend quality time together, watching movies together and so on. For example, my best friend's name is Rossi, we first meet at school, since then we have had a friendship, and it is getting stronger day by day. We both help each other when we need. We do care for Each Other as well.",
        "On the other hand, some people feel that making friends on social media and on websites are the best idea. They can meet new people and make new friends. They can know about new cultures, traditions and environments. Similarly, they can deteriorate the discrimination between countries. In the same way, it is not safe because sometimes people face many problems when they make new friends on social media. Sometimes boys use girls photos and send friend requests on Facebook and they misuse them. For instance, I read an article, where I read many people now using false pictures and misguided others.",
        "In conclusion, I can say that every coin has two sides like making new friends face to face and on social media. In my point of view, people should make friends face to face."
