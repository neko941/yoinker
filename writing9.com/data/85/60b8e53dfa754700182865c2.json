        "Is travelling experience best when travelled  alone or in a group? This is the issue often argued.From the perspective of travelling alone,it provides freedom on contrary ,to travel in a group which is economical .This essay shall discuss both views .I am in the opinion that travelling in a group is beneficial.",
        "On the one hand, people who favour exploring places singly,claim that it will be comfortable in addition to  having freedom . There will not be any restrictions at the visit.Moreover, a single person can communicate with the locals and create rapport easily than the masses.For Example, A solo visitor will be easily invited to know about the customs of a place by a local to his or her home.Hence, many tourists who want their privacy and do not want any interference from others will wish to be on a solo journey.",
        "On the other hand, human beings are social animals and will enjoy with people around them.Moreover, voyaging in groups will be economical .For instance, when in group journey expense,hotel room cost etc will be shared and will not be a burden on one person.What's more,people can share their experiences and will have company.Therefore, I believe the mass journey is beneficial .,Furthermore we can have lifelong memories as we develop close bonding during the trip.",
        "In conclusion, single visitors enjoy their privacy and freedom while mass travelling will be cost-effective and people can have company.However, I m in favour of travelling in a group.as it cherishes the friendship and builds a strong bond,"
