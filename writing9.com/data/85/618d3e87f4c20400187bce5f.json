        "Nowadays, armed police forces are playing a significantly vital role in keeping the safety of communities. Yet, there remains a controversial debate as to whether their allowance for carrying warm weapons can be an influential factor in reducing the rate of violation or is a motivation for higher crime.This essay will discuss the proposed topic from both sides of view with some detailed explanations.",
        "Firstly, without ,guns it is not possible to defend  inhabitants from the dangers of criminals. This is an indisputable fact that most of the offenders carry guns, which presents the significance of having firearms for the police. Furthermore, if the culprits are aware of the fact that these safe holders own warm weapons, they will be cautious about their actions; thus, the level of breaking law will be limited and reduced to a minimal level that is an influential criterion in raising the living standards in a region. Consequently, it can be clearly justified that the policemen are not strong enough against the offenders without guns since they can be victims themselves.",
        "On the other hand, the crowd may be motivated to buy guns for themselves to ensure their safety. A policeman with a gun can transfer the concept of a need for guns to the community living in the area resulting in a significant rise of violations in the zone. For instance, by observing the armed forces in a region, the settlers can be encouraged to purchase armoires as an effective tool to protect their loved ones; meanwhile, the lack of knowledge about these perilous elements can play a reversible outcome for the population since it can increase the threat for the families in their accommodation, particularly for the younger generation. Additionally, it can be an excruciatingly negative parameter to enhance the policemen with guns based on their destructive influences on the public to provide armoires.",
        "As a way of conclusion, I once again reaffirm that armed forces can both prevent the vicious and increase the aggression in the zone; however, I strongly believe the role as barristers with the help of armoires can be more sacrifying. In addition, it is highly recommended to educate the nation about the necessity of holding warm weapons for the police forces as long as avoiding them from buying guns for themselves."
