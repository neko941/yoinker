        "My name is Abhay, living in the new boys' hostel, room no:148. The purpose of writing this letter is to express sheer annoyance regarding irresponsible behaviour from my roommate, Harshal. For the last 2 months, he is organising parties on each alternate day in the hostel room.",
        "During the parties, he invites most of his friends from outside of the hostel which is not permitted as per hostel rules and regulations. Firstly, I thought it will be ended in a few days but to my bitter ,surprise it is increasing day by day furthermore his outsider friends speak vulgar language and also plays the music at a high sound, subsequently it affects  my studies and sleeping pattern too.",
        "Therefore, for the purpose of reducing this, I want to request you kindly take the appropriate action against him in the upcoming week. If you not taking this, then I have to leave the hostel immediately as semester exams are in next month. I don\u2019t want to lower my grades because of others.",
