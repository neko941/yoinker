        "Competitions are a ubiquitous phenomenon, it occurs whether when we are fully grown adults or a child. The feeling of competitiveness affects us on a whole-body scale, ranging from mentality, physical developments and even sanity. With such a relevant appearance, the debate on the effects of competitiveness has been ongoing for several decades and many communities regard a competitive environment as positive. Personally, I also agree with the idea as the disadvantages\u2019 causes can be quickly diagnosed and thus, addressed.",
        "Competitiveness plays as a stress source in one\u2019s life, yet, it is considered one of the largest encumbrance to ever be known. The ultimate goal of a competition is to not lose to others. However, to accomplish such a statement is a much more abstruse and laborious task. One is heavily pressured to both observe others\u2019 progress and seek the finest strategy. Take a marathon race as an example, a person will need to calculate how long a sprinting interval should last before reaching the finishing line that is at least five kilometres ahead while competing with more than a hundred participants. In another word, we will have to force our mind to work much more excessively in order to succeed. In some cases, our physical state is affected and it varies for different fields.For instance, a blue-collar worker can find spinal problems as much sitting is required while an athlete trains more than his common plan.",
        "If one is unable to find the best key to victory, the feeling of frustration, irritation and depression arise as a result and those affect the metabolism. It can be deduced this is caused by either too much emphasis is given to a sole competition or paying attention to numerous ones at a time. The most obvious solution is to calm oneself and remain sane. In fact, competitiveness allows the feeling of innovation and motivation. One will need to learn and work much harder to either remain in his position or surpass others. Meanwhile, uncountable knowledge and experiences are gained along the way. Those are undoubtedly beneficial no matter the fields. The most likely example is Japan. This country has been encouraged to develop its technology to the peak as the governments undoubtedly comprehend that being the most advanced country in the world rewards them with even more opportunities such as investment in developing nations.",
        "In general, competitiveness will only come at a healthy rate unless a person pushes himself more than necessary. There will inevitably penalty for trying much too hard namely continuous and strenuous exhaustion."
