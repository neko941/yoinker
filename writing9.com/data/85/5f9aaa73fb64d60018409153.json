        "Nowadays, life expectancy after retirement has increased in many countries. This causes problems that it is important to find solutions to.",
        "There are many problems associated with the increase in average life expectancy. The first one is that there would be a financial burden for young people. This is because longer life expectancy means pension funds now have to pay out much more than the money was paid into them, and the working population has to pay much higher taxes to subsidise the entire elderly population. Another problem is the pressures on medical care. Long life expectancy does not mean a healthy life as most aged people survive on medications and usually require care. Therefore, it is a foreseen future that a shortage of care providers such as doctors or nurses will be exacerbated, and elderly care facilities will be strained.",
        "On the other hand, the problems caused by people living longer could be solved with several solutions. To deal with the financial problem, governments should increase the retirement age, so more elderly people will be able to continue to work and support themselves. In addition, each person at working age should save more for their pensions so that we might be unnecessarily dependent on our children or the government\u2019s subsidies after being retired. Another measure is to reduce the pressure on the health care system. This could be done by technology advancements such as using robots to replace the role of nurses in caring for old people, or elderly people themselves should lead healthy lifestyles to avoid having to go to hospital regularly.",
        "In conclusion, the fact that people live longer after retirement is not just beneficial to our society because of a range of problems created. However, these issues can be resolved if both governments and individuals take efforts."
