        "Someone claims that environmental problem is updated from an individual issue for every single country to vital international trouble. In my view\uff0cthis question will never be solved unless all individual countries and people collaborate together. I will prove my point by giving examples about the failure of environmental protection that the single country or person tries separately and analyzing the benefits that are produced when environmental problems are solved at an international level.",
        "On the one hand, an Individual country or person is usually failing on environmental protection due to the interruption from other countries. Let\u2019s firstly take countries as an example\uff0cChinese marine conservation program was abolished simply because of the Japanese nuclear-waste discharging plan. In addition, whether how hard we try to avoid using plastic products or reducing carbon dioxide footprint,  pollution still exists since the fixed modern lifestyle. Thus, the conflict between different countries and the burden from urban lifestyle may cause the failure of environmental protection.",
        "On the other hand \uff0cthe efficiency of environmental protection will definitely increase when all people work together. For instance, it would be easy to imagine that the worldwide environmental policies are all agreeable by then. I mean, instead of making a specific conservation policy for one\u2019s own country, all of the preservation rules are the same as one. In this way, we may no longer worry about offending other country\u2019s territory rights, making the conservation campaign more efficient. As for individuals, working together is always more productive than working alone, which is an undeniable truth.",
        "In ,conclusion \uff0ccompared with the limitations that working alone, either for countries or for people \uff0cmaking efforts together to fight against global environmental issues is more efficient. So, that is why I advocate that environmental problems should be solved by all people around the world."
