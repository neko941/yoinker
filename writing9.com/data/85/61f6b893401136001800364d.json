        "Conversely,there are myriad things apart from cash that can make you happy like individual's satisfaction.In other words,although a person carries a lot of pay  still personal satisfaction is a necessity if an individual wants to stay happy.For example, the latest incident of a famous Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput gives a lesson that it is the personal satisficial which is most important in the life of a person rather than holding a lot of payment.In the end,with the help of monetary ,terms an individual can buy distinct things but they cannot purchase happiness.",
