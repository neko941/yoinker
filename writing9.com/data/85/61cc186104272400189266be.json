        "Please let me explain what happened  that night. First, I admit that it is sometimes difficult for single mothers like me to handle the relationship between myself and my teenage daughter. She had played the video games for nearly 4 hours after dinner, So I had to convince  her to go to bed instead of continuing to play. However, a peaceful argument  somehow tends to loud quarrels. Finally, we both realized argument is not helpful at all.",
        "I apologize to wake you up at late night and I am also considering  better ways in educating my child.  In fact, my daughter actually had a verbal agreement with me that she made a promise to go to bed on time. So it will not happen again as we promised.",
