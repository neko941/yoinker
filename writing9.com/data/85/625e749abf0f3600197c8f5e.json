        "Many processed foods and drinks are packed with sugar and this leads to many health issues. I agree that to reduce sugar consumption, carbohydrate-packed commodities should be sold at a higher price.",
        "Many individuals over-consume sugary products because they are cheap. For example, in the United States, many fast-food restaurants offer free refills on sodas. As a result, customers tend to have two or even three sodas at a meal. If these restaurants are required to implement a 20% tax on these drinks and stop supplying free refills, many customers probably wouldn\u2019t order one at all, let alone have a second one. A regulation like this could be extremely effective in terms of preventing obesity among low-income folks since many of them are high consumers of cheap carbohydrate-sweetened foods and beverages.",
        "In addition, making high-sugar commodities more expensive can promote healthier eating choices. This is because if the prices of these goods increase to a point at which individuals are unable to afford them regularly, they may turn to foods that are healthier and more affordable. For instance, if a can of strawberry-flavoured beverage costs 3 times the price of a box of fresh strawberries, why not choose the cheaper fresh fruits which can also satisfy a craving for sugar. Although fresh fruits also contain sugars, natural sugars are much healthier than added ones.",
        "In conclusion, sugar-sweetened commodities should be made more costly to reduce sugar intake. For one thing, the over-consumption of these products is partly because of their low cost. For another, increasing their price could encourage people to choose healthier food."
