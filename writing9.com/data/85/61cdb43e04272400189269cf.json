        "News media has a great potency to increase the violence in society. I strongly agree with this statement and I believe that, because of brutal videos shown on news channels and action-packed cartoon shows, individuals get influenced to commit crimes. In this essay, I will discuss these reasons with relevant examples.",
        "Firstly, graphic content shown on TV can manipulate a younger audience , causing the rise of opportunities for the children to be exposed to those activities. A substantial amount of watching this type of program will trigger and inspire them to do the same in the outside world. In reality shows, for instance, professional bodybuilders attack each other for money, ripping their clothes apart. As a result, kids will normalize those acts in their interactions.",
        "Secondly, there is a case to be made about violence in cartoons. In this generation, the violence shown in cartoons exposes children to things that they should not have to experience at such a young age. This can be seen with the difference in the types of cartoons that are being shown. In the nineties, for example,  we had cartoons such as Tom and Jerry, depicting how two friends tease each other but at the time of danger, they fight together , whereas now the children are watching cartoons such as Ben 10, which portray extreme rampage.",
        "To conclude, there are numerous reasons which support my opinion that the higher the society broadcasting brutality, the more those kinds of behaviours reflect in real life. Hence, it is important for the government to make certain rules and regulations, and bring more peace to the environment."
