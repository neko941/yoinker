        "In the present ,world governments tend to spend money to boost all fields like traditional arts, music and acting so, that people from all fields get equal opportunities to grow. However, some people believe that this money should be put into social service instead. I denounce the said statement and the reason for such viewpoints will be discussed in the following paragraphs.",
        "The first supporting reason for my point of view is that in every country there are people who are more creative than others and as , a result they are interested in various activities like arts, music and drama. If the government decides not to support these fields then these people will not get enough opportunities to grow. For instance, it is estimated that more than five lakh people are engaged in movies in India. If these organizations are not supported by government agencies then a greater number of people will lose jobs.",
        "The second point to back my statement is that art and music are the backbones of our cultures. These are very important for attracting tourists to the home country. In addition to this future generations also come to know about their history and culture. For example in counties like ,China much emphasis is given to skills like singing and dancing.",
        "In the nutshell I we can accumulate the fact that although governments should invest more money in social service , at the same time money should be invested in different art forms like art and music as these depict our cultural values and these should be preserved for the generations to come."
