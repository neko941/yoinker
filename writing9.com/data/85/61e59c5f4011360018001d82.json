        "In recent times , an increasing number of people argue that students should have a gap year in working or travelling before university . Although I think that this tendency may have some harmful consequences , I believe that the advantages of  a gap year for scholars  between high school and university  can outweigh its disadvantages .",
        "On the one hand ,there are some adverse effects of travelling or working  a period before starting university studies . Firstly ,students may lose the motivation to study and work hard after they experience  life without academic duties and wake up early , as a result , they will probably find a lot of difficulties to back into studies . Secondly , youngers are not mature enough to choose the best decision for them and then the risk of wasting a considerable time on not valuable activities remains higher . For example , some youngers will realise that the most productive activity  in this period is watching movies and playing games .",
        "On the other hand , there are several reasons  why people encourage scholars to have a break from learning while a period . The strongest reason is that learners will have the opportunity to discover other passions and the right and convenient path for them . For instance , some youngers find themselves in  Art such as music instead of math or physics , then they will change their career and try to get admission to the college of music . In addition , being face to new people and environment  tend to help learners to discover new cultures and be in contact with different persons with different  mindsets , consequently , they will be able to communicate easily with others and then they develop their soft skills which help to be more confident and build a character .",
        "In conclusion ,despite that the weaknesses of having a gap while 12 months for youngsters are significant ,  I strongly believe that the benefits of h exceed their drawbacks , if students are guided to benefit from this experience ."
