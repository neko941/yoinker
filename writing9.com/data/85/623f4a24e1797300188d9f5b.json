        "It is considered by some people  that nowadays,  human is becoming more and more dependent on each other.While others have opinions that  folks have more independents than others.Before arriving at my position both  sides of the argument will be elaborated on further.",
        "To begin with,why do people are dependent on  each other.To answer it, the economic problem. To explain it, we know that today's unemployment is a major problem in the world, if folk have no good wages job or  a business, they have no option and  have to borrow money from  family members or  friends for a living.Another one is in recent times students are more dependent on their parents along with the online classes for their education without tuition unable to get a good result.For example, 80% of pupils do  online classes for study.",
        "On the other hand,some believe that individuals are independent nowadays.To elaborate it, firstly, unexpected gadgets, everyone has a mobile phone , laptop, computer.Regarding ,it they can do anything from the home without anyone's help.can  send or receive the  documents through an email.Moreover, can communicate on video with relatives and friends or can arrange online  office meetings from any place.For example, till 2010 ,everything was done by the human as the letters or notices sent by the postmen but now it can do people themselves at the house.Hence now everything has been replaced by cellphone and lives is becoming easy compared to the past.",
        "In conclusion, maybe the public depends on others for some reasons like money problem also kids  studies.I believe that getting independence is a good trend around the world,they can grow themselves."
