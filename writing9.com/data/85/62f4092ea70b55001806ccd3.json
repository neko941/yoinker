I recently signed a rent agreement with you, and during that time you assure me that the furniture that I will be using during my 24 months stay has great quality furniture and other modern facilities.",

Secondly, one of the legs of the table in the dining area is broken. Lastly, the study table has draws which are totally jammed. In short, there are a lot of problems with these furniture items.",
