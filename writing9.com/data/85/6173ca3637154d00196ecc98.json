Secondly, would you mind helping to keep the newspapers, that are delivered every morning, please? I will put a wooden box near my house doorstep, to put the daily newspapers inside, so that they won't get wet if it rains. Last but not least, if anyone comes looking for me, would you kindly let them know that I am away, and ask them to reach my mobile phone?",
        "I will be leaving on Friday, and I will give you the key to my house on Friday morning. I am scheduled to be back home on the 30th of November. If you face any problem in doing these chores, please do not hesitate to reach my mobile phone - 5466 7244.",
