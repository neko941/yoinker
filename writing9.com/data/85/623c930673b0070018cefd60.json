        "I am writing to inform you that I cannot attend  the computer course from next Friday and no way to continue this until it finishes. From the first week of this , the month I joined  a full-time job at a reputed company as an administrator and my new working roster will crash my studying hours from the 25th of July 2022. So, I decided to end up this from that day.",
        "Moreover, before this full-time job I worked as a casual employee and now they offered me a full-time option to work at the same employer. I think this is a valuable chance for me to gain  work experience as a professional worker. I heard the good news that the same one will be going to start a new batch which will be conducted on the weekends after 3 months. So, I think it will be better for me by considering these circumstances.",
