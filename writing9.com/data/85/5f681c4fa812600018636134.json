        "Although, a lot of folks think that the advent of advanced technology made the public more outgoing, others believe it created more\u00a0gap on the already struggling human community. Even though the advent of modern technology opened endless access to meet people in distance land, in my opinion I think it reduced the frequency of face to face intreaction.",
        "On one hand, modren softwares has created limitless and cheap access to the international communites through social media such as: facebook. If this applications where unavaliable, many individuals\u00a0might not have crossed paths and this bring us closer to world peace since all part of the world\u00a0is becoming integrated. facebook for instance, enabled affordable communication between loved ones in far away places. Moreover the fact that these softwares can translate foreign languages makes easier to relate with foreigners.",
        "On the other hand, we have seen decline in\u00a0the level of\u00a0physical intreaction due to the enormous amount of time spent in front of the screen and\u00a0this creates an isolation between an individual and his environment. Furthermore, most people spent the whole playing video games instead of attending social functions such as: weddings or a carnival at the local park which could have availed them the opportunity to make their neighbors. For example, according the recent study in the UK, the world is currently faced with a\u00a0drastic decline on the turn up\u00a0at an outdoor event when compared to the trend in the\u00a0last century.",
        "To conclude, Even though technologies opened up communication channel to the distance land, it however, made people an island. This is not a good survival adaptation because human as a race\u00a0relay on\u00a0community effort to survive difficult times such as during Hurricane, so how\u00a0will\u00a0neighbours help either other? if they do not even know themselves. This is an error that needs to be corrected."
