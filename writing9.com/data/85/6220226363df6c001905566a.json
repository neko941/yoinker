        "Many cars, buses, and trucks will not need drivers in years later. So, a person who enjoys the trip oneself in the transport will be a sitter. Based on this fact, I think more no benefit driverless than with a driver. Due to the argument, I have two reasons that are increased unemployment and different feel tool used with person or machine.",
        "First of all, a driver is a job for a part human in the country. If the job being driver disappears, it would many people lost the work. Furthermore, many people without work and income which is impacted by increasing criminalization in society, such as murder and theft. For example, if automatic change human role as a driver, so many people lost jobs. They have no work that can affect their income. Above all, a driver as a job is very important for exist without change with a machine.",
        "Secondly, every human has communicative interaction. If facilities have walked without humans, our journey would have no interaction. Especially, interaction with each other people will take care and responsive people. On the trip, we need not only get to a destination but also enjoy by talking about something. For example, people who ride transportation alone will be more individualistic, because there is no interaction and change information with others.",
        "My conclusion for this situation, I think disadvantages transportation without drivers, because two reasons which are unemployment and minimize interaction in life. The recommendation for it that are drivers jobs most interesting still stand in the state."
