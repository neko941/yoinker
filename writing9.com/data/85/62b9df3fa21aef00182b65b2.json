        "Absolutely, the new generation will become the main hope to drive the future world. In order to create the ideal society, nowadays children should be properly taught to become smart citizens in the future. Some people allege that teaching kids are the responsibility of parents, while others argue that schools play a more important role in educating students. In this essay, both viewpoints will be elaborated on before my opinion is shown.",
        "On the one hand, parents act as role models to pupils as at young stages, children have the ability to imitate the ambient person to survive. Therefore, the behaviour of kids is always similar to their father and mother. For example, I decided to work as a government officer as my father and mother are civil servants, and I follow their way. Moreover, the proportion of offspring and teachers in school leads to ineffective concentration of their students. To illustrate, in an ordinary institute one teacher has to take care of approximately 50 kids. As a result, some students do not receive  proper treatment as there are so many kids.",
        "On the other hand, offspring can drastically learn how to live with others in school under the supervision of teachers. As every kid in class come from different families and backgrounds, they have different attitudes and behaviours, which are similar to living in the real world. For instance, children can learn how to share their stuff with their friends, can learn how to communicate with others, and can learn how to socialize with others. Furthermore, schools can implement the rule and regulations to form the discipline as well as punishment for the students who violate the rule. Consequently, young learn how to obey the rule and become good members of the community in the future.",
        "In conclusion, although both parents and schools play a significant role in teaching offsprings, presumably, children's attitude is more significantly influenced by parents, as they act as being an idol, and spend the most time with kids"
