        "It is argued that the most effective way to improve the academic performance of students below average is to engage them in extra moral classes to ensure their achievements shows significant improvement and as they become more incorporated with the school activities. However, I strongly disagree with this notion because they are better methods to improve a child's academic results such as,  streaming and obtaining their trusts.",
        "Firstly,  separating these pupils into sections per performance enables the teacher can tailor down their lesson to meet the specific needs rather than spending the whole day in a general class where they end up understanding nothing. For instance, it is evident that streaming enhanced the results of underperformed students by 20% in Enugu state. Clearly, it is a tremendous improvement extra school hours would not achieve. Therefore,  it  is a more efficient educating pattern.",
        "Secondly, these teens may become unhappy due to, the extended class time,as a result, no extra knowledge would be impacted. For example, a recent study shows that teens attain more positive level if they key into the task at hand, in other words, getting their loyalty is a better means to nurture growth and development in their study.  So an improved academic achievement would be visible once the kids understand the goal. Thus, It is apparent that long class sections would not produce the expected output.",
        "To conclude, it is presumed that the most efficient method to help low performing students is by obligatory after school classes but I strongly stand against the idea owing to, they are more result-oriented modified avenue to achieve the desired target, like, separating them according to the level of their academic strength as well as, acquiring the teen's loyalty."
