        "I am writing this letter to inform you about the feedback of the meeting held in your hotel.",
        "Last month, I booked your place for the business meeting of our company. However, soon after it was over, I received numerous good reviews from the attendants about the place. First and foremost, the air conditioning system and the ambience were pleasant therefore everyone enjoyed them. Moreover, the sitting arrangement was up to the mark because the tables were placed quite far away so they didn't create any problems. Finally, the hygiene and the cleanliness were absolutely perfect and they left the participants astonished.",
        "Although people were almost satisfied with the arrangements, they have some issues with the food. Firstly, the taste was not as good as they expected. Besides this, the meat was not cooked well. Furthermore, there were no candle lamps behind the dishes that did not keep them hot and made the items cool earlier.",
        "Nonetheless, they are not the bigger problems but can be overcome by outsourcing the contract of cooking to a third party or by doing some changes to your recipes.",
        "I look forward to hearing from you soon.",
        "Yours faithfully,",
