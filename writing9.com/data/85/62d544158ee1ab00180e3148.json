Although the drivers change every day, I remember his name was Sunny and the cab had a money plant in it. I had a file containing feedback forms which were filled up by the participants post our seminar. I need to analyse those reports and present them to my company. If I miss providing the data then it is difficult for us to improve for our next program.",
