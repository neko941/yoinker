        "First of all, we found out that the beef, that was part of the menu we ordered, was not properly done. None of us could eat it and we left it untouched. It was a total waste of our money and quite annoying. As if that wasn't enough, we waited for more than twenty minutes at the counter just to express our displeasure, and to my amazement, there was nobody to complain to. It seems as if all your staff took a break at the same time.",
        "For the now, we have decided, as an organisation, to stop meeting at your restaurant. We need to be sure that you will take corrective actions concerning our complaints. We want you to ensure that your staffs are more customer-friendly, and to ensure that you hire an experienced cook to supervise all meals cooked before serving them to Customers.",
        "Finally, I do hope you will do as we have communicated to you in good time. Thank you for your time and have a nice day.",
