        "It is true that host of a people especially kids needs some companion as a friend because of their love for them. Some people believe that pets can harm and cause illness among small babies while others feel that this trend will bring some positive effect on children's behaviour. Personally, I feel that pets give a sense of responsibility to kids. In this essay, I will give some logical reasons to explain this feeling.",
        "On the one hand, having a pet comes up with various advantages for children. For instance, taking care of their furry friends such as walking, grooming and feeding teaches them to be more responsible not only with animals but with other connections too. Additionally, some researchers proved that kids who are exposed to cats and dogs at a young age tend to have better immune systems compared to those who do not.",
        "On the other hand, parents have considerable reasons for not having pets at home . One of their concern is aggressive behaviour of any animal may cause harm to the small babies. For example, furrey members can be triggered if they bite and chew their skin unconsciously. Secondly, pets may spread allergies and diseases because their skin is prone to bacteria, viruses and pathogens  which is risky for minors' vulnerable physical health. Therefore, it is not secure for parents to allow their kids to play with pets if they are not cleaned and groomed regularly.",
        "To sum up, whilst there are some negative consequences for household animals,  I believe this is better than harm for kids because  they can learn many things by taking care of them  and have better health from an early age."
