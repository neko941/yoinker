Moreover, computer science inventions, such as theatre, video games, movies, are now common methods of entertaining which step-by-step become new leisures and replace the traditional ones. To abridge, the advantages of information technology are way too obvious and countless.",
        "In contrast, many people claim that the outbreak of modern appliances can promote sedentary lifestyles. For instance, AI-based robots can make us physically lazy because they perform all tasks on our behalf. Additionally, the opponents also believe that the dark sides of webs have ruined many lives. However, those negative cases are limited in number and mostly happen with some people who have little self-control.",
