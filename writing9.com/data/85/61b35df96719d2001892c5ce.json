        "However, I am afraid to say that the service was not satisfactory as it has been. First, my beloved wife and I had to wait 20 minutes in order to get our order taken. After a long wait, we were shocked by the low quality of the serviced meal. In addition to the undercooked meat, surprisingly, the salad had some dirt in it from the lack of washing it.",
        "Due to the aforementioned events, I believe that firstly, I deserve a written apology from you as a staff manager. Secondly, a thorough investigation to ameliorate the servicing will be welcome.",
        "Thirdly, a refund for the paid meal will be considered a good gesture on your behalf.",
        "In the end, I am looking forward to hearing from you.",
