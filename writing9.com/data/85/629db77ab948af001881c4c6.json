        "To a large extent, I agree with the suggestion.",
        "First of all, constructing transportation infrastructures for bicycles could motivate the public to travel on their own carbon-free vehicles. As a result, it reduces carbon emissions. Nowadays, the government considers environmental protection as their major undertaking. It is to save our planet from global warming, a devastating result of increasing carbon dioxide emissions. Building roads and parking slots for bicycles encourages the public to use bikes, typically for the \"Last Mile\" journey. Compared to motor vehicles, it is more environmentally friendly. For instance, it echos the \"Carbon Neutrality\" approach raised by the Hong Kong government in recent years.",
        "Secondly, it saves space and helps the city grows green. In general, bicycle commuters need less space to drive their vehicles. They are happy to see the bicycle paths are covered by greenery too. It creates additional spaces for the municipal authority to plant trees. In contrast, it is often infeasible to plant trees near roads for motor vehicles. Motor vehicles are taller and wider. They are likely to crash on trees and cause undesirable damage. It helps to enhance the air quality and the respiratory health of residents living in the vicinity by planting more trees. For instance, the Hong Kong government is planning to build a new cycling track connecting Tsuen Wan and Tuen Mun. Greenery measures would be taken in place surrounding the planned tracks. These trees are beneficial to the scenery and air quality.",
        "To conclude, I agree the authority should build more transportation infrastructure for bikes instead of fossil-driven cars. It helps to build a greener future by reducing carbon emissions."
