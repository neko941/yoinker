Furthermore, if  the tutor makes them indulged to trial with peer, then they  can easily develop their company working intelligence which is obligatory for their future soul in every sector.  For example, if the junior has to job in a related field as a doctor, engineer, nurses and so on, they need club performance to get success in their target. Therefore, educator should give prominence on moulding the students more friendly and ameliorating the organization working proficiency.",
        "However, some people believe pupils should be competitive to grab the thrive in their life so academy should focus on this things.
