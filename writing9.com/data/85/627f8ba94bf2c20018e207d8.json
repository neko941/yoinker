        "I am writing to provide feedback on the four-week cookery program I completed in April.",
        "Overall, the quality of the course exceeded my expectations. Despite its short duration, it included numerous tips and techniques for preparing North Indian delicacies. Our teacher, Mrs Smith, was not only knowledgeable but also always happy to help.",
        "Even though I had started cooking at home while attending these classes, these days, I am the lead chef in my neighbourhood. Indeed, at the monthly parties in my vicinity, all the main course is prepared by me. Not limiting to this, my family insists on me barbecue every weekend as they relish my food.",
        "As you are already renowned for Indian cuisine, it seems to me that a couple of intercontinental cooking courses would make your institution distinguished in the city. Since people adore Italian as well as French dishes, you could introduce these cooking classes.",
        "I hope my feedback is useful, and I look forward to returning to your school next year for another course.",
        "Yours faithfully,",
