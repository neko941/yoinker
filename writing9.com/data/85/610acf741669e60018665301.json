In other words, is very arduous for small business compete with this kind of service that leads to population buy food in big supermarkets rather than promoting the local service. For example, when consumers choose to buy at large supermarkets, generally foods are imported from far cities resulting in local food being devalued. Therefore, the population should be more aware of local service, prioritizing and helping small businesses.",
        "But, why this trend has a negative impact on society? Because the long travel is one of the responsible causes for the impact of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. The farther away will be the distance, the more polluted gases released into the air. In addition, these gases are responsible for climate changes around the world. Thinking with collective thoughts, ideas can help not only me but also my society, which is a huge step to ameliorate our community to the next generations. Hence, it is important both promote the local service and use cars less.",
