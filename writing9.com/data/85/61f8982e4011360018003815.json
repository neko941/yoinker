        "It is believed by people in some countries that owning a home is more preferable and important than renting one. I believe that any decision, especially in living cost management, has been considered thoroughly by comparing the advantages and disadvantages. This essay will explain why people choose to buy than rent a home.",
        "There are several factors that people are considered before choosing to own or rent a home. One of which is the increasing price of a property from time to time. For example, a housing price today is 3 million rupiahs per meter. Next year, the price is predicted to increase by 5%. The housing price normally increases every year. Thus, many people believe that owning a home is a good investment.",
        "Although the price of a home is expensive, many people can not afford to buy it. As a consequence, they have to pick the renting option. Looking at this situation, there are several schemes offered by each country to support their citizen to own a house. For instance, in Indonesia, the government subsidize a house for each citizen. The price of the subsidised home is discounted up to 50% with a credit payment. Therefore, owning a home is very possible for everyone from the richest to the poorest.",
        "In conclusion, I think the culture of people to own a place to stay is a positive thing. Because a house is considered a safe place for everyone,  people do not need to think about the billing issues once they have a home."
