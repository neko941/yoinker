        "Dear Mayor,",
        "I write this letter to complain about your decision of closing our town's park and building a car park in its place. I have been living in this town for 35 years and I have seen how the place where originally lived is being destroyed brick by brick.",
        "Firstly, our town needs this park as much as we need air to breathe or a place to have a walk or for our children to play. It has been the centre of our everyday lives and its closing will do no good to the minds and bodies of our town fellows. Besides, you will be remembered as the mayor that obliterated the last green corner we had. Moreover, I am sure that history will judge this decision as a really bad idea.",
        "Furthermore, I have done a survey amongst the people of the place and they are completely  unfavourable. Even the owners of shops and small businesses think that eliminating our gardens would have a negative impact on their customers, as they will have no reasons to go to local shops. If I were you, I would think who are the ones that have profited from your decision.",
        "On top of that, your project is a really bad idea. A botanical garden is what we need because it would attract tourism and would put our name on the map. Please, take my suggestion seriously and take that old-fashioned project back to the drawer.",
        "Yours sincerely"
