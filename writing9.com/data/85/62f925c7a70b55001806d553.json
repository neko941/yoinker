I already tried to use another set of ink still the result is the same. Kindly note that we need to print our 500 handout materials for my presentation last Friday, but I am unable to do it since the printer is not working. Although we solve it by using the service of the printing shop near our office, however, this is causing us an added costs. For example, imagine paying 500 pages.",
