        "Education is the fundamental rights of everyone. In recent years, the education ratio has been increasing than past. It is often argued issue whether the ministry should provide free college drilling to  all kinds of financial status people, not. I strongly agree with this statement and I will be mentioning my points in the upcoming paragraphs.",
        "To begin with, The ministry should give without cost education because every person has a basic right to enter  college preparation even they own any kinds of monetary status it does not matter. The folks pay a huge amount of tax to the government  every year in order to the government use the folk's tax amount on country infrastructure developments ergo, the ruling party should satisfy  all citizen basic needs  such as higher information and so on. For example, many western countries provide free higher coaching to their whole residence even they do not consider  their citizens monetary status as a result, the scholar ratio dramatically increase. Financial criteria is not a good one for this kind of amenities to supply all population.",
        "Moreover, if a nation should be provided without cost training to the whole population , the nation would be developed such as academically. To be more precise the cabinet should work for their entire folks besides one group of man such as a poor person. The country rules and regulation for everyone in the same way the  facilities also and everybody can get more benefits from this kind of free teaching method such as place of graduation. For instance, in the Indian ruling party gives scholarship to only under poverty line students repercussion, other remaining students whom the richest man get angry with the enjoy free guy and they might be fought. Therefore, the unity might be collapsed.",
        "To conclude, higher teaching is the inevitable one  nowadays. The ruling party make sure to give to offer everybody as a result, they  will get more benefit from this . I strongly agree with this point, because all population must work and contribute to their own state in future ergo, the cabinet does not consider to the capital conditions of the society and they only focus on how to increase the educate radio than financial conditions. I hope this trend is conducive for young ones."
