        "No doubt that leadership capabilities are essential in our modern society. While some people argue that in order to be a leader, an individual should have certain innate skills. Others assert that anyone can learn how to be a leader. In this essay, I will analyse both sides of the argument and explain my support of the latter view.",
        "Leadership properties are often described as confidence, persuasiveness and charisma. Eventually, some individuals are born with these distinctive personality traits, therefore they are genetically predisposed to influence. To start with, someone who has natural persuasive abilities can easily become a leader, therefore many people working in positions that require leadership skills such as directors, politicians, and etc have innate capabilities. For instance, a person who is naturally shy and anxious has to work hard on him- or herself and change his nature in order to talk in public and persuade others.",
        "However, it doesn't mean that a shy person with an introverted personality, can never become a leader.  Firstly,  there are universities that specialize in teaching articulation, public confidence, oratory and other subjects. Additionally, experience and knowledge can make a person a good leader. To illustrate, people can be naturally confident while speaking about something that they know very well, they won't be afraid to make mistakes because they have experience.  Consequently,  sufficient knowledge and experience can help an individual to persuade people to follow them rather than innate skills.",
        "To sum up, I believe that leadership is learnable quality though, not an easy one, the reason is that it may require changing personal qualities and overcoming fears."
