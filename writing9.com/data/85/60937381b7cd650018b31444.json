        "It is an undeniable fact that one most of the most important subject of the school curriculum is computer lessons . This has many benefits and drawbacks for school pupils  ; however , in my ,opinion it is very beneficial to  all school goers .",
        "First , in terms of its advantages . The foremost profit is that they learn basic things about computer subjects , for  instance how  to type , paint , calculate , watch  educational videos , browse relevant information on the web and so on . This could be taught in primary and secondary institutions . In addition , they should aware of the powerful technology of computers , consequently, it  helps them in future jobs , workplaces , etc . Next , they come to know about different types of technical skills , one of them is making-of presentation . If  they are very well aware of Microsoft PowerPoint , so they prepare a presentation and assignment in school or college project work . Furthermore , it involves many features such as typing , changing  font size and language and draw and drag images into slides .",
        "On the flip side , it has some limitations . The first is that it has adverse effects on the eyes of pupils because spending more time in front of a computer screen . In other words , rays emit from the computer screen directly pass into the eyes , particularly in the retina , as a result , leads to the drying of the eyes and finally poor vision since early adulthood. Another loss is that students' mind diverts on unethical things on a computer if there is  improper supervision and guidance by their tutors . So that , they trap into wrong things like watching sex videos on the internet .",
        "To conclude , computer lessons  are taught lots of thing to pupils , while it accounts for some health issues and creates negative impacts on student's brain in absence of observation  ; although ,  I believe that computers are so much valuable for students as learning purpose ."
