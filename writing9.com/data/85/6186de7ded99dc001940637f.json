However, the problem does not finish here, despite instructing him a couple of times he still parks the vehicle at the same spot.However, I first told him politely even though I scolded him later but he seems to put his ear on air.",
        "Thus, it's my humble request to guide him accordingly.If he doesn't behave himself.Moreover,there is a huge car parking area just at the corner of the road.Everyone parks their vehicle there .And If I find him standing in front of my vicinity again I will launch a complaint against him formally to the local council.",
