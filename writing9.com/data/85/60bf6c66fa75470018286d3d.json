        "Does limiting the  speed of the vehicle reduce accidents?This is the most debatable issue as few  are in favour of controlling the speed of  automobiles,while others argue that  there are a plethora of ways to solve this problem.I believe various measures can be taken by the government to tackle the above issue.This essay shall  further discuss both  views with relevant examples in detail.",
        "On the one hand, from the perspectives of people who think limiting the speed reduces accidents thinks so because  most of the dreadful incidents on the road occur due to uncontrolled speed.Youngsters are attracted to thrilling experiences and try to impress  their friends by  driving high speedy cars .Hence, they land up in unavoidable  circumstances. For Instance, studies on  the car accidents done in a survey in Mumbai depicts clearly that most of the mishaps are due to overspeeding.Therefore, it is believed that decreasing the speed limits on the roads will deter  accidents.",
        "On the other hand,some folks  argue that only controlling the speed will not solve the problem and various measures can be taken to alleviate by the government.Firstly, unfortunate incidents occur when a person is drunk and drives his vehicle.Furthermore, accidents are most commonly done  by an inexperienced driver.For example,famous Bollywood celebrity Salman khan was stuck in a case of drunk and drive in the initial days  of his career.Henceforth, stricter enforcement of rules for issuing the driving licence and levying heavy penalty on the drunk drivers are few solutions which the government can enact upon.",
        "In conclusion, I believe, enforcing strict rules for issuing the driving licence and charging drunk drivers will solve the problem of accidents and just reducing the speed limit will not be helpful."
