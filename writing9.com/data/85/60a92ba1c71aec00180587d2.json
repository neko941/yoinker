        "Many varieties of jobs are available across the globe. Some Individuals opine that job gratification is overlapped  job reliability. However, others believe that career security is the number one priority rather than job satisfaction. This assignment indeed discusses both perspectives and I shall give my views on this.",
        "On the one hand, young people have more interest in professional satisfaction. In that way, they become more creative and productive in it. The chance of getting a promotion is higher  if they love  their work. Next, they feel happier in the workplace. In addition to this, they never feel tired, bored and lost of interest. For example, in a recent study, it is assumed that people who work in their own interesting job have more success and happiness as compared to those who only for money, they do not have little bit curious.",
        "On the other hand, people need a permanent job, the predominant reason behind is that  for longer service in a job gives them lots of benefits like accommodation, health insurance and extra benefit. Moreover, nowadays, it is not an easy task to find a good job. The competition level is high, more are willing to do the job. If a person leaves his/her job then finding another job takes many months, in that period people feel depressed.",
        "In conclusion, I believe that job gratification is more important than a permanent job. If people find a job of their interest then it will make them always and they become more productive. Indirectly, it is beneficial to the company, they get an employee who loves to do their work."
