        "How are you? I was planning to come and see you in the hospital, but your parents insisted that you need more time to recover. Anyway, I have some great news for you about the latest game.",
        "We played with the Red Stars, they are from Montreal, if I am not mistaken. The team is quite experienced, they have a few former professional players.",
        "To be honest with you, I still can not believe it, but we won. They knew, that you are off that is why they decided to play with high pressure. If you had not advised us to make the change in the scheme, it would not have been possible to resist long. We decided to go all in defence and it worked.",
        "Well, the game was extremely tough. They scored first, but we managed to stage a comeback at the very end of the match. It was hilarious, I will never forget it. I think they wasted too much energy at the beginning of the game, so we managed to pull ourselves together and scored two times!",
        "By the way, we have already started preparing for the next game, so we need to discuss a plan for it. Hope they will allow me to visit you in person on Friday.",
