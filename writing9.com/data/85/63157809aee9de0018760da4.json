        "As you know, we have skyrocketing rents here which cost you an eye and a leg, hence, I strongly recommended to stay at outside of the city. In addition, we have shared accommodation along with well kitchen items which are going to charge weekly basis and I am sure that this will save some additional expenses too.",
        "Having said that, I can offer a ride to visit  some of the places nearby  Vancouver city. Furthermore, I can extend my support to look after your's father medication as he needs to consult the doctor frequently. Please do not hesitate to ask me for any other favour if they need anything during their trip and I feel always happy to help them at my place.",
        "I am excited and look forward to seeing them at the airport and I wish them a very happy and safe journey to Canada.",
