        "Overpopulation has caused numerous problems to human world such as extreme fatigue, lack of accommodation and deficiency in educational quality. In fact, these scenarios can still be prevented with proper campaigns and governmental regulations. However, the issue with Earth\u2019s natural resources evoked by the aforementioned factor is more significant and hardly has a resolution to reverse the damage. Therefore, the leaders of different countries have ran several policies to hinder the progress of resources exhaustion, in which the increase of prices in raw material seems to be the most effective. I totally agree that such method and demonstrate why would this change is the only answer to the environmental crisis.",
        "To begin with, there is a covey of people who are readily disobedient towards the government environmental regulations. These people have a great disbelief about the current situation which they refuse to believe the current state of affairs and be conservative about their usage of traditional energy. Therefore, the best practice to prevent exhaustion is overpricing common fuels, which such group is consuming. This method will encourage households to use other alternatives as it can support their finance. For instance, several families in the UK have already opted for a long term solution, namely solar panel because which method helps them not to pay the monthly electricity bills.",
        "If the citizen still value  the overpriced means of power supplies, the government can exploit the increased tax for other services and categories. They can allocate more funds for environmental campaigns or provide more aids for education to raise people\u2019s awareness about depletion. Furthermore, the authorities are capable of providing more renewable means of energy that hinder the progress of global fuel exhaustion. For example, Singapore, a small country in South Asia, has built more windmills and solar panel factories ever since they apply such policy towards conventional power supplies. As a result, this country has become one of the cleanest and safest place to live in terms of pollution level.",
        "In general, increasing the taxes of fuel not only helps solving the problem with natural resources but also economical crisis. Obeying the government regulations may be the only way, otherwise, the rise in fuel's cost would still be the best policy to the same problem."
