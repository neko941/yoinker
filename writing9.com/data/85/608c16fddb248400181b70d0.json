Some individuals utilise such platforms to rate commodities as well as to share their assumption about a variety of assistance that they received. I completely support this idea. In the upcoming paragraphs, I will put forth my views in detail.",
        "To embark on, publicizing such details through online media would help individuals to purchase the best available produce. To elaborate, people would definitely browse to know about a particular commodity which they intended to buy.

For example, the well-established shopping company named Amazon possess web page for their products which contain detailed review and purchaser rating from all over the world. Studies show that this is the basis for their credibility among people. Therefore, it could be said that such reviews are beneficial for every consumer.",
        "Moreover, besides the benefits for consumers, such online evaluation would  significantly help the concerned companies to modify the quality of their products. To explain, considering those online reviews, to regain customer reliability, multinational companies would upgrade their brands. They would take this  as the guideline to strengthen their research to fulfil  client satisfaction. In other words, such ratings and opinion would act as a boost to refine the product efficiency.

Henceforth, by analyzing the above facts, the merits of the online evaluation could be stressed.",
        "To conclude, in my opinion, public reviews and opinion about different brands and services are beneficial. Since they would be helpful to attract new consumers and also act as a correction media for the relevant enterprise."
