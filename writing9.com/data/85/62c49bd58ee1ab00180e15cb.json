        "The legs of the sofa are a bit shakey and the paint is peeling off on its own. Also, when we try to sit as a family it often moves against the wall which frightens us that it might break if we lean on it hard.",
        "It would be of  great help if you could change the legs and tighten to screws so it does not shake when we try to use it. Additionally, it can be repainted so the paint does not peel off again.",
        "Looking forward to hearing  from you.",
