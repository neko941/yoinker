This essay will show a lot of benefits with doing in this gap year.",

For instance, someone who loves nature should take this gap era to do some tasks and visit about the environment, which is in order to consider this field is suitable for them. Last, one will get more experiences in a different culture and living. It is also supporting to be adaptive in the future career.",
        "However, there are a few drawbacks to this performance. At first, this needs a lot of money to spend for an age, instead of using the amount to apply for a bachelor program in the next year. Another reason is adaption in various countries because it may not comfortable like home.",
