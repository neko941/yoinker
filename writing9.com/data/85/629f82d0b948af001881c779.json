        "There was a huge storm last Monday and it caused a fault in the electricity supply of your house. After reading your instruction book that you handed over to me before leaving for the trip, I tried to open the door of the store on the first floor for a tool kit. However, the door got stuck and when I pulled with a little force, it fell upon me.",
        "To be honest, I accidentally damaged the door otherwise I had no intention to break anything. Nonetheless, to mend my mistake, I have talked to a carpenter  and he has given an estimate of $40 to replace the hinges. If you allow then I can call him and can get the damage fixed before you come back.",
