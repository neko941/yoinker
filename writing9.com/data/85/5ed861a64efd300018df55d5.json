In other words, people who are suffering from depression and anxiety prefers to paint their walls with dull colours which will ultimately keep their mind relaxed and calm. To illustrate, hospitals have white walls because most of the patients criticize bright colours when they have sufferings, they would rather prefer to watch some low eye-catching colours which will eventually change their mood. Therefore, it is quite essential to decorate hospital buildings with those colours which have positive effects on the energy of patients.",
