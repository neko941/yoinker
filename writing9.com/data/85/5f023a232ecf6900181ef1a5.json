        "\u201cNothing is more deceitful than appearances\u201d, Jane Austen\u2019s main moral lesson in her famous novel \u201cThe Pride and The Prejudice\u201d. It is conspicuous that many people nowadays tend to judge others according to their social status, amount of earnings, and wealth. Honesty, perseverance, ethics, and kindness are some old fashioned virtues that no longer seem essential. From my personal perspective, I strongly disagree on judging others according to their social ranks for a plethora of reasons.",
        "First of all, judging people by their appearances, especially in wealthy people is considered a sort of social bullying. For instance, In Egypt, many researchers recorded plenty of suicide cases due to that kind of social harassment. One of them was for a 21 year old young man who committed suicide due to a well-known company's refusal for his recruitment. Although the young man was highly qualified for the job and had a good reputation, good personal traits such as honesty, trust, and perseverance, but   the company justified that he didn\u2019t fit for the job because of his bad taste in clothes besides to his lower social class. Differentiating between people according to social status can widen the gap between the classes of the society and can result in racism, segregation, and discrimination growth.",
        "Secondly, as it is demanded to judge people according to social status, It is also essential to be fair enough with people who didn\u2019t have the chance to live in a good social conditions. This doesn\u2019t mean that all of the wealthy people lack morals and virtues, but it simply means that we need to judge people by the quality of their work to be just enough for everyone. Shedding the light on people\u2019s good values and highlighting their good morals and qualities such as honesty, bravery, loyalty, and trust is inevitable when judging others.",
        "In conclusion, the issue of judging people will always be a debatable topic. As it\u2019s mentioned previously, regardless one\u2019s material possessions, everyone should be judged by the quality of his/her personal traits."
