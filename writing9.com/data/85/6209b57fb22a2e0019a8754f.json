When I opened the envelope, I noticed that it was torn, and my new bank card, probably, has been stolen. My main concern is the pin code written on the card which can make my account accessible to others. Therefore, I would appreciate it if you could reissue my credit card ASAP. Additionally, please check my transactions history and notify me that how much money has been taken.",
