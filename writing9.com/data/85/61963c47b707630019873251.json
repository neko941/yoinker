Normally, my parents are the ones who take her to  medical appointments. However, during this pandemic time, I would like my parents to stay at home, which is why I will be accompanying her instead.",
        "I will need to leave the office at 1pm on the 10th of January and will be back no later than 4pm. While I will be out of the office, my teammate, Jason, will cover my duties. I will brief him on the urgent matters that would need his attention.",
        "I would like to seek your understanding and would appreciate it if you could allow me to take 3-hour time off next Monday. Looking forward to getting your approval.",
