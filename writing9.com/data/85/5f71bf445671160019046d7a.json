        "Dear editor,",
        "I am writing concerning the June issue of the magazine \u201cAdventures around the world\u201d. Being your regular reader, I always was satisfied with the content of it. However, in the issue mentioned above, I have found a mistake according to The Apple Festival, which is going to be conducted in my home city Almaty in August from 5 to 21. Unfortunately, the wrong date of the festival (from 22 to 31 of August) is printed in the article describing the celebration.",
        "Thus, it will definitely have a negative effect on local tourism and sales as tourists will arrive when everything will be over. It goes without saying that foreigners may be frustrated about missing the festival as it is colourful and appealing due to the fact that \u201cApport\u201d is one of the best sorts of apples in Central Asia. As well as the owners of local accommodation may be disappointed and will lose their profit because of the lack of tourists during the festival.",
        "Could you please publish the correct information in the July issue of the magazine? I think it will be useful, especially if you put a special note that it is a correction of the previous misleading information.",
        "Moreover, I would like to advise you to double-check important dates prior to the printing of further issues of the magazine.",
        "Thank you in advance for your kind cooperation,",
        "Yours sincerely,",
        "Maria V"
