        "Recently, extensively attention has been put on the education problem. Some people argue that students who are not able to finish their course at university should be punished. I do not agree with this viewpoint. In this essay, I will give some detailed explanations to support my opinion.",
        "First of all, those students having unfinished courses should not be fined because some individuals can have inevitable reasons such as financial pressure. For example, students who are lack financial support may not be able to put all their energy and time into study. If a student is from an economically disadvantaged family, they may need to find a part-time job to pay their tuition fees. As a result, they have to balance their work and study life. In this case, they may have problems with their study, and cannot finish the course.",
        "Furthermore, punishment on people who not complete the courses should not be applied because  students have the right to determine what they would like to study. For instance, a student in his/her first year may register in various courses because they are not sure what subject they are interested in. So, it is possible that they could quit a course after having started it because they find they are not interested in that course.\u00a0If this is the situation, I do not think the student who is trying to find their interests should be punished.",
        "In conclusion, those individuals who are not able to complete a course after starting it should not be fined because they may not be able to finish the course due to financial pressure or their preferences."
