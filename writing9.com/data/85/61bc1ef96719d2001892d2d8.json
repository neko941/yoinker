        "Dear Alex ,",
        "As I discussed with you earlier , I am planning to attend my Master degree  at Singapore National University .  I might  choose to attend Data Science subject which has good opportunities and trends in next few years . This course will take approximately two years to finish and I need to submit my research proposal within this time frame . I will also apply for  a  study grant and I hope all things could be completed successfully as per my plan .",
        "Singapore is one of the most expensive cities in the world and I will need to work a part-time job to cover some of my personal expenses and to get some experience. Obviously , I understand it would be difficult to get well-paid jobs for students during this pandemic time .",
        "As I  know  , you have a rich network in Singapore and you could introduce me to any one of them. If possible I would prefer to work in Data Science related areas like Data Collector or Data Entry .",
        "I hope you could help me and support  my request .",
        "I am looking forward to hearing from you .",
