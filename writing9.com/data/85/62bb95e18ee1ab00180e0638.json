Two years is a long time, and unfortunately due to the ,pandemic I couldn't take part in my brother's wedding ceremony. Therefore, it's a good time to plan to visit my country and reunite with my family.",

        "During that time off period, Terry can take my responsibilities to move the project forwards and collaborate with stakeholders. Since we have had a lot of discussions regarding the project, he is totally onboarded and can lead the project  as long as I am on vacation. Looking forward to hearing back from you.",
