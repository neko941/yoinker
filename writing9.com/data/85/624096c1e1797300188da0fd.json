        "For Happy, I have placed his dog food in the kitchen pantry. Please fill his dish twice, morning and evening. Also, make sure he has access to clean water all the time. You have to walk him twice a day preferably before 7 am in the morning and after 6 pm in the evening as the neighbourhood gets crowded. Can you also vacuum the couch and the carpet once a day? You can find the vacuum in the washing area. I'm also expecting a parcel, could you please collect them and keep them in my office area? If you want anything from the fridge, please feel free to take them.",
        "I hope to return by Monday and looking forward to seeing you very soon. Once again thank you for agreeing to do this. It means a lot",
