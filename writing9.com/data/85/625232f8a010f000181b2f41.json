After arriving at the Sydney airport, I took your company\u2019s taxi and told the driver my destination clearly, which was the Sofia Hotel CBD branch. However, the drive took me to another Sofia hotel that is extremely far away from my destination, which made me miss my appointment and caused a significant economic detriment to me.",
        "In my opinion, as this is definitely the driver\u2019s fault, I require that the taxi fee  should be refunded to me immediately. In addition, I reckon I am entitled to compensation for the financial loss and an apology.",
