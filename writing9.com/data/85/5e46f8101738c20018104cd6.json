Therefore, it has been debated that whether this trend would obtain positive influence on offsprings of one family who resolves to establish their life due to profession's requirements in another country or not. My essay will analyse both of the perspectives and demonstrate my views at the end of the paragraph.",

A survey on several teenagers whose parents moved to a completely unfamiliar place just to maintain their financial status when they were younger suffer from many mental sickness like depression, autism, or anxiety disorders. Numerous children who suffer from this case feel lost when they live in the new environment. This is because the ability to adapt to elsewhere new limits for a child, and therefore, they are unable to communicate, or have new relationships. This consequently directly affects their education, state of mind, and physical development.",

For instance, in the USA, most children who have already experienced such a change in his life find himself more resilient in making crucial decisions which involve in their career.",
        "In conclusion, the advantages and disadvantages of switching living places for busy parents are even. In my opinion, it creates the opportunity for their children to harden themselves in terms of patience as they adapt to that unaccustomed place."
