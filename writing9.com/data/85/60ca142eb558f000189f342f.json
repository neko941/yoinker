        "Today, every country face environmental issues, while developed countries have more problems related to this. I believe that richer nations could take responsibility for global environmental issues because they have all the resources that would help them to overcome that environmental matters.",
        "To begin with, nations that are well developed have more environmental issues such as air pollution, water pollution, global warming and some others too. All these happened due to more industries, over-population and transportation that cause more pollution. Especially, the industry and other chemical factories,  have to reduce the usage of industries less that will help a lot  to prevent environmental issues. For instance, a few years ago,  a UN report, it had mentioned that if the developed countries control over there industries then it will reduce pollution all over the world but it did not happen.",
        "Moving further, nowadays, everything needs  money to do some work. Rich nations have the money and power to control  environmental issues. However, poor nation has problem-related to basic things like proper water supply, food resources, roads, healthcare, academic and many others then these countries do not have any industries and other major material which leads to environmental problems. Therefore, only rich nations have to face the environment and they are more responsible to create that global environmental problem.",
        "In conclusion, I feel that all regions come together to solve this problem but rich nations have to control moreover their industries process and put some resources to solve this. Poor nations have  to not worry about this because they have more forests or trees than industries or vehicles."
