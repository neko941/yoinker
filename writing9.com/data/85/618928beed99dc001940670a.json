        "Dear Sir or Madam,",
        "Thank you again for offering me the position of supervisor at your company and I am really gratefully for this huge opportunity. As per our last discussion, my joining date was decided as the 1st of December. However, I would like to ask if there is any possibility of postponing my employment start date. The reason is that my father has been hospitalized today due to his severe heart condition. The doctor has suggested keeping him under observation for this week and then performing surgery next week if necessary.",
        "As I am the eldest daughter in the house, I will have to take care of his health and also the insurance-related queries from the hospital myself until my father is discharged. Therefore, I will not be able to start my employment on the previously discussed date.",
        "I will be able to take care of this and join the organisation early next month. I really hope that you will keep the position on hold for me until I return on 15th December.",
        "I would really appreciate it if you could let me know your decision as soon as possible.",
        "Yours faithfully,",
