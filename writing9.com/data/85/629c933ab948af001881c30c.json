        "A highly controversial phenomenon in the contemporary world today relates to whether the mode is a crucial part of the community like art or not. There is no denying the fact that fashion shows require a lot of money and demonstrate clothes are not for real life. But I firmly agree and withstand the former notion. This essay will further elaborate on my visions in the forthcoming paragraphs.",
        "To begin with, videos from fashion weeks look very expensive, b\u0443sides a trend designer who spent years inventing new styles, a lot of people were involved to organize this event like stage staff, advertising companies, and model agencies. For instance, for the last fashion weeks in Milan have been spent 150 000 euros. Needless to say, this price in combination with the fact that most of showed garments are useless in everyday life, was just a waste. But this fact doesn\u2019t diminish its importance to society  the Malevich black square picture is expensive and meaningless at first glance with a price of 140 million dollars.",
        "On the other hand, own collections are not the main target of designers. Most of them are inspired by fashion shows and create the design for everyday wear that we use. For example, my friend who has been inspired by a fashion show dreamed to be one of the professionals in this industry. It motivated him to learn clothing design. As a result, he has his own dress production at an acceptable price. In addition, sometimes fashion shows are arranged for charity purposes, one of the events collected fifty thousand dollars for animal and environment saving.",
        "To sum up, fashion has the right to be an important part of humanity as art. Because fashion like art inspires and makes people better. The fact that fashion requires huge money is just a special case and can not be an argument against setting up fashion in one line with art. In my opinion, I agree with people who think that fashion is a significant part of the community as art. Because these industries are very similar and have the same pros and cons they can be expensive and cheap at the same time but always motivate people to do great things."
