        "Sorry for the late reply, I have been swamped with work this week. I am so happy you are moving to Belgrade, it will be so fun!",
        "Belgrade is an amazing city to live in, but only if you just the right neighbourhood. I know you are going to work in the city centre, but do not look for an apartment there. It is overcrowded, noisy, and expensive. Take a look at the suburbs, specifically Novi Beograd. In my opinion, it is the best value for the money.",
        "On the other hand, public transport is horrendous. It is outdated, slow and unreliable. You will have to take a taxi for the first month or two. When you feel comfortable enough, rent a car. Having one is vital in a city like Belgrade.",
        "The city is known for its rich nightlife. There are plenty of places where you can go out and meet new people. You should check out the Freestyler club on the weekends, by the Sava river. It is one of the main spots for people like us to come and mingle after the working week.",
        "If you have any other questions, do not be a stranger!",
        "Kind regards,",
