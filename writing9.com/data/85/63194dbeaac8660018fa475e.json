        "Nowadays society is likely to buy goods on a platform instead of committing with a store which could be a price and discount. It can be doubted that when buyers are directly going to the shops, they might be faced with a hidden cheat cost that includes its product. This consequently leads to a heightened cost compared to online materials. Furthermore, the advantage of the shopping platform is slightly convenient for everyone who has limited time for purchasing and obligating conditions; it is open 24/7 without obligation.",

However, if they choose to go to physical stores it helps the internal economy and rising the reduction of joblessness. Therefore, the purchaser should consider how worth between those options and influence drawbacks in the future."
