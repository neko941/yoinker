Unfortunately, the driver who drove the bus made us feel terrified and put us at a big risk as he is keep on driving the bus with 100 KPH which was not at all expected. In addition, he did not stop the vehicle at the designated place despite requesting multiple times to follow the rules.",

Hence, I would request you to provide some additional training along with an expert coach who can check his performance sporadically.
