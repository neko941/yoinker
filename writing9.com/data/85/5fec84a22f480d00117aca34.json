        "Handling kids is a much-debated topic. Parents and teachers come up with strict guidelines and many rules for children so that they behave good and to keep them safe. On the contrary, I believe fewer rules with lots of freedom will help children to develop themselves as a good human being and also it ensures their safety. In this essay, I will examine why providing liberty and restricting them less is necessary.",
        "Firstly, teenage is a crucial period of children's growth as during this period they develop several qualities. These attributes will shape them as a better individual with values in future. Parents and teachers should not be too conservative in their approach as this might result in a kid becoming narrow-minded and not open for new ideas. One should not be forced to bind by the rules, because they will end up becoming dependent on every aspect of life. When a child is made to follow strict directives given by the elders, he/she may lose to think independently. For example, from a very young age if one is taught to behave in a certain way then even when the situation demands a kid cannot think of any innovative ways of handling the situation.",
        "Secondly, too much of restriction will indeed have a negative impact on children mentally. When they are caged more and more, they develop a rebellious attitude within themselves which might burst out in future. For example, there was an incident in my hometown, where a teenage kid was denied a mobile phone for several days to play. As a result, the child in anger left the house and lost the way while coming back home. Hence, when kids are tied up there is a high chance that they take extreme steps which parents and teachers will have to regret later. Hence, a few necessary rules and greater freedom will help the overall benefit of an individual from childhood.",
        "To conclude, I believe any boy/girl should not be treated with too many restrictions. Instead, let them enjoy their independence so that they can explore new ideas and impose a few necessary rules which will shape them as better citizens in the future."
