They believe that certain workers deserve to retire and receive a pension at an earlier age.Do you agree or disagree?Which types of workers do you think should benefit from early retirement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.",

        "Almost every occupation can be retired from, depending on the choice of the individual. It is important to know that there are some occupations that are more physically hectic than  others and this can tell on the physical health of an employee. Notwithstanding, I am totally not in support of early retirement. Therefore, every employee should complete service till the set retirement age.",
        "Furthermore, most occupations are in levels, and this is for a reason. At the graduate level, it is believed that the employee is young and vibrant, able to carry out a lot of work ,also the staff is given a high workload. As the staff rises on the career ladder, the workload reduces, especially at the managerial level where supervision and leadership are the most important skills needed at that level. The staff who is older will be able to use his or her experience to carry out the job too.",
        "In addition, retiring at a later age, giving the younger staff opportunity to be trained well, this will help the occupation in a company maintain its standard. On the other hand, If some occupations are allowed to retire at a young age this could affect the culture, standard and retainment level of such occupation. For example, If a  mechanical engineer is allowed to retire early, without having an adequate number of subordinates to carry out the job well, It would affect the job.",
        "In conclusion, there are no particular occupations that have to retire early. I encourage that there should be uniformity in the retirement age."
