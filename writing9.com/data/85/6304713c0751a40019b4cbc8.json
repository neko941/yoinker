Hence, I was terrified after looking into a monthly invoice and bringing this issue to your kind notice immediately without any further damage to me.",

However, I strongly believe that there may be a big scam behind this cybercrime as this was done without my presence. In addition, you may go ahead and  do an  investigation to find out the fact and I would really appreciate it if you do file a complaint at the nearest police department.",
        "Undoubtedly, this will cost me an eye and a leg to pay the bill and I am not sure how to make this payment. Hence, request you to please consider my situation and make a new bill with the actual amount I am ready to make this payment with super urgency since this is in my budget.",
        "I look forward to hearing your reply with an adjustment of my invoice amount.",
