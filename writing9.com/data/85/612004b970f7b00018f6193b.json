        "There has been a growing debate whether to work your entire life for the same company or to switch between different ones during your career. In this essay, both opinions will be discussed and I will highlight why I believe working for the same organization is way better.",
        "To begin with, working in the same organization is much more convenient and sustainable. Although some will argue that this is boring; however, it is much less stressful. This allows employees to grow  and build their career step by step in an environment that is well known for them and within your comfort zone. For example, if the company is looking for a new position they always prefer to hire their employees in the new post over strangers applying from other companies. Being in the same place for your entire career saves the hassle of job hunting every now and then and the long stressful interviews that might end up with rejections.",
        "On the other hand, some people believe that being in the same company can affect one's personal growth and development. As there is little challenge and stress, people can be more reluctant in developing their skills. For instance, people who do the same job every day become bored and less motivated to give more. The more secure people feel at their positions the less motivated they will get. Stress and competition are the main drivers for production. But does this actually work for the company's benefit?",
        "In conclusion, working in the same place during one's career can be advantageous and less stressful; however, changing places is more challenging. Personally, I believe that less stressful workers can be more beneficial for organizations."
