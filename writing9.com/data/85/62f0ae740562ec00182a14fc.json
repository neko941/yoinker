        "Perhaps, I had already finished my bachelor's in English and consequently, I want to further enhance my knowledge of the language. I wanted to request  detailed information about the course. I am specifically looking for the Advanced Studies program which is going to start next December.",
        "In addition, I  want to apply for a hostel room as I am an international student and had never been to England. It would reduce the hassle of finding a place to stay, beforehand. Moreover, I would prefer  shared accommodation with an Asian because most of our culture is the same and it would be economical.",
        "I must inform you that I am allergic to gluten, could you please confirm for me if my special diet requests can be met by the hostel canteen? and if not, whether I will be allowed access to a kitchen so that I can prepare my own food?",
