When I checked out, I had always thought that my watch was in my bag the whole time, however, just today, I realized it was missing. The last time I remembered, it was on the side table on the left side of the bed, and I must have forgotten to pack it.",
        "It was a silver Citizen watch with a gold lock. Also, it has my initials, GJ, engraved on the back. As it is valuable to me, could you please check if it is still there or if someone already found it? I am willing to give a reward to the one that could return it.",
        "If you have any further information about it, please feel free to contact me anytime at 070-1234-5678 or [email\u00a0protected] I am looking forward to hearing from you soon.",
