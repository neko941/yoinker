        "There are  numerous problems which are the absence of physical activities in countless workers, especially in today's technology-focused world, which can lead to affliction.The causes of this appear to be focused on several areas, and the number of solutions also appear to be possible.",
        "Perhaps the major factor here is the insufficient term to do the exercises which may be the one exhausted, the other fresh.Moreover, these range from working hours to leisure points.For example, different persons spend their relaxing clock on watching TV, using the internet, eating and sleeping.Furthermore, generally speaking, movements are nowhere near as comfortable as the above activities, following this exertion need to afford many physical motions that tend to be possible the physical suffering at hands, legs and joints.In addition, another root of this problem is the reduction in the company where they employ for the holidays such as weekends, meaning that a large number of employment fix their schedule that is Saturday as doing tasks.For instance, if employees had more free moments, exercises such as running, next, walking in the morning would be done.Subsequently, it must be said that not all human beings actually want to do workouts, because their interests lie elsewhere.Examples can be seen in other hobbies including reading the books that can be written about pieces of knowledge, literature and fiction, this was followed by cooking.Nevertheless, in many cases, all of the above situations are possible  health problems, for symbols, eye diseases.",
        "Turning to possible solutions, an obvious step would be to make the timetable regarding this which describes what pace should do their business, after that, what future should do exercises.For illustration, running in the morning does not take much time, therefore,therefore  individuals can do that thing.Over and above that the second easiest way to do is walking at the building where you employ.As a result, souls do not need statistics instances for movements.Consequently, the supervisor should make the competitions with interesting games.There are some samples related to overhead ideas, concluding the short occasion which can make the mind of the people to be fresh.Finally, citizens should reduce the screen era, which means that problem tends to be the lazy community.",
        "In summary, inadequate minutes, different interests and being tired appear to be the main factors.A coordinated response by the state, preparing schedule and opportunities which are allowed by Boss may well lessen the severity of the situation."
