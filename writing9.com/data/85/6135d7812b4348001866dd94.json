        "These days, it can be seen that  computers and modems have changed the working style and effectively advanced the industry. They have provided many merits for office staffs working in a professional area. I agree that office workers must be supported to work from home as not only they would manage time but also reserve money.",
        "Firstly, one of the main benefits of working at home is that workers would save extensive time which would have been lost due to commutation and congestion. Furthermore, they are likely to spend a hefty amount of money on transport which might prove to be troublesome. Therefore, if the employees are allowed to work from home, they may cut down these extra expenditures and decide to save this spending for the near future. For instance, money could be effectively consumed on family expenses like expeditions, trips, visiting malls,etc. This would be a great opportunity to spend quality time with families or friends and commence a warm and delightful gathering.",
        "On top of that, employees could independently work based on their suitable work timings and further wouldn't be restricted to a permanent time schedule which otherwise they would have in the office. This would assist them to reduce their stress levels and be confident enough to meet the client's requirements. For example, there are different categories of staff who prefer working as per shifts as there would be no managerial pressure and could finish their tasks productively.",
        "Taking everything into consideration, the technology advancement has eased the worker's life to a great extent. For employees, working from home proved beneficial and cordial than working in the office."
