        "Nowadays residing in another nation where one is required to speak in the native language can result in severe roadblocks both in the community and during everyday life activities. I concur with this notion due to the resulting ineffectiveness in communication and  social segregations. Therefore in this essay, I will tackle this issue and offer a conclusion.",
        "First and foremost, living in a foreign country comes with a responsibility to effectively communicate with the natives in a tongue that one is not fluent in. In other words, the inability of a person to correctly convey the actual meaning of his words to nearby friends can result in distorted relations and breakable bonds. Take, for example, in a survey conducted on the effects of language barrier on friendships, it was determined that most friendships did not last because of a lack of proper understanding between the two. This in itself demonstrates the negative influence this holds on social issues which comes from a person's stay in another country but with limited language command.",
        "Secondly, an individual's inability to effectively  speak a native language means he can not properly communicate with friends at work and give the required information. To put this in perspective, even though a person can grasp what is being said to him, he can not give an accurate answer due to the limited language use. This further compromises his ability to work effectively in a conducive environment. For instance, if a person working at a health facility can not relay important instructions to the patients simply because he can not construct sentences accurately in a foreign tongue, he risks the patients' lives and causes more problems in his line of duty.",
        "By way of conclusion, I reaffirm my stance that problems exist in situations where a person resides in a foreign land as he will not be communicating effectively which results in poor relations with friends and in his inability to perform his social duties well. This problem can last for a few more months until a person gradually understands it."
