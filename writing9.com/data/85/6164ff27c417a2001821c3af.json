        "There is a controversial perspective heating a debate over whether the authorities\u2019 budget should be allocated on healthcare exploration rather than revamping the environment quality. While this thinking is valid to a certain extent, I consider myself a proponent of this notion since both aspects hold similar significant values. Therefore, it is a fulfillment of the Governor\u2019s response to divide the budget equally.",
        "There are many compelling reasons why the Government should fund healthcare investment. It is clear to note that the development of our society has led to an increasing number of infectious diseases that pose severe threats to people. As a result, the scientist\u2019s research for them is to address the issue and help citizens to ensure a decent level of wealth. Covid-19 can be cited as an essential example since it has become the direst issue nowadays for not only causing a high death rate all over the world but also bringing down the economic sectors of many countries. Thus, the ruler of many regions bears the responsibility to invest a part of the source for the scientist to create new medical treatments as well as effective vaccines. In other words, it is crucial for medical exploration to be invested in to deal with some problems related to health like the aforementioned example above.",
        "While the paramount significance of medical research is widely acknowledged, nature should be allocated cash as well. It is undeniable that human health depends on surrounding elements such as air, water, and soil, to name a few. Moreover, humans bear most of the responsibility for environmental pollution. In fact, the massive exhaust emissions released from factories built for manufacturing catastrophically exacerbate the air pollution. For those reasons, financial support from the authorities to preserve the environment is significant to create positive impacts. In addition, campaigns raising awareness of alarming planet degradation should be intensified by the government for people to acknowledge this current dire issue.",
        "To sum up, I am well convinced that the rulers\u2019 coffers should be balanced for both medical research and environmental fields."
