        "Pictorial representation in a story along with the text in newspapers or tv media is becoming increasingly common. The main reason behind such an argument is that pictures are far more effective compared to words. I agree with this argument and will demonstrate the reasons to further support it.",
        "A picture speaks a thousand words, if we come across a picture in the newspaper it instantly grabs our attention and interest to read more about the story develops. A graphic used in putting a point across makes a particular read more gripping. Moreover, pictures help in depicting the information much quickly and effectively which is the need of the hour as people don't have enough time to read through a heap of texts. If an article is just text-based and has no pictures or visuals associated, it is more likely to be missed by the reader. This can sometimes result in missing very important and useful pieces of information.",
        "Although, text in a news story can give you the detail about the events, yet the retention power is increased if a video or an image related to those events is shown. As most teenagers these days are not interested in reading long texts or news articles, visual representation helps in increasing awareness about certain topics like politics, sports, current affairs especially in this age group which is very important. For instance, adding a photo of a famous sports personality along with the article can encourage youngsters to read about it.",
        "However, there are negative impacts if graphics used are violent in nature, but, in conclusion, images or graphics or any form of visual representation can be extremely useful in putting the point across or helping the person understand and connect with a certain piece of information."
