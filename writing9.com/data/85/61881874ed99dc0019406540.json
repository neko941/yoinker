        "Nowadays, parents spend a great deal of time finding a way to encourage their heir to get higher scores in school. In this regard, while some parents attend to pay money as a kind of award for their child, others stand on the other side of the continuum, holding the standpoint that offering money is not an appropriate approach to attain this achievement. As it relates to me, I concur with the former group, and the reasons to substantiate my viewpoint are established in the following.",
        "First, offering money as a gift for school-age heir will impact the future of children and help them to be professional individuals. It is crystal clear that more practice increases the chance of being a successful person, and some backgrounds are crucial to practice properly. Money is one of the essential backgrounds which not only teaches students the way of managing their money but also they are able to find this hint \"what can they do if they save this property\". I firmly believe, to be an impactful person in society, the student should be familiar with the rule of money in school and both parents and school have some important responsibilities to increase this awareness. For example, when I was at school, my father promised me that if I got a high score in math he will pay 50 dollars, I attempted more and more to get a high score in math. Because I needed this pay to participate in a robotic class. Whenever I got tired I remind this reward. Finally, I got a high score in maths and I succeed to participate in the robotic class. I usually think that this class flourished my talents and results in that I choose electrical engineer in the fields of robotics as a major.",
        "Another significant reason to be mentioned is that paying the cash can cause more educational benefits for scion. In the light of this, children will find that better concentration on the concept, increases their grade, which results in the next award. Furthermore, students are able to invest in other activities such as entertainment, sports, and useful courses which increase the efficiency of the school. In fact, usually, there are some special activities which need money to pay and in this way, this price will help students to participate in what they want.",
        "To conclude, I firmly believe that the advantages of offering money for children by parents are overweight the disadvantages. First, increase educational benefits. Secondly, is a kind of background for the future of the student."
