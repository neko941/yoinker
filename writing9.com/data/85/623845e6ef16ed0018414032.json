        "I am writing this letter asking if you can give a presentation at the upcoming play-based learning conference . I understand that standing in front of an audience is not really your cup of tea but I believe you are the best person to perform this role.",
        "The conference will be held on the 5th of October  2022 at the school dining hall,I chose this venue because  it is spacious ,therefore social distancing will not be a challenge.I chose you to do the presentation because you attended a workshop on play-based learning in Brazil,so with your expertise, it will be easier for you to deliver the presentation.Another thing is ,your spoken English is very clear,so people will be able to understand you clearly.",
        "I have made arrangements with the general staff from the school to move the smart board to the dining room and they will make sure there are enough whiteboard markers at the venue, but If you prefer a projector ,I can arrange one for you.I have ordered some refreshments from our school cafeteria to be served during the conference.",
        "I will be looking forward to hearing from you.",
