        "Looking from a broad environmental perspective, excessive consumption of natural resources in the twenty-first century has put the world in a more catastrophic scenario than ever before. The following paper will be highlighting further challenges resulted from this worrying trend as well as examining plausible measures that can alleviate the issues if taken into implementation.",
        "In the short run, sudden shrinkages in natural resources, especially forest, will worsen the ongoing pollution. As these natural air purifiers vanish at an astonishing rate, the pollutants will soon pile up due to less carbon dioxide converted into oxygen via trees\u2019 photosynthesis. Eventually, the world\u2019s population will soon suffer from numerous respiratory problems as the air they inhale on a daily basis is severely contaminated. Worse still, taking a closer look into the long-term effects of this note-worthy issue, the future generations will have to face  the scarcity of non-renewable energy. As a result, this will undoubtedly require them to have a switch to alternative forms of energy, which require exorbitant specialised technologies for operation.",
        "By acknowledging all the obvious potential dangers mentioned above, putting an end to this issue requires extra encouragement, particularly from the government. Among many proposals that have been put on the table for discussion, the most frequently mentioned and seemingly plausible one is stricter policies on logging. Setting limits to exploitation activities of logging companies have proven to be incredibly promising in many economies as Mother Nature can have sufficient time to heal herself. In addition to this, local figures of authorities are also advised to hold campaigns to raise citizens\u2019 awareness of environmental protection. These can be easily achieved through various means of advertising, giving out information about the current impacts of human activities along with sustainable practices.",
        "Taking everything into consideration, the uncontrollable consumption of natural resources has put mankind at more risk than we have ever thought. However, stronger law enforcement and an alteration in people\u2019s mindset can help mitigate the problems."
