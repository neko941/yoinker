However, we have to maintain our kitchen since all the cabinets have been broken up, and the tiles should be changed. Although  I always remind the workers to keep the noise down, sometimes it is inevitable to work without machines which makes lots of noise.",

I would ask workers to cut the woods in their company so the machines sound do not disturb you. Also, they are going to stop working after five so your children can easily concentrate on their homework.",
        "Please let me know if we should take more steps to tackle this issue for you.",
