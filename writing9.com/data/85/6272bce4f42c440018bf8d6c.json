        "Dear Mr Bob,",
        "Well,  I am writing to draw your attention to the subject matter of an initial deposit that was $2000 at the time of renting an apartment and signing a contract and it was clearly mentioned in a clause that rent is refundable. in this regard I am requesting numerous times verbally to refund it, therefore, I decided to write a letter to you as proof evidence as the last resort and I am still requesting to refund my security because I need the money to rent out another apartment nearby my college area.",
        "Furthermore, I left your apartment in a neat and clean condition without damaging your property, as well as according to a lease deed or written contract I am entitled to a refund at the time of leaving your premises.",
        "lastly, I would like to warn you that within a week if you would not pay back my initial deposit I would like to present a petition to the honourable court with all evidence such as the rent deed and photocopy of the initial security cheque and then the court will decide your punishment.",
        "I am looking forward to your immediate response to this letter within a week of letter arrival.",
        "Yours sincerely,",
