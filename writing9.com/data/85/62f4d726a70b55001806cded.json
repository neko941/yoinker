        "I am writing this letter to give you some feedback regarding my stay experience in your hotel last week from July 21st till 23rd. I would like to share some points related to services.",
        "To begin with, the warm welcome I received was commendable.  Moving on to the amenities  the room offered was beyond expectations. It was well maintained hygienically with a wonderful hill view. Furthermore, I must mention the variety of delicious food offered. However, there are some low points which I observed such as the swimming pool area having no changing room facility. Besides this, the major downside is the unavailability of pick and drop services considering the far distance from the transport connectivity.",
        "In view of the above, I would like to suggest that it would be great if you can look into the changing area near the pool facility , and start pickup and drop services to airports and stations which will be very convenient for the guest as well as help your property economically.",
        "I am looking forward to visiting  this beautiful property in near future again.",
        "Yours faithfully,",
