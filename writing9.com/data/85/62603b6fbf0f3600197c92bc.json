        "Dear Mr Smith,",
        "My name is Adam Wilmer and I am very happy to inform you that recently, I have completed a short cookery lesson from your cookery institute named \"Learn to Cook\". I am writing this letter to provide my valuable feedback.",
        "First of all, I would like to thank you and the academy teachers who helped me a lot to complete my cookery course in Italian Food. Throughout the program, I enjoyed not only various Italian dishes but also other cuisines as well. However, my major subject was  Italian food, I tried almost everything at my home and my parents liked all the recipes which I had learnt at school. In addition, I have made Italian pizza last week for my younger brother's birthday and that lavish dish was appreciated by almost all the guests.",
        "I am deeply humbled by your institute for facilitating such a nice course. However, It would be more beneficial if you can offer a lesson on pastry designs.",
        "I really admire your efforts to deliver the best courses in the town.",
        "Yours Sincerely,",
