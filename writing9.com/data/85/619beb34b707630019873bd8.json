        "Undoubtedly, there are various methods to demonstrate appreciation for dear people such as relatives and friends. While some advocates deem that giving presents is a sound option others might argue that there are other approaches to show them your respect. This essay will analyze both points of view before expressing my own opinion.",
        "On the one hand, many think that giving gifts makes a positive impact on people\u2019s bonding since these things are tangible. To be more precise, there are some individuals who have quite a hectic lifestyle, and they simply lack enough spare time which they could assign to their family or friends. Hence, they are inclined to purchase fancy gifts in order to establish a relationship and make them feel their all-time favourite. A prime example that illustrates this approach is Arab countries where to showcase your appreciation for relatives and friends regardless if it is a special occasion or not is to present them with a piece of jewellery or fragrance.",
        "On the other hand, provided with a gift cannot be compared with actions that stand for care along with affection. Nobody would argue with the fact that when our dears are burdened with problems the sure-fire way to show them our love is to lend a helping hand. For instance, if any of your family member or friend is coping with some difficulties concerning their wellbeing, spending valuable time with them and offering them all the support we can is the appropriate way to show that we care for them. Therefore, no presents on Earth are able to substitute this approach.",
        "In summary, beyond any doubt, it is extremely crucial to show our care for people whom we are concerned about; however, I believe that gifts are not particularly the only way to express our feelings towards our loved ones. Assistance during challenging periods of time is the sure-fire way to show affection to them rather than presenting them with gifts on different occasions."
