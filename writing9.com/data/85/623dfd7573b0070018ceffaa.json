        "I am Vijaya, pursuing my masters in the department of microbiology. I live in our college room with another student. I am writing this letter to share my inconvenience with you.",
        "Firstly, I will explain the problems I am facing with whom I am sharing my room. As you know our exams are approaching I need to study hard but I am not able to give my efforts. The girl who stays with me always has friends visiting our room and they even have parties here till the morning. I asked her many times to consider my difficulty but there is no change from her side.",
        "In addition to this, she is not at all cooperative. Sometimes she takes my things without even asking me. I think that is not good.",
        "Therefore I request you to change my room for the next term of my course. I prefer a single room because I don't want to face these issues once again. Moreover, I can concentrate on my studies peacefully without any hurdles.",
        "Yours sincerely,",
