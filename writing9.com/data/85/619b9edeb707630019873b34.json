        "Some people argue that to decrease the crimes, a long prison sentence is the best way while other people believe that this may not be as effective as we think.In my opinion, to reduce crimes, we should try some alternative ways rather than those kinds of sentences.",
        "On one hand, people think that if we give some serious punishments, criminals will afraid and do not dare to commit the crimes. In addition, the people who are already in jail will regret  what they did in their past. But it is not true. The person who doesn't want to commit another case doesn't ever do it again whether u give a long or short prison sentence. For example, there may be criminals who committed with no intentions or who is threatened to commit.There will never do this again when they are free because they don't want to involve even in their first experiences. Do you ever hear about serial killers? They are the ones that do the crimes with intentions. They will manage the crimes again and again even when they are free after a serious judgement. So, the terms of prison is not an important way that can cope with the crimes.",
        "I want to suggest some alternative ways to prevent  serious cases such as murders and rape cases. We all people grow mostly depending on our childhood cravings and the thoughts of surrounding that we had to live. So we must educate children by telling them stories, showing the postcards that involve the crimes.  And also we need to make them understand not to do bad things to others.For example, a child who lives with rude parents has a percentage to be rude when he gets older and a child who lives with  generous parents will grow into a good man.",
        "In conclusion,childhood lives are more important than longer prison statements. We just need to bring up children without traumas and have a good mindset from the start.So in my opinion, longer prison sentences are not the best way to control the crimes."
