        "Corporate companies are employing the candidates who give their entire career for the  company. I personally disagree with this procedure, holding to one group for lifetime could lead them to miss great opportunities which are waiting for them outside. This essay will explain the reasons to support my statement by taking examples from newspapers and journals.",
        "To begin with, candidates employing long-term with the organisation could lead them to numerous problems. One among them is, losing big opportunities which could enhance their career with higher wage or position in different organisation. Most importantly, spending complete live with one company would give them to learn only one skill in their entire career. For instance, a recent survey conducted by the Times of New York revealed that 65% of employees who work with one business mastered only one skill in their 35-years of experience with the business. As a result, at the end of their retirement, these people are not satisfied with their job.",
        "Secondly, companies hiring employees for lifetime guarantee for their work could lead them to lose huge money, if the company decided to shut their business due to low profits. This could navigate them to pay redundancy payment, annual leaves, and notice period payment. Therefore, this is a big burden on the organisation. For example, the shutting down of Holden manufacturing in Australia made the group to pay a lot of money to the employees who signed a full-time commitment to the company.",
        "Finally, companies seeking employees for entire lifetime responsibility could be a great disadvantage for both the candidate and the company. Thus, I personally disagree that long time promise with one organisation is not recommended."
