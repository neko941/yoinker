        "A highly controversial issue today relates to whether to have parents\u2019 collaborate in their juveniles\u2019 school activities or not. In this essay, I am going to examine this question from both points of view and then give my own perspective on the matter.",
        "There are people who argue that the benefits of guardians\u2019 help considerably outweigh its disadvantages. The main reason for believing this is that kids could have a great opportunity to learn with their mothers and fathers despite only their teachers. It is also possible to say that it is a good way to improve the family\u2019s communication because they probably will stay together for much more time than before. One good illustration of this is present in many families\u2019 routine where the guardians have to work all day long and do not have enough time to talk with their relatives. Helping their children with homework, they could not only teach them but also have the opportunity to chat about many things such as how was their day.",
        "On the other hand, others believe that collaborating with kids\u2019 school lessons may be a bad idea. It is often argued that youngsters must execute their homework by themselves. People often have this opinion because this is an important moment in their life where they need to stimulate their brain looking at overcoming their difficulties.  A second point is that guardians\u2019 intention in helping their juveniles with their homework could generate the opposite results, low grades. A particularly good example here is that a child and an adult have different levels of knowledge. What can be difficult for a kid could be extremely easy for an adult.",
        "In conclusion, I believe both arguments have their merits. On balance, however, I feel that children should learn and execute their activities by themselves. This is because they are at school to learn and either if their activities were not correct, they probably will learn a lot with it."
