        "Many claimes that relishing the jobs are more significant than job society. However,some people opine that remaining in a stable occupation is more effective than enjoying the works. From my point of,view, I believe that job pleasure is the most crucial thing for a person.",
        "Firstly ,in my opinion ,one of the conspicuous reasons that enjoyment is more important is advancing. For example, the people who set up their favourite business regularly are more successful in their jobs. It means that they usually could reach a staggering progressive in their paths in professions. This would create a noticeable advance in human lives besides jobs. This would definitely for delightful occupation. Therefore ,this makes it clear ,people who relish their works do not deviate from their original goals in addition they proceed to follow the significant items that are required to have without ceasing.",
        "By contrast,some believe that having a constant profession is more essential because this would be a need for a country. For instance ,there are multiple jobs that a country is required to have ,such as doctors , psychologists and nurses. It  means that these persons claim that all people who want to choose an occupation should regard the society needs besides ignoring their favourable works . This would create a space where all needs of occupations in countries are provided without employing foreign workforces. As a result ,it becomes apparent ,for numerous humans around the  world, the needs of the community are more necessary than personal choices.",
        "To summarise ,I personally believe that ,work enjoyment is more crucial than the requirements of the community. It is predicted that to continue personal pleasure for having a profession all the population around the world will accomplish to their cherish profession also will proceed to progressive."
