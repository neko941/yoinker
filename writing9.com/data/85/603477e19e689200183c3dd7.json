        "With the advent of technology, pupils are able to grasp and learn information more easily and instantly. In my opinion, I completely agree with this statement as youngsters are quite aware of the mode of resources and know-how to access available data.",
        "First of all, in  light of the proliferation of globalisation, the Internet has made the distribution of knowledge exclusively simple.Owing to the main reason, learning material is easily accessible and approachable within seconds through the various handheld devices such as mobile phones and these are significantly portable to carry around. For example, an increasing number of students use Google Chrome, Youtube, or Safari  to complete their assignments. These sites provide detailed and accurate information about the topics. Therefore, adolescents nowadays are highly dependent upon these sources due to their reliability.In addition, along with the subjective material,students can have in-depth knowledge from the uploaded videos made by the various skilled mentors. These are the most comfortable platforms to share knowledge and schoolchildren are very well aware of how to use it appropriately which enhance their knowledge.",
        "Moving further, Teenagers can be aware of more information as it can be shared very feasibly among the masses through emails , text messages , downloading files and PDFs'. In other words, knowledge is not restricted to a few people only due to various mediums of transport of knowledge, they can share the files with each other. For instance, pupils at school share their work through the web and enhance their circle of knowledge by sharing their new ideas.",
        "In conclusion, learners at school, university and colleges can have more information due to multiple technological gadgets which have made this process much more convenient"
