        "Nowadays consuming convenience foods has become more popular among people because it makes the digital lifestyle easier . Although I think that it maintains some obvious negative consequences, I strongly believe that the advantages of convenience foods can outweigh its disadvantages .",
        "On the one hand,  consuming  canned meals has undoubtedly  various adverse influences on  humans . The first reason is that it can engender some health problems , such as obesity. It is clear that controlling fat and sugar levels may be impossible ,therefore persons who are consuming fast cooking may be overweighted . For example , many studies show that the major cause of obesity is eating a fast meal that contains  high levels of unhealthy ingredients . In addition , our dependence on pre-cooked cuisine can lead to a decrease  in physical practices. Individuals  may tend to be lazier and  less active , moreover , they can become related to  lazy habits and carrying less to be dynamic and  energetic .",
        "On the other hand , there are many reasons why people prefer canned snacks instead of homemade meals . Firstly , it provides  persons more flexibility in their daily life . The ease of preparing canned food in less time brings them the ability to perform their daily activities and responsibilities without any  inconveniences . For instance , employees  , who work far from their homes , can take their lunch in the company with ordered canned cuisine  without any problems . Secondly , convenience foods bring comfort to those who should prepare snacks especially women, Instead of going  shopping for  grocery  products and preparing and cooking meals , they can easily use canned cuisine for themselves and their families , It is effortless and saving time and energy .",
        "In conclusion , consuming much-canned food can lead to a few obvious problems . However , I believe that the tendency is the best choice for eating and the benefits that it brings about can exceed its drawbacks ."
