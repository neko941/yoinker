        "Dear Sir/Madam,",
        "I am excited to write  this letter to inform you about my moving to Canada, Vancouver city. I will be travelling during the 2nd week of August along with my better half.",
        "As you heard, we are very new to that place and not familiar with the city and locations since it is a huge capital and the best   immigrants.Therefore, we are looking at a quiet fine place without any traffic noise, in addition, we cannot pay such skyrocketing rents as we just gain a basic salary. Last but not the least, we do not need any mind-blowing sceneries and luxury flats.",
        "However, I strongly recommended having a small and nice flat with basic facilities despite the busy traffic and costly rents. Firstly, we need full furniture along with utilities as well and this would help us to save the investment on them. We both always work from home therefore, it is much needed to have  better internet service and no matter how much they will charge.",
        "I look forward to seeing your response with good news about the best flat with all the required facilities.",
        "Yours Faithfully,",
        "Lakshmi."
