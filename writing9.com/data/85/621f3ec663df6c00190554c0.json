        "In recent times, certain people opine that we have too much freedom to decide on things that we want. I disagree with this notion because we have limited income and strict governmental policies to follow.",
        "First and foremost, even if we might be perceived as having more choices than ever before, having a very limited source of income to use in our daily life activities does restrict the number of options we can have. In other words, because the amount of money that most people earn at the end of the month is only sufficient to carter for a few items out of the many that they might wish to possess, it limits the number of choices one can make with regards to the number of items to own. Take, for instance, a person earning less than a dollar per week, even though he might have several plans of going on vacation or enjoying some luxurious time with his family, he is incapable of so doing due to the limitations in his income. This in itself depicts how limited resources restrict the choices one can have in any given situation.",
        "Additionally, the strict governmental policies also contribute to the limitations in the choices people make. In other words, due to the challenging rules that govern what people should or should not own or the kind of careers they can choose, their choices are often few. For example, for a person in Zambia to buy a car from a foreign land, he is required to wait for governmental approval in order to be allowed access through the border which usually takes months to happen. This significantly reduces the chances of one owning more vehicles as he would have wished to.",
        "By way of conclusion, I reaffirm my stance that people currently do not have more choices as compared with those in the past due to very stiff governmental rules and the limitations of resources to use in daily life. These regulations keep getting worse by the day."
