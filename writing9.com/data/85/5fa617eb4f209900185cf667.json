        "It is an irrefutable fact,, that new devices offer the opportunity to develop different skills now a days in all over the world. Today, people a producing movies by movil. The following up, paragraphs will analize with explanations if creating pictures is a positive activity. Finally, as a conclusion I\u00b4ll give my personal opinion.",
        "First, around 50 years ago, the industry film was reached for just a few group of people. These people held all the tools required to produce a movie. Cameras, scenes, actors, actresses and much more. So, after they finished to produce the picture, they did have special movie theatres to show to the public in general. Of course people had to pay a ticket to wach the film. For example:  In the 70\u00b4s public can not make a movie because they didnot had the tools.",
        "Second, currently in youtube, it can bee seen short films that any one can develop. In addition, people who maybe do not know any thing about how to produce a film, now a days are discovering this hability, and some of them are very good. Furthermore, they are reflecting more naturally different aspects of human life, such as emotions, ways of life, ways of thinking and things that people are interesting on. For instance,: Tik-taks are not films, but they are very close, and some of them are really good. Especially, reflecting the interest of common individuals.",
        "To sum up, in my personal opinion, to produce films with new devices and technology is a positive way to evolve habilities. At the same time, people are ilustrating their perspective of the world."
