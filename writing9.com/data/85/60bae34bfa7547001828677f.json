        "I am professionally working as a Software Developer for a consultant firm in New Delhi and have a bachelor\u2019s degree in Electronics Engineering from one of the top tier colleges in North India. I have read the eligibility criteria for admission into the aforementioned course on your website, and I am eager to join it. While the relevance of my qualification does not meet those requirements, but I want to mention that I have covered and used a wide range of elementary concepts of computing such as linear arithmetic and non-linear progressions during my two years of job as a software developer since it involves an immense amount of complex calculations for building various computer applications.",
        "In view of my practical usage of the basic concepts of mathematical computation, which I strongly believe will be sufficient for the course, along with my passion for this field, I request you to review my application with special consideration to let me participate in this academic course.",
        "I will be looking forward to your reply.",
