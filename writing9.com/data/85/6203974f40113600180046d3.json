        "Childhood is considered to be the most beautiful one of life seasons.Nowadays,the privilege provided for young people is more compared to those given to older generations. This evolution can create both good and bad manners in heir. In my opinion, parents should provide freedom to  these young groups under certain conditions.",
        "Firstly,the changes in  lifestyle have significantly caused a drastic change in the way we treat children,resulting in more freedom to this peer group.This phenomenon will help them to know more about the world.For instance,kids are allowed to carry mobile phones and through which they can learn new things.Secondly,strict parenting will eventually break the soothing bond between parents and offspring, so freedom is an essential thing for them as well.This will gradually help them to understand how they should handle each situation in life.",
        "However,the world keeps on changing, so unconditional flexibility may ruin this peer group. Child abuse cases are increasing at an alarming rate so a threshold should be set by guardians themselves for their day to day activities.For instance,they should be advised to reach home within a particular time. Furthermore, there are certain points where the heir should be restricted.For example, usage of alcohol, smoking if parents are doing this in front of kids automatically it became a habit for them as well.",
        "In my opinion,flexibility is essential for young people to become  independent individuals,but it should be within a threshold limit and that limit should be determined by guardians themselves.By way of conclusion, the flexibility offered to young people is in such a way that it should not make them feel that they are under the control of their elders  at the same time the elders should monitor them as well."
