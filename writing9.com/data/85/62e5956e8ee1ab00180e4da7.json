        "In this contemporary epoch, there is irrefutable debate among folk about the carelessness of our parents. There are copious inhabitants who argue that the veteran ought to send to old-age homes while  the rest of them think that it is imperative for them to stay at home. In my perspective, I promote the latter notion, the reasons for this statement will be expounded in the next forthcoming paragraphs.",
        "To begin with, the benefits of the old-age house, the most preponderant is that the senior citizen especially, the people above 60,s always have a need of doctors because they can easily be attacked by some virus or an infection. So, it is noticeable that old responsibility places are usually designed for this purpose a team of doctors is always present at these institutes. For example, According to a recent survey. In Nigeria, 6 out of 10 patients with diabetes had been saved at an old-age hut because of care. However, this is an efficient ratio compared to the outer world.As a result, this trend is positive to some extent.",
        "On the other hand, I personally agree with the notion of taking care at home because our parents spend their whole lives serving us, So, it is actually a good time to help them in their old age. In other words, most   people get engaged in some contagious diseases because of loneliness and depression. To cite an example, According to a recent survey,stated that  China has a better percentage of elders than any other country. Because  there are no old resorts and also Chinese culture is famous to respect their elders. As a result, these factors cannot be wrong to promote this view.",
        "In the nutshell, according to the aforenamed quarrels, I personally believe that it is an effective way to prevent our parents from deadliest viruses or infections but the care at old age homes cannot be ignored"
