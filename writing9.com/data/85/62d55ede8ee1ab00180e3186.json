        "Dear Sir/Madam,",
        "I am writing to express my disappointment regarding the missing items related to my purchase of a 18-inch, intel i10 processor HP EliteBook touch laptop from one of your Chroma showrooms located on downside street in Michigan. To be specific, the purchase date was 18-06-2022 around 6.30 pm.",
        "Since I had my flight on the same day around 10.30 pm, I couldn't open the box and check for the items. After payment, I immediately collected my package and rushed to the airport to take my flight to India. On reaching home, I unpacked the kit and found that a few accessories like a charger and a LAN cable were not available. This left me extremely upset as I planned to utilise the device for my new upcoming projects.",
        "Furthermore, I have attached the bill copy and the picture of the items that were placed in the box for your perusal. It would be great if you arrange to send these missing accessories by international registered post immediately to the address mentioned below. I hope to receive my goods at the earliest possible.",
        "Yours faithfully,",
