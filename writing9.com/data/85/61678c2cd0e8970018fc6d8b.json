I am extremely interested in collaborating with your institution because I would like to bring back to the place that helped my mother get better and eventually, overcome her illness. A few months ago, she was extremely sick and thanks to your hospitality, she felt at home.",
        "While I do not particularly know the kind of help I could offer, I do feel ,however, that I would be really happy if I could be close to cancer patients, even if it just means helping out by bringing their breakfasts. For the last two years, I acquired plenty of experience with basic health care, after dealing with my own mother's cancer.",
        "I am currently studying a Master's degree in Psychology at ASU, so I will probably have more available time on weekends (any time) or holidays. I would highly appreciate it if you would give me the opportunity to assist the hospital and make an impact in my community.",
