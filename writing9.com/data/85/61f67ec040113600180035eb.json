        "The problem I am facing is that my roommate was playing video games loudly every evening sometimes until midnight. Moreover, he often phoned his friend so loudly in the middle of the night.",
        "I tried to request him to lower the voice or sound ,especially at night. But he still keeps on doing as  usual. That noise is really stressful for me to concentrate on my studies and sleep. Sometimes I feel that I did not sleep enough and the next day I cannot focus on my lesson because of this.",
        "If it is possible, please transfer me to another room. I would prefer a single room or share with a student who does not have this type of attitude.",
        "I hope you understand my problems and look forward to hearing from you soon.",
