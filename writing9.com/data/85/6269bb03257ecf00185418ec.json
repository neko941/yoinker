        "The ability to speak a foreign language fluently may be considered a priority nowadays. Therefore, it is said in this regard that both social and practical issues could emerge while residing in a country where a different tongue needs to be spoken, a perspective which I completely support given the inherent difficulties involved in such a scenario.",
        "Firstly, one of the main issues related to staying in a nation whose native dialect is different involves considerable limitations while trying to communicate ideas in that specific one. Certain situations, for instance, may make it challenging to talk naturally to locals, which often leads to a feeling of frustration that in turn hinders any motivation to socialize confidently and create bonds with potential new friends. In addition to this self-restraint, a perceived lack of fluency typically indicates that an individual is a foreigner, and as a result, unfortunate instances of discrimination could emerge, though these are relatively infrequent.",
        "Second, not only communication inconveniences can occur, but also certain daily-life tasks might become more complex to fulfil when proficiency is limited. This is usually the case when following directions to get somewhere, given that both locations and instructions could be misunderstood if they are unfamiliar or newly learned, with the stressful outcome of late arrivals to meetings of any type. For example, formal errands are another activity which could become especially harder while speaking a different language, taking into consideration those related to the renovation of official documents abroad as is the case of a visa, essential for migration processes.",
        "In conclusion, I totally agree with the thought that there could be problems of social and practical nature for anyone in need of talking another language while living in a part of the world where it is spoken. Constraints in both communication and completion of practical tasks are only some of the various obstacles emerging from this circumstance in particular."
