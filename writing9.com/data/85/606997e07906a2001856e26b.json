        "Dear Sir,",
        "I am writing to apply as a volunteer in connection to an advert published by your organization \" The Child Care\" stating the need for voluntary assistance for children.",
        "I am excessively eager to be a part of your team that helps orphan children by providing a better life in terms of education and personal development. I want to put in my application for this volunteer position because I believe helping hands are better than praying lips. Therefore, being a teacher I am willing to give my input in educating them by making them capable to earn in future for their livelihood.",
        "Last year, I had already worked with a non-profitable trust to serve slum students by inculcating communication skills in them. For evidence, I am attaching an appreciation certificate that I had received during that free service. Hence, I feel I can justify this position as a teacher I am quite experienced to deal with this age group.",
        "As I am enrolled in a full-time teaching job in school, I would be able to spare my evening time after 4 p.m during weekdays. Also, I will be available for a longer duration on weekends to help them more. To avoid any misinterpretation about my availability, I will share my weekly timetable after selection as a volunteer.",
        "I look forward to receiving your response.",
        "Yours Sincerely,",
