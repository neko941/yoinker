        "I regret to write this letter to express a concern regarding the purchase of a fridge which I bought from your store on 10th street of New west city. Firstly, During the demo, everything looks great, but when I unpack and try to use it at home then I was completely terrified and  blown away by the huge noise and functioning method. In addition, I called  your store and none of them answered my calls politely despite the multiple attempts.",
        "Furthermore, When called the store, I received an unprecedented response from one of the employees, In addition, they are not caring about customer service as they just sold products and wash their hands which is not at all acceptable and I did not even think in my dream this kind of experience.",
        "As you heard, I would like to return this product without any second thought as this not going to help anymore. Having said that, I would really appreciate it if you could provide some training to your employees on how to talk and behave with the customer.",
        "I look forward to hearing a response to this request. Hope it will come soon.",
        "Yours Sincerely,",
