        "Having said that, they had some complaints about the service, if you do not mind me saying so. Some participants repeatedly reported that meals were too cold, although they criticized this issue many times. I believe this problem will definitely destroy your hotel's popularity. Therefore, I would like to kindly suggest you  provide a solution for this issue.",
