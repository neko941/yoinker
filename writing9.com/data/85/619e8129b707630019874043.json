        "The contentious argument that whether it is essential for an organization to solicit  personal information from potential candidates erupt an incessant hatred debate among many. In this essay, I will illustrate the merits and demerits of such a practice generally adopted by the employer.",
        "On one hand, there are plenty of advantages in obtaining personal data from a prospective employee such as his hobbies, marital status etc. which will later prove to be beneficial in gauging an applicant that is he is suitable for the position or not. For instance, if the job role required him to travel frequently then a preferable candidate must who is single otherwise how will he manage his marital life? Furthermore, an employer can achieve a sustainable retention rate or even improve it by knowing the applicant better. For example, a tech-savvy person would be more suitable for a multinational company with various systems and controls, rather than a person who despise modern technology and devices.",
        "On the other hand, there are some cons of such a practice.

In addition to that, some employers may resort to discriminatory practices after knowing  the personal likes and dislikes of an individual. Such as, a manager with a keen interest in soccer will probably select a person who shares the same.",
        "Having considered a range of arguments, I firmly believe that the merits of acquiring information relevant to the company and position undoubtedly out weight\u2019s the drawbacks and equips the managers to make a wise decision in recruiting a suitable candidate which eventually is fruitful for the organization in long term."
