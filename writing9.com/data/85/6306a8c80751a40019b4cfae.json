In addition to that, he parties with his friends over the weekends with loud music ,barbeque and party at home which makes me stay awake the whole night and collapse my complete weekend plan. Due  to ,this I'm not able to focus on my classes and thus impacting my overall academic score. Moreover, the room and kitchen are not maintained clean which results in a bad smell.",
