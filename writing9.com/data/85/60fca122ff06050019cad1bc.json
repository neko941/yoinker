A beautiful lady received us and explained everything about the accommodation. I can not wait to spend our vacation here and explore London.",

        "Due to that, as you said in your advertisement if the client has any issues with the property, such as internet connection, furniture problems or anything else, we should call or email the landlord immediately. Do you think you could send someone to have a look? I will be here until tomorrow night, but after that, I have some plannings with my family and I am not sure at what time we will be back.",
