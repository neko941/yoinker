        "These days, advertising is more popular among almost all companies to encourage individuals to buy their products and services. It is said that many people have been influenced by advertisements and purchase goods without considering their true needs. I completely agree with this opinion as advertisements are more aggressive today, and companies use celebrities to have more influence on people.",
        "Firstly, promoters advertise more aggressively these days. To do this, they produce glamorous commercials to advertise their so-called high-quality products. In this way, people become more encouraged to buy the advertised products without enough consideration of their feasible functions. However, these gorgeous products are usually not practical and spending on those are just wasting money. Recently, in my country, a food processor has been advertised all day long on both television and radio that seem to be very helpful and timesaving in the kitchen which is not according to friends of mine who have purchased it. Additionally, many companies target young generations by using celebrities in their advertisements. Most youngsters have fragile minds and they consider their favourite actor or artist as their role models, therefore these commercials have a great influence on them and impulsively make them  purchase the product. For example, the Gillette Company advertised one of its shaving products featuring Ronaldo, a well-known athlete, to have more influence on young boys. According to the company, this campaign was a real success among their target audience.",
        "On the other hand, customers\u2019 buying habit is undeniable. They allocate budgets to purchase products according to their disposable income. For instance, when people want to buy a smartphone they usually compare different features, check customer comments and read expert reviews to make a wise decision. As a result, no one can judge whether people buy according to the commercials or real needs.",
        "In conclusion, I agree that many individuals from young to adults become influenced by the commercials and purchase different products even if they do not need those."
