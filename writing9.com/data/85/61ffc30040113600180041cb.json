        "I would like to express my interest in the Job posted in the Journal to take care of a child for over six months and stay with them for the duration. I have prior experience in handling children above five years of age in Sydney. So, I think that I will be the right fit for the position.",
        "I have been working with kids for more than three years, I am skilled enough to teach the lessons for primary school students. In addition to that, I can cook simple dishes if they are hungry. I am trained to provide first-aid, if necessary. I can have conversations in the three languages such as French, English and Tamil, which is my native. I have been working with a family for two years until three months ago, as they had to shift to a different country. They had a couple of toddlers in their home and I have a great relationship with them even now.",
        "During the time when the child is not at home, I would like to take breaks and spend time visiting the monuments across the city. Moreover, I am currently working on my linguistic skills to learn Spanish. I would like to utilize my personal time on it.",
        "Let me know, if you feel I am the appropriate person for the job. You can contact me through the landline (+78-453280).",
