        "In recent years, people and mass-media started to evaluate others according to their wealth and personal achievements. Some even believe that values of our ancestors do not already have any significance to us. In this essay I will examine why modern society rejected some of our core principles, but also will give an explanation why I disagree to follow this widespread practice.",
        "Development of technologies and economic prosperity have made humankind more selfish and angrier. Indeed, such social networks as Instagram and Tik-Tok show a luxury life of celebrities that the majority of youth would like to have. However, nobody knows what, in reality, is hidden behind the curtains. For example, a plethora of bloggers do not care about others: they are ready to turn their backs on family and friends. The social-network heroes promote their unsophisticated behaviour among children and young adults, making them disrespect the traditions of our ancestors.",
        "Nevertheless, there is an abundance of highly motivated people who are striving to change our world for the better. Despite being oppressed by the leftists and current \u201caristocrats\u201d, they are moving towards their goals by helping others. For instance, Jordan B. Peterson, who is the phenomenon among Western thinkers, is inspirated to show young generation that we should not forget who we really are. The professor wrote two fundamental books entitled \u201c12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos\u201d and \u201cBeyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life\u201d which teach us to respect our traditions and set ourselves for the bright future. Moreover, I agree with Mr. Peterson idea that we should not be afraid of modern trends since it is in our strengths to combat them.",
        "In conclusion, I would like to say that a significant number of people have forgotten that with every right comes responsibility. Even if modern actors, singers and musicians have rejected honour, kindness and trust as their values, we should withstand the pressure of cultural revolution. The more we educate ourselves, the more the principles of our ancestors will exist."
