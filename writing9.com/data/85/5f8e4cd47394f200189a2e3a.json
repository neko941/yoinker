        "Since in the olden days, music has become a famous activity which most of the people like spending their time . In fact, even some academics believe that each younger ought to be learned on playing musical equipment. In my point of view, I agree with this statement as it would improve younger\u2019s creativity  and bring healthiness towards their mental health.",
        "To begin with, creativity is ones of the mental processes, which should be developed since  childhood.For example, as children would be easier to be bored in one direct learning, music is the best way to attract them back in focusing their learning. Many studies have shown that being studying music would improve  people\u2019s imagination because it triggers the right and left side of the brain working together in  time.  As a result, by implementing children to play their musical items in school would lead to the empowerment of younger\u2019s wisdom.",
        "In addition, playing musical items  by the teenager would bring beneficially in their mental healthiness. In the contemporary world,for instance,  it has became a trait, which children have to struggle in studying many subjects. Clearly, it could contribute to the depression among this younger generation because this modern study system has put up the pressure in their early stage of life. Despite this stressful life, music should be learned to them for relaxing purpose and lessening their burden of study. Thus, implementing music in children\u2019s studying become a need which would bring cheer over their faces and bring positivity for their mental condition.",
        "In conclusion, suggesting  the teaching musical instrument toward children affect them on increasing their creativity and heathier mental status which people should be aware of in order for the betterment of the younger generation."
