        "Let me explain to you the situation in detail. Initially, when I have moved into this accommodation since I was the first occupant I did not face any problems. After a few days when a new student has joined to share my room, there the problem has started. My roommate goes to bed late almost every day and also he plays loud intolerable music which doesn't allow me to get good sleep. Because of that, it is becoming hard for me to concentrate on my work.",
        "I would be grateful if you could change my room. I would prefer to share the room with someone who is more considerate about others and also understandable.",
