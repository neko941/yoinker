        "I write in reference to the recent article about the town Chander Nagar in your magazine describing some of the interesting places to visit. The article covered the information about all the areas except that there were a few corrections in the content that was printed.",
        "I am highlighting a few corrections that would make the content more precise. The content portrayed that my town has only one bus terminus whereas it has two. Furthermore, the address of the art gallery was specified to be 1st street but it is supposed to be 5th street. Yet another correction is that the direction of  the temple road is along the Main road and not  opposite to the Main road.",
        "I would be most grateful if you provide appropriate directions so that the tourists are not misguided. As your magazine is the face of Indian tourism, I believe that the information ought to be more accurate. I would appreciate it if you could republish the article with the corrected content. Thank you.",
