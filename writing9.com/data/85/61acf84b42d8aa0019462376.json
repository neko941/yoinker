        "Governments in some countries spend a large amount of money on space exploration programmes.I completely agree with the idea that these are a waste of money, and that the funds should be allocated to public services.",
        "There are several reasons why space programmes should be abandoned. Firstly, it is extremely expensive to train scientists and other staff involved with space missions, and facilities and equipment also come at a huge cost to the government. Secondly, these programmes do not benefit normal people in our daily lives; they are simply vanity projects for politicians. Finally, many missions to space fail completely, and the smallest technological error can cost astronauts their lives. For example, the Challenger space shuttle disaster showed us that space travel is extremely dangerous, and in my ,opinion it is not worth the risk.",
        "I believe that the money from space programmes should go to vital public service instead. It is mostly cheaper to train doctors, teachers, police and other public service workers than it is to train astronauts or scientists and engineers who work on space exploration. Furthermore, public servants do jobs that have a positive impact on every member of society. For example, we all use schools, hospitals and roads, and we all need the security that the police provide. If governments reallocated the money spent on space travel and research, many thousands of people could lift out of poverty or be given a better quality of life.",
        "In conclusion, my view is that governments should spend money on services that benefit all members of society, and it is wrong to waste resources on projects that do not improve our everyday lives."
