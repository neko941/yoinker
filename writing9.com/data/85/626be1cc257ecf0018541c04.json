        "I, Shalu Lalichan, Regulatory Affairs Manager, am writing to call attention to the current salary disparity and to request pay equity.",
        "In 2020, I was promoted to a Manager position with no salary increase. My present compensation for this position is still the same as for my previous title i.e. 12500 AED. According to my understanding, the optimum salary range for a regulatory affairs manager in Julphar is around 16000 AED. Even after the grading scheme was implemented, my remuneration was not aligned with that of other Regulatory Managers in the same grade/title (N4-2). Hence, this wider pay gap during these past 2 years has cost me a huge financial loss.",
        "I have been working diligently with Julphar for a decade and contribute  similar efforts as other respected managers in the department.",
        "In view of the above, I humbly request you to look into this pay equity request so that I will be compensated fairly with standard pay ranges comparable to other Regulatory Affairs Managers.",
        "Best regards",
