        "It is often argued that many employees are supposed to dress smartly in their organisations, while others believe that work performances are more important than their appearance. In my opinion, I believe that both views are necessary for companies\u2019 image, dressing smartly is something that has more impact to outsiders.",
        "On the one hand, dress formally could convey an external image of the organisation. This is because people who are not employees there can judge their image. The dress can represent the professionalism of the company. For example, if there is a company's advertising on screens, many people watching the screens will tend to focus on its appearances more than its performances. According to  Chulalongkorn University's research, most people are likely to consider the external image over the internal image. Therefore, this is a reason that dressing smartly is more important.",
        "On the other hand, the quality of work is another key importance of the company\u2019s look. Due to the fact that it is an indicator representing the ability of a company's management. Success is something that could drive their image. This can lead to a well-known organisation. For instance, employees possibly choose to pursue a career in a good credit office. Moreover, many business organisations tend to cooperate with an outstanding company because it could help them to develop their future work performance.",
        "In conclusion, while work performance can improve the organisation\u2019s external image, employees\u2019 appearances have more effect on outsiders. In my opinion, employees ought to dress smartly, as a result, their look is more attractive and trustworthy."
