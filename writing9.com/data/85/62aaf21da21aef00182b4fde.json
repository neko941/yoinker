        "While some people believe that they are able to watch movies on their phones or tablets without going to the cinema, others take the view that they can be pleased if they see films in a movie theatre. In this essay, I will explain both these points of view.",
        "On the one hand, there are people who take the view that people can easily catch the movies in their own places with the help of advanced electronic gadgets. In other words, people can buy many kinds of streaming service applications to catch all kinds of movies on their phones or tablets. For example, Netflix, one of the famous streaming services, offers films or other television and folk are able to watch updated movies from that application and don't need to go to the movie house. In addition, they can download and keep the film that they want to see on their gadgets so that they can  watch them many times.",
        "On the other hand, others believe that flick should be watched in a movie theatre in order to get full enjoyment. Getting enjoyment from the theatre and on gadgets are different because the community can see the movie on a big screen that cannot be gotten from electronic devices and the smell of the theatre make audiences enjoyable and more romantic. For instance, most couples are used to dating at first to go to the cinema to get more pleasure. Moreover, some latest films are only shown in theatre before they were uploaded on steaming services or on online media. Therefore, people can catch the latest movies only in the movie theatre.",
        "To conclude, although watching a film in a cinema can give full enjoyment to the audience, I think that people can get more benefits and pressure by seeing movies on their electronic devices as it is less costly and can watch all kinds of movies at their own places."
