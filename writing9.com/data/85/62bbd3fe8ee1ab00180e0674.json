        "Although attending  a college program could be enjoyable, selecting a course in college without having any ideas about your future career and your career path is just wasting time.",
        "Securing a part-time job or a paid internship plan may help you to find your autonomy and get a better idea about your future professional life at the same time.",
        "As I remember, you passed some computer programming courses in high school, likewise, you have a very good background in mathematics and statistics, so I think you can secure a software development job easily. After securing the occupancy, if you feel you need to extend your knowledge in a specific field to get promoted in your profession, you can select a college program in this regard. I'm sure you rock it!",
