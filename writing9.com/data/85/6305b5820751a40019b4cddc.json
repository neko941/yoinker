        "Let me provide you with some details of my experience working with adults. As I mentioned above, I have been an active member of  Lion's club for 10 years now, I have enough experience doing similar projects with them. On top of that, I have my grandmother at home, so, I know how to work with them, and I have a good understanding of their feelings.",
        "Finally, I am good at cooking  and giving baths to the elders. Last and not least, I am good at singing, I can sing songs from the 70s, my grandparents love those very much. I hope these skills will be useful to the event.",
        "If you need more information, please contact me on my mobile, and I look forward to hearing from you.",
