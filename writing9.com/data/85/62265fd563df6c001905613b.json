        "Dear Sir/Madam,",
        "I am writing this letter to you regarding the problems faced recently with the bus service in Churchill over the past two weeks.",
        "The following problems have severely impacted my commute to work. Firstly, the buses are extremely unreliable. The buses are 20 minutes behind the schedule mentioned on the application. Secondly, the drivers have started following new routes which again have not been updated on the application, nor are the passengers made aware of the de-route in advance. Lastly, the interiors of the buses are not well-maintained and are often dirty.",
        "In my opinion, I would strongly suggest that the company should update the application with the revised timelines and routes, to improve the reliability of the bus service and the passenger journey. Additionally, it would be great if you could outsource a cleaning and maintenance agency to sanitize the buses at regular intervals.",
        "I hope you would take the required measures to improve the bus service in Churchill.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Yours faithfully,",
