Moreover, I am sure that you are very excited to discover my home country and I would like to help you by pointing out some activities you can do in your free time. Thus, please make sure to go shopping in Hamra streets, swimming in our beautiful sea, visiting the mountain and Jeita grotto. In addition to this, don't forget to taste the Lebanese Mezza such as Tabbouleh, Hummus and Kibbe. Make sure to visit the Leila restaurant at ABC Verdun, it is known to be the best in town.
