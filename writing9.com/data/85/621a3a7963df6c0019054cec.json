        "It is believed that some individuals are gifted as natural leaders. However, the critics of the idea regard that the knack for headship can be achieved. Personally, I  advocate the second view opposing the first since the bravery that is the overriding trace of a ruler  can be attained through  circumstances and environments.  Albeit,  genetic predisposition plays a vital role. This essay will shed light on both sides of the view and provide anecdotal evidence to prove the arguments.",
        "On the one hand, the necessities and the surrounding creates a commander. In other words, everyone can command  the army force, the government or  a company,  that said, only must be at the right place and time. For instance,  the most famous international leader Adolf Hitler, if he existed today, perhaps  he could not be recollected as the  worst German chief in command  because he comes from  a humble family  without any  historical in terms of ruling.  As a result, despite his origin, he ruled Germany and led the second world war.  Furthermore,  there is a myriad of the same cases throughout the world.",
        "On the other hand, the past relative's life builds a leader. Because of the history and the life had by  the previous progenitress  individuals  straightforwardness achieve high positions. For example, North Korea is a flagrant case, where the acting president without undoubtedly any leader's character is now  number one in the nation. Hence, the criticism grows, and  the shortfall of  headship comes out menacing the entire world with  nuclear weapons and missiles testing.",
        "In conclusion,  notwithstanding  that the biological orientation influences managership the willpower allied with the proper atmosphere and time transforms an ordinary individual to that. Therefore, I still believe that it does not  heavily depend  solely on genes. In addition, I  recommend  youngsters worldwide to raise themselves as leaders independently in the area, tribe, and race."
