        "I feel the need to bring to your attention an issue I have faced while watching cinema in your theatre. Allow me to elaborate further.",
        "Last weekend, I visited the cinema complex to watch the movie named \"the stolen rock\". While this is rated as 18 plus film, younger children were also allowed in the hall. To my ,surprise this film is full of violent content and youngsters are exposed to violence. Moreover, the hall was messy and unclean. There were popcorns scattered all over the seats from the previous batch who watched the movie.",
        "I trust you can empathise with my concerns. Thus, I am expecting you to put in place stricter rules on screening the audience with age-appropriate films that are shown. Also, I am expecting you to reprimand the responsible staff for such oversight to happen and make sure the hall is clean after the end of every show.",
        "Your timely attention to this matter is needed.",
        "Yours faithfully,",
