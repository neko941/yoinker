        "Let me give you some details so that we will be on the same page. Today, I confirmed my booking and I paid the trip's expenses. I will travel next Friday at 10:00 P.M. from Atlanta's airport, and I will stay in Japan for five weeks. Once I arrive there, I will send you my new international number just in case if you want any help.",
        "Regarding my dog, you must give him the medicine every day at 2:00 P.M. In addition, he has to eat at least three times a day. If you don't mind, you can walk him just 10 minutes per day. By the way, don't forget to cut the lawn every Saturday, though. I know that all this will be a new experience for you, but hopefully it will be easy.",
