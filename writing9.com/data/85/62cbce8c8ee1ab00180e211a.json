        "I am writing to offer some valuable feedback on the cookery course that I did last month at your renowned school.",
        "I would like to start by thanking you and your team for tutoring students with so much patience. Because the course was so thorough, I never faced any difficulty in comprehending the details. After learning to cook a wide variety of cuisines from such a well-known institute , I believe I will have an array of opportunities in the future.",
        "Since the completion of my course, I have been cooking every day. I am glad to inform you that I got an internship at a cafe on  Rogers Street. They were happy to offer me a stipend as well because of the generous feedback I got from one of your master chefs.",
        "Although the course was undoubtedly perfect, it mostly focussed on teaching the preparation of main-course meals. It would be great if you could add a complimentary starter and a sweet dish-making course to the original one.",
        "I hope my insights will be valuable.",
        "Yours faithfully,",
