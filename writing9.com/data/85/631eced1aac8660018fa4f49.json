        "Let me explain the activities in detail. Firstly, take Poker for a walk every morning and every evening, at 9 AM and 6 PM respectively. Bags for collecting dog poop are kept in the storage room. Secondly, replace the water and refill the food dish; canine food is kept on the lowest kitchen shelf. Thirdly, prior to moving out, please turn off the living room lights in the morning and turn them on in the evening, as Poker gets afraid of the dark at night.",
        "As far as the house is concerned, there is nothing much to be done. The housemaid will collect the keys every day at 10 AM and return them back by 11 AM after she is done with the cleaning. Since I do not trust her for watering the plants, could you do it?",
        "Thank you once again for stepping in to look after my darling Poker and the house.",
