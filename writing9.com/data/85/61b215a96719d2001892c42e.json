        "I am China Tarhini who contacted you a month ago after regarding your advertisement on the website regarding your appartement for rent. After signing the contract between us, I explained to you that I am planning to move with my family to the flat as soon as possible.",
        "We have already moved a week ago but since our arrival, we are facing some problems regarding the furniture and I would be glad to take some of your time for explaining briefly the situation. First, the air-condition placed in the living room is making a lot of noise by which we are feeling uncomfortable while settling afternoon. Second, there is water leakage in the master\u2019s bathroom, which is a very annoying issue to cover all the floor with water when taking a shower.",
        "We will be very glad if you take an action with fixing these problems as soon as possible. My parents are old, and they are very uncomfortable with these current circumstances.",
        "Thanks for your consideration.",
        "Yours faithfully,",
