        "Nowadays, there is a discussion going on, whether a University should welcome boys and girls in equal number in each subject or not.In my opinion, it is impractical to impose this type of any rules in tertiary education. This essay will first highlight why it is impossible to enact and give proper justification on this viewpoint.",
        "To begin with, it is quite impractical to implement a gender based quota system in University education, because, girls and boys have a different set of subject of interest.   Where Male students want to go to the engineering field and female students have soft corner towards the arts. A student cannot be forced to take up any subject which fails to fascinate them. To give an example, most women do not prefer to set up their career in mechanical or civil engineering because, they feel it is the job for men.",
        "In addition to it, there are few jobs exist in the society where a lot of physical activities are required. Most of time, it is not possible for any woman to match up the same amount of physical strength which a man has. As a result, there are some possible chances of disasters in industrial field which could be life-threatening. To illustrate, it is very difficult for women to work in any construction sites or to do an electrical job on the field.",
        "In a nutshell, there are some specific set of subjects which came into existence by keeping in mind on gender. One particular set of work cannot be fulfilled by opposite gender and neither it should be compulsory for anyone to take up any university courses because of vacancies in certain gender quota.We should respect the difference and no rules and regulations should be applied in University on gender basis."
