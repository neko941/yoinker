        "The fact that youngers, these days, have exposed themselves extensively on fashion trends as well as advanced technology is undeniable. Hence, there is an assumption that they have wasted too much money and time following these latest trends. Personally, I just partly agree with this idea due to the below reasons.",
        "On the one hand, it is true that some young people are willing to pour a huge amount of their money and time running after the newest styles in order to show off their status or keeping up with their peers. Changing clothes constantly or trying to own the most state-of-the-art technological devices such as iPhone or Tablets could be seen as the most typical example for this lifestyle, the one that is paying too much attention on materialism and appearance values. Several years ago, the scene of a long queue of Chinese youngers lining up all night for the newest iPhone model had raised a question for all public about the obsessions, or even addiction of a high number of the youth on fashion trends.",
        "On the other hand, I believe that it would be wrong if we conclude all the young generation who follows this phenomenon. More and more individuals, nowadays, prefer a minimalism lifestyle. In other words, they are cutting back all unnecessary items and tend to choose lifetime technological products to save time and energy in the long run. A clear example is Mark Zuckerberg, an America Internet entrepreneur. He is famous for his daily clothes with a similar T-shirt collection, as a result, he does not need to waste any minute for any fashion trends. In addition, not pouring time and money on the latest trends, a number of younger, currently, is making an effort on learning language or working out to pursue a physical and mental health. It means that there are numerous others useful activities that the youth is putting their minds into.",
        "In conclusion, it is understandable that why many people criticize the young for consuming too much time and money on new attractive fads. However, it is just unfair if we label all the younger with this trend."
