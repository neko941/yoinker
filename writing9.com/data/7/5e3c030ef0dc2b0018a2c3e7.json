        "People have different views about crimes and their punishment. In some places, the number of young age crime is escalating. Few people say that teenage criminals should be given adult punishment,not concentrating on age. While I agree that youth should not be given adult punishment. I believe that they must be given an adult sort of punishment according to the crimes.",
        "On the one hand, people argue that juvenile criminal must not be punished according to their age because of some reasons.The first and the foremost reason is that they change when they are given less punishment related to their age. Thus, there is a probability for reduced crime rates in young people. Secondly, If you put them into adult damnation there is a possibility the crime rates increase when they are left in society. Finally, they are under more risk of psychological effects where they become not only more aggressive to everyone, but also leading them into Mental disorders in their older age. For instance, In London, A 2017 study by the Cambridge University London, founded that young criminals are under more danger for Mental Disorders compared to adult criminals by 45%.",
        "On the other hand, i believe that  they should be given punishments as like for a grown person. Due to some reasons. If they are not given matured punishments, they become more lavish and bold that they can get into more crimes. In addition to this, they also teach their peers about the crimes and thus leading to increased crime rates. In Scotland, For example, An article of 2015, Times of India stated that young criminals spread their crime ideas to their friends of about 20%. Moreover, there is a higher probability that they get into an immoral activity like getting addicted to drugs, alcohol and cigarettes.",
        "In conclusion, although I do not agree that young criminals should be given punishment because of criminals change, crime rates decrease and psychological effect. I believe that major crime committing young criminals should be given adult-related punishment as it escalates crimes, lavishness and boldness and bad habits."
