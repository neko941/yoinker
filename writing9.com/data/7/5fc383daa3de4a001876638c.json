        "It is important for people to consider which type of accomodation fits more with their life style. While some believe that it is better living in a house, there are those who feel that dwelling an apartment is more advantageous. This essay will explain why I reckon that the benefits of living in a house outweigh the drawbacks, when compared to life in an apartment.",
        "Considering firstly the negatives of houses, generally they are more spacious, and it means that they demand more work to do and time dedication to take care of it. It is also because normally there are more plants, gardens and trees in houses, and these beings demand specific care to the house owners. Secondly, this type of accommodation might be less safer than apartments. When people leave their houses alone, usually there are not any neighbor who can take a look at the house, whereas in apartment all the neighbors take care of each others accommodations, because they are closer.",
        "However, you have several more possibilities when you live in a place with more space, such in houses. This is because space is fundamental to able people to explore and practice activities. For instance, in houses you can create vegetable gardens; construct pools where people can swim, sunbathe and have a good time; practice joinery, make parties with a lot of people, etc. Besides, when somebody is passing her days in a house, she is so much more connected with the surroundings: she can see the sky, watch the sunrise, the moon, the stars. As a result, this can definitely change moods and humors, developing the sensation of fulfillment and happiness in individuals.",
        "In conclusion, I am convinced that the advantages of space and connectedness with the environment that come with living in a house outweigh the disadvantages of less housework and less security in comparison with living in an apartment."
