These groups of people can share more efficient knowledge, which the public wants to know. For instance, there are many celebrities that share the way they maintain their health, which in my opinion plays a crucial role in the lives of humans. Many well-reputed and famous people are also role-models, as they set an immaculate example by showing the public the way they prioritize their time. As a result more people are motivated to use their time efficiently.",
