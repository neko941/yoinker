        "In recent years, scientific statistics indicate that many children are hooked up to playing computer games. Some people believe digital games are beneficial to children's mental well-being and social skills while others argue that computer games could negatively affect their skills. This essay will focus on elaborating on both views.",
        "Admittedly, playing computer may take away a large portion of children's leisure time and reduce their contact with other people. Many school-aged children reported that excessive exposure to computer games leads to a series of physical and mental problems. Many of them stand a chance of suffering from sleep deprivation, fatigue and depression after playing games. In addition, their communication skills are inferior to their counterparts as they don't have the opportunity to engage with other people. Long-term exposure to computer games further isolates children and prevents them from getting in touch with their peers.",
        "However, playing with computers is proved to be helpful to people's intelligence development. For instance, a recent study from Harvard University reveals that playing computer games increases  brain activity and shortens people's response time to the external environment. Players will also realize the importance of teamwork as they need to collaborate with others to finish tasks in the games. Contrary to the common belief, some scientists claim that there is no clear connection between computer games and health problems given many health problems are associated with the environment and lifestyle.",
        "Having considered the matter in some depth, it is safe the say that computer games are a double-edged sword as they may bring both benefits and negatives to personal development. It is important necessary to take the essence and abandon the negatives."
