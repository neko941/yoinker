        "The contentious argument that whether giving money is the perfect gift to the young people has sparked a heated debate among many. Some folks believe that it is beneficial to give a monetary gift to the younger generation while some set of people disagree with this view of giving money as a gift to the youngsters. In my opinion, I agree with the view of giving monetary gifts in place of other gifts due to various reasons.",
        "To embark with, one of the evident benefits of giving money to teenagers is that they will have the capability of standing up on their own. With the advancement of technology, there are plethora of opportunities for them to pursue to mould their future. Consequently, they can use this money to lay the foundation of what they desire. For example, a survey performed by the Times Now magazine has proved that nearly 40% of the teenagers pay their tuition fees from the money that they have received as a gift or from their saved pocket money. In addition to this, they also develop financial management skills. Thus, this leads them to spend money wisely.",
        "On the other hand, some people believe that money should not be the most suitable gift for the young people. Firstly, money may motivate the adolescents to pick up the bad habits like smoking or drinking that is detrimental for their health. Secondly, they get distracted from their studies and indulge in unethical activities to fulfil the materialistic desires. For instance, a survey performed by child psychological department of Texas university has proved that 20% teenagers involve in criminal activities just to satisfy themselves with the things such as electronic gadgets, expensive fashion accessories and lot more. Hence, due to all these reasons, monetary gifts are not beneficial for the youngsters.",
        "In conclusion, I assert that having personal money seems to be one of the most effective learning tool. This is owning to the fact that this approach boosts essential skills which youngsters will definitely apply in the adult life. However, by organizing some counselling session we can stop the young generation from adopting bad habits."
