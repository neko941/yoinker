        "Over the recent years, contemporary gadget has been played enormous to the mankind so that skill has been developed rapidly, but some peoples opinion about kids does not need to teach basic handwriting skills for their booming stage whereas some individuals are divided on their opinion.Notwithstanding, this discourse will delve both points of views and subsequently, put forward my own vantage points, accordingly.",
        "Apparently, the proponents of the school of thought that claim that these days manifold gadgets help the society to reduce their workload. The rationale behind their argument might be like that enormous work has been carried out by computer.Furthermore, the way of communication is vivid  as well, and documentation of that work can be preserved in a facile way. To illustrate, many schools encouraged their student to do their homework by using modern devices rather man  man-made skills.",
        "",
        "However, taking a look at it from the flip side of the coin.Could the contenders of the school of thought that postulate that some basic skills help the kids to build their confidence  be absolutely right?. Certainly, the justification for their argument is much more likely that they can  understand the concept by learning through by themselves without depending on any gadgets.To exemplify, according to the research, from local authority bodies in my village , enormous children learns basic concepts by own made itself.",
        "To conclude, having explored both point of views, it is evident that both perspectives may be very much in their reasoning; Nevertheless, there ares some pitfalls.thus, personally I partially consent to hilt that we can teach both techniques into right stage and each us an equal ratio of salient in this face pace world."
