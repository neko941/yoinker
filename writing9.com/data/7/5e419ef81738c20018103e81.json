        "It is the fact that famous sport players are paid with\u00a0extremely high salary worldwide. Some people support this; while, others believe it is unfair for other professionals in the contemporary societies. I personally agree with the former. The essay will discuss both views and presents my own opinion as well.",
        "To begin with, firstly, sport celebrities should be paid with huge salary because\u00a0it takes\u00a0a long journey for\u00a0them\u00a0to become famous globally. The majority of them start their training in their early childhood and left their families behind them. They went through the tough process which ordinary citizens are unable to tolerate. Secondly, they convey the\u00a0optimistic spirit, become role models and take leadership responsibilities in our communities.\u00a0Last but not the least, they are hired by magnates which make extremely large\u00a0profit from sports events; therefore, they should be rewarded well as well.",
        "However, others\u00a0believe that sports celebrities should not be pain such\u00a0a huge amount of money\u00a0for their jobs. Firstly, they believe that sports professionals only provide entertainment to our lives.\u00a0The role of this professional\u00a0in our societies may not be necessary as compared with other professionals, such as nurses, teachers, policemen, and so on. Without the latter's contribution, our societies won't function properly and won't provide harmonious living environments for citizens. Therefore, they may advocate that the latter occupations should deserve high payment.",
        "In my opinion, I support that it is fair for famous sports players to receive extremely high salaries because the above reasons. For example, renowned retired Olympic athlete, Jingjing Guo, has become a significant character in China, even around the world, because she becomes the icon for many females and encourage them to pursue their dreams in the reality.\u00a0Therefore, it is fair for her to make huge profit when she are invited to play in some commercial advertisements."
