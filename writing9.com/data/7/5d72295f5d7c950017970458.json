        "Obesity is one of the serious health issues that a lot of developed countries face today, yet many of them have difficulties to tackle the problem. However, despite providing healthy eating guidance is a good way to solve the issue, I do not agree that it is the best way.",
        "To begin with, it is undeniable that people having a healthy diet habit are crucial to improve their health status that would keep them away from obesity. In fact, people in modern society have more choices in what to eat, but they have little knowledge what the food they intake brings on their bodies. Likewise, many diseases regarding food like strokes and heart diseases are resulted from a lack of knowledge of healthy diet that can be solved by offering a proper healthy eating education by professional nutritionists.",
        "However, despite the truth that health behaviour can be changed by the nutrition education, I still believe that taxing heavily on sweets and fast food companies is way better to reduce the morbidity rate of obesity. Moreover, studies indicate that food contained too much sugar and oil is the main reason for obesity. Fast food restaurants like McDonald's, for example, offer cheap food that even younger generation can afford and they tend to frequent there after school. If the fast food restaurants are not affordable for people, they will find alternatives that offer better nutritious food.",
        "Finally, probably the best method of tackling the issue of obesity is a free check-up system in local hospitals. Usually, people cannot notice their bad nutritious habit and tend to overlook the first symptoms that can be detected easily from medical doctors at an early stage. Local clinics can offer free checkups for patients who have risks of obesity, since the guidance is most convincing when it is done by professionals like doctors.",
        "To sum up, although I acknowledge that giving education on healthy diet is a good way to treat the situation that people are more and more suffering from obesity today, I, however, believe that imposing heavy tax for sugar and fast food industries and setting a free check-up on obesity in local clinic are much better."
