        "Nowadays, people tend\u00a0to go\u00a0aboard for their vacations due to that ravelling by plane has become more affordable under the help of modern technology; therefore, tourism is booming\u00a0in many countries worldwide. Meanwhile, visitors also cause the harmful\u00a0impacts on local communities. I personally support that these negative impacts should\u00a0be assessed in order to protect local residents and guarantee the quality of tourism service.",
        "To start with, it is a fact that tourists could disturb local residents daily life activities, even though they create revenue incomes for local governments. Local entertainment activities and festival\u00a0events hold to attract more visitors will create some inconvenience to\u00a0local residents in many ways.\u00a0\u00a0For example, vehicles hired for visitors will lead to traffic congestion. The festival activities will cause traffic jams and disturb residents' routine daily life as well. Moreover, local native resources will be redistributed to meet the demand of visitors, which will result in higher prices or shortage for local residents.",
        "In addition, increasing visitors in many countries may lead to\u00a0many illegal activities in local communities.For example, with the increasing night shows in bars, substance use\u00a0and crime rate may\u00a0surge up\u00a0in the regions. Furthermore, local residents will be influenced by the novel ideas brought by visitors, which may lead to their personal valves change as well. Local residents, especially the youth, might pick up harmful habits from visitors, such as substance use,\u00a0or smoking.",
        "In summary, tourism will contribute to the local economy; however, it also disturbs local residents' traditional daily lives due to their activities. Without strict guidelines,\u00a0\u00a0visitors may also create many potential illegal issues when they enjoy their happy hours there.\u00a0Therefore, I support that\u00a0\u00a0local governments should provide safety instruction for visitors and assist tourism companies to establish the right agenda for visitors to follow."
