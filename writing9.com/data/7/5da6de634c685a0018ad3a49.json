        "In the modern world, problems that affecting cities are a topic of an interesting debate among people. Some argue that motor vehicles are the major cause of troubles, while others affirm that it is because of the increasing amount of waste in the city. This essay examines both the perspectives and arrives at a definitive point of view.",
        "A sizeable number of people in the society are on the outlook that an increasing number of automotive are the main problem that cities are facing nowadays. The reason they cite in this regard is that the traffic congestion and air pollution by the emission of carbon monoxide from motor vehicles have increased drastically. For example, a recent survey by Dubai RTA showed that block in roads is increasing rapidly especially in the mornings and evenings. Furthermore, they have also stated that scientific study has discovered large amount of carbon monoxide in the atmosphere due to this. Consequently,an increasing number of vehicles  will endanger the environment. Therefore, those who advocate this view maintain that vehicles are the only reason that worsen the main areas in a region.",
        "On the other hand, many others believe that heap of wastes in the city is the major trouble for the people who lives in the urban areas. This is due to the fact that there is no proper process for eliminating the waste materials and that result in dangerous diseases. For instance, most of the developing nations do not have a specific place to dump the leftovers and it remains in roads and other public areas and it generates diseases like malaria. Consequently, without taking proper remedies, this will be going to affect the society badly. Hence, this view holds waste materials that remain is a challenge to the people and the city as a whole.",
        "To conclude, although there are contrary views on the factors that affecting the sustainability of urban areas, I would argue that it is quite sensible that the waste is the main problem that cities are facing rather than traffic pollutions because it is a threat to the humans and the society alike."
