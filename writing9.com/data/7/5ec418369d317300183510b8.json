        "In recent times, putting a ban on advertising aimed at children has become a debatable topic.While some people believe that commercials aimed at kids should be prohibited because of its negative effects, others are of the opinion that it should not be forced out. This essay will  discuss the positive contributions made by the medium of publicising despite its shortcomings.",
        "There are several reasons why advertising aimed at children should not be banned. Firstly, commercials serve as a way of creating awareness to the general public about products, events e.t.c. This in turn increases the sales and turnover of the company involved. Thus contributing to the economy as a whole. For example, the percentage contribution of producing companies increased by 7% in the current year as against 2% in the previous year.In addition, more jobs are also created for people leading to reduced unemployment rate in the society.The world labours committee reports that the unemployment rate has reduced drastically. In this view, advertising has done more good than harm in the society.",
        "Furthermore, despite the effective outcome of commercials targeted at children, there are also some negative effects associated with it which should not be overlooked.Firstly, toddlers tend to develop some habits that might cause a great harm to their health.For instance, food awareness created on media could make the kids develop bad eating habits which, however cause obesity and other health conditions.Statistics show that a large number of food-related  health cases were traced to the publicity given to junks and drinks. This makes the aimed audience get so addicted to them without caution. Even though, some parents tried their best in putting their wards in check.However, parents still don't have control over what these young stars eat in school.",
        "The essay discussed why the advertisement aimed at youth should not be banned as well as the negative effects it causes.In my opinion, adolescent aimed commercials should not be eradicated, even though the negative effects is not to be overlooked."
