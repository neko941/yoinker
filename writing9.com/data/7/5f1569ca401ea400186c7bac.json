        "With the decrease in costs of travel, there is an increase in the tourism in different countries. As a result, there are advantages and disadvantages, both of which are being discussed in the following essay.",
        "Reduction of costs not just benefited the Airlines with huge profits. Other industries like hotels, restaurants, tourist companies, etc., were also benefited. In addition, it brings foreign exchange currency into the nation, develops stock markets, and inflates the value of home currency in the international market. For example, a person came from America to visit TajMahal and stayed at a hotel there, not only that, he also hired a vehicle and tour guide, to show him around the place and had visited the nearby restaurants for meals. Thus, tourism increased the income for different sectors of the economy and enhances the development.",
        "On the other hand, one of the major drawbacks of increased travelling is pollution. With increase of transportation and population, they eventually brought out noise and air pollution. Individuals are growing ill very easily, as there are impurities in drinking water, air, food, etc. For instance, a research study shows that there has been a major increase in pollution levels due to the population growth caused by tourists, and as a result, there are health problems faced by the people. Therefore, not only environment is being polluted, but also the society face health issues.",
        "In conclusion, the tourism industry enhanced growth of the economy by providing beneficial income to different sectors of the country. However, it also created problems to the nature and individuals through pollution and illnesses."
