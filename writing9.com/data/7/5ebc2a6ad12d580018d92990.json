        "In the modern world, rapidly developing and changing technology  has impacted the working sector positively which apparently facilitated many employees and employers to work online at own site, with the help of internet and modern technology inventions such as computers, laptops, tabs and remote tools.

        "Working online from home has  many benefits. Firstly, people can save More hours to do fruitful things which will balance their professional and personal life.

        "However, this trend has some disadvantages too, which cannot be ignored. Most of modern professions are dependent on the team's efforts and practical on-site presence at the operation site. If organizations allowed all employees to Complete projects  online at their places  can cost them to less productive Projects due the lack of ideas because team collaborative efforts is always better to some extent which  offers a mixture of number many ideas with the best analysis to finish up a job with perfection.",
        "In a nutshell, it seems that this trend has more pros that its cons which can be outweighed by some good polices. Although, working online at own place is beneficial in terms of to save time  and more flexibility in schedule and less expenses, but team efforts and on-site work's presence are required in some workplaces in order to do a job with perfection. I highly recommend that online working from at own place is beneficial and it can be more positively enhanced by making some teams efforts when it becomes essential."
