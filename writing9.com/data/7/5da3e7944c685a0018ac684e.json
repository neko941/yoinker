        "Whilst a sector of the society is of the view that foreigners ought to respect cultures and traditions of the country, others argue that various cultures should be welcomed by the host country. I am of the belief that the latter point of view is advantageous. In the following lines, both points of view will be further discussed along with my perspective.",
        "To begin with, restricting visitors to follow the local culture has a substantial merit, which is preserving the identity of the country. In other words, the majority of inhabitants might be influenced by the foreign activities, and these laymen may assist in spreading alien behaviors which are prohibited in the country. Saudi Arabia is an exemplary country which restricts drinking alcohol within its boundaries because of religious reasons. This reflects that respecting the local culture and behaviors of the country has a pivotal role in maintaining its identity.",
        "Despite the aforementioned prospect, others and I second the view that countries should welcome visitors and their own behaviours. This is because the more the diversity within the country, the more its citizens are tolerant, and they respect other concepts. For instance, as per an article published by The Guardian, around 70 % of the Canadians do not have a criminal record because they are raised in a culture that respect the odds. Not only does allowing diverse traditions encourage tolerance, but it also broadens the citizens' horizons, and it boosts their cognitive skills. Hence, this accentuates the concept that allowing culture diversity has a tremendous positive impact on the individuals.",
        "In conclusion, having discussed both points of view, it can be reiterated that despite the fact that some countries may have a logical reason to refuse visitors' cultures, other countries have reaped the benefits of the culture diversity. I believe that welcoming foreigners will lead to a plethora of blessings to any country. It is recommended that governments raise the laymen awareness about diverse cultures, if they aspire to strength the bonds among its individuals."
