        "In the past few decades, people have continued to exploit nature and pollute the environment, despite knowing the level of environmental degradation caused by them. In my essay, I would discuss the reasons behind the lack of change in their lifestyle and the measures that could be taken to encourage them otherwise.",
        "",
        "Primarily, citizens choose a convenient lifestyle, even if the activity is hazardous to the atmosphere. Addicted to the comfort offered by the modern creations, they are turning a blind eye to the harmful consequences like automobiles exhausting fossil fuels or air conditioners damaging the ozone layer. Nevertheless, environmentally safe alternatives exist, but people are resistant to change, since, they are costly and not easily available. For instance, electric cars are expensive and produced in fewer numbers, making it difficult for a common man to substitute his fuel driven car.",
        "",
        "However, some measures can be implemented to preserve the environment. Firstly, the government should provide incentives to develop affordable eco-friendly equipment. Their nominal cost would encourage consumers to alter their lifestyle towards a safer future. For example, with the availability of inexpensive reusable cloth bags, people are not against replacing plastic bags. Secondly, ecological consciousness should be generated amongst people. Although scientists are cautioning, the public are ignorant due to lack of communication, therefore, knowledge should be reached to everyone though various forms of media.",
        "",
        "To conclude, people have neglected the warnings for convenience and greed and corrective measures from the government and corporates could save our environment only to an extent. Hence, the added effort of the current population in becoming an environmentally sound society, would give our future generations an opportunity to inherit an inhabitable earth."
