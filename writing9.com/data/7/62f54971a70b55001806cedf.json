        "A healthy diet is crucial to people's health. The majority of the community are not consumed healthy foods because of numerous reasons such as long working hours in the job field, and spending time on TV and the internet. They mainly prefer fast foods and snacks to provide daily nourishment due to fast preparation. This eating habit leads to the health problems such as obesity, cardiovascular diseases and hipper tension. Some believe education is the main factor to force people to prefer a healthy diet instead junk food, but others consider that way will not work. I strongly believe education can encourage people  not to use snacks.",
        "The eating habits of  society are different from the past. Almost all members of the household except teenagers have to support the budget of the family. They spend a long time in the working areas and they are not able to eat homemade meals and they must prefer fast foods or snacks. As we know, ingredients of  convenience food lead to  fatness and have almost no benefits.Additionally, eating junk food when people watch TV is another harmful habit to harm the community's health. Actually, the population consume more snacks which can destroy the balance of the human body, while they are watching. Moreover, consumption of  convenience food can cause  plenty of diseases like being overweight and heart diseases.",
        "Precisely, the influence of education can not be doubted to prefer proper diet. Educated people have the ability to know damages of the junk foods. For example, they search foods that can be beneficial for a healthy diet. Moreover, they totally care about the components of the foods when they buy a sort of snack.Further, the negative impact of  convenience food can be easily understandable by them. I have never seen a way that can be efficient like education. I consider education the only way that can help to understand the damage of the snacks.",
        "\u0130n conclusion, people should select a healthy diet, because their health can be easily affected by unhealthy nourishment. \u0130f people desire to be healthy, they fiercely do not consume junk foods."
