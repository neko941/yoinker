        "In the evaluation of the human history, life started getting easier with the inventions of the machines and thoughtful ideas to develop the machines. With the progress of science, various ideas have started getting implemented, lessening the human efforts. But as a coin has 2 sides, the disadvantage of this evaluation resulted into the new problems and concerns. According to me, the drawbacks of the machines getting introduced in almost all the industries are more than the disadvantages. This essay will throw the light on the heavier side.",
        "Initially, when there is no much progress in science and machine development, human efforts are required. Because of which, there is a large number of employment and living standards are maintained. For example, when there were textile manufacturing meals, large number of people have jobs and their life is more stable with the regular incomes. But once the machines introduced in the textile industry, they lost their jobs and income stopped which resulted in many other problems of living and getting normal lives.",
        "Another thing is that, manual efforts were given exercises of the body which was the source of much healthier lifestyle. But when machines were introduced, people started becoming lazy and previous healthy life style got pampered. This resulted in unhealthy and disease prone lives now a days.",
        "So in my opinion, to maintain the healthy and happy lifestyles, converting all the industries automated should be judged and tested with all other circumstances and then only they should get allowed with large number of machines."
