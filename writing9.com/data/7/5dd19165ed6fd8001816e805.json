        "Nowadays there is an increasing movement around the world to encourage people to maintain their homes and workplaces in tidy condition. This essay will explain why I believe that trend is a positive development that has potential to help us better manage our lives.",
        "Firstly, the increasing demands of modern life have brought to the average citizen a plethora of new tasks to be accomplished, either at home and at work. For example, in recent years people started tracking things such as messaging notifications, online classes and even the status of their phone\u2019s battery. As a result, they have been showing the need to rely on organisation and methodic behaviours to properly handle all the requirements that are expected from them. Otherwise, the average worker will have a hard time remembering where a certain object was placed, or which piece of cloth must be washed, for example.",
        "Additionally, with the advent of the open office concept and social networks, those who work or constantly share their lifes on social media are actually exposing their private and professional environments to their whole social group of friends and coworkers. Consequently, an office table that is not well organized or a backyard that clearly requires urgent maintenance may be seen by others as a lack of care to detail. On the other hand, employees that maintain their offices in tidy conditions increase the chances of being profiled as better professionals.",
        "In conclusion, there are many benefits on maintain our homes and offices in prestine conditions. I believe any citizen that adopts the habit of being organized will increase their likelihood of accomplishing tasks and their chances of being better evaluated by their employers."
