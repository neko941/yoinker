        "Dear John,\r\t\tI would like to formally thank you for agreeing to take care of my house while i am away on my holiday. I am sure my house is going to be in safe hands under your care. While I am away for a few days, I thought I would leave you some notes regarding few things about the house and my whereabouts during my holiday.\r\rI will be travelling on my holiday for the next 10 days, but I am always available to reach by phone at my regular mobile number. Just so you have it handy, here is my phone number (469-123-4567).  Please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to me in case of any questions.\r\rAlso, please do not forget to feed my super cute pet Duffy three times a day at 8am, 12 noon and 6pm. All the food is available in the kitchen drawer right next to the sink.\rThe only other household duties are to water the plants and collect mail."
