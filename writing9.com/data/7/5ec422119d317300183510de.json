        "The world has been harmfully affected mainly by different factors. Humanity has been known as one factor that exhibits some depleting effect on the ecosystem due to their actions. This essay will discuss how people have destroyed their environs, how leaders can address these issues and what people can do to reduce these impacts.",
        "Firstly, individuals have caused so many harmful effects on the society through air pollution. It can be caused by incomplete combustion of fossil fuel by oil companies or cars. In Nigeria, especially Port-Hcourt, due to improper burning of crude oil by most organizations, black soot has covered this community and can be seen on the walls of most houses and offices. Secondly, improper waste disposal is one way the society has been harmed. Since most people refused to discard their scrap properly, it has increased the amount of mosquitoes in these communities. For example, In West Africa, despite the increased education on chills and fever, the incidence has not reduced because of scraps are not properly removed.",
        "The leaders can actually correct these problems by introducing policies that monitor the production of fossil fuels and educate people on how to dispose their junk.  In countries like USA where fuels produced by companies are being regulated by the authorities have shown reduction in smog, unlike most African countries where anyone can burn crude. Education of people on good sewage dumping will reduce ague incidence. Since the exposure of individuals in the better ways of bin discarding, some states in Nigeria like Abia and Enugu has been known for their reduced pathogenic infection cases.",
        "Also, people can help to reduce these issues if they obey the policies being issued by the authorities. If humanity obeys rules and regulations, the number of chills cases will reduce. Even though most people might not be financially adequate to repair the vehicle, if they repair their cars when damaged, the amount of environmental contamination will reduce because of expelled carbon-dioxide from their exhaust.",
        "In conclusion, the ecosystem has been affected greatly by the actions of humans.  Although people have enormously affected their environs, if some measures are introduced, it can be averted. This essay suggests that adequate exposure of people to better sewage dumping and introduction of rules by executives to check improper natural gas production can reduce air pollution and improper waste discard. Individuals can also help if they obey the government rules and regulations and repair their cars when damaged."
