        "Some people believe that having a successful career is a key factor to live a life full of joy.  I partly agree with that argument and the reasons will be explained below.",
        "There are various ways to become a happy person in this contemporary world. Even though, having a good business life is the main factor to enjoy a life which is worth living, it is not the only option due to the fact that there are more precious things in an individual\u2019s life such as building a family, gaining unforgettable memories and  having friendships which have strong bonds. For instance, if a person has an issue to handle in the working life, he/she will need a friend to share this situation thus this person will feel less stressed. In addition to this, it is a necessity that shares the moments which make them feel happy with their friends for this person. Their life becomes meaningful when they share their memories with their friends rather than having a successful career.",
        "On the other hand, there is no doubt that the biggest part of a human\u2019s life becomes from working life. Even in a day, every people spend many hours doing their jobs and this means if a person loves his/her profession, this person will be happy in his/her life. For such a person, more success in a career means a more meaningful life.",
        "In conclusion, there are some ways to make a life meaningful such as having a good career or real friends. It depends on the perspectives of individuals and how they make their lives more precious. Some might only be happy with walking through their career path. However, others will choose different values."
