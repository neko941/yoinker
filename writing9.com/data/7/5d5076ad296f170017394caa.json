Each of the rooms in the house has its own bathroom and toilet, a study area, laundry room, kitchen and dining. Also, there\u2019s a space outside that I can park my car. The good thing about the area is that it is more peaceful with nice gardens.",

We could use the opportunity to attend the festival together. I\u2019m sure it will be fun, as there will be plenty to eat and drink. Get back to me as soon as you can.",
