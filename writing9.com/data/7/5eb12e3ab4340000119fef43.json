        "The reason I am writing to you is an issue that our community \u201cWest Summer\u201d is facing due to the faulty and inadequate rubbish management system, especially for the last couple weeks.",
        "Let me elaborate on the situation. First of all, the number of garbage bins installed in the area is insufficient considering the total population. Furthermore, for the fortnight, the garbage collectors pick up the rubbish only once in two days, instead of picking it up on a daily basis.",
        "Since the garbage bins are overflowing with litter, it attracts some street dogs and local citizens are worried about their safety. Moreover, it has also become a breeding ground for mosquitoes and other insects that can lead to the spread of contagious diseases. In addition, a bad odour from rubbish bins reaches our houses and it makes unbearable to breathe.",
        "Considering all of the above-mentioned, as a long-term solution, more large garbage bins should be installed. Also, garbage collectors should pick up the rubbish each day without any gaps.",
        "I hope you will take immediate measures to solve the problems and suggestions will be considered.",
