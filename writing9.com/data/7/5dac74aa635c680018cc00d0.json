        "I am writing to inform you about my decision to discontinue my course at the university in the interim. Due to the time strain, my course attendance has been poor, my mid-semester assessments was not impressive and I have also received a number of warning notices from my boss as a result of some laxities at work.",
        "With the new schedule at the National stadium, I would be missing alot of classes and will find it difficult to meet up with the minimum attendance required for my course. This will affect my grades and ultimately ruin my chance of applying for the student aid at the end of my sophomore year.",
        "I would like to defer my admission till the next session when I would be fully ready to face my studies with the least distraction. I will be switching to a more flexible job which will require me to work only five hours in the morning ans as such I would have more time to ficus on my studies",
