        "People have different opinions on  spending and saving their money. Some people believe that they should spend money to enjoy life to the fullest while  others consider saving money to secure their future. In my opinion, saving money is absolutely necessary, but it should not be achieved at the cost of limiting basic needs.",
        "To commence with, people these  days are working hard to earn more and more money to live a comfortable life and full fill their desires. There are certain expenses that cannot be curtailed. For example, we all need food to eat and cloths to wear. We also have the responsibility of taking care of our dependent parents, children\u2019s and spouse. In addition to this, they should invest some amount in the recreational activities to break the monotony of their regular life and to live a stress free life. To exemplify, people should go out for vacations once in year to relax themselves and enjoy quality time with their friends or family members. Thus, all of these are good reasons for spending money.",
        "On the other hand, saving money is vital for a bright future. Life is full of ups and down and we cannot predict what would happen in future. For instance, a sudden job loss can put people in financial trouble and derail their course of life. Therefore, if we spend all of our earning in enjoying the current life, we will not be able to overcome these difficult situations. Furthermore, we can enjoy an economically strong and independent life during our twilight years with this saved amount. Hence, it is important to save money.",
        "In conclusion, it is evident to live a comfortable life throughout one\u2019s life, it is important to save and spend money wisely."
