        "As a result of the dangerous effect continuous consumption of sugar causes, it is thought by some that the government should play a role in controlling its intake, while others believe that it is the sole duty of a person to regulate how he consumes it. I, however, believe that an individual is solely responsible for the number of sweet things he consumes.",
        "On the one hand, in order to prevent health conditions, it is paramount that the government educates his citizens about the effects of sugar. This can be done by carrying out health awareness programmes, warning people about how diseases like diabetes, hypertension can drastically reduce life expectancy. With measures like this, there will be a reduction in sugar consumption generally. For example, after the 2019 \"say no to sugar campaign\" there was a reported decrease in the number of people diagnosed with diabetes.",
        "On the other hand, no one can take care of a person\u2019s health better than themselves, as individuals know their own body requirements better. Adults have free will and should be able to control what they consume. Also, everyone is different and cannot be measured on the same scale. For instance, if someone has a family history of diabetes then he should take precautions and consume less sugar than the others because he is more likely to develop diabetes. \u00a0In addition, there are multiple ways through which people can regulate their sugar cravings. For example, they can use sugar-free products instead of real sugar. I believe that adults are the only one who can ultimately regulate the sugar they take because when they are faced with difficult health conditions as a result of consumption of sweet food, they will not have a choice than to cut it down.",
        "In conclusion, although the government can control sugar intake by the creation of awareness, I believe it is the sole responsibility of a person to control sugary substance intake because nobody knows the body of a person better than the individual himself."
