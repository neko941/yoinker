        "Nowadays, Many people argue that students are studying in school in foreign countries. While there are some benefits to learn in another country, I am of the opinion that the drawbacks will likely be more significant.",
        "On the one hand, the option to learn overseas can exert many positive effects. Firstly, Students will quickly understand local people. This is because they learn about new cultures. Secondly, They gain qualifications for their job easily. This is mainly due to getting new knowledge. For instance, People come to America to study, they know many things about U.S.A culture. They have a chance to meet some famous teachers in the USA. They will get a good job in the USA  and earn much more money than their friends in their original country.",
        "On the other hand, this practice can highlight a number of valid concerns. The first drawback relates to the expensive education fee. This is because education fees are higher than in their country. The second one is that mixing harmful culture to the student. For example, there are average families in their country. They don\u2019t have much money. When they try to study overseas, they must try to work hard. Especially, the learners have to work overtime with other job to earn money. They spend so little time studying that negative impact on education results.",
        "In conclusion, While there are many benefits regarding learning in foreign countries. I believe that the advantages that result from this phenomenon are of more vital significance. It is recommended that bring a high quality of education to the original country. Everybody can get a good education."
