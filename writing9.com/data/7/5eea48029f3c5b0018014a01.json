        "There is no doubt these days, news is one of the most important parts in our modern life. However, the question is, are we wasting our time when read the newspaper or follow it on television? In this essay I am going to argue that.",
        "There are many people believe that, news is connecting to their lives. Firstly, follow news programmes is important to know what is going on the world and to be knowing what happens around them. In fact, they could be informed if there is any crisis appear in the earth such as, nowadays the COVID 19 has spared in the whole world. Moreover, business men require to be attentive about the economic news also political disaster, because the policy has relation with the economy, if any political disaster happens to the world, it will affect strongly in the international economy, so business men will run to buy anything that its price was affected. There are some other things to make following news being as this important.",
        "On the other hand, many individual think that watching news let them to loss their time. In addition, many of them believe that if they read books instead of watching news, it might be more useful and that could return to them significant knowledge. For instance, they think that while the news programmes are discussing and sharing the news they could finish two chapter of their book.",
        "To sum up, this essay has argued that if is watching news will let them to loss their moment. In my opinion, watch news will not let you to waste of your time and maybe that make you attention what is going on around you and about your country"
