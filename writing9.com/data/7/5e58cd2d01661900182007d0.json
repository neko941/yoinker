        "These days, industries are manufacturing more products than required, the repercussions of this is worsening of the environment.   This essay chronicles few solutions for protection of a healthy and safe habitat in the purlieus of the human kind.",
        "Factories of various industries are built for producing products at minimum human efforts, it is the automation of manual work. While building the units of substances, the requirement is over estimated, so the result is of mass outcome, which leads to wastage of goods.  This extra item is thrown away in to mother nature, only to damage the nature. This is a major problem, which must be addressed.",
        "Firstly, proper estimation of the required outcome from manufacturing plants will drastically reduce the chances of mass production, there won\u2019t be wastage. To support this idea, one can start the producing of units after confirmation of one million orders only for example. So, after one million of items are sold, next batch of processing will commence.",
        "Secondly, the raw material used for production should be biodegradable, so that once usage is done, products will be absorbed by the earth without ruining the environs. Finally, as the products become obsolete after a few months, these if recycled correctly to generate next version of the product, then there won\u2019t be contamination of water or earth with plastic or metals produced by industrialization.",
        "In conclusion, the production of goods more than need is detrimental for both environment and that factory. Thus, if the factory-made proper planning before manufacturing of products and uses of eco-friendly methods, then this situation can be healed to few extents."
