        "In salad days of the millennium, local media telecasting the prisoner trails for the citizens throughout the year. While this offers a few advantages, but there are also some disadvantages which are worth considering.",
        "There are two main benefits to telecasting or broadcasting such events. The main advantage is that all the trials of the criminal activities will create awareness to the people. In many countries, there is a quite number increase in illegal activities in the neighbourhood such as human trafficking, child abuse and drug mafia. These are the most pressing issues for the government where the prisoners are sentenced to death. Another advantage is that it will enhance the power of the local government towards the crime rate. By broadcasting the punishments the local bodies are loyal to the people who elected them as a ruling party. The Asian countries are prime examples, where the rime rate in recent years reduced from 80% to 60 %  when it is compared to 90% to 85% last year. As a result, reduce crimes make people live a peaceful life.",
        "On the other hand, various drawbacks may be noted. A major disadvantage is that when this stream in media and without age limit people will watch these trials. This will lead young children or older people to panic which is not advisable even though for small trials. The disturbing scenes should need to be blocked while streaming. In addition to this, it will affect the countries reputation in the world. In the world of internet, these videos will circulate in all platforms namely Facebook, YouTube and Twitter where people will migrate to such countries. To illustrate, The New York Times magazine issued an article about the telecast and dissatisfaction of that country.",
        "In conclusion, if this has been streamed online people will think before committing crimes. However, this will also affect the country growth.Therefore, it is necessary to weigh the benefits against the drawbacks carefully before coming to decision as to broadcast such incidents."
