        "How are you? Hope you are having an amazing time now with having been gifted with a little princess. I'm enormously elated after having heard this news from your husband and I really wanted to turn up there; however, my boss has tasked me an important assignment that needs to be delivered within the next two days.",
        "This has been the best news to me since the recent months and you really cannot imagine how I rejoice despite my hectic work schedule. I immediately told this to my wife and she is extremely eager to see you.",
        "As I stated, the task that was assigned takes up a large sum of my daily time and it is crucial that I complete it within the stipulated time. We will leave our town in the next two days to see you after having completed this work.",
        "You may know that I'm not quite good at buying presents especially for infants and hence my wife has bought a baby care kit that contains essentials such as baby soap, a delicate towel, and importantly a swinging baby cradle. We imagine that your little princess will love what we bought for her. And don't worry, I'm getting your favourite chocolate, Ferrero Rocher, from my town, which you have been asking me for so long.",
        "Do call me on my number or write an email if I should buy anything else for you. See you soon!",
