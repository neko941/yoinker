        "The carriers are becoming a significant aspect of human lives. Because everyone's life pattern depends on their job and the salary. However, the majority of people think that having an interesting job is more vital while others believe that having a high salary is more beneficial. But I believe, having an extra salary job is effective these days.",
        "There are several advantages and disadvantages to having an enjoyable job. Furthermore, when people doing a fascinating job, they could have more fun, a good mood and more satisfaction with their job. And also, when they do it happily the output would be impeccable. On the other hand, there are some disadvantages to having that kind of occupation. When a person has a low salary job he has to do more sacrifices and also, he has to limit his wants. Due to that, the money they earn might not be enough for living. But to get over this, people should balance these circumstances by doing what they like and earning enough money.",
        "By contrast, there are some positive and negative sides to doing a high salary job. In addition, doing a high earning carrier can earn a plethora of money and he should not have to worry about daily expenses and living costs. And also, he could has a better lifestyle. Nevertheless, there are negative effects too. When doing a job that a person does not like he could be stressful. And also, that could convert a person to a robot that only earns money. So to get rid of this, people should be more enjoyable from what they earn.",
        "To sum up, there are a variety of occupations in the world. And people able to choose a job that they want. There are advantages and disadvantages to every carrier. But in my view, I think having a high salary job is more convenient to live nowadays."
