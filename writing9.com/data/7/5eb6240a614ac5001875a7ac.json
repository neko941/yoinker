        "In our modern society, many arguments have been made for and against the income of the famous celebrities or performers. It is debated heavily whether they deserve such an amount of money for their work or not. Personally, I believe that such personalities are being compensated unfairly and thus, resulting in a number of negative effects for the society. In this essay, I shall critically examine the given topic and outline relevant examples to support my view.",
        "On one hand, there are numerous drawbacks of this trend. To begin with, the amount of money that such a type of personalities earn may cause the general public to feel discouraged, as often times celebrities are paid in millions of dollars for a minute of the advertisement. For example, a recent study conducted at the Stanford University showed that in terms of the employment, acting and media performance jobs are one of the highest paying career, even greater than a neurosurgeon or scientist.",
        "On the other hand, one of the major positive impact of the entertainers is the fact that the movies and documentaries are a great way to raise awareness about the important issues in the world, which could be used to tackle various problems in our community. In addition, media industry accounts for a heavy sum of the tax earned by the government, thus, it plays a vital role in the country's economy.",
        "In conclusion, this is a topic which raises many questions in the contemporary life. After a thorough analysis of the subject, I am inclined to continue stand in support of my view that the negative consequences of this tendency surpass the positive points."
