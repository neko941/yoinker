        "I am writing this letter regarding the bus service, that you are providing in our zone for 10 years. It has been tremendous service and absolutely up to the mark, but I have found two major issues since last two weeks. One of them is few of the seats are broken and not comfortable at all. Anther problem is the punctuality; it is hard to get any bus on the time in my area.",
        "Furthermore, in this area, my stop is in the middle of zone and if I am able to catch the bus, the remaining seats are the broken one. Apart from this, I am a salesperson and being on time is one of the points to crack the deal, since your buses are not on the time, either I am forced to pay the heavy taxi fares or arrive late for the appointment, which means a loss of the money or deal.",
        "I would like to suggest you that kindly recheck the quality measurements and reschedule your transport system. Increasing the number of vehicles, and upgrading the interior of old buses might help in resolving these problems.",
