        "Some people argue that it is pointless to spend money on the protection of wild animals because humans do not need them. I completely disagree with this point of view.",
        "In my opinion, it is absurd to argue that wild animals have no place in the 21st century. I do not believe that planet Earth exists only for the benefit of humans, and there is nothing special about this particular century that means that we suddenly have the right to allow or encourage the extinction of any species. Furthermore, there is no compelling reason why we should let animals die out. We do not need to exploit or destroy every last square metre of land in order to feed or accommodate the world\u2019s population. There is plenty of room for us to exist side by side with wild animals, and this should be our aim.",
        "I also disagree with the idea that protecting animals is a waste of resources. It is usually the protection of natural habitats that ensures the survival of wild animals, and most scientists agree that these habitats are also crucial for human survival. For instance, rainforests produce oxygen, absorb carbon",
        "Dioxide and stabilise the Earth\u2019s climate. If we destroyed these areas, the costs of managing the resulting changes to our planet would far outweigh the costs of conservation. By protecting wild animals and their habitats, we maintain  the natural balance of all life on Earth.",
        "In conclusion, we have no right to decide whether or not wild animals should exist, and I believe that we should do everything we can to protect them."
