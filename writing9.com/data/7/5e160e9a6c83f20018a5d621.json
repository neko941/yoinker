        "There is no doubt that adolescence can be a difficult period in life for both youngsters and their parents.  While some people believe that conflict at this time creates more harm than good, others argue that it is an essential phase of teenagers\u2019 development. In this essay, I will discuss both sides of the argument and explain my support for the latter view.",
        "On the one hand, those who believe teenage conflict is harmful might argue that it can lead to distress in relationships between parents and their children. This is because such disputes can cause unnecessary arguments and tension in the family. For example, it is quite common for young people to get addicted to playing video games for entertainment, but the resulting disagreements with parents can lead to difficulties with communication. In contrast, if there is no argument between parents and children, there will be a much greater sense of happiness among family members.",
        "On the other hand, my view is that this conflict is crucial because it can help youngsters to develop themselves. The reason for this is that by having disagreements adolescents can think and have their own opinions. For instance, a child may grow up in a family of meat-eaters but feel very strong about not eating meat. If this child does not voice their opinion, they will be going against their self-thoughts. However, if they are willing to engage in argument with their parents, their conscience will be much clearer despite the agony of the argument.",
        "In conclusion, although teenage conflict can create damaging relationships, it is my firm belief that this time of friction is a vital step on the path to teenagers becoming mature and independently-minded adults."
