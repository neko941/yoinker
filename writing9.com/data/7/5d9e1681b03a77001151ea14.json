        "It is often seen in the developing countries that the new generation is attempting more crime than before. This essay will discuss how poverty of the nation  and wrong upbringing for  a rich child encouraged to commit crime and how some government programs and a proper raising method of rich offspring can tackle this problem to some extent.",
        "THE PRIEM REASON FOR YOUTH CRIME IS THE LOW ECONOMY OF THE COUNTRY. LOW ECONOMY MEANS MORE NEEDY PEOPLE. TO ELABORATE, NEEDY PERSON DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH ENCOME TO FEED THEIR FAMILY, THUS THE CHILD OF THAT FAMILY TRIES TO COOPERATE WITH THAT BYE FINDING EASY MONEY THROUGH MINOR CRIMES LIKE, ROBERY, FRAUDE ETC. FOR AN EXAMPLE, ONE BOY IN MY NEIGHBOUR HE ATTEMTED A ROBBARY IN BANK TO REPAY LOAN OF THE FAMILY BECAUSE HIS FATHER IS JUST LABOUR WORKER AND HE TOOK LOAN FOR HIS DAUGHTER'S MARRIGE. THAT FARMER WAS HARDLY CAPABLE TO PAY THE HOUSE-HOLD UTILITY IN THAT HOW COULD HE PAY BACK THE LOAN. THUS I THINK THIS IS THE ONE REASON OF WHY YOUTH IS ATTEMPTING CRIME. MOREOVER, ADULESENCE FROM WEALTHY FAMILY ALSO TRIES TO OUGHT  OFFENCE IN SOME CASES DUE TO SOME WRONG UPBRINGING BY THEIR PARENTS. TO ILLUSTRATE, WHEN PARENTS ARE NOT GUIDING THEIR CHILDREN IN A CORRECT WAY, NOT TAKING CARE OF THEM PROPERLY, THAT JUVENILE GET IN BAD INFLUENCE AND AS THEY ARE RICH THEY THINK THAT NO ONE CAN CATCH AND IF SO HAPPEN, THEY PARENTS WILL DO SOMTHNING TO TAKE THEM OUT FOR THEI PRIDE. THUS I BELIEVE, PARENTS ALSO PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THIS.",
        "IN THE SOLUTION SIDE, FIRST OF ALL, GOVERNMENT CAN OPEN VARIOUS PAROGRAM LIKE, SAVING FOR GIRLS' MARRIAGE IN THE AUTHORITY BANKS. TO ELABORATE , DUE TO THIS KIND OF PROGRAM POOR PEOPLE AN HAVE SOME SAVING SO THAT THEY DO NOTHAVE TO GO TO SOMEONE ELSE FOR LOAN. FOR AN EXAMPLE, IN INDIAN THERE IS A SKIM WHERE ANY PEOPLE WHO HAS LOW OR MEDIUM INCOME CAN ELIGIBLE TO OPEN AN ACCOUNT AND DIPOSIT MONEY EVERY MONTH. THEY CAN START THIS WHEN THE GIRL BORNS. SECOND OF ALL, RIGHT GUIDANCE PROVIDED TO THE CHILD BY THEIR PARENT. TO EXPLAN, WHEN PARENT TEACH THEIR CHILD OF MORAL VALUE, HONESTY, HOW TO BE GOO MEMER OF THE SOCIETY WILL DICREASE THE YOUTH CRIME.",
        "TO SUM UP, IT IS TRUE THAT CRIME HAS BOOST ENORMOUSSLY IN THE PRESENT TIME DUE TO SOME ECONIMY PROBLEM AND PARENTING. BUT GOVERNMENT CAN HELP AN D ALSO INDIVIDUALS TO LOWER THE PROBLEM OF THIS."
