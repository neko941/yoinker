        "In today's era, both education and health facilities are important for the people. Some individuals opine that these elements should be free for all, while others suggesting to take from individuals themselves. Since I am going to discuss both of the views before provide my opinion.",
        "To commence with, health care and education services may provided by the nation for free of cost to their citizens. This will result in benefits whoever opt for it for sure. Firstly, if the government provides schooling to the children, all children will get the free schooling and they can get the employment and they do not have to worry about fund which is most critical in their life and can concentrate on the studies. Moving to the health care system, some low-income families are not able to afford to take medicine such as diabetes and critical heart problem. The unpaid system may relax them financially as its owned by country. Then the government can accumulate from the citizens by collecting taxes. For example, some developed countries adapted this approach. They collect money for unpaid hospitality through taxation.",
        "On the flip side, some individuals thinking that why cannot take this as a personal  duty of health care and Education themselves. In this case, there might be a chance of overcrowd  the hospital and missing of emergency cases those who are really needed.  Although free education can be  significantly increased the employment to citizen, it will also increase unemployment because the resources are limited on the globe.",
        "To sum-up, there are pros and cons for both free and paid services. I believe that the government should pay services only those who really in need and maintain the list of beneficiaries who are economically week and facilitates."
