        "Hope you and your family are healthy and safe in this pandemic. I wanted to personally visit you to tell you that I have to push my moving date to September 15th instead of September 1st, but it\u2019s about 8 hours drive from where I live right now.",
        "The reason I cannot make it on decided time is because my father had an accident last week, nothing to worry, it\u2019s just a minor fracture in his right knee, he fell from his bicycle while trying to save a 5-year-old kid running to catch a balloon. The doctor strictly gave him bed rest for a month. Although, he is recovering very fast, but me and my mother are staying home to take care of him, but mother is going back to work starting next week and then I would have to take care of my father. My brother is having his middle school exam starting this week and he asked for my help in maths. He is the second reason I want to stay a little longer.",
