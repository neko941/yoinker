        "For being healthy, people organise sports events like  the Olympics or world cup; however, some people advocate that a good health comes through different types of activities such as doing workout, healthy diet, and staying away from tension.",
        "To begin with, several organizations manage programs related to sports to encourage the common people to take part in these games such as cricket, football, swimming, and so on, to name but a few. Inviting people to participate in such games, myriads of people, who are unwell and suffering from various types of diseases such as back pain, muscle disorder, height-related issues, are motivated to implement the task assigned by the authority of event organizers. Thinking that if they do such activities, it would help them to cure ailments. They, eventually, will get a robust body and mind. Moreover, engaging in sports not only make their brain active, but it also succours to relieve pain.",
        "In contrast, besides participating in sports, some people believe that if people, invariably, do regular physical exercise such as walking, running, weight lifting, et Cetra, they will lead a healthy life. What is more, people should eat healthy food which has no sugar, fat, cholesterol. In fact, the  pressure of work and family problem may increase psychosomatic ailments, so that people have to keep themselves away from tension.",
        "In conclusion, although Olympic and world cup organizers organise events for pooling ordinary people to become a part of these events which, consequently, would restrain them from various diseases and would not be unhealthy in the long run, many people think opposite like corporal exercise , balance diet, and remaining tension free - all these help people to stay healthy."
