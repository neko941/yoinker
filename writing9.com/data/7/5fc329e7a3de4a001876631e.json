        "In this modern era, Consumers are following the trend of usage and throw policy in which they use a product for a short period of time and then dispose of it away. This essay will discuss the main causes of use and throw of products in little time including a lack of awareness and  high prices of recycled products. This essay will reveal the problems that take place because of this current scenario including their contribution towards pollution and extinction of marine ecology.",
        "On the one hand, a lack of awareness among the consumers and rise in prices of recycled goods creates a trend to follow the policy of use and throw. Shoppers are not aware of their actions and thus contributes to the environment. To illustrate, consumers are not aware of the consequences of using plastic bottles and thus purchase them without any hesitation. Additionally, a consumer prefers to invest little amount on disposable items rather than on recycled products which are quite expensive. For example, according to a consumers survey in 2018, it was revealed that 80% of consumers make a purchase of disposable products. Therefore, These actions of the consumers often result in spoiling their environment.",
        "On the other hand,  adoption of use and throw policy not only leads to  pollution but also contributes negatively towards  marine life. Users contribute towards various forms of pollutions that eventually spoils the environment and makes it unfit for survival. For example, the usage of the high volume of the motor vehicles creates smoke in the air and thus gives birth to air pollution which not only spoils the ozone layer but also gives birth to the diseases such as asthma and breathing issues. Moreover, this also creates a problem for marine animals and makes them extinct. To illustrate, Marine ecology is in danger because of the dispose of plastic material in large oceans which are eventually eaten by water animals and thus become a reason for their instant death. Therefore, pollution and extinction of marine life are occurring because of the actions of human beings.",
        "To conclude, Throwing away the products after using them for a short period of time is creating tremendous issues in our society. This essay discussed how a lack of awareness among users and high prices of goods gives birth to pollution and puts water animals in danger."
