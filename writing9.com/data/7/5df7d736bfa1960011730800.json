        "An increasing number of individuals believe that animals should not be used by common people and they should have the equal rights as human beings; however, counters claim that mankind must utilise animals for their different demands, including utilisation of food and scientific experiment. The argument consists of dual opinion and pros cons respectively. Prior to my opinion, both the views are analysed.",
        "Discussing the former viewpoint, the most crucial one is that men do not have any right to kill the animals. As, Animal is a wonderful creature of God and only almighty has the power to take the life of any living things. In addition to this, killing the animals for food is inadequate. Because it has proven that human beings can get all the nutrients and vitamins from green vegetables and fruits. Moreover, a substantial amount of animal research is done for cosmetics, not to find cures for diseases, so this is unnecessary.",
        "Analysing the latter perspective, the foremost one is that, animals can be used for the medical research. For example, the medicine for the dangerous cure like cancer was founded after the successfully experimented on the animals. Additionally, scientists try to find the difficulty the animals experienced. To justify, some animal species are endangered because the climate changes. So scientists try to do various experiments to save the animals. Last but not the least, some individuals consider that animal is below the humans in the food chain so, mankind has all the rights to use them to their advantage.",
        "To cap it all and offer my position, I agree with the fore more viewpoint. A growing number of people experience that animals should not be used by humans; where as, specific people claim that mankind must use the animal for their purposes. Although animals can be used for the medical research; however, humans do not have any rights to take their life's."
