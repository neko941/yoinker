        "Certain people argue that spending money on extra curricular fields is not worth, Despite the regime should support the civilian services financially such as schools and health care system and so on as this all play a vital role in forming the healthy and wealthy continent. I believe, if the public services have the regime as their prime investor, they would bring a myriad of change around the nation.",
        "A good reason to contribute money on public services is that it would provide an equality among all the civilians. As government supports the educational institutes, everyone will have access to get admitted and obtain a knowledge. As a result, nation will have an increasing number of educated and well qualified workers, which make the leading and wealthy nation. Take a Canada as an illustration, all most everyone is able to admit in the school or college as the Canada authority has made education free and that is why over 70% of the population is educated there.",
        "Another point to consider is that, if the health system has a government support, everyone would abolish from a dangerous health diseases. At present, almost half of the  population of the world is dying due to some type of health issues that is because of the  to the lack of health centre where they  can not afford to take a treatment. For instance, as per the 2019 survey done by the Oxford University students, 80% of the hospitals are not accepting the destitute folks as they are not capable to pay the fees.",
        "In conclusion, hospital and the school are the elementary public services sectors that should have the full authority support in order to bring the nation on the list of wealthy and leading countries."
