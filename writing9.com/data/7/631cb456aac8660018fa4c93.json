        "It is claimed that day-to-night institutes are better choices for pupils than day academies. There are different opinions about these two sides and this essay will discuss the debate and give a concluding view.",
        "On the one hand, people agreeing with boarding institutions demonstrate financial aspects and less commuting which results in a limited amount of expense for transportation or accommodation and even saving more time. In developed countries, kids are encouraged to travel to school by bus, although their parents own personal vehicles. This matter rarely happens in developing countries like African regions. Another argument is socializing from primary classes and beginning friendship bonds among youngsters. Some students struggling with making friends may benefit this system.",
        "On the other hand, opponents of mentioned view point out that isolating feelings for kids being far from home, and experiencing homesickness, are prohibitive for academic achievements. Furthermore, the pedagogical should consider various types of age characteristics, for ,example higher educators  probably can accept more controversial events. In addition, they might not be prepared for such independent life and the burden of ultimate responsibilities, whereas some scholars encounter bullying and then truancy. However, family support can help them to withstand the challenges of education and peer pressure.",
        "In conclusion, based on the person's family and personality situation, it defers taking such schools for a whole term or not. It seems the benefits of this option are worth the disadvantages after all."
