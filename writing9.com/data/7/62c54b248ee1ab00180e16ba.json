        "I was enroled in a new project which had a close deadline, and I couldn't have missed it at any cost. I feel awful for it completely slipped off my mind to inform you beforehand because I was really busy attending my clients. I know I should've atleast made a quick phone call but I hope you'd understand the sticky spot I was in.",
        "Although I was not there with you, I've sent across a present via courier, and I hope you'd like it. I wish to make it up to you, and let us meet if you are not still mad at me. How about we catch up for a movie this weekend? I am free on both the days and this time I won't ditch you, for sure.",
