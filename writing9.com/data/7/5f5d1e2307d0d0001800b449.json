        "It is debatable issue that whether minors should choose subjects of their own interest or they  will have gain  knowledge of  all other subjects. Nowadays, the trend of having broad knowledge in all  course subjects is exponentially increasing in the globe. This essay will investigate both aspects of viewpoint  while paying more emphasis on the significance of all subjects.",
        "To begin with, in terms of all-rounder minors, if youngsters have a understanding about all course subjects they are likely to get  more job opportunities in future due to a broad understanding of different aspects of life. To illustrate, a recent research study by Harvard University on IQ level of  all subject holder juveniles and specific subject minors which helps them in getting recruited for jobs. As a result, children  studying all courses have  more than 60% of IQ level than only interesting subject  chosen children. Thus, it depends on the capabilities of children to grasp the material.",
        "Moving further, creativity and perfection come to those  who select the subject of their own interest  but in this modern world knowledge in just one aspect of studies is not enough to move forward. For instance, instead of  interacting with other children  if minors  just sitting alone and doing their work  privately  will impact them negatively.",
        "To conclude, I discussed both viewpoints but my  most of the reasons are on the side of positive effects of studying all subjects because in the future being a smart person people have to  be pro in  each and every part."
