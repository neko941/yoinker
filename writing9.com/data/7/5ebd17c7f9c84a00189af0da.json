        "It is argued when children start formal education they are more likely to be affected by their teachers rather than their parents. Although, there are compelling and various reasons behind this issue. However, I strongly believe that only parents have the most effect on children.",
        "When a child is born the first people that she or he sees is the parents. So parents as two people who are fostering a child play crucial role and influence their child in countless ways. Firstly, they create a life and mix the genes, therefore  a child certainly inherits traits from his or her parents. Secondly, since parents provide the environment for their child living and also parents do have interacted with their child, so they highly influence their child intelligence and personality by the way they treat the child and also more importantly the way they treat each other. Furthermore, psychologists believe that a child's mind is like a blank slate which is highly susceptible to every impression. Therefore, a child's mind and also personality easily take form, especially at a very young age.",
        "However, some people are of the opinion that after children enter school, teachers play a vital role and they may influence them more than their parents do. They think teachers have significant and lifelong impression on all students. Teachers provide to stimulate students' behaviour toward class activities and increase their involvement. Therefore, this involvement can lead to confidence, especially for students who are usually in a slump and lacking confidence. Also, teachers play a vital role in students' future educating. Because they can motivate students in different ways, such as reinforcing self-esteeming in the classroom, which is extremely associated with increased motivation and learning.",
        "To sum up, without a doubt, teachers have significant impacts on their students in different ways. However, in my view, the impacts of parents are definitely much more than teachers on children."
