        "Happiness is an eminent aspect of life and each individual crave for it. There has been an ongoing debate on which phase of life is the happiest one.  Some thinkers believe that the adolescent is the perfect period to enjoy the life at the fullest, while another set of people support that adulthood is apt for it. However, both have its pros and cons. This essay will discuss both the views before commenting on my opinion.",
        "Undoubtedly, senior people have ample of money to explore new and exciting things. However, they do not have sufficient time to enjoy their life with the family or dear ones because they are abiding to follow the norms of achieving success and handling their responsibilities. To illustrate this, professionals always plan to have a reunion with their college friends, however, only a few numbers of people turn up for it as they are busy in their life. As a result, although, people have money they do not have time to use it and experience the fun.",
        "Nevertheless, younger age groups have multifarious options to experience in their life. Moreover, their excitement level is at a higher peak as compared to older age groups. One of the main reasons is they make different friends, who motivate them to experiment various forms of activities for example",
        "Adventure, sports and many more. And this enjoyment can lead to various happy moments in life which are cherished at a later stage of life. To exemplify, recent surveys conducted by the Human Health Department, India, state that over a population of 1000K citizens around 80% accept that they enjoyed more in their teenage compared to their present life.",
        "To summarize, happiness can be measured in different ways using money, time, the interests of individuals. Even though juniors are short of cash, I believe this age group can have fun and experience happiness more compared to adults with responsibilities."
