        "In this modern era, the technology giving so many discoveries for humans to reduce their workload, where most of the things get a great welcome by users and eco-friendly for the environment. But some items like plastic bags are more useful than others, it is a huge threat to the environment, which includes every life. In fact, the used plastics, the electronic rubbish cannot be disposed of with this same modern technology. I largely agree that people are also making the environment as dustbin without any think about the future.",
        "Firstly, people are using products whichever is into the market without any knowledge about the pros and cons of that particular product. They will not ask for any information about the product, only it should be attractive and useful. With this similar attitude, the products like plastic bags are introduced and once we used only know that it cannot be destroyed. Due to this, at present, the environment is full of used plastic bags as wastage and these bags are harmful to human health. For example, a recent study by the University of New York, which tell that excess used plastic as waste in society brings cancer to humans.",
        "Secondly, in a survey, one- fourth of the world population is uneducated, there don't know to use a product properly with all precaution to dispose of it. Moreover, the government should have a particular department to check the new introducing product before it enters the market, at least they should have a technology to solve any problem related to the environment or human health. In addition, the authority of the state can get strong rules and regulation to dispose of wastage properly from home. For instance, the degradable and non-degradable products can be separated in home and get into public garbage.",
        "To conclude, people should be more aware of society and try to put their hands together to keep clean and tidy, at least around the place where they live. The government should also properly guide them to achieve an eco-friendly environment."
