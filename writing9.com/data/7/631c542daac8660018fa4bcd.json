        "Technological devices such as smartphones are commonly used by individuals for personal purposes or for work. People argue that mobile phones can be used to answer calls from work and personal at any time or even 24/7. The following essay will discuss why the negative impact overweights the positives by giving the reasons behind this action in individuals and communities.",
        "For some workers place full attention to their tasks at work is crucial to get a promotion. Some individuals might be able to always contest their phones and do their job at their workplace or at home. This could lead to highlighting employees\u2019 activities and may be selected to receive a promotion. Additionally, some types of workers such as doctors, nurses and psychiatrists need to be available for any emergency call to aid patients in their physical or mental health. Another point is that personal calls can be made at any time if they are crucial, making feel relatives that one can be available at any time if they need.",
        "Keeping that in mind, some drawbacks are present in the overuse of cell phones either for work or personal use that are vital to mention. Communities may be affected by the excessive use of smartphones in their mental health. developing diseases such as stress, anxiety or depression. For example, an employee who is constantly replaying their boss' emails or calls may feel stressed for not having a personal life and space for themselves. Another aspect of the negative development of smartphones\u2019 overuse is replacing in-person communication. Individuals tend to reply to messages or attend to calls instead of having a face-to-face conversation to discuss a certain topic either at the workplace or in their personal relationships which give more credibility than calls, text messages or emails.",
        "All the arguments considered, using mobiles at any time to answer it may depend on individuals\u2019 perceptions and what that person would like to achieve in their lives. However, we should not underestimate how affects individuals\u2019 mental health and the credibility of facing a person to have a conversation."
