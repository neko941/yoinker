        "In this new era, individuals are hardly getting for themselves, doing workout will not only keep you fit physically but also mentally.

In my country people eat the organic food, have eight hours sleep; which is right amount required for the body, and go to the morning walk in parks or gardens to stay healthy.",
        "Although, fitness is as essential as anything else in the life, there is a well known phrase about it, \u201cthe health is wealth\u201d. It explains that being healthy is important than only earning money or other things Still, many individuals are mainly focusing on the savings, investments, and earning. Hardly, they get time for the workout or any sports. In my country, the thirty percent people go morning walk or other type of exercise to remain healthy, the rest are suffering from obesity.",
