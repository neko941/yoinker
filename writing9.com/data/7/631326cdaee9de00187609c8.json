        "It is hard to deny the key role of experience in our lives and because of that, some people argue that elderlies should be valued the most; while others tend to think the other way around.",
        "Senior citizens in every country are considered valuable for different reasons. First, they carry the cultural and historical backgrounds of the country with them and, they will eventually pass them on to the next generation. Moreover, they have faced many challenging situations and managed to handle them so young people should learn from them. They have worked in  society for many years and helped to build up the country therefore everyone owes them so much. The second reason is mostly related to the cultural and moral values of  society. Old people are more experienced and have seen the ups and downs of life moreover, the social conventions obligate other people especially youngsters, to respect them more.",
        "On the other hand, young people make up a considerable part of  society. I agree with those who argue that young people should be valued more; because they are the working arms of the country and the future depends on them. They have dreams and passions therefore, they are more determined and well- motivated also, this makes them more compatible with the difficulties of working. In addition, young people have more energy and can learn faster. Besides, they are usually more familiar with today\u2019s technology hence they can work efficiently.",
        "In conclusion, both views of this argument have their merits. On balance ,however, I think young people need to be valued more in order for  society to improve and become a better place."
