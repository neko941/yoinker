        "People have different views about whether watching television is educational or harmful for children. While there are some downsides to watching TV for children, I believe that children can learn a plethora of things by watching the right content on the television.",
        "On the one hand, watching TV in excess can have detrimental effects on children. Firstly, watching television for long hours can make children physically feeble and it may affect their eyesight. Secondly, in today\u2019s jet set age most of the families are nuclear and both of the parents are working, so it is possible for the children to get exposed to harmful / inappropriate content. For instance, there is adult content in every movie and sitcom nowadays and also film stars are seen drinking alcohol and doing drugs on television. This could have a detrimental effect on children.",
        "On the other hand, watching TV can be beneficial for learning new things for the children, if they are allowed to watch for limited time and under the supervision of elders. I believe there are numerous channels such as Discovery, National Geographic and Animal Planet which telecast programmes that are educational and thus enhance a child\u2019s cognitive skills. These types of channels broadcast episodes related to science in daily life, flora and fauna, and biodiversity. Children can learn a lot about nature by watching these on the television.",
        "In conclusion, watching TV in excess can be detrimental for children, but I believe that it could be educational if seen if watched for a short amount of time under parental supervision."
