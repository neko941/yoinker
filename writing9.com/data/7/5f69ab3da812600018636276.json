        "Nowadays, visiting and enjoying in zoos is a common activity but some people argue that animals in the zoo are trapped and prisoned which is a bad thing snd it should be banned now. While other contradict, saying that it is a better way to save wildlife from extinction.  Hence it should be flourished. From my perspective, it has both positive and negative aspects. In this essay, I will shed light on the argument with my own opinion.",
        "The proponents of first idea are also right because most of the time, cages in the zoos are too cramped and they leave a lot to desire. There is less space available for the animals to move here and there. Due to which, sometimes animals feel sad there. Secondly, according to many animals right activists, zoos are against the right of animals because there they are deprived of their natural environment and denied from the lifestyle they choose. Sometimes experiments are done on them which mutate them genetically. For instance, the tail of the rabbits gets change from black to white colour because of mutation. Thus these are some of the reasons against the zoo.",
        "On the other hand, some people proclaim that zoos are the best way to conserve wildlife. Because in the zoo no one can harm them and they are properly taken cared for by authorities. Whenever they are sick or feeling under the weather then doctors checked them and prescribe some medicine for them.  Similarly,they are protected from the poachers,especially endangered species. Which are on the verge of extinction. Research within zoos often looks at animals behaviour or welfare  helping to ensure the animals are well housed and fed. Overall, zoos provide opportunities to observe and engage with exotic animals.",
        "In my viewpoint, zoos are the best way to protect animals from killing and poaching. At the same time,they could be provided with the best medical services.",
        "To sum up, as we know everything has dark and bright sides so conserving animals in zoos  also have some problems which should be handled carefully."
