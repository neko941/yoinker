        "It is often argued that whether children should be allowed and encouraged watching TV both at home and at school or not. While I agree that watching TV indeed benefits children in terms of learning, I also believe that it is wrong to allow children to spending too much time in front of TV screen.",
        "On the one hand, when it comes to learning, there are several ways in which TV is beneficial for children. Firstly, this audio-visual medium provides different opportunities to make learning more enjoyable and interesting. Children will be attracted by visual illustration on the screen, which can help turn tedium lessons into fun activities. For example, historical events which are presented with vivid audio and colourful images tend to stimulate children\u2019s interest and imagination, then they can grasp lessons easily. Secondly, educational TV programs can widen children\u2019s horizons and enrich their knowledge in many aspects of life. Without TV, the young would never be able to see amazing things such as exotic natural habitat, different culture and breathtaking sceneries. Throuh this type of media, the young are educated about expressing their gratitude and sense of honor to the world around them",
        "On the other hand, spending too much time sitting in front of the TV screen can create bad side-effects to children. To begin with, exposure to the screen excessively may lead to eye problems such as blurred vision. To illustrate, these days, there are a growing number of children suffering from poor vision. Take my 14-year-old brother as an example. He had worn thick glasses since he was 7 due to seeing too much cartoons. In addition, watching TV may distract children from studying when they are addticted to. For those who watch frequently, it is very hard to give up, so it is similar to a dependency such as alcoholism or another type of addiction. This may lead to adverse influences on students\u2019 educational outcomes.",
        "In conclusion, watching TV does more harm than good for children\u2019s development. Therefore, I firmly hold the view that it is definitely harmful when children are allowed to watch TV all the time."
