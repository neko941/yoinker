        "Sports are popular all over the world and professional sportsmen become heroes for many people, especially teenagers. They would like to emulate the way these stars dress, act and live their lives. Although many top athletes are good role models and responsible citizens, others are not deserving of their role model status.",
        "Besides being good for their health, young people are excited about sports because they admire their sportsmen whose characters help them to learn about valuable life lessons such as teamwork, goal setting, the reality of dealing with success and failure. Moreover, these personalities can make them understand the importance of working hard to achieve a goal or practicing regularly to become good at something. It can be said that this is a good example for the youth to follow their idol.",
        "However, it is undeniable that a few great athletes can make young people misunderstand   sportsmanship. For example, many top sportsmen reached a level of fame that makes them attract media attention or social attention  or even earn large financial benefits. As a result of this, teenagers love sports because they focus on  fame and wealth rather than on the fun of the games or on the challenge of learning how to play well. In addition, some sportsmen behave badly, including some cheat to win their competitors or taking drugs to improve their performance. Eventually, this kind of behaviour can send wrong messages to children.",
        "With all the above arguments, I think that young people can make an attempt to catch all the good figures of their favourite sportsmen but they should not try to repeat all of their idols\u2019 lives because every professor has good and bad characters. All  the people can agree that there is no  ideal person in the world."
