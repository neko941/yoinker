        "The importance and popularity of a successful life and career have grown over the past few years due to fast development in this planet. Experts throughout developed and developing worlds have debated what are the reasons behind those such cases and whether the impacts of this are positive or not. Both causes and effects will be examined in the following essay.",
        "On the one hand, there are three crucial reasons that why parents tend to force their children to be successful in life. The most important one is a high level of competition. The best example for this is that not only educates environment, but working environment also are highly competitive, as a result, the standard of nature has leveled up, especially school, food, extra class and extra activity. Consistent this line of thinking is technology development which accelerates the growth. An extensive study by renowned universities has illustrated that technology improvement facilitates people to easily access the valuable knowledge on the website, hence people tend to step further and faster than the past. Last but not least, comparison may be a main factor that drives the pressure from their parents. For instance, if a child's friend has a better grade or performance, then family will have a question to a child's performance and force them to study harder.",
        "On the other hand, although there are ample reasons of accelerating success in life, it multifold both negative and positive impacts cannot be denied. First and the foremost, on the beneficial side, the potential capability of the student would be noticeable and pull out. Therefore, the opportunity of being top of the hill must be higher. Conversely, the drawback that should be taken into consideration is too much pressure, which causes an increase stress level or even worse mental health problem in the long run. Lacking right is the final point due to the fact that some teenagers are forced to be doctors or lawyers, but, in reality, the teenagers' dream may be the singers or artists instead.",
        "To conclude from the aforementioned arguments, I strongly believe that its cons of pressure outweigh its pros. Personally, I highly recommend that family should respect the dream of your kids and keep giving certain suggestion."
