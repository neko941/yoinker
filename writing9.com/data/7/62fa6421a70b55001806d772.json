        "The first negative note that I should draw your attention to is that the driver was late about 10 minutes. I and my family were in front of the door and when he got to our location, I objected to why he was late. To make it worse, he responded in such an offensive way that my child burst into tears and I had to keep her calm till we got to the destination.",
        "Being late to get to the gates, We could hardly convince the flight team to accept our tickets because we were late. After that, I called the customer service office for several times and, ,unfortunately no one was responsible for my complaint. I also sent an email to explain what happened at that time and I recognized that the email service is outdated too.",
        "Having such problems, I would like to make an appointment with the company manager to know more about them. Perhaps I could make some suggestions for your team members ,especially the mentioned driver, I think it is useful to guide your personnel to take part in some interchange classes to get more about how to behave politely. I am looking forward to receiving from you soon.",
