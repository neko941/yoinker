        "In modern society, scientific research is mostly managed by the private sectors rather than the state. From my perspective, this is a positive development for various reasons.",
        "By taking the dominant responsibility for controlling major research projects, private companies can bring numerous benefits to the government as well as the research process itself. Due to the abundant financial resources of the private sectors, their involvement in this field eases the pressure on the state budget, which might increase government spending on others prioritizing public areas. Moreover, (since private firms tend to have a certain financial advantage over the state), scientific research carried out by private businesses is often facilitated by more advanced equipment and facilities. Take Space X, a private powerhouse in the field of space exploration for example. Scientists here are provided with state-of-the-art launch facilities along with a spacious area for flight tests.",
        "Moreover, the presence of private sectors in research activities is beneficial to the labour market. First of all, the involvement of various firms results in surging demand for hyper intelligent workforce. As working effectively in such challenging fields requires elite workers, companies tend to invest in headhunting by offering a wide range of incentive policies, thus generating more job opportunities and more diversified working environments. In terms of remuneration, private sectors often offer generous amounts of salary to attract excellent employees. Consequently, this tendency stimulates research students to pursue such demanding professions.",
        "In conclusion, I believe that scientific research projects implemented and sponsored by private-held companies rather than the government brings numerous advantages to the society and the projects themselves."
