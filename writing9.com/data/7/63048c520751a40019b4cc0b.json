        "In this modern era, the way of teaching has improved significantly. All the institutions have been changing their learning methods using new technologies such as computers. Some people think that the amount we pay for institutions should be used only to teach students using modern techniques. In contrast, others are of the opinion that hiring high-level teachers are better for improving students' knowledge levels. This essay will discuss both sides of the argument, and the viewpoint will be given in the following paragraphs.",
        "On the one hand, IT technology is dominating humans in all aspects. For this reason, most schools are installing new computers to use by children. Teaching kids to use the latest developed devices has many advantages. Firstly, by using computers, children will be given global exposure to the ongoing trends. More specifically, they would be capable of understanding the competition in the current world. Secondly, by using the internet, children can use materials that cannot be accessed directly.",
        "Almost all the necessary information is available on the internet, and most of them would be helpful to those with good knowledge of computer devices.",
        "On the other hand, teachers are considered  guides and mentors to the students. Unlike computers, human teachers can guide students through their hard times and are models for youngsters to learn and expand their skills and experiences. For instance, if a student had a problem with his exam, the teacher will explain the problem and help him solve the issue and not repeat it again. Thus, experienced and qualified teachers are always needed in teaching, and universities should first invest in recruiting teachers before computers.",
        "In conclusion, although the latest technologies are required for education, I firmly believe hiring well-educated teachers is the first method to improve students' knowledge levels. After having enough teachers, universities may spend some money to equip their rooms with educational devices."
