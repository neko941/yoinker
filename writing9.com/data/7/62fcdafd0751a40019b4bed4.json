        "Life is not a fairy tale and it is unavoidable that we usually have to deal with unsatisfactory situations including undesirable occupations or financial burdens. The majority of people say, \"You should be able to solve your own difficulties\". I, personally, think it is not always possible to solve problems or try to overcome them. And it is also acceptable to take a long time to learn how to accept it.",
        "First of all, if it is a solvable one, you tried to improve your own situation and successfully overcome it, congratulations. Leave behind your bad undesirable job, you will be able to open a new journey, and create the ability to find better jobs and workplaces which can comfort your financial needs. When you have the bravery to stand up and face your realistic nightmares, it can also provide you such a bunch of work experiences and life skills. On the other hand, a hopefully healthy work-life grants you happiness. According to some experiments, when people feel happy, their body creates a neuromodulatory molecule called \"dopamine\" that plays several important roles which include mental ill decrease and creating motivation for your brain.",
        "Secondly, if it is an unsolvable or uncomputable function, take time to learn how to accept and overcome it in your own way. Usually, it's hard, time-consuming, and frustrating but what really matters is the worth of your attempt. Last but not least, accept your situation and be happy with it to create a healthy lifestyle. For example, some unlucky ones with intense sickness are trying to live their own life.",
        "After all, it seems that there are always rainy days that beat our faces and we are not always able to solve it. What actually matters is individuals ought to face the reality, and try their best to change their life step by step with limits."
