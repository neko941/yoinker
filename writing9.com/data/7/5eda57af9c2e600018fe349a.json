        "There are people who believe's  that there is only one way to overcome the poverty that is with economic development, but there are others who think, instead of helping it is harming our environment and that should be put to a full stop. In this essay I would like to express my point of view and provide with suitable examples.",
        "Firstly, In our present generation every country wants to grow and develop. To achieve such target they develop new technology and new infrastructure and many new thing's and to make them we need many different resources. To full fill their objective they destroy  all the resources to achieve it. For instance, many tress is cut down to build new roads, high skyscrapers, which is overall affecting our environment and  even pollution, air for making electricity and using  the huge quantity of oil and other all raw resources.",
        "Secondly, We use this resources without even thinking twice, but he  forgets that they are in limited quantity. By using them in large quantity we harm our environment which later will affect us back. For example, due to high rate of wood cutting many animals lost their house and many of them are going instinct and as well as it affect our air, there will be not long when we won't have fresh air to breath and our planet will be doomed.",
        "To summarize, Economic development is essential, but we should not neglect and destroy our environment. If we are cutting down trees or using any resources we should also prevent them, for instance, if we use wood and we should plant them back as well to not affect our livelihood. For the other resources as they are scarce should be used in limited quantity or we should use alternative such as, solar power systems, so that we it will keep our air clean and also preserve our resources."
