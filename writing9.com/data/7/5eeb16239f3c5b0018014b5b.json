        "The population in most countries of the world is rising at an alarming rate, to accommodate this hike, new homes are being constructed. In my opinion, towns should be constructed in the countryside because this will help to generate new job Opportunities and the pollution growth in existing cities will be controlled.",
        "The first reason for this choice is it will open new doors for people. This is because building new towns in the surroundings will create job prospects for the people moving there mainly in the area of agriculture and construction. This will reduce unemployment, which is not possible if people move to cities as the populace is already facing unemployment. Besides this, people will find everything under one roof, like transportation, water, and other basic necessities this will discourage migrants to move to big cities. For example - Hoshangabad is the small town in Madhya Pradesh, however, there are huge industrial opportunities for people living in the area, workers from different cities travel to this small town for different purpose. Therefore, building new houses in the rural area will aid in bringing new jobs for the betterment of the people.",
        "",
        "The second main reason for building homes in the towns is less pollution and traffic congestion. Residing in a rural area has the advantage of commuting smaller distance which creates less pollution and saves time. Cities are facing high traffic congestion on roads during peak hours. As many people are not going to reside in small towns, there will be lesser movement and minimal air and noise abuse that consequently leads to decrease in health and mental issues. Therefore, people should choose to accommodate in towns",
        "In conclusion, an increase in population is inevitable.Therefore small towns should be constructed to generate employment opportunities and a better environment for residents, to live in a more sustainable area with reduced pollution and traffic problems"
