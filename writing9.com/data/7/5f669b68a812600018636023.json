        "These days people eat a lot of prepared meal instead of cooking at home. Some people think this is a bad idea because it is not healthful, but I do not agree with this point of view. There is a lot of healthful foodstuff choice available, ad they make it easier for busy people to eat instead of skipping meals.",
        "Not all prepared cuisine is bad for you. Some of it, of course, is high in sugar, fat, and salt. That is the kind of cuisine you will get if you make certain choices, such as eating at fast-food restaurants. But there are plenty of other options. Many restaurants serve fresh, healthfully prepared meals. Fresh and organic food is also available in grocery stores. Anybody who wants to eat deliciously, nutritious meals can do so, even people who buy prepared meals instead of eating at home.",
        "Prepared foodstuff can help people to eat more healthfully. Some people are just too busy to cook. These people could choose to skip meals, or they could choose to fill up on snacks such as potatoes chips and cookies. But if they buy a prepared meal from grocery stores or restaurants, then they are eating a complete meal. This is much better than eating snacks or, worse, nothing.",
        "Whether you cook your meals yourself or buy them already prepared, you have both healthful and unhealthful choices. The type of food you choose to eat is more important than whether or not you cook it yourself."
