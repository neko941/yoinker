        "Currently, in order to make a decent living, parents are compelled to work . For this reason, it is important to consider who can take care of children. People have two different opinions with respect to this topic. However, some people think that grandparents play important role in child upbringing, while others think that nursery school is the best choice. I agree with the idea of children must be taken care of by creche.",
        "On the one hand, it is argued that due to working parents  increasing in number, so as not to remain uncontrolled, children are taken care of by other family members, such as grandparents. It is obvious that relation between grandparents and grandsons is much stronger than with their parents. Additionally, it is irrefutable that being taken care of by grandparents enables children to learn their family traditions nearer. Such as together dinner",
        "On the other hand, I firmly believe that grandparents don't have adequate experience to look after children, even some of them are physically feeble and inactive, hence parents have sufficient reasons to put their children to the childcare centre. Actually, one of the main advantages of nursery school is that they have trained staff who have enough practical ability to grow a child. Furthermore, creche offers entertainment which comes interesting to children. Moreover, nursery schools give an opportunity to make social interaction with their peers which will help them to enhance their communication skills.",
        "To conclude, both of them are up to the parents and their financial condition. Although how much grandparents are safer for children, childcare centres have professional employees and also  be looked after by experts will be beneficial for them to adapt to society easily in the future."
