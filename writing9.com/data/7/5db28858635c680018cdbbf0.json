        "Nowadays, walking people do only out of the  necessity, not for fun. Obviously, there are many reasons for this and by adopting certain strategies this issue can be effectively tackled. This essay will discuss causes and solutions for this.",
        "First and foremost, since employees live away from their office there is no opportunities to either walk or cycle to work place. Additionally, due to sprawling subways and heavy traffics make it impossible to walk. Pedestrian path also witnessed heavy traffics. These days, many  people largely depend on cars because of its convenience and speed, sometimes, they become slaves of cars as well.  By contrast, if anyone tried to walk on these roads, they would meet accidents as these roads are not meant for both walking and cycling.",
        "However,  there are some measures could change this issue dramatically.  One possible method is that constructing more foot paths. Eventually, this encourages the public to walk, along with this, they  should be educated regarding incredible benefits of this. The government can channelize more public funds to these kinds of initiatives, which can have a long term advantages. Another obvious idea is that motivate tourist organizations to start more and more walking tour packs. Additionally,  the government can give some incentives to attract people to walk by providing, for instance, cycles, and running shoes.",
        "By way of conclusion, even though people of current generation walk minimally when compares with the older generation,  by implementing new initiatives this can be significantly improved. It is vital that walking to be  encouraged at  a very young at school levels."
