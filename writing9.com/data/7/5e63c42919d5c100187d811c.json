        "In today\u2019s world, the using of the national budget is a heated topic which is collecting many different opinions. Some people argue that the government should invest in the art while others think health and education are more important. In my perspective, health and training are a general demand of the majority of residents.",
        "To commence with, Arts is an important part of both nation and individual. To demonstrate, the art products such as pictures, photos or a song is a particular way to show a beautiful soul of a person, some of them also have the characters of the authors. Besides that, the piece of art is a place people send their emotions or record the special moments in their life. On the other hand, many nations receive a lot of advantages from the art. For example, a large part of art shows the traditions, the symbols or the beautiful places of a nation, then those are attracted. As a result, the image of the nation will be enhanced in the global stages and more and more tourists will visit that country which can increase the incomes of national budgets.",
        "However, while the art just satisfies a part of the society, health and education are the general demands of every resident in a nation. To begin with, Health is the main reason of the stability and the development of a country. For example, in this year the Corona virus is affecting many nations, they have a big problem with the epidemic, they also have to close customs boundaries which against them trade the products with other nations then leading a shock with their economy. Besides, education is the unforgetable factor, because the higher rate of resident who graduated higher education such as university or collage means the nation' illiterate rates is decline and more and more residents can build the nation effectively.",
        "In conclusion, I firmly believe that the national budgets should be invested in personal demand such as health and education more than the art."
