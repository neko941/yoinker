After some days left, a parcel is coming to my home . When i open the box and see the dress it was damaged.  Chaniyacholi is back side damaged and gown is a different colour. I am stuck.",
        "Next day i am going to your shop and tell all the damaged items your staff . One person his name is Suresh , he tall me that it's not a shopping field. I tell him that return my money or change this dress so they tell him it's not  to come our store policy.  It's a very rude person.",
