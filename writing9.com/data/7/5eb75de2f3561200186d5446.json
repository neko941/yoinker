        "Proper education and healthcare facilities are conceivably two determining factors for the overall development of a nation. Some think that the cost of education and health care should be borne by the government, while others suppose that it should be the citizens\u2019 responsibility. Both these schools of thought hold valid arguments, which will be discussed before drawing a conclusion.",
        "To commence with, providing all citizens the right to health insurance and education are essential for economic productivity. When individuals have exposure to affordable care services, they lead healthy lifestyles and miss work less, enabling them to contribute more to the economy. Related to schooling, free training ensures that people should have the ability to gain exposure to college and therefore increase the prospects of being employed. As a result, it is obvious that the state should bear for quality schooling and better health care systems since they are the best combination to power the national economy.",
        "However, rendering schooling and health care accessible for everyone is not feasible for the country since it would require a budget unendurable for the nation.  For example, in Vietnam, the allocation of capital from the national fund is being conducted on an average basis since the tight budget, so it does not create a competitive incentive to improve the quality. Therefore, several schools and hospitals should shift to financial autonomy, both reduce the pressure of capital spending and encourages corporate sectors to engage in critical social care,  thereby increasing the standard of service. In sum, citizens should support health care and education costs to reduce the pressure on the state budget.",
        "In conclusion, I agree that both health insurance and education are basic fundamental rights that are essential for every nation, and, therefore, the responsibility should lie with the government. Nevertheless, citizens should also coordinate with the state if they want to enhance health and training services."
