        "There have been conflicting views on whether governments should allocate more funding to offer sports facilities for top athletes or for ordinary citizens. Both arguments will be discussed in this essay, followed by my own opinion.",
        "People who consider spending more money on professional facilities for top professional sportsmen may hold the following views. Being provided with more training bases equipped with the lasted devices and technology can encourage those elite sportsmen to have better performance in international events such as Olympic Games and Football World Cup which are seen as ideal platforms to present a nation\u2019s unique strengths. With the exalting glory gained by the winners, a nation\u2019s status in the international arena would be raised, helping a country to stand more opportunities of bidding for some major international sports events. In such cases, the enormous economic value could be generated through ticket sales, accommodation, and visitor consumption.",
        "However, opponents of this way of thinking have their own opinion, which they can also easily justify. The funding allocated to the construction of these facilities is generated from tax-payers. This means it would be unfair for ordinary citizens to pay for something that they can barely gain any direct benefits from such as the training venues constructed only for those elite sportsmen. Furthermore, if governments lay more emphasis on sports facilities for normal residents, people could be encouraged to do exercise, enhancing their physical health and get more energetic and productive to work or study.",
        "In my view, it would be far more beneficial for governments to spend more money on proffering sports facilities to top athletes for the purpose of gaining huge economic profits and succeeding internationally."
