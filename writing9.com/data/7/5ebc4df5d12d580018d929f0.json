        "In this modern era, nowadays it has become highly common that people get all the news by internet rather than traditional methods such as reading newspaper which was probably the main way for people getting updates in the past. In my view, it is extremely likely that latest ways of getting updates will conquer the old methods such as newspapers.",
        "To begin, first of all, without a doubt newspapers has been very practical and useful especially in the olden days. However, some people are of the opinion, despite significant development in technological scopes, they think newspaper will remain as the main source of news because some people still like to flip newspapers pages. In other words, they are fans of having the news in their hands and it happens to be more pleasurable for them rather than scrolling a page with a touch screen. Additionally, the other positive aspect of getting updates by newspaper is that most of the time a newspaper comes with other supplements like crosswords and magazines. Furthermore, it has been said, some of people are not in touch with the latest technology such as internet. For instance, take elderly people as an example, most of them are not familiar with the usage of internet and all the technologies which are highly dealing with internet. Thus, they may prefer getting the latest new by newspapers.",
        "However, these days, the majority of people, especially youngsters, are the fan of getting news online since it is greatly accessible and most importantly reading news online is cost free for them. More than that, reading news online has other privileges such as you are free to choose your favourite topics and whenever they get updated you can set your notification alarm on, so you won't miss the latest news. And besides that, environmentalists are the biggest supporters of e-papers because it leads to fewer trees to be cut. Therefore, with regard to those facts, when media companies' administrators start to see a notable drop income, they will become aware of the fact publishing newspapers will have no profit for them and it is going to be such a waste for their companies, then they will be forced to come up with novel solutions and make money from news online.",
        "To sum up, nevertheless newspapers are still existed, though; they will gradually be replaced by modern ways of getting updates."
