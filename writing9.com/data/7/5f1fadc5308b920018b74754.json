        "Voluminous traffic in metropolitan cities is a common problem across countries. Rapid increase in the number of automobiles is leading to high traffic jams and congestion in urban areas. However, there are certain ways and measures that power can consider to solve this issue.",
        "There are several factors for the increase in traffic in urban areas. Firstly, overcrowded population in metro cities due to high job availability, and this leads to increase in usage of vehicles and automobiles. Secondly, there is no proper limitation for the use of personal vehicles such as cars and vans. For example, in city areas, each person in a family uses their own car for commuting and this increases the density of vehicle in busy roads and result to vehicle congestion. Thirdly, the lack of knowledge and awareness on following traffic rules. To illustrate, most of the people in metro areas, are trying to bypass the traffic signals, which would result in blocking the way of other vehicles.",
        "One effective solution to deal with traffic problem is that government should educate and encourage its citizens to use public transports. This will lead to decrease of vehicle density in roads. In parallel, government should also increase the count of public transport vehicles to provide frequent access and availability for people. An alternate solution is, programs about traffic awareness and driving tests can be conducted to reduce traffic snarl. For instance, Singapore government runs the frequent campaign for public regarding driving and traffic.",
        "In conclusion, increase in automobile usage in metropolitan areas and unawareness about traffic rules is leading to high traffic. And this can be controlled by enabling more public transports and awareness campaign by government for the people."
