        "Due to the human factor, the majority of species are dying out and becoming extinct leading to the loss of biodiversity.This essay will put forward some reasons for this trend and also suggest some feasible measures to address this problem.",
        "One of the ulterior motives for extinction is a change of natural habitats.In recent years ,because of modernization,many natural places are being destroyed by people.Instead of forests,a range of skyscrapers is being erected leaving no place for animals and birds to live.According to some statistics,due to  deforestation,a third of animal species died out in the last decade alone.Another factor in species dying out is pollution.Water pollution and exhaust fumes are killing millions of animals and birds.Because of pollution in the oceans,a wide range of animals including fish, whales and  dolphins are dying.More and more people and factories are throwing their waste into oceans not thinking of the consequences of their own actions.",
        "The most practical policy for the governments is to protect areas where animals,birds and insects can thrive in.They can enforce legal policies and punish those who break the law.Another way  to lessen the risk of animal extinction is to promote awareness among residents.The government should organize clubs and meetings on animal rights and aware people that the majority of species are at  risk of becoming extinct.",
        "By way of conclusion,I once again state that  pollution and taking away their natural habitats are major causes of loss of biodiversity.And we can alleviate this risk by protecting areas and promoting awareness among citizens."
