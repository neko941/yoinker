        "Dear Sir,",
        "I am writing to express my appreciation in regard to your decision to sponsor a local junior sports team or alternatively arrange two open-air concerts.",
        "Undoubtedly, sponsoring the local junior sports team will be advantageous for both the team and the business. What is important is that they will be fully equipped with all necessary training stuff, and it will enhance their chance to win competitions with a prize pool of up to 1 million dollars. Considering that your business will become more lucrative, your brand will also be promoted simultaneously.",
        "On the other hand, arranging two open-air concerts will also bring to people an immense pleasure and some bands would also get the chance to show their talents. It is extremely essential for our culture and legacy.",
        "I am completely confident that either of your initiatives will be beneficial for our society. However, I suppose that supporting the junior sports team will have a permanent result than organizing two open-air concerts with temporary effects. Emotions after concerts will be forgotten while the young sportsmen will become our pride at least for the next two years.",
        "Once again thank you for an excellent support.",
        "Yours faithfully,",
