In addition,  it has resulted in the collapse of firms.  Secondly,  another issue that needs to be considered is the termination  of victims' life after being swindled.

For instance,  anti-virus like Avast and others are capable of preventing  details pilfering  by  fraudsters. This will deter the antics of the perpetrators. Moreover ,  another way of resolving the situation  is for ordinary people  to browse reliable websites for activities . For example, users should be on the lookout for  suspicious web dealings , self-awareness will make them  fortify themselves against being cheated by  fraudsters and they can do so by limiting commercial deals to secured channels.",
        "Lastly, internet criminals have been a pain in the neck to citizens and their jobs. While  it has led to a deficit of capital and life of their victims.Henceforth, people should use appropriate protective  software applications and increase awareness about online activities."
