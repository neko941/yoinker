        "In many cities, residents are likely to stay near their neighbourhood for their entire lives . Many people might believe that they are more comfortable living close to their parents and their hometown. For instance, It is easier to take care of their parents, and also they are familiar with the route of transportation and location. In this essay, both advantages and disadvantages will be detailed in the following paragraphs:",
        "On one hand, living near their birthplaces will reduce their extra expenses for example accommodation and transportation. Most people who work near their hometown ,especially with their parents could help eliminate their rental fee; additionally, they can treat their parents better than living far away such as in a critical situation or accident when parents might need  urgent help.",
        "On the other hand, going abroad or moving to another town might add more pressure on individuals to be more adaptive and face challenges. From my own experience, to illustrate, I went for an internship at a research centre in Japan which  is a place with multinational culture; thus, it was a rough situation at that time to obtain new knowledge, and  live with new norms. Besides, living abroad also need to spend more than usual cause for example extra travel insurance, rental cars and train tickets .",
        "To conclude, residents who stay close to the area they were born in might benefit  in many aspects they can give more attention to their parents as they leave close together and they get used to those areas and travelling paths."
