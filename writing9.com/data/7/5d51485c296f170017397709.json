        "I am writing to request for time off from work for 20 days, as I am having Selenium certification exam for five days. It starts from December 15th to December 20th and I need 15 days of study time. Therefore, I need leave from December 1st to December 20th.",
        "As you are aware of my Selenium certification exam, I am done with the training and at the end of the course I am having five days of exam to assess the level of automation knowledge. Based on this assessment, the board will award the proficiency certificate. In order to attend this exam, I need 20 days leave from the work.",
        "In upcoming days whenever there is a public holiday, I will make sure to work on those days in order to compensate the leaves which I will be taking now and complete the pending work.  Furthermore, if I am not able to complete the assigned work even after working on public holidays, I assure you to work on weekends too.",
        "I would like to add to that, selenium certification will not only help me it also helps the project as we are extensively working on building the selenium frameworks. Moreover, once I am certified I shall help the other team members to improve their technical expertise in this area which in turn will help the project work to complete on time with 100% efficiency.",
