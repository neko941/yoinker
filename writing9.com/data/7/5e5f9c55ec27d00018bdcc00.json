        "Formal training at the universities have become an integral part of any society. Even though, a few individuals think that the universities are creating more graduates than required and that the importance given for the formal university learning needs to be lowered, others believe that formal training forms a really important part in any society. In this essay, I will discuss the significance of university education for students.",
        "Although the university education is important for everyone, there are limitations on the benefits provided. Firstly, it prepares students for the outside world as job seekers rather than job providers. For example, it is widely known that the majority of professional courses prepares the pupils to take up jobs in their respective fields, rather than enabling them to start up their own career path. Secondly, it provides uniform curriculum to all the individuals irrespective of their interests, which would result in certain students cramming up the subjects for the sake of scoring high for the university exams and not for the love of learning it. Above all, universities recently have been busy churning out graduates at a rapid rate that the supply of talented graduates currently far exceed the demand, which in turn has resulted in many graduates remaining unemployed.",
        "On the other hand, there are many other factors that plays a bigger part in any individual's life other than university education. Employability is one of the biggest factor that concerns the market, which at times, is attained by the public themselves rather through a formal training. Additionally, the stress needs to be placed upon developing the practical skills of an individual and not just their theoretical knowledge. For instance, it is an accepted matter that many tutees attend vocational college after graduation in order to attain hands-on training experience in their field. Moreover, it goes by the proverb that formal education will make us a living and self-education will make us a fortune. To exemplify, we have a lot of cases with thousands of billionaires who never went to college, but ended up being much more successful than their counterparts.",
        "To conclude, there are much more important factors that play a crucial role in determining the success of any individual than their university education, even though it plays a big part. Further, with advances in technology, self-education is expected to come up in a bigger way."
