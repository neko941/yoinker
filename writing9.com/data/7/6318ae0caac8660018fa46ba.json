        "In this contemporary era, the internet has become the main part of everyone's life. Some amount of people believe that they can learn and search for a lot of things related to various types of cultures and life on the internet without exploration to other countries. I firmly disagree with this notion. In the following paragraphs, I will discuss my view.",
        "There are a number of reasons to learn about cultures and traditions by travelling to a country. First and foremost  we can know the real and exact circumstances being travel to the country. After visiting different nations we can see their culture, traditions, beliefs, clothing, their past history from the older adults who have exact knowledge of life experiences that they can not learn from the internet. To illustrate this, many things can not experience on the internet such as people's nature, talking with them and so on. Thus, visiting a country is the best to learn about different cultures.",
        "Secondly, the internet provides only theoretical knowledge. Practical knowledge is far better than theoretical knowledge. A person can grasp and retain practical things easier than  written material. While travelling to the country, people can see and learn many things related to culture and traditions and by ,experience they never forget these things. For example, Doctors can not perform surgery on patients on the basis of theoretical knowledge. However, it is only possible with practical knowledge and life experiences. Therefore, experienced things have a long impact on a person's mind.",
        "To conclude this, although there is a plethora of knowledge we can seek from the internet however to learn and know about the cultures and other exact things yet people have to visit the places."
