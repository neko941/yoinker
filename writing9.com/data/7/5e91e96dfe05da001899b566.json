        "Nowadays, countries, these  days  have  cities  with  people  from  different  parts  of  the world.  People  from  different  cultural  backgrounds  follow  their  respective  traditions. With  such  versatile  cultures, it  is  possible  for  one  cultural  group  to  offend  another group  of  people  that  have  a  completely  different  perspective  of  their  own.  This raises  the  question  of  how  the  government  can  assert  harmony  amongst  these people.  Harmony  might  be  ensured  by  declaring  public  holidays  for important religious days and creating public societies for different ethnicities.",
        "Declaring public holidays for auspicious religious days such as Hari Raya, Deepavali, and a Christmas show respect to religions and their practices. For example, Singapore is  a  country  that consists of  a  majority  of  people  from  three  ethnicities,  namely Indian,  Chinese  and  Malay.  Public  holidays  are  declared  for  most  of  the  auspicious day that is celebrated by these ethnicities. This demonstrates the government\u2019s interest in their well-being and brings joy and harmony to the people.",
        "Most  cities  have  public  societies  of  multiple  religions  where  people  from  their respective backgrounds get together, organize activities and celebrate their religion. People  join  these  societies  to  remind  themselves  of  their  religious  practices  while being  away  from  their  country.  Governments  can  promote  the  formation of  such societies for the people.For instance, India is home to more than thirty religions, therefore there are religious societies in many cities where families meet together.",
        "In conclusion,   to   invoke   peace   and   tranquility  amongst   people   from   different backgrounds,  the  motto  of  unity  in  diversity  is  most  helpful,  since  if  individuals  are respected  of  their  cultural  and  traditional  backgrounds,  they  will  welcome  other people in their lives, and thus live in peacefully."
