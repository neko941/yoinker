        "These days, a growing number of customers participate in the online marketplaces. Whether this issue influences on the environment and some types of recent occupations have aroused people\u2019s discussion. This essay is going to present why the advantages of this trend might outweigh the disadvantages.",
        "On the first side, online shopping has some detrimental implications to the environment as well as the employment patterns. Understandably, the rubbishes from thick covers and the emission from delivery vehicles are the two biggest problems of electronic shopping. The further destination, the thicker the wrapper. Moreover, the greenhouse gases from shipping process may cause air pollution. On top of that, cyber shopping management systems just require fewer employees than directly purchasing. Due to cutting down in the labour force, many people, such as security guards, clerks and marketers, are in unemployment- state. This will have the greatest impact on longtime workers - who are less likely to seek another job.",
        "On the other side, it is true that some compelling merits can overshadow the drawbacks. First, since large shopping malls with air-conditioning and advanced facilities are not crucial for online stores, a great deal of fuel can be saved for other needs. Second, thanks to the appearance of online shopping, a series of new employment opportunities are available, such as online grocery personal shoppers, delivery drivers and web designers. As a result, young- workforce can take a host of perks from this.",
        "In conclusion, online shopping may bring both positive and negative impact on the environment and work patterns. The government should release some policies to control this type of purchasing so that people can reduce the drawbacks of this trend."
