        "In some countries nowadays, parents face a dilemma to make a decision about their children`s education. Some hold the view that studying in a homogenous setting will have pitfalls in students` future professional and personal life. I completely agree with that belief.",
        "One of the main reasons why single-gender institutions are still considered as an effective option for some parents is causing less distraction during the lesson. At some stages of life, especially in teenage period, the young are trying to attract the members of the opposite gender. In the learning process, this sometimes ends up showing low participation and difficulties to concentrate. Another reason is that parents sometimes find separate schools for boys and girls much safer places. As there are fewer chances for contradictions which lead to bad behaviour in this kind of academies. In other words, children studying in homogenous schools have less discipline issues.",
        "On the other hand, some detrimental effects of exclusive schools for boys and girls are supposed to be seen in other spheres of the learners` life. In the society, people have to contact and communicate with a number of people from the opposite gender. If they grow up without interacting with both of the sexes, they will encounter a lot of problems in terms of communication in a workplace, at home, university or office. Furthermore, it is proved that men`s and women`s brains work differently that can be effective while learning. They can share different perspectives with each other and build the skills of cooperation.",
        "In conclusion, our modern world requires strong communication skills that single-sex institutions cannot provide. In my opinion, some challenges in mixed-sex academies can be handled with proper guidance."
