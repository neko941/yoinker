        "There are many ways to show our concerns for the loved ones. While some are in favour of sending specially chosen items, others prefer spiritual measures to show their love.",
        "The benefits of giving gifts are apparent. For one, it is an effective way to express how much we care about them because the presents we choose are usually useful and desired. For example, I once gave a necklace to my mother, which she had decided not to buy for the high price. I could feel her happiness when she opened the box. Also, the gifts will be reminders of the love we share even years after, which can unite us with our friends or family members for a long time. Furthermore, it can boost the economy and be helpful for the retailing industry.",
        "On the other hand, gifts can be expensive and not easily affordable, and it sometimes imposes burden for senders to buy really valuable things. As a result, it can save a large amount of money to celebrate the relations in more intangible, hearty ways. Companion, for instance, is an amazing way to tell others we love and care for them, which is often overlooked. In modern society, we seem to be so busy that we have no spare time to just sit around and talk with each other regularly.",
        "In conclusion, people have their freedom to choose the right way for them to improve their relationships with friends and family. However, I truly believe that we should not shower our loved ones with expensive presents, but instead, we should spend more time together."
