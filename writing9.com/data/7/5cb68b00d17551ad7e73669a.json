        "In the years following the introduction of Facebook, there have been many changes in our society and community, some good and some bad. In my view, I believe that while there have been some negative impacts from social networking sites, the positives far outweigh the negative impacts.",
        "One of the major advantage of social networking sites for individuals and society is that communication with one another is easy and instant regardless of the geographical location. We can instantly speak with someone on the other side of the world and get a response just as fast. Additionally, now, more than ever, we can keep up with real time news and information discovery unlike 20 years ago when we solely relied on newspapers and news telecast on televisions to know what is happening around the globe. Furthermore, social networking sites also act as a low cost marketing platform for small, medium enterprises. Many business owners in the society out there depend solely on social networking sites able to sell and promote their products. They would not be able to operate without it. There is also the added benefit of social networking sites being fun and enjoyable for individuals to use.",
        "However, there are some adverse impacts of social networking sites individuals and society. Concerning individuals, it is easy to be too preoccupied with the usage of social networking sites such that offline interactions are disregarded. For example, some people would rather stay in and browse on social networking sites instead of taking part in events with family, friends or local community. This in return would also adversely affect society as people in the local community are no longer forging close and supporting relationships as before. Moreover, society as a whole is also becoming increasingly disjointed and fragmented as people spend more time online with people they have never met face to face and who they are unlikely to ever meet in the future. Another negative impact is that usage of social networking site promotes sedentary lifestyle in the society as people these days are spending more time indoor than ever, with eyes glued to their screens.",
        "To conclude, social networking sites have impacted individuals and society in both negative and positive ways. It is important to manage the usage of social networking sites such that the negative impacts can be minimised."
