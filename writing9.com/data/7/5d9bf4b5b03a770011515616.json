        "It is argued that the architectural pattern of new buildings should be the same as that of the old one in local areas, while others believe that individuals should be free to design their own house the way they prefer. I personally agree with the second group.",
        "On the one hand, the primary reason why people think that modern constructions should follow the style of the old ones in local areas is that it helps preserve traditional and cultural values, which could boost tourism in that area. Take Hoi An, which is one of the most famous ancient city in Vietnam, as an example. Local people in this city are encouraged to preserve their old houses or construct new houses in traditional architectural styles. As a result, Hoi An has become a popular tourist destination that attracts millions or tourists. That is the reason why ancient style is advantageous as it preserves the tradition of that area.",
        "On the other hand, I would argue that people should have the right to make their own decisions when it comes to building their own house. Firstly, many people do not like the style of old buildings in their neighbourhood. So, their rights would be violated if they were forced to stay in an accommodation that they do not feel comfortable about the design. The second reason is about the costs. It would be much cheaper to build a modern,  simple residence in terms of their owner\u2019s references rather than one, which has complex architecture.  Therefore, it seems to me that the freedom to build a new house is better due to its comfortability and money-saving.",
        "In conclusion, although some people say that the design and construction of modern and traditional buildings should be the same, I strongly believe that the owners should be allowed to choose the way their own houses will be built."
