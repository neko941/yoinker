        "Dear Mr. Gilbert,",
        "I received your letter in my mailbox yesterday. I regret to know that the noise of the drilling machine that has been coming from my apartment since the last two days has been disturbing you. You have mentioned that the noise disrupts your afternoon nap, as it typically begins from 1pm and goes on upto 4pm.",
        "I shall explain to you the incident that occurred. Some furniture at my apartment got damaged about a week ago. After some research on the internet, I got in touch with a contractor who agreed to mend the broken furniture, as well as beatify the interiors of my home. He & his team visit my apartment each afternoon to work on the d\u00e9cor. The drilling noise in the afternoon is due to their in-progress repair work, that shall be completed by early next week.",
        "However, beginning today, I shall ask the contractor & his team to reschedule their work time to morning or evening hours to minimalize the inconvenience caused to you. I hope this will resolve the issue of disturbed afternoon rest you are currently facing. I sincerely appreciate our co-operation and patience in this matter and would again apologize for the inconvenience previously caused.",
