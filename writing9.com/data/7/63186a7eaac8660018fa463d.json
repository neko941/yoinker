        "With the rapid growth of technology,  the world has come a long way . The computer has become  an integral part of our life.  We can't imagine  a day without computers or smartphones.  One of the most conspicuous trends in  today's world is a colossal upsurge in the number of people believing that virtual games are bad for juveniles.  The assertion  seems pretty controversial across the globe.  Without any doubt,  society is divided  into two groups as per the distinct mindsets of different folks.  A fair amount of people agreed with the statement while others claim that online games are beneficial  for children's  mental development.  Whether to agree or not it's a tough-provoking question.  In upcoming paragraphs, I will not only shed light on  both sides but also elaborate on my point of view Rega this issue.",
        "To embark , if we have a deep look at the topic then we will certainly be able  to find a fair number of reasons  why people  believe  virtual games are good for kids' development.  The first and foremost  reason  behind  this is computer games help kids to become  competitive. It helps them to grow and introduced them to the latest technologies . They  compete with  people  across  the globe which help them to understand  the competition  . Secondly,  they can meet new people through  the gaming apps which help them to know about other cultures and traditions.  In addition,  children will be in safe hands. For example,  children will play video  games at home as a result  they can't get in touch  with bad influences.  Last but not least , gaming become an integral part of our society  . So many people  choose their careers based on gaming  . It's  a very interesting  way to earn money . They can earn money while streaming.  For instance , there are so many esports companies that organize gaming events where people  all around the world participate  and win prizes . It's a fun way to earn money  .",
        "On the paradoxical  side, a school of individuals  believe that e-games are dangerous for  kids. There are a plethora of reasons  why people  think this way. firstly,  it makes children antisocial.  Kids play games for hours while setting in front  of the computer  screen.  They don't interact with their family members or friends.  This weakens their bonds. Secondly,  due to online games, and challenges they become aggressive  and violent.  Furthermore,  playing  alone video  games  can cause health  problems  such as obesity,  back pain,  low eyesight  and many more . For instance,  nowadays  children  prefer  to play games on mobile  or computer . They hardly  play any physical  games as a result  in the present  scenario children have more obesity  cases Than past .",
        "In conclusion,  Rhee is no denying  the fact that games have some demerits but for some good ,reasons it's more justified to agree with the statement that computer games  are beneficial  for children's mental health  ."
