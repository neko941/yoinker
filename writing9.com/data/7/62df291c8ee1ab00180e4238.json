        "Nowadays robots are used in different aspects. and many manufacturers and companies are using them instead of humans. by this concept robots and intelligent machines will become more important in our life. In ,fact in most of the industry and services robots are working more and more with better achievements in comparison with people.",
        "Industrial countries are using different kinds of intelligent machinery for many reasons. Firstly, in order to improve their profit and doing more quick with robots. as a matter of ,fact robots are  faster than a muscle, Then by using each robots the performance will be more. for ,example vaccine production lines are working by robots, if we want use  people ling time need to produce enough medicine or vaccine for covid then robots could support us for quick action. Secondly,  robots don't need any salary and don't have many rights like humans. moreover robots could do with fewer mistakes and higher performance for some kinds of jobs  regularly.  Then it would be a good reason for leaders of companies in order to increase the number of robots in their organisation.",
        "On the other hand, the cost of each robot in comparison with its performance becomes less day by day. then more company is looking to have some of them. For ,instance car factories are using robots for production, and the cost of each car is lower and it could help  all the society for purchasing a safe vehicle. however they fill full many job positions but on the other ,hand many advantages make for all the society, such as reducing the consumer prices for a variety of products and services. also the quality of products will be  higher than before.",
        "In ,conclusion I would mention that development in all aspects needs new tools. and intelligent machinery is one of the most important ones.then it would be nice for the leaders to predict the situation and prepare a suitable context for their increase in robots use."
