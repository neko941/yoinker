        "Naturally, we as humans, cannot live without our precious friends. Friendship is mostly a lifelong relation between people. It considered to be not only an exceptional relationship between individuals, but also it sometimes seems sophisticated. While many may have great soulmates with kind features, they nearly lose them due to dishonesty or even being moved to remote areas.",
        "The personal characteristics always shape our relations with others. A noble friend should be honest and respectful. If one needs some kind of support in a particular circumstance, he directly thinks of his close friend for guidance and advice. Additionally, true friends often share special moments, either happy or hard times, with their companions. Such distinctive relationship does not appear suddenly, instead, it usually takes years to be framed properly. It can be said that friends are almost our second family like parents and siblings.",
        "However, there are some cases, may be not frequently occurred, that such connection could be broken. When someone behaves in an unethical manner or does not tell the truth in serious situations, he can be considered as a dishonest person from his friend's view, which in turn may weaken such connection between them. Furthermore, other reasons like relocation to remote areas or immigration to another country could play a role in reducing periodic communication among friends.",
        "In conclusion, friends are our life partners who we cannot live normally without being surrounded by them. Real friends are fortune for us so that we should keep this relation healthy over time."
