        "It is evident that there are various issues faced in today\u2019s world that causes unhappiness. Then what makes us happy in this community? Some people believe that there should only be a small difference in earnings between the rich and poor for many to be satisfied. Yet, in order to ensure happiness in the society, we too, need to consider other factors such as racial discrimination and the importance of facilities the government provides in the country. To say that enabling a small difference in earns between the rich and poor is true, however, I strongly agree to a certain extent.",
        "Bridging the gaps between the rich and the poor is vital in every country. To exemplify, it is often seen that in the middle eastern part of the world, there is a vast difference between the rich and the poor. The wealthy are able to afford the best dishes, whereas the unfortunate do not have the luxury to spend lavishly and are only able to scrimp and save from the little earnings they have. This undoubtedly results in dissatisfaction in the citizens, leading them to resort to crimes such as stealing to feed themselves. Therefore, in order to produce a happier home where the rich and the poor can co-exist together, one's economic success is crucial. But, this is not the only matter we must note.",
        "Many countries lack basic healthcare equipment, food and water. Without all the necessities, how would one live in peace knowing that they have to live in hunger again? The Yemen crisis can be taken as an example. Citizens are living in poverty, and yet it is disheartening to hear about the government not taking any action to improve the conditions many are facing. With the aid of funds, there is a possibility that the situation in the country can be changed, creating a happier community. Hence, only when people can meet their fundamental requirements sufficiently and have some means of entertainment and relaxation, they can claim they are happy.",
        "Furthermore, it is commonly heard that racism still exists in our midst. For instance, Singapore. On the surface, Singaporeans seem to live peacefully, accepting the cultural backgrounds of different races. As a Singaporean myself, although it is clear that we live in a democratic society where regardless of race everyone is treated equally, is it true that we are practicing what we believe in? There have been many comments on racial and religion discrimination found on the internet from Singaporeans involving job opportunities. Thus, by educating ourselves to do away with any stereotypes we have and giving equal chances to all, we can then possibly achieve a harmonious community.",
        "To conclude from the aforementioned points, it is critical to close the income gap between the rich and poor. After all, we must not forget that there are other needs that ought to be addressed and to achieve a better and happy society."
