        "Some people are of the opinion that it is important to invest in exploration about space as there may be a scenario that we may need to live on other planets. This essay agrees that it is necessary to spend money on investigation about space.  Discovery of water on Mars along with the research data from other planets is indicative that they may be able to support life and all such activities need a lot of funding.",
        "Astronomical data from Mars proves it has water which has led scientists to believe that there may be a possibility that life either existed on that planet or the planet may be favourable to supporting humans. A lot of research is being done on this subject with different countries sending their space shuttles to see who is able to discover this first. Apart from Mars, several other planets are being researched for traces of life or the faintest possible scenario that may be able to support life.",
        "All this research on space obviously is very expensive as it involves a lot of equipment, fuel , machinery and not to forget, experienced astronauts and researchers. In addition, it involves a lot of experiments and test runs which also consumes time and needs finances.",
        "In conclusion, keeping in mind that there may be a time in future where we may need to live on other planets, I definitely agree that we need to spend money on research about space. We have evidence that there may be life on other planets and all this needs money."
