        "Many parents are approving their children to go abroad as a part of educational trips to learn new things. I personally think the initiative has more advantages than disadvantages. Firstly, the benefits of the trips will be discussed, followed by the drawbacks of them.",
        "",
        "Basically, at present most of the parents want their children to travel abroad to gather knowledge. Obviously, it is true that visiting new places is helpful for the children to widen their mind. Also, they can know about the culture & etiquette of different communities through the trips. Because of that, they will be able to get the idea that how diverse this world is. For example, when I travelled to India during my childhood, I came to know about the cultural activities of the Indian tribes which helped me to learn their way of life.",
        "",
        "On the other side, going to trips frequently for children can be harmful in some aspects as well. The mind of infants is very soft & sensitive, Therefore, whenever they acquire knowledge about a particular thing, that permanently gets fixed in their mind. That can be detrimental to their mind which might affect to nurture them. Sometimes, they can experience the violent side of the culture or lifestyle of another community. Later, they might practice those activities in their life resulting in the moral atrophy of them. That's why in some cases, such an initiative can cause harm to them in the long run.",
        "",
        "To conclude, it is inevitable that taking children on abroad trips can bring negative impact on them. Still, the positive sides of this approach simply outshine the harmful sides of it."
