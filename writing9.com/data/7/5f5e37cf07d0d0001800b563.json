        "It is argued that the younger generation should extend the traditions of their society. In my opinion, however, people aged 20 to 30 should be able to behave freely by their own rights",
        "On the one hand, There are several understandable reasons why some people subscribe to the idea that young people need to obey the traditions of their country. The first cause is that the younger generation forgot the customs and traditions which are extremely plentiful in their nation in order to adapt to Western ideals. Because they think that what the West does is right and everyone should conform to it. Take Vietnam's youth as a telling example for this, they believed that the country's centuries-old traditions are outdated and prevented modern society's development. Additionally, Adapting to traditions is an effective way to promote relationships between numbers in the family. For instance, family numbers could together organize and engage in traditional festivals every year. As a consequence, people become more loving and connected",
        "On the other hand, I am more convinced that young people need to be treated with freedom. To begin with, comfortable performing is a great way to blend into the world. Because they easily learn different traditions from a plethora of countries, resulting in expanding knowledge and being welcome when they are exposed to a new country. Furthermore, free behaviour helps the younger generation feel comfortable and pleasant. Thus, it is a great way to stimulate their creativity and their imagination, acting as a contributor to creating a myriad of new things. Take Japan as a telling example, numerous students who follow higher education have explored innumerable technology equipment by searching freedom and learning from international websites and worldwide friends",
        "In conclusion, some people believe that people aged 20 to 30 need to conform to their country' s traditions. But, I advocate the idea that the younger generation should be free to treat"
