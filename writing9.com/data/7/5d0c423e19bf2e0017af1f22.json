        "There seems to be a common belief among people that anyone's achievement in adulthood is due to their upbringing and parents' influence. Even though I have to agree to some extent, at the same time, it is also undeniable that every individual paves their own path and deserves to be merited according to their efforts.",
        "On the one hand, children spend the majority of their childhood in the company of their parents and, thus, the imprint they leave is of extreme importance. In other words, parents educate and discipline their children from the very beginning of their lives, and if they implement proper motivational techniques and develop their imagination through various methods, this would surely develop commendable qualities in every young individual. A case in point is all political dynasties, such as the Kennedy's and Clintons, where children's enthusiasm for politics was boosted from birth, contributing to their future success as adults. This is why it would be unreasonable to undermine the influence parents can have on their offsprings' positive career outcomes.",
        "Nonetheless, having been properly raised and given the necessary foundation can only be some of the factors for individuals triumph as adults. This is because, as children grow up, their uniqueness grows with them, and over time, they develop a set of skills based solely on their individual abilities. It is then when their parent's imprints start to fade, and they go on their separate path, based on their merits. An excellent example of this is Marc Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, whose parents tried to involve him in their family's dental practice ever since he was a child, but never succeed because the IT sector was what he was truly good at, and where he thrived. Therefore, parents impact cannot be regarded as the key factor for individuals professional triumph.",
        "In conclusion, although it is acceptable to believe that one's success is deeply affected by a parent's way of upbringing, an individual's inner abilities cannot be disregarded as unimportant."
