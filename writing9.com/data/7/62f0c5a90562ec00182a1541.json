        "It is believed that keeping a particular job early in life brings more career satisfaction than regular job hopping. While there are some benefits to switching jobs, I maintain that remaining on a job is likely to provide people with greater fulfilment.",
        "On the one hand, career switching does some wonders for people. The first reason is that people have the opportunity to work in different fields and thus acquire more skills by changing from one job to another. In addition to that, job-hoppers always need to accommodate themselves with a new environment, new co-workers and new workflow, and it results in their flexibility and ability to solve problems well in almost any situation. Second, people who change jobs more often and experience various working environments may manage to find a potential job that matches their passion and interests.",
        "On the other hand, staying with the same job for a long period stands a chance of promotion and rising salaries. Because if people sharpen their skills and undergo plenty of challenging tasks after years, they will have much experience to be more likely to move up the ladder and earn a lucrative living. Furthermore, people remaining on a career path for an extended period of time are put under less pressure. As they only focus on the development of one field and already become familiar with their workplace and colleagues, therefore, they can get little depression and achieve work-life balance.",
        "To sum up, I believe that early pursuing and continuing with one career choice is likely to give a sense of security, and hence brings more satisfaction in life, though changing jobs can be somehow beneficial to some people."
