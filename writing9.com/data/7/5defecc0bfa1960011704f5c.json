        "The request for English language test has increased because of its various needs like education, migration and employment. The IELTS for instance, is done on computers. This essay will explain why the advantages of an online testing outweighs the disadvantages.",
        "Firstly, one of the advantages of taking the web English test is because of its convenience. Although, the demand of experience workers with good communication in some foreign countries is high and may require some people to have several tryouts before they get a desire score. For instance, those interested in migrating to Canada will need at least an eight band in all four subjects before they are qualified. On the other hand, it can be time conscious. This will enable the student to fast track before the examination period elapse. For example, during the writing task 2 it is required to keep to the clock.",
        "Secondly, the disadvantage can be alarming. System virus can affect assessment that can lead to loss of data. Information can be easily wiped off if affected by malware this can be disastrous, especially when analysis scores are not saved. This can lead to lack of trust on the examining body. Another demerit is the strain the screen resolution can cause to the eyes. A sample is those that have suffered from the constrain and will not like to take chances to furthermore damage.",
        "Conclusively, the pitfall can be discouraging, but the good side goes a long way in various conditions. In my opinion, the merits supersede the troubles because, the trials are only for a specific term that may not lead to any major difficulty."
