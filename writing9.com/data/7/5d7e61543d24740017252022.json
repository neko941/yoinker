        "Some people claim that some people are naturally endowed with gifts, while others are not. Also, some people are of the opinion that any child could be trained be good at these activities. Personally, I believe that with hard work and determination, irrespective of one's talent, any child could learn to be good at playing some musical instrument or playing sports.",
        "On one hand, some people believe that talent is inborn. One of the reasons for this line of thought could be because of their religious beliefs. In some religions, talents are thought to come naturally to specific children from a higher supernatural being. Another reason is because some children play musical instruments, and perform very well at sports at a high level which would not have been possible without some form of training. In addition, some children are more  physically fit than others, due to their natural build. For example, children who are tall, usually outperform shorter ones in the game of basketball.",
        "On the other hand, I believe that children could be taught to be good at music and become excellent in any sport. With consistency and hard work, children can even be better than children who are claimed to be naturally gifted. This is because a child's mind is still very keen on learning new things and can grasp new skills easily. Some of the world's best musicians and athletes were not naturally gifted when they were younger. For example, Christiano Ronaldo, who is one of the world's best footballers was not very talented when he was a child. He, however, got better and became the best due to rigorous training routines, dedication and hard work.",
        "In conclusion, while it is true that some children are naturally talented at music and sports, I however, feel that any child could be trained to become even better than children born with talent."
