        "Some people argue that punishment is necessary to help children to learn right from wrong at an early age. I totally disagree with this statement, here are my opinions about this topic",
        "First of all, punishment can not guarantee the effect of educating children on what is acceptable or unacceptable for them. To be specific, kids in their childhood might be opposite with the method of education which is robust and simple,  resulting in side effects in their grown-up. My opinion is that parents and teachers should be role models for youngsters rather than teaching them with solid punishment. Therefore, punishment should be reduced even districted in the family and school education.",
        "Another critical drawback of punishment in educating young children is that it may destroy the relationship between educators with kids. For instance, a kid may suffer mental or physical disease from punishment and further cause a serious issue in their life, which is definitely what we don't want to achieve. Instead, the youth should be taught with encouragement and support. Research has shown that people tend to be more creative and energetic if they were brought up in a loving and caring atmosphere. Punishment is such a negative teaching theory that parents should not regard it as a normal trick in engaging with their kids.",
        "To make a conclusion, punishment to help young children to tell right from wrong is unnecessary in teaching kids. Parents and teachers can choose to be children's role models, encouraging them and making kids  more confident with their ability to judge."
