        "Education is a weapon by which we can win the world. Education plays an important role in everyone's development. Therefore, parents want that a good education is provided to their children and help them in their future. Parents choose between state run and private schools which is best for their own characteristics.",
        "To begin with, most of the parents choose the state run school because they think that our children can get better facilities there like scholarship, free books and etcetera. Many students get scholarship due to their great performance and now they are studying in abroad. Moreover, state run schools accept all types of students. In these schools, children can get admission without any entrance test. Many state competitions are organised by these schools so students can get a chance to play at the state level.",
        "On the other hand, other parents think that private schools are best because they provide so many facilities like English medium, activities like, music, arts and etcetera. In private school rules and discipline is more strict than government schools. Moreover, in private school students get the admission by  test. They are  selected on the base of their test. By this students know about their ability and gain self confidence. Furthermore, private schools provide computer and science labs to help students in their study.",
        "In the conclusion, both schools have their own importance. However, state run schools are more economic than private schools. So everyone can not afford private schools. For them state run schools are best."
