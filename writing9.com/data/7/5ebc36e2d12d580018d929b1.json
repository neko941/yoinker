        "In modern days, there has been a higher percentage of people who consider shopping as a hobby than being a chore. Although, I believe that this can be enjoyable in some aspects, I personally believe that the drawbacks of this change are more significant.",
        "On the one hand, I accept that shopping for pleasure might be beneficial in some aspects. First of all, it raises the demands for products which leads to a more competitive market. As a result, the producers have no choice than improving the quality of their product in order to survive their business. This can be helpful in developing the overall growth of economy through time. Apart from these, many researches have proved that shopping can be effective as a factor to dilute the stress level in every individual's life. For instance, a recent survey by Yale university which was revealed in 2019, had shown that the people who go shopping as an entertainment have shown lower levels of stress in panic situations.",
        "Despite the advantages mentioned above, I advocate the notion that the drawbacks of this trend are more important. Firstly, this tendency is prevalently increasing during recent years which means that it may become a habit or even an addiction through time. As a result, the rate of consumption will rise after a short while and that can lead to detrimental effects on environment. In other words, the more people buy items which are not necessary in their life, the more the pollution will be produced to refill new items on stores.",
        "In conclusion, although regarding shopping as a hobby has become more prevalent these days, I believe that the negative aspects of this change outweigh the positive ones."
