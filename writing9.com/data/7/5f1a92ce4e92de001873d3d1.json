        "Countries where social welfare schemes are properly implemented by the governments don\u2019t have high levels of homelessness or unemployment. In fact, when a country has a large number of homeless and unemployed people, it is a clear indication that something is wrong with the way it is governed. But can governments be held completely responsible for loss of jobs and homes? Let\u2019s examine.",
        "Both internal and external factors can have a significant effect on a nation\u2019s economy. A good state should be able to control the internal conflicts that might be causing joblessness and homelessness. However, no government in the world can effectively control external affairs. For example, a lot of people lost jobs due to the economic crisis in 2008. Although the recession was mainly in the US, its effect was felt all over the globe. In fact, the US recession caused job loss in countries like India and China. It affected India\u2019s booming outsourcing industry. And because it was an external factor, the governments in India or China couldn\u2019t do anything to ease its ramifications.",
        "Nonetheless, there are many things that governments can do to reduce the severity of these problems and protect their citizens. Most governments have enough money in their coffers to ensure basic amenities like food and shelter. Governments collect taxes from the wealthy people. If this money is effectively used it will significantly improve the living standards of the poorer sections of the society. If an authority fails to do it, it is either apathetic or inefficient.",
        "In India, for example, the ministry has launched several schemes to provide housing and employment to people. Although the country still faces these problems, the situation has considerably improved in recent years. This is a clear indication that political willpower and proper governance can improve the economic status of a country and its people.",
        "After analysing the situation, it is difficult to arrive at the conclusion that governments can be held completely responsible for problems like job loss and unemployment. Of course, the governments have a role to play in easing these problems, but factors outside the control of a law too can upset a nation\u2019s financial status."
