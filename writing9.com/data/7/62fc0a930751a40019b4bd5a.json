        "I am writing to you to recommend one of the members of our team, Jonathan, for the Best Employee award this year.",
        "I have studied the new criteria for nominations that the head office has recently published. Among the most important things, there are requirements for the minimal average code quality score, as well as for the feedback from all team members obtained during the cross review process to be perfect. There are many other secondary criteria too, but finally and most critically, it requires the nomination from the manager.",
        "So as you may know, Jonathan started working with us around eighteen months ago as a junior software developer. I was assigned to help him during his onboarding process. Since then, his progress has been extraordinary. He successfully qualifies for all the formal criteria related to the technology, and, as I recently learned, currently holds the highest ranking informal feedback grades in the whole team.",
        "Therefore, I believe that Jonathan is the best candidate and I am thrilled to ask you to officially nominate him for the Best Employee award.",
        "Best regards,",
