        "Being perfect has become a trend in the 21st century . People are obsessed with beautiful bodies and clear skin . With the rapid growth of , the technology world has come a long way . Cosmetic surgery become very easy to operate nowadays because of the technology . it's quite common to see a fair amount of people have plastic surgeries to get their dream face feature. This is quite a controversial topic across the globe . Whether to agree or not it's a tough-provoking question. As far as I can see it's more justified to say that it has negative development in  human society . In the upcoming ,paragraphs i will shed light on the issue and also elaborate on my point of view .",
        "If we have a deep look at the issue we will find numerous reasons why people go  through plastic surgeries . The first and foremost reason behind this people easily gets influenced by others' life . People choose to look like their idols who seems perfect to them . That's why people often get plastic surgery to more look like their role models. Another striking reason is people feel insecure about themselves . In today's world beauty standards are very high . perfect body shape and fair skin are more important than inner beauty . People often get bullied or discriminated against because of their looks that's why people like to get plastic surgery nowadays. Last but not least, in the past cosmetic surgeries were very expensive but now it becomes very cheap and available for everyone . For example , in Korea beauty standard is very high . Cosmetic surgery is very common in Korea . 6 out of 10  people in South Korea do nose jobs to look pretty they even do double eyelid surgery .",
        "On the paradoxical side, there are numerous side effects of cosmetic surgeries . Firstly , as  plastic surgery becomes affordable and available everywhere people go through many surgeries without consultation with a doctor . As  a result they face several health problems . Secondly , throughout the years , big lips become very trendy . So many people got liposuction without any thought about how it would look . As a result that looked horrible . To make it up they do more cosmetic surgery until they look like plastic dolls.  For example , the famous Michael Jackson was one of the victims of cosmetic surgeries.  He suffered a lot after going through multiple nose surgeries .",
        "In conclusion , cosmetic surgery become very popular no doubt. it is quite beneficial for some people who feel insecure about themselves . It gives them the confidence to face the world .but in my opinion , it is better to get cosmetic surgery as less as possible because it can cause us several health issues ."
