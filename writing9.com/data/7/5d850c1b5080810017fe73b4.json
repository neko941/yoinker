        "As you know, I had purchased some prize bond from my pocket money. Although I was not sure at the time of purchase, I will really win it. But, when I received a call from a bank representative that I had won the prize of amount one million dollars, my joy knew no bounds, and I thanked God for His mercy upon me.",
        "What is more important, because it is a huge amount, it should be spent wisely. So I\u2019m planning that I'll divide this money into chunks, and donate a handsome amount for charity to an organization which is located. I'll also pay my university fees for the remaining semesters.",
        "I\u2019d like to invite you this weekend to be a part of my happiness. I\u2019m planning to throw a party at a five-star restaurant to celebrate this great news. If you are not available this weekend, I will shift this event to the next date for your convenience.",
