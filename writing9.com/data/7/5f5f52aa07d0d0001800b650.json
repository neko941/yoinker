        "I am writing concerning your difficulties with the latest release of navigation maps. As you know, I was preparing maps for Garmin devices over the course of 3 years. That is why I am completely aware ofwhat kind of problem may occur during compilation and how to tackle them.",
        "In fact, I had a problem similar to yours, when I was doing a map product compilation in July and there was an error related to restrictions, where mentioned in the restriction links do not share a common vertex.",
        "Thus, the first thing to do is to find a log file in a compilation folder. In the log file, you can find a description of all errors, which were met. Secondly, look for a list of link IDs in the file that are unique identifiers of problematic links and then open the map and use the \u201cSQL-search\u201d option in order to find links and fix the restriction. After all these operations, launch the compilation again.",
