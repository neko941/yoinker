        "My name is Jazzy and I am working in the IT department in wood-bridge Toronto. I am writing to request you if you can allow me to work in our head office for next six months in the United States.",
        "Actually, my sister just had a new baby and I need to take care of her child for next few months in the USA.  Also, I can spend some time with her because she is living alone. Fortunately,  Our head office is in California and I have checked the address which shows very close to my sister's home.  However, I could manage my job responsibilities on phone here and I will attend our next two upcoming meetings which are always through video conference.",
        "Moreover, I can get experience and I will be able to handle more duties here after working in the head office. I assure you if you will allow me, the work will not be interrupted and I will be available through phone calls during my regular work hours. I would really appreciate if you will help me to arrange this.",
        "I look forward to your positive response.",
