        "When \u0131 go to the other country which is very close to Turkey, you have to make something. For example, I have a cat who lives in my house, so you have to give her food each day and control her toilet. In addition, You should give water flowers once a week. you should give its water Friday. it is up to you.",
        "I don't think that there are any issues, but if there are any problems with a cat or other issues you can call me immediately or you can advise my uncle who lives next to  my house.",
        "Finally, When \u0131 come to  Istanbul, you will have already gone to your own home, so \u0131 will give you your lift later.",
