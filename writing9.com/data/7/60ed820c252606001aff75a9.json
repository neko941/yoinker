In addition, it has been used to share our culture, ideas and our personal life. For example, someone in Asia can make a daily conversation easily with someone in South America using social media. Furthermore, the information that we decide to share, it helps us to be understood and acceptable in many different ways.",
        "However, there is always a risk of sharing our private data with strangers, because we don't know all the people who they are behind the screen. To clarify, many young people use social media, and they may face a lot of harmful situations such as, hatred, bullying and discrimination. Moreover, several companies use our information for marketing purposes which may be annoying, and this issue will break our privacy.",
