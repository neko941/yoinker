        "In recent years, there has been ongoing concern about the mistreatment of wild animals in zoos. Notwithstanding the claim that these facilities offer safe havens and promote the conservation of wildlife, zoos in fact are a form of animal cruelty and should be discontinued.",
        "There are a variety of reasons for people to believe that the existence of zoos is conducive to the protection of wild animals. First, it is apparent that zoos can bring otherwise exotic animals closer to urban inhabitants, which raises their awareness of wildlife conservation. In fact, establishing zoos is a simple and effective way to convey messages about the environment to the city dwellers, galvanising them to the cause of protecting these animals. Second, by organising fund raisers and attracting benefactors, zoos can channel a great deal of money into the safeguarding of wild animals. These funds can be used to invest in reproduction or relocation programmes for endangered species, helping them to escape extinction and hopefully thrive in number down the road.",
        "Nevertheless, there are a myriad of drawbacks to keeping wild animals in zoos. First, since the original purpose of these facilities is to entertain the curious citizens, they have no regard to ensuring the animals\u2019 well-being. For example, from a human perspective, a cage means safety and food being delivered on a daily basis, but to a bald eagle that has spent most of its life in the air, it is only bitter imprisonment. Second, the change of habitat as well as being on display for myriad visitors, subject these animals to stress, which negatively affects their physical health. In fact, animals held in captivity are reported to have various health issues and have a lower desire to reproduce, which is actually detrimental to their conservation.",
        "In conclusion, notwithstanding the fact that zoos are an integral part of every major city, they should be deemed a form of animal cruelty and cease to operate. The resources currently being spent on zoos should be diverted to actual conservation programmes to improve their effects."
