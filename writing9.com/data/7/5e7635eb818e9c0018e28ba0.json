        "Educational Institution is the pillar for better future and this pillar is built in the early years of a student's life. These days, few secondary school follow a dress code for their students, whereas others believe casual dressing is appropriate. This essay supports wearing school uniform instead of students wearing the clothes of their choice. The below paragraphs will discuss this argument in detail.",
        "To begin with, schools are distinguished based on the uniform their students wear. This helps to identify students during an inter-school events or programs. The students who participate in such competitions represents their school wearing their school uniform. Second, wearing uniform will not distract students from their studies. This will make them focus their attention on homework and exams, and not waste time in choosing what to wear to school . To quote an instance, as per 'The Times Newspaper' survey schools having mandatory uniform records cent percent results than those who have other policy.",
        "On the other hand, some schools allow students to wear what they like. This results in students having a casual approach towards the curriculum because of which they lose interest in their studies and focus more on fashion. Additionally, there are a few students who belong to poor families and cannot afford expensive clothes. This can give rise to inferiority complex among the students. For example, few students commit suicide because of being ragged at school by kids belonging to upper class family.",
        "To conclude, uniforms should be a mandatory at schools as students who have freedom of wearing casual clothes at school will not make them disciplined and concentrate on their studies."
