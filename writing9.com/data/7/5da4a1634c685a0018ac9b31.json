        "Music is created in multiple genres, it can change an individuals mood instantly. A few have stated that it's a successful way of bridging gaps between people coming from varied backgrounds and age groups. It's an emotion that music brings alive within a person, regardless of any other aspect of the human body. I completely agree to this fact. This essay will attempt to elaborate the points substantiating my agreement.",
        "Firstly, the melody is created across the globe and are not limited to a certain area. But with the digitisation and technological advances that the world is going through it has become possible for listeners to be exposed to music from a different part of the world. Sharing the liking of a common genre brings people from different mindsets onto the same accord and helps in sharing a similar wavelength. For example, at a concert you find diversified crowds coming to listen to the same artist and share a common thread.",
        "Secondly, music doesn't die. Trickling down from generations there are classics that are heard by teenagers and older people. Artists like ACDC, Bryan Adams and Metallica have specific genres which are suitable for any age. Bands like Coldplay are known across for their music and not for whom they create it for. For example, the ACDC tour of 2019 had a mixture of crowds across the age band.",
        "Bringing this essay to a close, it's music that is bringing people together and helping them unite as a fan club merging cultures and breaking barriers."
