        "Recently, there is a common phenomenon that many are not spending much time in their home. I believe that the insanely high price of properties in the developed areas is the main contributor to the issue, and there are some government interventions that could be done to relieve the problem.",
        "The soaring price of housing is the root of the \"not staying home\" trend. Owing to unaffordable flats and houses, many adults in the workforce are still living with their families under the same roof with no choice, which leads to a lack of personal space. For instance, it would be embarrassing to bring one's lover to his or her home if they would like to share some intimate hours. On the other hand, even for some lucky ones who possess their own flat, it would usually be a tiny flat, which is the most they could afford, in which having social activities or even individual ones like yoga, dancing or exercising at home is undesirable or somehow impossible.",
        "To tackle this, it is indispensable for the government to increase the supply of public apartments. In the city that I live in, it is not rare that people wait over ten years or more for public housing, which reflects the severe scarcity and imbalance between  market demand and supply. Moreover, the government should subsidise citizens or borrow money at a lower interest rate for those with  stable employment to purchase their own property. The policy not only could mitigate the pressure on  public housing , but also provides a better prospect for future life and thus higher motivation in succeeding in their career.",
        "In conclusion, expensive properties cause the vast majority to spend little time at home. The government is urged to intervene in the situation by constructing more public estates and providing more financial support for those who are willing to purchase private houses."
