        "Dear Sir,",
        "I am writing in regards to the article you have posted in your newspaper on 10th December,19 about the expansion of the Dwarka airport and increasing the number of flights over there. I would like to tell you that I am living in the same area and the airport is 15 minutes walk from my house.",
        "We the local residents are already facing problems because of the heavy noises of the airplanes and the traffic congestion in our area. We cannot sleep at night and even concentrate on our daily routine work because of the noise pollution created in our locality. Already, our area is densely populated, and once the airport gets expanded our problems will get doubled up automatically.",
        "The traffic in our locality will increase and the disturbance caused by the frequent flights will result in more trouble in our lives. I would like you to write a new article in your newspaper describing the issues that will be caused by this new plan, so that it can put light on this issue.",
