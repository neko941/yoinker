        "Despite many guidelines and books about parenting, there is no single method that all parents can agree to, including the right way to discipline their children. Some people believe that hitting or smacking will be beneficial in raising their children. This essay will argue why using physical violence to punish children is completely unacceptable.",
        "Even though this practice has started to lose popularity in recent years, some people still consider corporal punishment as the best way to instil discipline in their children. When children are not doing what they are being told to do, they are taught to fear the consequence, which is the pain inflicted by hitting them. It is hoped that the fear of pain would have a long-lasting effect on the children so they will be more obedient. Some people believe that spanking or slapping their children does not only generate fear but also respect for the parents.",
        "On the other hand, I believe that corporal punishment should be abolished altogether. More often than not, it creates strained parent-child relationships. Instead of fearing the consequences of their actions, children fear their parents, which in long term can dissolve a loving and caring relationship that they previously had. Based on a lot of research, violence during childhood can induce many mental health problems, intergenerational trauma and further violence in later years. It is proven that children that were repeatedly hit when they were young, would also hit their children when they become parents. Thus, it is important to stop the cycle of abuse now.",
        "In conclusion, I believe that physical violence toward children should not be done regardless of the reasons. They are many ways to teach kids on how to behave without having to hit them, such as talking and giving rewards."
