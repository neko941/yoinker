        "Some are the opinion that factories working in  rural areas is better rather than working in cities. This has both negative and positive impact. In this essay delineates the consequences also some merits.",
        "On the one hand, migrate large companies to the native centre is a negative trend because of the various reasons. Firstly it would a threat to the environment. Therefore villages are so sensitive in nature they are flourished with a good atmosphere so the chemicals emitted by  the manmade industry would easily destroy the pure atmosphere and cause to air pollution. For instance, recently in India, more than 100 people died due to the leakage of poisonous smoke. Secondly, the waste disposal. However rural areas are less facilitated so it is hard to find a proper waste disposal system and a place for it due to this they tend to pollute the remote areas where the factory located make a huge  threat to nature. For example,  research about the Ganga river in India shows that it particularly more damaged in the area which is nearest to the multinational companies.",
        "On the other hand, the major benefit to migrating the company to remote areas is it may increase the employment level of local people in that area. When  a multinational establish one of their branches in a suburb they definitely need the help of the local people so that they receive more workers from the local area to work with them with the appropriate time at a lower level of income. To illustrate, one of the top company Cocacola start their branch in a village at Kerala help to enlarge the occupation level of the region.",
        "Conclusively, factory migration to suburb both have demerits  and merits but when considering the environment and facility it is better to stay in cities."
