        "It is believed that a child is often affected by their parents while the others have a strong belief that other factors outside the home accounted for the big parts in the development of a young kid. In my opinion, all of the elements above have equal effects.",
        "There are several reasons why people think that parents play an essential role in a child\u2019s development. First of all, most children mimic their parents\u2019 behaviors and thoughts. According to a recent survey carried out by a group of professors at Oxford University, there are about 90 percent of children who were grown up in a family that has violated parents, tend to act in the same ways as their father and mother. Besides, a lot of parents, especially Asian ones often guide their kids to do the same job as theirs, and it could be repeated in the next generations.",
        "As can be seen, there are also a variety of impacts from outside factors such as school, friends, television even neighbors. The first reason is that a child\u2019s personality might be altered by outside influences. For example, a child raised by disciplined parents could become undisciplined if he plays with friends growing up in chaotic families. Another reason is that outside factors can have a significant impact on a child\u2019s habits and behaviors. Many children are becoming addicted to drugs and sexual assaults due to heavy exposure to violent movies or playing street gangs.",
        "In conclusion, I strongly believe that a child is affected easily by all the things that happen around him every day, and nothing takes over the others."
