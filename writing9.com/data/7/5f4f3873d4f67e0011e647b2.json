        "Nowadays, people around the world are using social media more and more. Some folks believe, that these sites have a severe bad effect on our people as well as on community. I would partially agree with the notion because, although, it has some detrimental consequences there are positive uses of social media also. In this essay I will provide some contentious argument to support an overall opinion.",
        "Social networking sites like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and many more provide a platform for individuals to showcase their personal brand, they can access to different companies and could get a Job. Because these sites share our data like hobbies, skills, education and experience. Moreover, It could be used for connecting our loved ones from around the world. With the help of messenger, WhatsApp we can see a person living far apart. Likewise, it would be used handling for getting information about different things for example about tourism and beautiful places in the world. Hence, It depends on the people that how we use it.",
        "On the other hand, it has some devastating impact on our society. Spreading negativity, cyberbullying, and hacking are some of the cons of social media sites. For instance, It is easier to spread a piece of news through these networks. Because almost every second person in the world is using them. While a large number of adults squander their valuable time by spending to much time in front of them. Which has bad effect on their physical and mental health. It also causes harms their career. Sometimes, our personal information is hacked and misused which cause immense problems in one's life. Therefore we should use it carefully.",
        "To conclude, Everything has its dark and bright sides. It depends on us that either we use it for our welfare or for our destruction."
