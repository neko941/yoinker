        "To individuals, working for longer hours triggers at least two issues. It is not only to damage personal relationship, particularly with family, disrupt social lives and impede communicate activities, but also to cause a feeling of depression, a psychological disturbance that is suffered by many job holders. It also tends to exert pressure on the employment market and make fewer job vacancies. The highest proportion of unemployment is expected to cause even higher stress for people in the labour force.",
        "To cooperate, working incessantly, although promising higher benefits from limited resources every now and then, has destructive effects in the long run. The primary reason is that staff tend to be less productive, and meanwhile, be put at greater risks of sickness. It would lead not only to lower quality of work outputs, but also to higher absenteeism and turnover. Therefore, employers have no choice but to spend much more on recruiting and training new employees. For a country in general, it has chronic impacts which are preventing the optimization of resource use natural resources and human capital.",
        "",
        "Some people might argue that it is reasonable for an employer to expect the flexibility during a specific busy period, however to those employers, dependencies on the jobs with extended hours has the tendency to become quite common. Tolerance of this practice would enable employers to exploit labour and omit the benefits that employees are deserved with, such as re-scheduling, flexible working assignments and job redesign to explore their full potential.",
        "In the light of the above discussion, there is obviously no reason accounting for why working long hours can be accepted. In short, this would lead frequent sick leaves and low productivity, thereby doing more harm than good to people and the corporate as well."
