        "Today, we live in a world where social media is dominating our lives. It is constantly argued, that social networking sites like Facebook have had a huge negative impact on both individuals and society. I raise my hand against this notion, and the following paragraphs will analyze two facts that contribute to my opinion.",
        "To begin with, over the years social platforms have changed a plethora amount of lives into best of best. For instance, recently I watched a video about a person who became rich, just because of the comedies he made using this media. Before that, he was just another hopeless person without a proper job and a place to live. Therefore, this makes a clear indication to the rest of the world it is only the ideology that matters, there are true success stories that made their way by using these platforms.",
        "Secondly, It is these sites that made the world into one global village. Before the timeline of this revolution, people had only a limited number of methods to communicate. For example,  a supplier who wanted to sell his product in a foreign country had to fly all over to that country to make it happen. But now thanks to these wonders, it is now easy to create attractive adverts in order to sell their products worldwide. It is just a matter of distance of fingertips to reach the buyers in another land.  As a result of these innovations, gathering an audience has become very simple considering the hardships that we had in the past.",
        "To encapsulate my writing, I reiterate there is a number of advantages over the undesirable sides that social media has bought into our lives. Since these emerging pieces of technology are incapable to change human life for the betterment and uniting all as one. So we should appreciate these more than deprive them."
