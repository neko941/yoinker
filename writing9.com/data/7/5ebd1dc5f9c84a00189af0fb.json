        "Without a doubt donating money to those in need can be a personally satisfying experience. Additionally, these days the ways of donating money have changed significantly. In other words, there are now multiple choices for donating. Individuals can donate money by national or international charities or otherwise can support people in need around them directly. In this essay I will investigate the merits of both approaches.",
        "To begin with, one argument put forward in favor of donating directly is that you can see how your money is being spent and be sure that the neediest one has received your support. For instance, when you're supporting those in need in your town or city you can exactly and easily be aware of where has your money gone. While, when you are donating to international charities you may not completely make sure is your money really helping poor individuals or is going on other costs such as costs of advertising for those charities. Therefore, many people are of the opinion that it is a more rational and logical choice to donate your money to those in need around you.",
        "However, by contrast, others believe that donating to international and national charities has better privileges. first and foremost, these charities cover much more issues to support, so by donating to national and international you have wide alternatives to choose. For instance, you donate your money to kids with exceptional disabilities or diseases or you can donate to conserve wildlife. Not only this, donating and supporting to large charities with an international reach means having great knowledge that you are involved in issues of fundamental global importance such as global warming or tragic environmental events.",
        "To sum up, given benefits of both, I would argue that every individual should make their own choice of the way of donating their money based on their personal preferences."
