        "Some people consider that travelling alone should be the preferable way to learn a country\u2019s background, language or culture. Others feel that one should travel with his/her known ones. In this essay, I will discuss both side of views and I will emphasize my perspectives regarding this matter.",
        "To begin with, travelling all by oneself means one has the freedom to make his/her decisions. This means one can book a ticket, choose a place and make his/her stay comfortable. Moreover, there will be no disturbance or annoyance of people to worry about. Another concern is that one is less likely to feel stressed out. This is because when one is with people, he/she is more likely to listen to their thoughts and opinions. As a result, one is unable to make them happy with his/her decisions accordingly. People who like solo trip do not want hassle. Consequently, they do not want to feel the burden when travelling. Travelling alone means one can easily blend in with locals which will give license to barter. That said, travelling alone does not automatically mean that one is completely safe from hustlers. Another consideration is meeting new interesting people. When one travels with others, he/she typically sticks together. In other words, one is less likely to wander away from his/her group.",
        "On the other hand, travelling with friends and family can be an exciting feeling. This means we can make plans and arrangements before travelling. Packing up the luggage and getting ready for a flight are one of the best feelings to be remembered. We can also gather information about where and which places to visit. Although there will be conflicts and disturbance among the family members, we can still enjoy the moment with them. We are less likely to get lost in the middle of our trip since we stick together wherever we go. This ensures the benefits of travelling with our loved ones.",
        "To conclude, I support the fact of travelling with different groups of people. This is because I think safety comes first before any factors or considerations. Therefore, people who choose to travel alone should be aware of his/her circumstances."
