        "Now a day the traffic and environmental problems have dramatically increased. Many people believe that to overcome the increasing traffic and pollution issues, the cost of petrol should be raised. This essay will discuss this in detail  also other ways to solve the problem of traffic and pollution.",
        "I agree that by increasing the price of petrol is one of the best ways for solving the issues of pollution as the use of petrol for various vehicles produces CO2, which is harmful for the environment. Furthermore, by increasing the price people will also be encouraged to use their bicycles for short distances or even walk. In contrast to that, the traffic problems will also be solved as well as the pollution issues will also overcome.",
        "There are many ways to overcome the increasing problem of traffic. Such as, firstly, by constructing wider roads. This will help to reduce the traffic during rush hours . Secondly, the government should develop proper traffic systems. For example In India due to poor traffic system many ppl die as people come from any directions. Therefore,  to improve the a proper traffic system is to be developed. Similarly the government should  impose heavy fine on the car owners whose car produces black smoke which causes air pollution.",
        "In conclusion, increasing the price of petrol helps to overcome the problem of traffic and environmental issues. But they there are other ways to do that. such as, build wider roads, imposing fine on cars that produces black smoke etc."
