        "It is believed that travelling has become a major trend in this century and people are extending their route of destinations longer. This positive trend and several factors will be examined in this following essay.",
        "Numerous studies have consistently found that there are various reasons why travellers extending their destinations longer distances. Firstly, travellers intensively due to the existence of low-cost airlines. It is a fact that airline companies such as Air Asia or Nok Air are providing economy and affordable ticket price, people who have limited the budget can purchase to faraway countries such as Japan or Korea. Secondly, there is no boundary of the world due to the internet and social media, the wide ranges of journeys from the bloggers inspire people to get a chance and discover the world.

Lastly, nowadays, people earn more money from their jobs. Some of them have part-time jobs on the weekend. As a result, they received a lot of money and paid for their dream destinations easier.",
