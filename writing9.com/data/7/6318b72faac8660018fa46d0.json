        "In the present circumstance, some individuals claim that preliminary schools offer the best support for children's growth, while other occupied parents state that elder parents will be suitable for raising kids. Personally, I believe that the quality of childcare facilities outweighs that of grandparents and the essay will discuss  both views.",
        "On the one hand, it is reasonable why busy parents believe that elder members are the best candidates for nurturing children. Firstly, family members are well-acquainted with their heir and these relationships can be trusted undoubtedly. As a result, parents are assured that their children are safe under supervision. Second, elder members in the family that participate in babysitting chores can lessen the financial pressure on the whole family. As old people only stay in the residence, they can take care and look after their grandchildren, and it will be not necessary to attend childcare centres. However, a lack of modern technical knowledge of early childhood development can be a concern for some parents.",
        "On the other hand, childcare facilities are the perfect choice for nurturing children when parents are occupied. This is because these centres hire professionals, who are trained with specialized knowledge in childcare and are able to guide children in a proper method. Second, attending preliminary centres allows children to meet other kids as interactions between them will help develop communication skills as well as promote emotional growth.  To illustrate, a study conducted by UK Medical Board shows that children tend to learn faster from their friends compare to that  elder individuals.",
        "In conclusion, although there have been controversies about proper daycare. I believe that preliminary centres are the most effective option since they can ensure the growth of the parent's offspring."
