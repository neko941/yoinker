        "Nowadays, the number of cars in the world has increased dramatically. During the last 30 years, many people bought their own car, thus, in the cities, there is a new important problem: the traffic jam. This essay will explain how much is real this issue and how the governments can influence the people convincing them to decrease the use of cars.",
        "First of all, in big cities, movement with cars is becoming really slowly. During specific hours, when population go and come back to work or school, it is reported that the traffic jam is 10 times more than in normal hours. In my city, for example, some people believe that the only way they can arrive at work on time is to bike even if they have to risk their life everyday because there are not enough paths reserved for biking.",
        "According to a recent survey, people consider that governments have a crucial role in this issue. For instance, one method to solve the problem is through the introduction of new bike paths and giving incentives for electric bikes. Replacing part of the streets with bike paths can encourage people to use the bike. After this introduction of paths, the bike will be considered as the best method to move because it is fast and secure. Moreover, the incentives could be helpful because the people will have more motivation to spend money in electric bike which can be used for long distances.",
        "In conclusion, the increasing of cars is a real problem which can provoke a lot of negative consequences but thanks to the help of governments it will be possible to encourage people to switch from the car to different type of transportation, such as bike."
