        "In this modern age, the disappearance of individual plants and animals has been one of the environmental issues. While some believe that we should spot the lights on much more serious problems such as global warming. I do confess that all possible factors that pose threat to the priceless environment are worth considering.",
        "To start with, a great deal of time should be spent to consider the most harmful effects of our surroundings especially the flora and fauna. As long as people are dumping more waste products, using plastic bags, more and more creatures will eventually lose their habitats. Moreover",
        ", at the end they will dye out, so that would cause loss of biodiversity. For example, tuna fishes are under continuous threat of extinction due to marine pollution. As they represent a food source, so that is will affect the normal food chain. Thus, damage our healthy environment.",
        "Secondly, global warming is a popular and famous topic nowadays, which is caused mainly by ozone layer depletion. Even though most of people are aware about the detrimental results of using cars to commute as a daily basis, there is a high demand of them on our streets. More CO2 is produced in the atmosphere, so trapping more heat from the sun; thus, climate warming. In 2008, a paper was published in Tokyo, states that if we didn\u2019t decrease our dependency on cars ,that would yield in the more and more tremendous harmful outcome.",
        "In conclusion, while some advocates that the extinction of some animals and could be dangerous, others admit that there are other natural catastrophes such as global warming. I personally believe that all above mentioned factors that seriously affect the Mother Nature should be managed urgently."
