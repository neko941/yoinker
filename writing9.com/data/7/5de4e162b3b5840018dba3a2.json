Since I born and brought up in an orphanage in Canada, I have been interested in doing voluntary works from my childhood itself. I believe that doing some unpaid work is good for knowing more about the people around the world. Because of the reputation of the Cultural Expeditions in conducting voluntary works in developing countries, I am very much interested in working with your organisation as a volunteer.",
        "Let me explain more about me. I have completed my degree in Social Welfare and as a part of my internship, I have done some voluntary works in Africa and Thailand. Last year, I was able to be a part of unpaid work conducted in an old age home in the Qubec.",
        "Would you kindly allow me to be a part of upcoming welfare activity in India which is going to conduct by next year. As I am taking two years of break after my education, I would like to be there for in the meantime. I love the culture over there and that is the reason I am interested.",
