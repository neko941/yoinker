        "The educational institution is a huge institution where one can acquire a heap knowledge of the courses selected as per one's choice, be it a male or a female. In my opinion, whether academy should enrol equal number of male and female in all subjects, I would rather concur both.",
        "",
        "Firstly, the reason why I agree is because, every program that is designed for a student is not gender specific. As in, there is no foolproof guarantee that, only one gender can excel in that specific program. For example, a program related to home science that has a curriculum for cooking and homemaking. It is a not a program that is restricted to females alone, if men can get an opportunity to learn and if they are keen on learning, then the academy should give them a chance as well. Likewise, for a woman who is interested in pursuing mechanical engineering. She might have her own ambitions in leveraging her career in that space.",
        "",
        "Secondly, on the contrary, the reason why I disagree is because, it shouldn't be a mandatory norm that every student of both the gender types have filled the seats to meet the program requirement. For example: if there is a subject under a program, where the number of male candidates exceed the female candidates, then the academy should not enforce the female students to pursue that program, if the numbers don't meet.",
        "",
        "Lastly, in conclusion, education is a choice and the courses chosen by each individual should be purely under their discretion. It's not about male or female, it's purely based on an individual. And due to this option, every gender should get equal opportunity in pursuing a program that they dreamt of.  An academy should not be a hindrance for not allowing an individual in succeeding the same."
