        "The two maps illustrate the various change in Grange estate from its first opening in 1920 to the present.",
        "Overall, it is evident that the park has been re-arranged significantly and the playground is extended with many modern facilities such as an amphitheatre, a children\u2019s play area, \u2026 while some buildings are destructed to elect another structure.",
        "First of all, in 1920, there were 2 entrances for people to come in, which were located in the northern and southern of the garden and still remain at the moment. Besides that, 1 of 2 rose gardens, which were built in the northwestern and southwestern of the forest, is destroyed and only one garden remains in the northwestern ones. While the stage for musicians was rebuilt on a big scale and served as an amphitheatre for concerts.",
        "In addition, there was a fountain put in the centre of the public estate in 1920 but this figure is destructed and rebuilt as another huge rose garden with many seats surrounded. Therefore, at the northeastern corner, a children\u2019s play area and caf\u00e9 are built to replace the pond for water plants and another rose garden in the past. Finally, there is the prominent water feature, which is substituted for the old glasshouse, is elected next to the south entrance.",
        "In conclusion, the playground has changed significantly since it first opened in 1920, many modern infrastructures are added to the park to broaden the scale, so it's easier to attract clients but this square still retains its uniqueness."
