        "It is true that watching TV has some unequivocal benefits for children in terms of learning. However, I totally disagree with the opinion that children should be promoted to watch TV both at home and school for a number of reasons.",
        "On the one hand, TV is a useful educational tool for many children. Firstly, this audio-visual medium provides different opportunities to make learning more enjoyable and interesting. Children will be attracted by visual illustration on the screen, which can help turn tedium lessons into fun activities. For example, historical events which are presented by vivid audio and colorful images tend to stimulate children\u2019s interest and imagination, then they can grasp the lessons easily.",
        "On the other hand, I agree that children should be allowed to watch TV in a limited time and under supervision. If children spend too much time sitting in front of the TV, it can be harmful for them in many aspects. To begin with, exposing to the screen excessively may lead to eye problems such as blurred vision. To illustrate, these days, there are a growing number of children suffered from poor vision. Take my 14-year-old brother as an example, he had worn thick glasses since he was 7. Moreover, children may distract their studies when they become addicted to watching TV. For those who watch a lot, it's very hard to quit, so it is similar to a dependency like alcoholism or another type of addiction. This may lead to adverese influences on students\u2019 academic outcomes.",
        "In conclusion, I firmly hold the view that children should not motivated to watch TV all the time both at home and at school. Instead, parents had better monitor their children\u2019s time of watching TV."
