        "One of the many challenges executives face these days is the issue of deciding which sector gets the larger part of the budget. Some people think that more money should be assigned to the educational system than the health department.  I strongly disagree with the idea because the health care system is much more important than the academic structure.",
        "First of all, good physical condition is the centre of all other things. Only a person who is physically fit can undertake the normal activities of daily living. For example, the global outbreak of the novel corona virus proved the point as the pandemic placed a stop to every business, and schools were all closed as a result. Also, those who are infected with the virus could not even participate in any online tutoring. This goes to explain why it is important for authorities to invest in the well-being of their people by funding its health sector.",
        "Secondly, it is said that health is wealth, this means that individuals who are physically sound can contribute positively to the economy.  Moreover, good hospitals can attract medical tourism from across the country which can significantly increase the economy. For instance, recent study proved that most African leaders spend a huge amount of money to access hospitals abroad, and this sum is large enough to construct  and equip fifty standard hospitals in their own countries. Clearly, its is necessary to pay more grant to the health department.",
        "To conclude, although the educational sector is very important and also require funding, however, more money should be apportioned to the health care system."
