        "Nowadays, the rise in committing crimes is a crucial issue. As a result, some countries punishing murders with the death penalty. However, some people believe that by the death penalty, society is also the guilt of committing murder. This essay is going to analyse this issue by using examples with supporting points.",
        "To begin with, the death penalty may significantly reduce the commitment of serious crimes such as murders, due to fear of punishment for the criminal. For example, in the USA, some states considerably decreased the crime rates with the death penalty. Moreover, even if society murder by the death penalty, they prevent future victims. In other words, by committing one death, individuals help to any possible victims of the crime. To sum up, because of the fear of the death penalty, most of the killers will change their mind to commit crimes, and the punishment could save the physical and mental health of possible victims.",
        "On the other hand, there may be different circumstances of the crime. For example, self-defence, when the person committed a murder protecting himself or herself. As a consequence of this fact, the police and the court must carefully study the case in order to reach the correct verdict. Summing up, the death penalty is not applicable in some instances, such as self-defence, even if they committed a murder.",
        "To conclude, in the modern world, the death penalty cannot tackle all the problems with committing murders. However, I believe that by using it properly, society could save lives and prevent possible murders in the future."
