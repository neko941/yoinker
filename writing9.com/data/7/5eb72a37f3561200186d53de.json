        "In the past, when students used to apply for university degrees or any other higher degree courses, they used to prefer the institutions of their own province for this purpose, but as the time passed, a new trend of studying abroad has been seen from past 2 or 3 decades, specifically in the 5 years. There are both advantages and the disadvantages of such development.",
        "To commence with, everybody wants to get an education from a good and well reputed university. So, most of the students apply to the prestigious institutions in order to receive knowledge from renowned faculty. Apart from this, students get the experience of living and studying with the people from different cultures. As a consequence, students gain information in many ways. Moreover, the developed countries provide a chance for the students to earn while learning, which makes them self-dependent.  According to a research, the students who study and work in different countries, can adapt any type of working environment.",
        "On the flip side, there are many students who intend to work and settle in the same country where they finish their university degrees because they get bedazzled with the lifestyle of that place and the good perks offered to them by employers. However, this development is not good for their home country, since their native land face loss of valuable human resource.",
        "To encapsulate, studying abroad can be good from the perspective of an individual as it helps them to be knowledgeable, prosperous and wealthy. But from the view of a nation, such development could be regressive for their homelands."
