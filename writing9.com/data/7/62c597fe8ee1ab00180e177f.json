        "I am writing to express my dissatisfaction with the product of your company which I purchased it from store in Paris. I bought a digital camera last week while I took a vacation to French. when I arrived in my hometown, and opened a package, I found that the charging cable and camera case were missing.",
        "I purchased the camera from the shop in the market nearby the Eiffel tower, It is a little shop,painting in green colour and in the opposite shop is a bakery shop. When I arrived home, I opened it, and I cannot find the charging cable, but it was supposed to be there. I curious whether this mistake comes from the shop or the manufacturing.",
        "I, therefore, suggest that you replace the item or I will be given a full refund, as the warranty covers it.",
