        "Broadcast television is experiencing a biased trend where women's sports have disproportionately less screen time than their men's counterparts. I believe this trend takes root in the concept of assigned roles on the basis of gender, and it should change as a means to promote gender equality.",
        "Sports have been a male domain for as long as humans first invented them since they symbolize masculinity. As most sports require muscular strength from participants, the belief that men are inherently better at sports, and therefore more worth watching than women started to instill in the minds of the masses. As opposed to men, women are discouraged to play sports in pursuit of other, more specifically, feminine interests such as beautification or embracing their expected maternal duties. As a result, men are predominant and far more highly regarded compared to women in the field, which essentially makes men's sports more appealing in the public eyes, and television producers for that matter.",
        "However, I strongly believe that women's sports should have the same amount of attention and have channels televised for the same amount of time as men's sports. That is the right step needed to address gender equality and gradually gain balance to both sexes in every aspect of life. Even though women are indeed inferior to men with respect to physical abilities, by no means should female athletes receive less than the appraising efforts they put in. Credit must be given as a reward for dedication and sportsmanship, thus inspiring others to achieve an even greater level of greatness in their careers.",
        "In conclusion, women's sports are being disgraced by television channels as they do not focus on them as much as men's. This discouragement should stop to promote gender equality as far as sports are concerned."
