        "Purchasing on the internet has become increasingly popular over the latest decade.  Thanks to this, there is a widely spread belief that the next generations will no longer see physical stores on the streets. From my perspective, despite the clear relevance of digital stores nowadays, these shops do not fullfill all the necessities of clients to replace all shops.",
        "Firstly, street shops sell more than goods, they offer an unique experience to costumers. Diverse from the digital world, these commercial areas invest in creating a pleasurable atmosphere rather only products. For instance, the majority of American malls have a musical environment along with salespeople trained to offer a personalized experience to consumers. Therefore, although the facilities and generally affordable prices found online, clients might continue to come to real shops to gain what it is beyond the product.",
        "Secondly, certain goods are not fully aproprierate to buy without a physical presence.  Regarding clothes and shoes, the necessity of trying on before purchasing them is a reality to most people. That is because, even with all the specific measures, clients might have daunting challenges to find the right piece. To illustrate with numbers, the online store of Forever 21 claims that an average of fifty percent of their fashion collection is returned by costumers despite the lack of defects. Thus, regarding the fashion industry, online shops are not the ideal to provide the ideal clothing.",
        "To conclude, websites offer a range of products; however, the costumers' experiences are limited. Furthermore, certain goods might require personal avaliation of clients before acquiring them, making it difficult concluding this online. Consequently, I am opposite to the notion that shops in the future will close as a result of online shopping."
