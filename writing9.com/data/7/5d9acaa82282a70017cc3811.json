        "I am Paul Smith, living on Park Avenue, Juliet Apartments, Ontario. I am writing to complain about the bus service in our area. We are facing so much difficulty regarding arrival and departure of buses.",
        "In our area, buses come so late that people never arrived to their offices on time. If sometime buses are on time, then they never depart on time, which create so many problems. We cannot rely on buses to travel from one place to another.",

        "I want you to start fast bus service in our area. This will result in reliable timings of the buses and people may also get benefit from this.",
        "Hoping for quick action to be taken by you.",
