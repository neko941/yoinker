        "People have different opinions when it comes to school children and whether or not homework by their teachers, plays an important role in the education of their offspring. Some may say children must do children to do assignments and others say it does not help in any way. I believe it depends on the type of practice and does the child benefit from it or not.",
        "Homework, in general, is something that is seen by kids as some sort of punishment although it is meant to help them learn the subject this is because homework is usually something that is not interesting or mind-numbing and done to keep the grade. This is done by teachers who give out a long practice that does not add additional value and repeats what has already been taught in class. Thus, people conclude that chore adds no value to their offspring's education. for example, I had a teacher who used to make us write all the formulas 10 times just so we don't forget them rather than explaining the key concept behind it.",
        "If homework is given in such a way, it compels the children and makes them more eager to learn that children and makes them more eager to learn that particular subject. Then homework can be helpful. people who argue that homework places a crucial role in their child's education think that it gives them some responsibility and shows that children are disciplined enough to get the given work done. also, it gives some way to measure the progress made by the children through which teachers can give more attention to the child that is lagging behind others. for example, I was given homework to prepare a presentation on a topic related to what was being taught in class which made me learn both topics and much more when researching for it.",
        "In my personal experience, it depends on the type of work and whether or not they add any value to the students and does it encourages them or they do it fearing punishment or a drop in grades. Is homework that students do without hating really homework?"
