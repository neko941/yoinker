        "Deploying the online  in education can provide students with up-to-date sources of information. However, there are other possible solutions that would appear to be more effective rather than the internet. This essay will discuss the drawbacks of teaching lessons using the internet and provide some alternatives.",
        "First of all, using the internet constantly during lesson might lead students to addiction. With this said, many of them could rely on only the internet and thus this method would cause them to use only the internet rather than printed books. In addition, it might bring about some health-related problems in children, such as eye disorders, which discourage students to study. Therefore, the internet could not be the best way in educating process.",
        "Turning to viable alternatives, probably the most effective would be to introduce multi-sensory tactics such as games, puzzles. Via this method, they can spend their time being energized, which encourages pupils to comprehend themes well. Another possible option would be to organize more recreational activities such as a school trip, which would achieve in keeping them interested in the subjects. Unlike the internet that provides visual information, understanding any kind of the subjects through nature would be much more fascinating for school children. This also helps encourage them to learn more.",
        "In conclusion, although teaching lessons via the internet might be seen one of the best tactics, it would not be the most effective option. Introducing multi-sensory process of lesson and organizing school trips, which assist teachers in encouraging students to study, seem to be more helpful in education."
