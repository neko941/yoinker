        "There are some guardians who buy a lot of tools for their kids to play.The benefit of a large number of toys is that children will have knowledge of all the playing tools, while demerit is that they may fail to focus in their study.",
        "The foremost advantage of having a greater number of toys is that children will be more familiar with the modern devices; moreover, it also increases the confidence level of players. Different kinds of playing tools will make the kids learn about the rules of various games. Furthermore, it will raise the interest of children in gaming. For instance, research done in Cambridge schools concluded that the level of the knowledge of primary school students in gaming is higher in those students who are provided with a large number of playing tools than others.",
        "But a large number of toys can distract youngsters from focusing on their study. These devices engage the students more than needed, and they cannot give time for their homework; this will impact their whole future. As kids do not focus on their school, they will fail in their exams and may loss their interest in schooling; they may be addicted in playing by leaving all the things besides. For example, the results of KMC school showed that the students who are provided with many toys spend about 6 hours in gaming per day.",
        "To sum up,  the greater number of the playing tools increases their knowledge of sports while it creates a negative impact on their study, that can demolish their actual aim."
