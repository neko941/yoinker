        "Some people believe that, it's good to share their personal information while applying for their domain related jobs while, others think that it's not a recommended  approach. In my opinion, I completely agree to provide required data to the respective employers.",
        "There are various benefits by providing required information to companies. Firstly, if there any emergency situation, where employers would like to contact any of the family members then it will definitely helpful in such cases. Otherwise, there are chances where the company does not have proper information specific to employee personal information such as medical illness. Thus, it will adversely impact on the respective employee families. Secondly, In the organizational level,",
        "If the company willing to promote other new initiatives where employees have had great interest in that scenario also it will give benefit for both company and employee as well However, above scenarios not only impact employees but also their respective organizations. I believe, this will be useful for the future development of employees in both personally and professionally.",
        "On the other hand, there are inevitable reasons for not to share any personal data to the respective employers. One of the predominant problem is, misusing of employee data for the marketing and other business tactics. For instance, over online, there is a plethora of websites are maintaining personal data and these websites getting data from the job seeker's tools such as monster.com. In addition to that, employees need to suffer in order to support for the company duties endlessly and it will cause serious problems to the job holder's and eventually it will impact on their counterparts of family members. Employees need to be condoned to do such activities or duties 24/7 format, until and unless their proper agreement employer's shouldn't call or message to their employees.",
        "To conclude, in order to avoid risks and the process of sharing proper relevant data to their respective employers should not be transparent. However, the Government needs to take preliminary actions over online data breaches websites and other tools."
