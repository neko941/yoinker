        "The infrastructure of any country's transportation system needs to be maintained and updated from time to time. For that matter, some people argue that the Government should invest money in constructing the railway track for the high-speed trains between cities. Although it is crucial to spend money on updating the railway infrastructure and equipped with a modernized railway system, I believe the present public transport system should be modified first because many people are already using them.",
        "Those who claimed that the Government should spend there coffer's money in building the railway tracks for high-speed trains are necessary in today's fast speed era. Because people have to maintain their working speed according to today's fast-paced environment, where every individual is in a rush, and wants to do many tasks in a short period, many people in the world depend entirely upon trains to commute within the city. Therefore, due to slow speed trains and over crowded, many of them cannot reach their destination on time. As a result, some people have been fired from the jobs, especially the people who are near to their retirement age, because as they are aging, they are slow in catching the train, although it has a slow speed but overcrowded and slim in frequency make it difficult for them. For example, In Mumbai, India, over 90% of people commute via rail. Many stories I have heard from my acquaintance that, despite reaching on the platform at 5 am morning, they were always late to their destination because the trains were not only with the limited capacity, limited in number, and moved with snail speed. However, I think fast speed trains sound more attractive on paper only.",
        "But deeper reflection reveals that high-speed railways sound engaging in theory, but not economical and practical for many underdeveloped countries where the working community depends on trains. Therefore,I believe the tax payers funds should be spent on developing more platforms, increasing the frequency of trains, and modifying the existing one with more seating space with an appropriate ventilation system. Additionally, spendings can also focus on improving the quality and increase the number of single and double-decker buses around the city with competently trained and licensed drivers, along with building a supreme quality of roads with no bumps and jumps.",
        "In conclusion, instead of installing fast speed trains to commute, the Government should attain their focus to improve the existing transport system by introducing quality vehicles and roads for their dwellers and regular train commuters."
