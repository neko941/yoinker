        "Many of developed, as well as developing countries have been strengthening their law and order situation which as resulted in a significant decrease in their country's crime rates. Despite of this improved law and order situation, many still feel unsafe. This is mainly because of the fact that, people nowadays are more afraid about an outbreak of epidemics, which could result in millions losing their life. In addition, the rate of accidents, especially in the urban centres, has been on the rise further fuelling peoples' fear. This essay would discuss both the reasons in detail and provide solutions to overcome this problem.",
        "Numerous reports, around the globe, have suggested that countless new species of bacterias and viruses are yet to be discovered by the scientific community. As a result, many scientists from different countries are on the hunt for new pathogens. Recently, a group of virologist from Canada, discovered three new species of viruses, one of which may prove deadly for humans. If such viruses make their way out of the research facilities or are transmitted from animals to human, then it would lead to pandemics, resulting in the lost of countless lives. On the other hand, with the increasing rate of accidents people also fear of getting into one, which may cause their life. Over usage of vehicles, especially in cities, is the main culprit for the rise in accident rates as people often tend to break traffic rules or drive recklessly. For example, the National Transport Agency has reported a sharp increase in vehicular accidents due to people driving under the influence of alcohol. All these reasons have caused people to be more anxious and feel less safe.",
        "However, the population can be made to feel safer by adopting solutions such as educating the general public about the do's and dont's in case of a pandemic and enforcing stricter laws against traffic rule offenders. Firstly, by spreading the awareness about the things to follow during an outbreak, it would help citizens safe stay and remain healthy. Furthermore, by following the guidelines it would help the health officials to swiftly contain the epidemic. For instance, educating people to wear masks and maintain a certain distance in case of an airborne disease outbreak, is an effective way of reducing the transmission of disease. Secondly, to reduce vehicular accidents, the government should impose strict laws for breaking traffic rules, such as fine up to 1,000$, or imprisonment up to 6 months or both. The Indian Government, after realising the increase in incidents of traffic violation, enacted heavy fines on the offenders. Such measures discourage people from breaking the rules and help reduce accident rates.",
        "In conclusion, even though countries have taken steps towards reducing the crime rates in their countries, in my opinion, people still fear about outbreaks of fatal diseases and getting into an accident and makes them feel unsafe. In order to reduce their anxiety and make feel safer, the government should educate them on ways to effectively reduce disease transmission and come up with harder punishments for traffic violation."
