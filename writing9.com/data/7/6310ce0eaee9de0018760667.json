        "Health issues are becoming more and more serious in today\u2019s society. The cancer rates are climbing rapidly every year and many other diseases are getting into people\u2019s life. However, under this circumstance, many people still lack the motivation to do regular exercise, especially those at work.",
        "It\u2019s quite understandable why most working people don\u2019t get enough physical activities if we draw a full picture of their daily routine. For example,a white-collar usually gets up at around 7-8 am, spends 8-9 hours at work and gets back  home at around 8pm, then he would be too hungry and tired to make a move, let alone do any exercise. And if he has to work overtime, then the workload would make him have no time to do any exercise. In this respect, people are unwilling to work out psychologically and physically.",
        "So what can be done to refine this situation? In my opinion, Not only working people themselves but their companies should be responsible for the health problems. On the one hand, the individual should raise their consciousness of personal health and do body fitness regularly. On the other hand, the company should organize more activities and encourage its staff to take part , such as holding a basketball competition. Also, the company should build a gym room or add some fitting facilities in the rest area.",
        "Overall, Health problems should not be ignored, though it\u2019s understandable why some working people are reluctant to do any exercise after work. Both companies and individuals should change themselves to solve this problem and build a healthier society."
