        "Phones are  unseparated components of our lives. Most people argue about the usage of these tools inside  school borders or not. In my opinion, it may decrease children's focus during lessons. This essay will discuss both views and thus will give a reasonable conclusion with acceptable examples.",
        "On the one hand,  phones are very useful devices to achieve information without a computer. Most  people claim that it may helpful for collecting information during studying. For instance,  finding data from books or dictionaries may waste of time. It can be learned  online via phones which connect  directly online. Although it seems a better way to education part, phone may cause distract student focus on other applications such as social media or games, Also it may eliminate the main task.",
        "On the other hand, using phone increase our connectivity. It works the same as among students in that they continue to chat by text during lessons and school days. It may damage students learning activities which lose their focus inside on phones. For example, the lecturer always wants to  attention during the lesson.  however,  if the student does not listen enough,  the quality of the lesson cannot be valuable. Furthermore, it has affected student success more than expected. Some  learners may try to keep records after lessons. People never repeat lessons after class despite  good ideas.",
        "To sum up, it is clearly seen from the essay that the main problem is attention. Although phone gives good resources for gathering information,  they should not use in during school. Moreover, the younger generation can distract easily. Students would be  attention to their lessons on the time. Thus, the ban is a good idea for education."
