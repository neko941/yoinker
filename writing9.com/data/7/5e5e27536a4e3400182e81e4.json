        "In this day and age, travelling around the world is not just a dream because of the invention of transportation. Although we can go anywhere and anytime by using convenient transportation, it brings severe effects that are harmful to the environment and consumption of natural resources. Hence, some people support that governments should promote the use of bicycle while others believe that investing on public transportation systems is the best way to solve the problem.",
        "First of all, public transport allows many people to travel in just one vehicle, which helps reduce traffic congestion in city centres. According to the reports, the total CO2 emissions from buses (15%) was three times lower than the private cars. It is obvious that there are environmental benefits of most of the people using one vehicle in the form of a reduction in the consumption of fossil fuels. In addition, some public transport such as subways, are highly energy efficient or use sustainable energy which is greatly reduced the destruction towards the environment.",
        "From another perspective, bicycles can solve the problem that public transport can't handle it, which is offering flexible routes. We always face some troubles when we use the public transport such as buses are not catered for many destination and the punctuality of buses or trains is frequently unreliable. Furthermore, we will not be restricted by other passengers as bicycles can be deemed the personal transport. If we use the bicycles, we can avoid the peak hours and will not feel unpleasant due to the overcrowding.",
        "In conclusion, we have the responsibilities to protect our environment, either using bicycle or riding public transportation is less harmful to the environment. In order to live in healthy and clean cities, we must practice the carpooling as soon as possible."
