        "In the 21st century,the role of opening areas should be concerned with the employment of companies for candidates excepted from discussing with own spaces for jobs.In this essay,both merits and drawbacks can be seen as relevant to this statement.Hence,having an open-side framework gives more accessibility for workers rather than restricted rooms are convinced.",
        "Beginning with positive impacts,employees can collaborate freely as much information as possible in sharing their projects which are accounted for the improvement of their organizers.As the separated rooms are not allowed to workers by their supervisors,standard officers can feel workplace happiness in the combination of senior and junior job holders.For instance,a recent survey reveals that when individuals communicate with each other and share ideas, their cortisol levels drop and further elevate the potential of collaboration projects.",
        "Moreover,retainers can taste different people with different backgrounds who are consulted for their good fortune by recovering from their past mistakes.",
        "Apart from this view,there are two disadvantages to this topic.If employees are given  open-side workplaces,their hundred per cent concentration does not focus on their detailed projects because they have  more chances to gossip about their interpersonal cases.As a result,not only the low quality of the works",
        "but also the unfinished assignments can be included in the negative effects on offices.Another significant point is that the less privacy of officers becomes the main unexpected problem.This is because there are no rooms to do what they intend to do. If they are still not in their own space to relax, they are more likely to increase their stress which results in a drop in productivity.",
        "In conclusion,it is really conspicuous  that there are many beneficial sides to making the offices in the open-space styles.And also,I am of the opinion that the overall advantages outweigh the disadvantages."
