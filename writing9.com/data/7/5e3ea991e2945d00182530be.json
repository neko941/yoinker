        "The crime rate is considerably increasing nowadays. Despite all attempts of governments and societies to prevent this phenomenon, it seems solutions can not be successful to reduce the crime unless they consider underlying root causes of this issue.",
        "The first root cause, and perhaps the most important one, is unemployment, and the consequent financial problems. That is to say, citizens who have not any occupation to the living cost, are more likely to commit a crime, in order to afford their basic needs. To tackle this problem, the government should attempt to improve the national financial state, so that more companies can employ more people. This can decrease the number of unemployed citizens. The next step would be funding those who are unable to find a proper job. Therefore, the government can assure that almost all people can pay their needs, and do not require committing a crime. These steps can, significantly, reduce the crime rate in the society.",
        "Although low financial balance is considered the main reason for crime, many people, especially adolescents, commit it because of peer pressure. Teenagers, usually, tend to rely on their friends rather than their families. As a result, if their surrounding people persuade him or her to commit criminal activity,  it would be seriously hard for juveniles to avoid it. Many juvenile crimes, like graffiti and vandalism, are performed simply under pressure of criminals\u2019 friends. For eliminating this, parents and schools are responsible to make youngsters aware of this kind of pressure and educate them to avoid such friendships.",
        "In addition, a significant number of criminals have also been encouraged to crime by media violent contents, which have noticeably increased recently. A good solution would be dwindling production of these programs.  Moreover, TV channels and other composers should label all shows with age-related warnings. Parents, this, can control, more effectively, what their children can watch, to minimise the negative impacts.",
        "To sum up, Crime is a highly important issue for every society. The government, media, schools and families should work together to tackle the problem by removing the main contributing factors, such as the poverty resulted from lack of job opportunity, juvenile circumstances and media impacts."
