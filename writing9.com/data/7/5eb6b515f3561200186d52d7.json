        "Nowadays, with the fast-growing economy of some major cities in the world, more and more modern buildings are being erected to accommodate the burgeoning population that economic growth brings. However, there has been debate over whether local governments or construction companies should be responsible for the design of buildings. This essay discusses both sides of this contentious argument and then I will give my own perspective.",
        "Many people argue that companies building the projects should be free to design buildings as they wish. One of the reasons for this is that they often have the expertise to design buildings well. For instance, they often employing leading architects to design stylish buildings for them. Another reason is to allow buildings in an area to have a distinctive flavour and to not be constrained by governmental regulations that may result in a cookie-cutter approach to building. An example of this style of building is in Beijing, where whole suburbs look identical.",
        "Others argue that governments should safeguard the general public\u2019s interests and design buildings accordingly. More often than not, they have records of areas affected by disasters throughout history and will design buildings that can usually withstand just about every natural disaster such as earthquakes, floods and tornados. In addition, if governments make the decisions about a building\u2019s design, the whole town planning can be considered in the decision. More specifically, they consider how the design of a particular building fits in with the other buildings and facilities in an area.",
        "In conclusion, I believe both sides of the argument have their merits. However, on balance I believe that governmental involvement is essential to ensure safety issues are not being violated and whole cities have some sort of overall plan in their design."
