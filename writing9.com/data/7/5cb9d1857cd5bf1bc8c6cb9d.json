        "It is said that the key factor to be successful in studying is learn by heart facts. I completely disagree with this point of view.",
        "Education is one of the most important issues in every country as there are many benefits gaining from it.  First of all, education gives people knowledge and skills in any specific fields that they studied. To get the best results in education, people should do more than they think, not only memorising. In my opinion, understanding is the most important key to success. For example, when I study chemistry for my advanced test, reading a textbook and memorising everything there is not enough. If I just do this, I will could not do anything in the test. I have to understand this information, but not only understand, it's still not enough. I have to understand its very, very deeply until it likely becomes a part of my body. Only then, I feel that I succeeded in my studies.",
        "Memorising will not help us if we don't understand anything. If we just memorise these facts, we might success only in the test of remembering things. This is something like a robot, you remember this, people ask you about this, you might answer it, but if they expanded the limitation of the questions, you couldn't. There are many other ways we can do to succeed in education. Practising is one more example. We learn theories in classes, but what we learn is just what the other experienced and recorded for the smaller generations. Therefore, practising will help you to understand what the textbook is trying to tell you.",
        "In conclusion, to be successful in education, memorising is not an important way for everyone."
