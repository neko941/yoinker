        "Environmental issues such as global warming, air pollution, wildlife extinction\u2026 have dramatically increased and become a significant concern over the last few decades. Some people argue that government and big organizations should take responsibility to reduce them. I am of the opinion that these problems should be addressed by individuals.",
        "To begin with, every individual who is living in this society should be responsible for environment protection. A great deal of actions can be taken to protect our planet such as getting rid of cutting trees, growing trees in the forest or around our house as well as stopping deforestation. Because tree can do Carbon dioxide absorption and release Oxygen, therefore more trees should be a good solution. Moreover if deforestation is reduced, we are able to keep natural habitat for wild life and avoid wildlife extinction as well.",
        "Another aspect of contribution at the personal level in environment protection should be considered is that we can actually take some good habits in daily basis in dealing with environmental problems. We can always bring along recycle bags instead of using plastic or rubbish ones as fewer plastic bags being used means that less air pollution or dump sites. We also cut down residential waste, donate money to environmental organizations or call others on this mission. From small, realistic actions, together we can make the greatest contribution to protecting our environment.",
        "To sum up, responsibility for environment protection should be ours. By practical actions mentioned above, I firmly believe that we can save the earth for our life as well as for our future generation."
