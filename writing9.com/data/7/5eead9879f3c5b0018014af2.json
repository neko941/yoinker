        "The new things are booming in day to day life, which will impact people's life and there is a necessity to adapt the new culture to live in the community. However, people should not forget the significance of art.",
        "Art has many forms like painting, music, literature, dance, sculptures and so on. In the bygone era, these craft works were handled by their inheritance, which was changed in the last two decades because the young generation does not want to do these kinds of work.  The science and technology are helping people to produce new equipments which are making our life more easier than earlier. Due to this, visual arts are changed to digital form and this digitalisation is causing many professions. For instance, the traditional classical dance is eradicated by the contemporary dance.",
        "Some people are still having the knowledge about the art and they are willing to spread their knowledge to the society with free of cost. Government should encourage these people to exhibit their art and provide some rewards for them, which will motivate other people. Moreover, adolescence should think about to improve these arts based on the current trend which will bring everyone's attention to the art. For example, the design of the cloth is changing based on the current fashion likewise we need to change other forms of art.",
        "To conclude, the new business will be added every year, but it will not diminish our creativity or imaginations. Therefore, people use to adapt new things, and in the meantime, the art and old cultures should be updated."
