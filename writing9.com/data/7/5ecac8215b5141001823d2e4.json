        "Work from home has become a new trend in this pandemic crisis to abide by the protocol of social distancing. An increasing number of people have a preference to work from home due to the risk of getting infected with the virus on the job. There are conflicting views regarding whether working at home have more merits or demerits. Some folks proclaim that this incline in trend is beneficial to employees while on contrary side other argue that it causes unnecessary tension at home. In the following essay, we will elaborate both points of view and will explain my support to the latter standpoint.",
        "Commencing with the pros, the individuals who perform from home saves a lot of time of transition, and they do not require to waste their crucial time in traffic congestion this additional time which they get can be utilized in several more productive activities or for family. Many times, the employee need to migrate to other cities leaving their family behind. However, if the work from home is advocated, the work can be completed from any part of the world, thus they do not need to split up from their family for their livelihood. For instance, the person sitting 100 km away from the workplace can accommodate the work from the home saving lots of money and time in travelling. Besides this, most of the people find their home to be the most relaxing place which can offer them the environment conducive for work which let them be highly productive in their comfort zone.",
        "On the converse side, it is undeniable that the work from home can ignite the stress level that is carried forward to home. For instance, while working at home, there are no specific work hours all they need to do to complete the specific task in whatever time it takes which can lead to people working longer than the normal routine that can cause a domestic dispute and tension among family members. Furthermore, there are high chances that they might not be able to concentrate on their work because of the noise created by kids. Many times, it slips out of the family member's mind that the other person at home is working and accidentally the noises created in the surrounding can affect the concentration and may affect the work efficiency. What is more, is that many times they can fail to grab the opportunity which may arise in the workplace. To exemplify, there comes a time when the urgent meeting is conducted, and presentation is to be made if at this time being at home will not let person  seize the chance and might lose the opportunity to get a promotion or bonus.",
        "In conclusion, it clearly shows that the disadvantages out shadow the advantages. Even though staying at home and working will not let the person be more available for family, that is why it is better that the work is done from the office, so the work stress is not carried forward at home."
