        "Worldwide, every government shows more interest in protecting their arts and culture. Some people think that the government should focus on public services instead of spending in arts, music and theatres. I partially agree with this notion. Improving public services is essential to the county's growth; however, the arts also important.",
        "Every year the government spends an enormous amount in arts, music and theatre attract tourists. Worldwide, most of the people interested to learn and experience various cultures and tradition, so each country all over the world tries to attract more tourist and earn from it. For example, to compare the past few decades, Iran's income has increased several times once they started investing in tourism. In addition, Iran's one-third of their income depends on tourism.",
        "However, public services are taken into account first. In many countries, still, the people who live in rural places are struggling without proper education facility. Even in this modern era, a massive number of students are travelling so far to get educated. The regime should consider education issue on top of others because the country's growth relies on the number of educated people. For instance, according to the 2019 survey of Times, worldwide, 46% of children do not have proper education facilities. Hence, it is the sole responsibility of the government to provide an adequate education.",
        "To conclude, although it is important to invest in arts, music and theatre, public services like education should consider the top of others. I believe, in the future, the bureaucracy will consider public services as the most priority and others will taken depends on the need."
