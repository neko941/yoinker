        "There has been a worrying trend that nowadays the crime and disrespect in society is rising.This trend can be ascribed to a number of reasons and it must be addressed by definite actions.",
        "The primary reason is that the television, social media and other digital platforms like Netflix are playing a major role in cultivating such kind of negative behaviour in  teenagers. In this era, people prefer to watch the  crime stories full of murder, violence  and villain roles which spreading the negativity and impacted very badly the young minds.For example,  many Bollywood movies like the king similarly Hollywood movie such as Game of Thrones which promotes violence, crime and action stunts, and bloodbaths are greatly viewed. People find such kind of stories extremely fascinated and try to imbibe the shown characters in their real-life consequently affects the conducive environment of society by some planned happenings.Another clear reason is that the Increasing fees of schools for education, In result children of the indigent families are unable to go educational institutes and get a lot of free time to spend outside home with people with bad ethic values. For instance, many eminent schools continuously increasing their class fee by adding  additional charges of upmarket school infrastructure. They also planed special lunch for the students which are not possible to afford for every middle-class family, in consequence,families ask their kids to withdraw the school.",
        "The first solution is that the government should take some serious actions against entertaining programs that stimulate  bad content.Before telecasting any of the tv serials there should be a strict observation and approval strategy. For example, Country like china has a sensor board to give approval to the films before it going to release .Moreover, there should be some special programs for the school goer to teach the ethic and cultural values.",
        "The Second feasible solution is that education should be completely free and to make the school environment more prosperity, the Government should use some new methods which must be effective to grab the attention of pupils.Education is an essential way to teach kids moral values and ethics, how to respect of elderly? For instance, in countries like Canada, Education is completely free of cost  which also includes all latest technology, children spend most of their time in the educational departments to learn the new inventions, hence ,the crime rate is very low compared to other Asian countries.",
        "My opinion on those problems is that  there are many ways to solve sort of issues like Television and internet either by self-control or by parents or keeping the tab on children, as well as providing free education to everyone, crimes and disrespect, which is prevalent in society can be considerably decreased.",
        "To Conclude, there is a number of reasons why unethical behaviour and crime rate are continuously increasing in communities  and it can be tackled by a number of remedies"
