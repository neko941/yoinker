        "I'm an employee from your company in the position of Sales Accountant. I'm writing this letter to request you that this week Friday, my family and relatives are having a gathering dinner party at 6pm. The venue is just near here, 3 or 5 km from here, if I'm not mistaken. In this regard, I know those office hours are 10am to 8pm, hence, I'm asking if I can leave early on that day, so I can attend on the occasion. My parents rarely go out of the house now due to this pandemic and some of my relatives and siblings are busy at work or already have a family of their own. I promise to finish my paperwork before leaving. If there's anything that comes up, like signed documents, I already asked my colleague to just put it on my desk while I'm away.",
