        "I hope that you are keeping well. I\u2019m sorry that I couldn\u2019t write back to your letter before as you might be knowing that a wind storm has hit a few days back and it was a far too dangerous than it was thought of. I\u2019ve been staying at your place for more than a week now and before the storm it was all going pretty awesome. However, this storm has made most of the travelers journey miserable. The storm stroke us at a speed of 100km/hr. It is said to be the deadliest storm in the last 10 years.",
        "Because we\u2019d been told in advance about the storm by local authorities, we had prepared ourselves to counter it.  Even though we managed to save many of our goods, unfortunately, the furniture that had been placed outside got damaged. Additionally, some of the windows also have been broken.",
        "I\u2019ve tried to contact the local service providers to fix the windows and one of them has agreed upon fixing the windows next week. But, the broken furniture needs to be repaired by an expert to whom I couldn\u2019t reach. So, once you get back, see to it what can be done.",
        "Don\u2019t you worry about anything else. We\u2019re safe here. I\u2019ll update you further in the coming days.",
