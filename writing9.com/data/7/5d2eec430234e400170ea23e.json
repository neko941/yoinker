        "Never in the history has the influence of teachers on children been more visible. The impact of academic experts is indisputable while that of parents is of the same level. From my perspective, it would be adversely exaggerated to claim the superiority of teachers over parents.",
        "We have every reason to believe that teachers do influence children to a particular extent but do not possess total power over them. In particular, teachers are not only education providers but also great advisors for children. Despite the fact that children go to school everyday for academic knowledge and social skills, they are critically aware of what is being taught since they can tell right and wrong. Another point worth consideration is that some teachers go further than their duties and force children to take inappropriate tasks or implant things that are not suitable for students. This is the point when children go home and have a conversation about what happened at school. It should be borne in mind that parents know their children like the back of their hands so if anything wrong happens to them, they will see through immediately. Getting to the bottom of this dilemma, parents can take methods such as calling the police or having a word with the headmaster.",
        "There is some truth in the impact of teachers, but there is much to be said for parents. Although parents might not be able to spend enough time for children academic education like teachers do, they can teach children from daily life tasks such as housework or communication. These are invaluable knowledge that teachers can not spare time for when children are at school. Moreover, what should not be neglected is that parents know children better than teachers, so children are more likely to seek help from their parents rather than their teachers. All in all, there are things that teachers can implant but parents can not and reverse; therefore, there should be a balance between the impact of teachers and parents.",
        "In conclusion, it is ill-advised if one of the sources of influence is overpowering the other. Accordingly, I highly recommend this essay be taken in scrutiny to adopt suitable guidelines."
