Hence, before I go, I am planning to sell off a few things which include this television as there won't be anyone to use it after I leave.",

        "I will be finishing all my paperwork for the visa application by the end of this week, post which we can catch up. Therefore, if you are free, you can come over on Sunday to see the television. We can speak at length and then you can decide if you wish to purchase it or not.",
