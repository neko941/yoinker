        "Elders of over sixty-five years old are able to participate actively in life nowadays due to improvements in life expectancy as compared to the past. The impact of retired people living longer can lead to a plethora of advantages for society.",
        "One of the most obvious benefits that elders can bestow upon society is knowledge. Older people have already accumulated numerous experiences in life, both in the workplace and in their daily lives. Those experiences can be of great use to people around them and to their societies as well. For example, old teachers, doctors, and scientists have a lot of knowledge and experience in the workplace that cannot be easily obtained by younger people. In those professions, it is crucial for older people to advise those who are at the beginning of their careers since they require their guidance and assistance. In other words, the experience of the older generation is invaluable and can never be learned elsewhere.",
        "Furthermore, the older the people, the wiser they become. This wisdom, which is acquired through time, can be immensely helpful to families and people related to elders. For instance, when someone in the family is faced with a difficult decision or a challenge, the first person they would turn to is the oldest person they know. This is due to the fact that old people are trusted and are well known for their wisdom in life. This would lead to a healthy young generation since they were supported by their elders while growing up and were advised and supervised constantly.",
        "In conclusion, elders play a vital role in the development of a healthy and balanced society. With their life spans being lengthened, it is undeniable that older people contribute to the overall well-being of their societies and help numerous people around them."
