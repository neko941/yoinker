        "In this ceaselessly changing world, environmental problems have taken up the shape of a hideous monster. Some people support the idea of increasing the fuel prices for cars and other vehicles to curb this issue, but perilous gases from vehicles is not the only reason behind the current environmental conditions. This contentious topic has profoundly debated in several forums. I will reason my stance diligently before implicating a rational conclusion.",
        "We cannot conclude that the aggravation in fuel prices will help since vehicle by products are not the major contributor in the egregious pollution level. Instead, various other measures might prove to be more significant. For example, penalizing with hefty amounts can control the reckless burning of farmlands, near Delhi region, making the air quality critical. Educating the individuals and promoting the idea of planting more trees can mitigate the tremendously burgeoning level of pollution.",
        "Consumption of plastic is also worsening the existing problem. Banning plastic and moving towards cloth and paper products will support in reducing the ruckus. Industries and factories being the major pollution contributors should have a meticulous waste management system. Disposing of everything in the oceans is not the appropriate way. Recycling of resources should be given top priority.",
        "As it is rightly said, as you sow, so shall you reap. With our existing attitude towards environmental issues we might create a stifled condition for our coming generations. We should understand that there is enough for everyone\u2019s need but not for greed. It is high time that the resources are judiciously consumed, recycled and not wasted."
