        "Responsibility plays a vital role in everybody's life. Some communities believe that  In some ,areas offsprings are less responsible  compared to past times while some others argue with this matter and says that there is a change in children in a negative way. In this essay, I will discuss the scenarios and then I will give my opinion on this matter.",
        "On the one side, From the earlier to the present era there are great changes in everything. In the same way, there are also some changes in the responsibilities of a child. In some areas, due to  family problems parents' offspring are taking responsibility to take care of their family. For example, A person who has financial problems, takes responsibility to take care of their family and build standard life with their parents. In this way, It is a great change in a positive way.",
        "On the other side, Accompanied by positive change, negative change is also there in the world. This change depends on the behaviour of the children. This negative impact also occurs due to family problems only. For example, An elder child in a family feels very responsible to look after their family but a younger child feels that it is not his responsibility when there are financial problems.",
        "To sum up, I think the given statements are true. In this world, there is a negative side accompanied by a positive side. Responsibilities are big things to handle in everybody's life. Children will have an impact on their surroundings. They behave according to their environment. A positive environment gives positive whereas a negative environment gives negative change. But I think Everyone in this should feel responsible and build their life in a powerful manner."
