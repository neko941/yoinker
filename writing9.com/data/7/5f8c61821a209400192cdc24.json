        "Everyone and Everything has its place in nature. Protecting the wild animals is on us, people. I do not think that it is a waste of resources. It is our responsibility to save wild animals from going extinct.",
        "In the 20th century, many animals have been extinct. We saw it with our own eyes. In the 21st century, humans started to realize the problem in front of them. So they took certain measures for animals from going extinct. Moreover, we occupied the forests with  tall buildings. Wild animals have nowhere to go because we occupied their home and making them move to other places. Recently I have seen a video of elephant herd entering into a village in Thailand. People are scared to death and they urged officials to make their village safer. But the point they are missing is the area was actually forested a decade ago,humans occupied it with selfishness and greed.",
        "In addition to that incident, we are experiencing a lot of animals roaming around us. Some people killed those with reasons like fear, safety and fun. Hunters, they go into the forest and kill the wild animals for fun. They say it is for their safety. If that is the case, they should leave that place to animals instead of behaving like animals. Some people cutting down the forests for their gain.",
        "In my opinion, I believe we have to leave some of the places to wild animals. It is their right to have their home back. We, humans need to understand the importance of every living creature in this world. This earth is not only for humans but for everyone. I believe that this point should be in the human mind."
