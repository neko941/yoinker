        "Boxing is the physical sport that is played by two people in the ring until one is knocked down or cannot perform. People say that boxing is a vicious sport which always leads to physical wounds, but I think boxing is a good and entertaining game and it is appropriate. Likewise, In this essay, I am going to write why it should exist.",
        "Firstly, in boxing without getting any injuries, there is no option of winning. One should make other vulnerable and make him quit or lose the fight. For examples, MIke Tyson, a well known boxer and a great champion of his age, he mostly won his game by knockouts but some point he also have to suffer to win. Although it is a bloody athletic, it is a passion and whole growth, career for some peoples and making their good living form this.",
        "Secondly, boxing is an art and it is the duty of an artist to have some restriction in his art.",
        "There are news where people lost their lives while boxing or some have been crippled for their whole life. Likewise, there are many whose career has been destroyed by injuries. Having said that for this reason, there are many laws and rules have been enforced for the safety of the players. Many professional doctors are kept on the side in case of emergency,",
        "In conclusions, boxing is the profession of risk and there is risk in everything we do, however, the risk can be minimized and the sports should exist so that people with an interest can always enjoy it."
