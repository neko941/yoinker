        "Reading online on computers and traditional method of reading printed books for a child, which one to choose is always debatable. Most of them think that articles or materials which we get on the internet is the best method of reading, whereas others think that by buying a copy and learn to read would be the best style. This essay is going to discuss on the both ways of reading as well, going to provide with the opinion of the best process of reading for children.",
        "Displaying information online is one of most convincing ways of making kids to concentrate on reading.",
        "Because children usually likes or get attracted towards visual material, which are displayed on a screen. While online material also helps children not to carry heavy bags and books on their shoulders, which is one of the major concerns of the parents. Recent Harvard studies show that 70% of the kids are showing interest reading information on a computer. Provided that online reading is the most convenient and interesting fashion of reading in this generation for kids.",
        "In conversely, reading, through a newspaper or a book is the best and the most usual process of reading for children. Since the systematic and traditional manner of reading followed from ages through a scripted material or a written script. Whereas it is also a more convenient form of reading and you can carry the material where ever you want. As per the parents' survey done by Oxford University in the year 2019 says that, 50% parents like their children to stick with traditional and usual system of reading through material which, they think it\u2019s the right means of reading a publication. Few things wouldn\u2019t be changing through technology as the traditional approach outweigh the new approach of reading.",
        "In the above, I have discussed about the traditional way and online manner of reading information from kids. I particularly feel that reading through the traditional way of printed material is the most convincing method, I have come to this conclusion because of reading continuously online material could affect children's eyes but also ranging up with advanced methods is always inevitable."
