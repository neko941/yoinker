        "The laptop is a 15-inch black Dell, with a silver logo on the cover and a small Batman sticker (placed there by my son) at the bottom right-hand corner of the keyboard. The keyboard itself is worn with some of the letters missing. It should be easy to identify.",
        "I am a university researcher and, though on vacation, I had to work on a major project. I did not have the opportunity to upload this vital work to the Cloud, and thereby have a backup, so I genuinely need to recover the laptop as soon as possible.",
        "Could you please ship it to me by express mail? I will immediately transfer the full costs involved to a bank in your area. Please let me know you have the laptop and can send it, as well as the banking details.",
