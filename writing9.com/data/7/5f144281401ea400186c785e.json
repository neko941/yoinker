        "Nowadays, some people suggest that huge companies and industries should be established in rural areas rather than in urban areas. Despite having some problems, I personally believe that moving companies and industries to regional areas will bring a lot of advantages.",
        "On the one hand, relocating business outside cites will be a big challenge for some employees because this process will be complicated and expensive. Besides, losing many clients who live in cities will be the greatest threat to the economy of many enterprises. In addition, rural areas are widely rated for low facilities and lacking of skillfull workers. Moreover, the transition of companies and industries from urban areas to rural areas will wipe out natural spots and habitats of animals in this area.",
        "On the other hand, repositioning business to the rustic areas will be the enormous advantage for many owners because land prices are much lower in this area rather than in city centres. Therefore, the operating cost will be reduced by moving their business outside the cities. Furthermore, there will be a lot of job opportunities for workers in rural communities. So, the living standards will be higher than before. Likewise, air pollution will be reduced in urban centres which will be the greatest benefit for people in residential areas.",
        "In conclusion, although there have some drawbacks of relocating business outside the cities, I strongly opine that the economy of many business can be greatly improved by establishing companies and industries outside the cities and there will be many advantages not only for rural people but also for people in urban centres."
