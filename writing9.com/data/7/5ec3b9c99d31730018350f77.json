        "Environmental problems are the issue which needs proper consideration. Gone are the days when pollution level in the environment was less. Whereas nowadays,\u00a0 development in every sector lead to not only emission of toxic particles, but also use sums of garbage. It has been put forward that the bills of pollution should be paid by governments other than individuals. I disagree with this statement up to some extent.",
        "There is no doubt that for some people, companies and private individual should not pay the bills of pollution. The first and foremost reason\u00a0 is that since large scale industries are more participated to pollute the environment. Large scale industries pay bills, then smart scale is equally responsible for paying bills of pollution. Consequently,\u00a0 it causes arise many conflicts so paying bills of companies may be not a good solution. Second reason is the burden on the general public. A good illustration is that is mostly of pollution is carried out by transportation. As people will have to pay bills for this thing, increase burden on middle class or poor class family. As a result, individuals can not live a better lifestyle.",
        "However, there are a number of reasons that it is necessarily the best way. One approach is the industrialists pay for less amount of pollution bill.\u00a0 They will be established waste treatment plants. Due to this,the harmful wastage of products will be reduced in land as well as decreased the level of pollution. Another measure is, if an individual pay taxes for these things, then people may be reduced environment activities which is harmful to the environment. Such as, people can less utilise fossil fuel consumption.",
        "To sum up, the above-mentioned argument in a nutshell, it can be acknowledged that pollution is mammoth issue and the government should not leave it to individual and companies to pay its bill. It can However, make it mandatory for companies to set up effluent treatment plants so that pollution is minimised."
