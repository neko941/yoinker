        "The popularity of learning foreign languages is increasing from day to day. Several researchers suggest that a foreign language should be begun studying at primary school by children rather than in secondary school. This essay discusses whether or not the benefits outweigh the drawbacks.",
        "On the one hand, schoolchildren benefit from learning new languages at primary school. The most important factor is that children tend to learn a new language faster and easier rather than adults or teenagers. The website \"tessais.org\" claim that it is due to the fact that children's brains absorb any information that they see or hear. Furthermore,",
        "On the other hand, there are two main disadvantages related to the idea. First of all, communication difficulties are caused by learning more than 2 languages at the same time. As an example, this issue is very common in Kazakhstan since children begin studying two or three languages at primary school. The second drawback of this belief is that learning a foreign language may be a waste of time.  Secondary school students are more aware and they tend to decide by themselves which language  they to study than primary school students. For instance, it is known that most pupils had to learn German at school during the USSR. However, they couldn't use that language in daily life because of some problems, including an unimportant and reluctant attitude to the language.",
        "In conclusion, it is cannot be said that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages as it depends on an individual and parents. They should decide when a child will be ready to study foreign languages."
