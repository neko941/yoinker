        "In this era of technological Revolution learning about different Technologies is important. As English being considered as the \"Universal language \" the English learning is compulsory as well as vital. But, the understanding of local languages is also equally important. There are people with the belief that learning of local languages is useless However, I believe, it is an absurd thought and knowing the native speech is also equally crucial. My opinion is discussed further.",
        "Firstly, Yes, it is important for everyone to learn English. In this time where most of the organisations, private Institutions, government publications use English for conversation, It is undoubtedly crucial to know English. Without the understanding of this speech, you will feel left out and you will miss well known papers and books. Most of the knowledgeable news and discoveries published in English Which you will miss. For example, if you want to read about current things happening in the world, then you have to have the knowledge of the English speech.",
        "In addition, one should also have an understanding of local languages. The history of local areas and the neighbourhood is always in local language plus, conversation around nearby area is also not in English. So, understanding of own language is also necessary. But, due to craze of foreign culture, We are missing out the importance of native language. So, the survival of local languages is necessary. That's why, we should definitely try to ensure the survival of the local language. There are multiple ways of doing this. For example. We should make the teaching of local languages compulsory in each and every school. This is one of the many ways.",
        "To conclude, it is right to consider English as a first language, but it is also necessary to add native language in the syllabus of school as a second language. Since, It is so unlikely to happen, We should definitely try to ensure the survival of local languages."
