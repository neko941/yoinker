        "It is claimed by several  people that occupation options abroad and travelling are the single reasons to acquire a foreign language. While, some populations believe that there are other motives for learning new languages. I think that, language acquisition should also be observed from a different perspective, including its beneficial effect on the brain's function.",
        "On the one hand, the population of immigrants pursuing their career goals and international travels are increasing dramatically due to globalization besides facilitated transportation. Indeed , learning new languages is becoming a crucial skill. For example, individuals who are more fluent in communicating with native speakers in their workplace are able to overcome  challenges more facile. Subsequently, they will improve their career prospects year on year.",
        "On the other hand, enhancing memory, developing cognitive performances, moreover delaying brain ageing are some other efficient consequences of being multilingual. For instance, there has been some research asserting that learning a language reduces the risk of Alzheimer's disease and dementia. And it is  a great brain exercise during a human lifespan. Furthermore, communicating with people from different cultural backgrounds widens our horizons and definitely will boost our self-confidence.",
        "In conclusion, this essay discussed both aspects presenting the importance of learning other languages. However, achievement in work and travelling around the world are the major driving forces for enhancing language fluency overseas. People can gain other mental health benefits from this skill that in my opinion outweighs other advantages."
