        "Nowadays, it is observed that there is an upward trend among the societies in some different areas in the world that they want to realize the story behind their houses. In this essay , I will consider why this is happening and also explores some possible ways to research it.",
        "the main reason for this trend could be that , people really keen on finding the identity of their home. What I mean by this is that  some people especially younger people prefer to know the value of their home from a historical aspect. For example, in Iran, the majority of houses particularly the old buildings, have a history  them behind. As a result, people know the historical value of their house and try to preserve it. Another reason is when you find out about your possession's value, you will try to keep it as a valuable asset. For instance, in some countries, people buy valuable houses which have a story and it could be a fine example of a good investment. Consequently, most   people tend to know the history of their home.",
        "There are some possible solutions to find about the past of a house. For one, people could go to",
        "municipality of their town as the history of every single house is kept there. For another , most of the community in some cities, especially the small cities, know about the background of the houses. It can  lead to an acceptable result for the owners of these homes. Subsequently, people can use these methods and get some ideas about their houses.",
        "In conclusion, to reiterate there are some reasons for searching the history of some buildings which are the preservation and the financial investment. However, people can use some methods which are asking the people and municipality for more information. Should people consider these ways, they could find more impressive information."
