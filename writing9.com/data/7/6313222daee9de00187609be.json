        "Most people nowadays believe that the younger generation should volunteer for free in their spare time, which would benefit society. From my point of view, I agree with this idea for many reasons, as described in the following paragraphs.",
        "To begin with, people who work in their spare time for an unpaid wage are responsible for society. It is the community's intention to provide an opportunity to learn time management as well as various experiences, such as how to communicate with diverse people, compassion for one another, and unity to work well together, which are essential parts of becoming a reasonable person. In this regard, if a teenager adds information on their charity work in their leisure time, it will improve their portfolio and make it easier to apply to a famous university in the future. In addition, the community will get quality citizens.",
        "Furthermore, the teens will have connections with people who work in highly reputable companies, which can help the youngster by providing references and assisting in the search for a prestigious job. Moreover, adolescents who volunteer with a variety of organizations will aid in the discovery of their goals and the development of a path to achieve them because many of these organizations will teach valuable lessons, and then their parents will be proud of them.",
        "I personally agree with this viewpoint since it seems to me that the advantage of being young is that they can do charity work in their free time. It can benefit them and the city, which outweighs the disadvantages."
