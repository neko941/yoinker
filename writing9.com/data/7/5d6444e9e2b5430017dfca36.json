        "It is an era, where brand value gives utmost importance than anything else.",
        "The percentage of people buying branded goods are increasing exponentially, day by day.",
        "The fad is not only confined to usual commodities like clothes, but also to lavish products like cars, buildings and so on.",
        "The reasons that contribute to this trend are innumerable. Firstly, the public believes that, labelled items are more reliable and are of premium quality. For example, watches designed by Rolex are definitely unique and authentic.Also, it is effortless to buy trademarked things than searching for multiple alternatives available in the market, which offer the same items for a reasonable price. Secondly, it is often considered as a prestige issue by the mankind, ranging from juveniles to adults. For example, holding even an old version of the iPhone is much more valuable than mobiles like Motorola or Vivo.",
        "As per me, cons outweigh the pros in this scenario. Although, wearing or buying the expensive articles is not troublesome, but most of these are exported from various countries, thereby effecting the authenticity of their own nation's goods. For example, our traditional woven dresses and handloom sarees are not used by anyone these days, thereby bringing down the country's economy. It is a known fact, that cost increases with the demand and, the same in this situation also. Communities who cannot afford them are facing issues like depression and are feeling inferior.",
        "I conclude saying that, as we cannot completely eradicate the use of brands, it is beneficial if each individual spends the money in an effective way, considering all the available options, instead of running behind the mammoths."
