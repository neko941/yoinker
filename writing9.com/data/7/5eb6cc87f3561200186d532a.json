        "Environmental problems are increasing day by day in many parts of the world.  The majority of people are of the opinion that it is important to preserve the nature, while there are people who are of the viewpoint that there is no harm in utilizing the environment in the best possible ways to fulfil the necessity of the humans. In my perspective, fulfilling human needs and desires is important, but one should not ignore the safety of habitat as well.",
        "To begin with, there are people who think that it is important to preserve the environment for many reasons. Firstly, clean environment provides a basis for breathing and surviving. For example \u2013if there are numbers of trees surrounded around the city, you get to breathe fresh air. In other words, planting more trees will help in protecting our environment. Secondly, there should be proper handling of waste materials, such as disposing and recycling them properly. For instance \u2013 people should buy recycled products or paper bags which can be disposed easily and avoid using plastic bags",
        "However, some people have the viewpoint that it is beneficial to take into consideration human needs as well. Humans rely on environment for many reasons like furniture\u2019s, papers, food, water, fuels For example, through a balanced deforestation and afforestation one is able to have a win - win situation furthermore, the government plays a pivotal role in maintaining the environment by introducing laws, create awareness among people.",
        "To conclude, the combined efforts of the government and the public will help in preserving our environment and human needs."
