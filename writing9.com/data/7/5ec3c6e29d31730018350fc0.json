        "In the contemporary world, the concern for the degrading habitat is at the peak. Some people believe it is difficult for an individual to make a difference, while others feel it cannot be solved without authorities intervening in the matter. This essay will discuss both sides in detail before a conclusion is reached.",
        "",
        "On the one hand, there is an ongoing discussion on an appropriate role of the authority regarding saving the environment from global warming. Therefore, industrial construction related activities cannot commence without the approval of the government. As half of the population of our country is currently reeling with water related crises, abnormally high temperature, deforestation and melting of Himalayan glaciers, this issue cannot be ignored. It is the duty of our government to take immediate actions involving the signing of petitions, treaties, saving wildlife and the land. For instance, they can promote usage of solar energy and also ban industries from dumping industrial waste in the water bodies.",
        "On the other hand, however, managing environment issues cannot be successful until and unless the individuals take an interest in it. Being a member of society, everyone is equally responsible for their environment. As \u2018Every drop of water makes the mighty Ocean\u2019, an individual can make personal efforts such as avoiding usage of plastic items, keeping their neighbourhood clean and reusing products. For instance, tiny steps like taking car-pools instead of personal vehicles to work can also be implemented.",
        "In my opinion, if the government and the citizens play their part simultaneously, without blaming each other. It would definitely bring a positive effect on the environment. The government can impose laws to prevent environmental degradation while awareness and education among the citizens can have a significant effect on such issues. By modifying their lifestyle and living habits we can help save the environment."
