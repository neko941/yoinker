        "Education plays a vital part in the life of every                                                                                                                                                                                                                               student. There are some scholars who believe that gaining knowledge from  institutions is the leading way to a well-established future, whereas others opine that getting experience after studying is paramount. Both the views shall be discussed in detail along with my perspective on the dilemma of a successful life.",
        "It is worth considering that for dominant career people need to acquire a degree from the university in their respective field of interest. To move ahead in the cut-throat competition, individuals are obliged to attain higher literacy. For instance, if the individual wants to attain a higher position in any company, the minimum requirement is a master's degree from a reputed university. Therefore, to go ahead of their peers one needs the finest discipline.",
        "On the other hand, experience in any discipline would be fruitful in the long run. Gaining experience after schooling makes the mind of the children more creative and innovative. To exemplify, in the recent studies by Forbes, it was shown that the students who explore after high school, tend to have strong problem-solving abilities. Thus, practical knowledge is way more rewarding than monotonous",
        "study in the same domain.",
        "To conclude, some of the skills do require more education credentials",
        "however, other programs are eligible even after the completion of high school. According to me, pupils ought to consider the requirement in the  field of work and prepare it accordingly. Moreover, to excel in their domain both factors need to be considered."
