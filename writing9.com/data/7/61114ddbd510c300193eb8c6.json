        "Nowadays, parents have the option of educating their children in single-gender as well as co-ed schools. While some people believe that the teenagers who had done their schooling from gender-isolated institutes have some advantages in future, I would strongly argue that the drawbacks of this education outweighs its benefits.",
        "To begin with, personnel who do not have mixed-gender schooling backgrounds might not be able to communicate effectively in a workplace. The reason for this is, these folks have no experience in interacting with the opposite gender. For instance, the male employees who have never talked to females in their academics, feel hesitant when talking to their female co-workers. In contrast, if these male employees studied along with young ladies in their childhood, they would feel comfortable in dealing with their female colleagues, leading to efficient interactions and thus rise in their productivity.",
        "Furthermore, teenagers with same-sex learning can face problems with finding a suitable life partner in their adult life. This is because, since these individuals do not have any experience with the other sexuality, therefore they lack confidence while meeting with human beings of opposite gender. One clear example is, women educated from girls-only institutes are probably not themselves and might act weird around a man while going on a date. If these women had done mixed-sex schooling, they would have felt a lot more comfortable in dating and thus finding the right partner.",
        "In conclusion, it is my firm opinion that the individuals who had educated from single-gender institutes might not only face problem in dealing with opposite gender colleagues due to insufficient experience but also they are unlikely to succeed in dating and find true love due to their lack of confidence."
