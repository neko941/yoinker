        "Nowadays, that families tend to eat together less frequently has gained popularity. This essay will present some grounds for this trend and identify possible effects.",
        "The given problem can be attributed to two main reasons. To begin with, people have become busier and busier with their hectic schedules and heavy workloads in our fast-paced society. Consequently, sitting down with their family members might not be a convenient choice. Instead, these individuals frequently eat out with their peers, colleagues or business partners near their school or workplace, which can fit their schedule more. On top of that, the fast food culture of modern life can change people\u2019s eating habits given that fast foods have become ubiquitous in most countries, especially developed countries like America. For example, youngsters in Vietnam often grab a quick meal after a busy day at work or school, which leads them to skipping meals with their family when going home.",
        "The trend has both positive and negative influence on citizens. In terms of benefits, people are able to be much more flexible with their time. They will not have to show up at a fixed hour to have meals with their family and can eat whenever and whatever they want. However, in terms of the downside, this can lead to a weaker family bond. If a family continuously eats separately, family members might not be able to show their thoughts, feelings with one another, and therefore may feel isolated from each other. This will result in a lack of deep family connection.",
        "In summary, for the aforementioned arguments, the tendency of family members not gathering at meals is mainly because of the difference in their schedules or the preference to eat fast food, which can have both positive and negative impacts."
