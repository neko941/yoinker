        "Nowadays animal is becoming an essential part of our daily life. It is often argued that staying with a beast is virtue for babies. This view is supported by some others have a strong counter argument that, it is harmful and detrimental. According to my perspective, it is righteous for children to carry a pet.",
        "Bringing a pet such as cat or dog is beneficial in several ways. First and foremost, through maintaining a pet at home parents can teach their children a sense of responsibility. In other word, by treating an animal in a well efficient manner family can create a moral example. To illustrate, by this child can get to know that how to accomplish a numbers of responsibility that they have. Beside this, not only this but parents also make sure that children have a such an upright company. Which make them even more entertain rather than human. It is obvious that why this point of view has generated a more support.",
        "On the other hand, some of them might consider a pet as a worst. They think make children to live with an animal may threaten. For instance, if children, play with them it may be possible that an animal like a dog, bite them, as a result they have to face a lot trouble. Despite this, as children continue to play with pets in a longer period of time they flooded with certain diseases. Therefore it is a comprehensive why this is a popular opinion among many.",
        "To conclude this, after musing both sides of the case, I believe that,  pet is good as children can learn responsibility and they can better entertain. There is sufficient evidence to demonstrate this."
