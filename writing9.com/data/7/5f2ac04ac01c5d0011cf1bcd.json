        "It is important to consider how school going children and staff of any institution commuting every day. Although advocates of long distance journey believe that this can enhance their social life, others think that this can cause only damaging effects. I, personally, support the latter's viewpoint.",
        "On the one hand, those who think  that the commuting hours can be utilized as a productive time. This can be done by different ways. Firstly, listening to music can aid to relax both workers and students, after a hectic day. Eventually, the relaxed mind can be recharged, due to this, they would be active in their home or hostel and able to do  household work as well  homeworks. Secondly, this is the best time for the socialization by making  friendship with other commuters during the travelling. They can meet like- minded people and share various thoughts, for instance, sharing books, DVD's, and cooking recipes. By considering, all these factors,  some people think that long commuting hours  can be fruitful.",
        "On the other hand, some people consider staying a long distance from the school or office can have detrimental effects on both  employers and employees. This is because after the journey, usually, people get tired and they cannot concentrate their tasks as compared to those who live near by. As a result, the productivity would be significantly reduced, ultimately the business or educational firms may not be achieved their target. For instance, some studies have suggested that  tiredness and weakness can result in poor performance and productivity.",
        "In conclusion, staying away from a home or school can have some merits, according to some, while others, opponents of this viewpoint that this can lead to have severe damage to professional and personal life."
