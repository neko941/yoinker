        "Actually, I used my card last time in the college library to access the computer system and I lost it there.I went to ask for the reception but nobody returned them. I really need the student card because I have to take my annual exam next week and the examiner will not allow me to sit in the examination without an ID card.Even I am not able to study in the library though paid for one month so that I can prepare better for passing the test.",
        "I would really appreciate if you can share what documents I will need to apply and how much it will cost me? I look forward to your response soon.",
