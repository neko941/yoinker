        "Nowadays child labour Is the biggest concern to think, especially in poor countries. Some sets of people argue that it is unfair to them while, other sets of group have opined that it is a learning experience for taking accountability. I believe strongly that child's exertion is not good.",
        "Nevertheless, In developing countries, people are economically weak and they have no option. They have to send their children to do paid work. To give a clear example, In one lower class family if there are more numbers of family members. And one of them is facing severe illness and only one man is working as a servant with minimal pay. In this situation they have to send his baby for slavery. To conclude, this type of families believes that working in childhood makes their baby experienced and will be beneficial in the future.",
        "However, any other middle class and higher class society think that child labour is a crime. Government of many countries considers this as a crime. Now that, it is crucial to save the rights of children. To illustrate, Suppose in the small age, they start working, they have to leave their education. Thus they cannot develop. They can not be able to get reputed job in future. In addition, this will also effect on the development of the nation. Therefore, Child education is necessary for the  improvement of themselves as well as for their countries.",
        "In conclusion, Child-labour is harmful to children's education and mental development of them. However, the number of people argue that it is a helpful experience of taking responsibilities while others deny this position. I emphasize my opinion that child labour is unjust."
