That is to say, older employees who are nearing retirement or working beyond the acceptable retirement age, are not just causing a threat to many young graduates of joblessness, but adding to the social stigma such as unemployment.",

        "To conclude, there are some issues due to ageing crowd affecting both people and the society, but with proper checks in place the risks can be controlled and turned in favour of the country and its citizens.",
