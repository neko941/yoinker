        "Studying is one of the most important things in everyone\u2019s life and there are many arguments about this. Some people believe that teaching children at home is best for a child's development while others think that it is important for children to go to school. This essay will discuss the advantages of both types, which one is good over the other.",
        "On the one hand, studying at home, children will be taught by their parents-who understand them the most. The lesson will be created based on the child's ability. For example,if a boy is having difficulty with Math, his parents can teach him to guide children from places they don't understand. Learning at home may not be limited by time and can teach the subjects that need attention.The tots study at home more conveniently in terms of time and learning styles.  In addition, houses keep kids safer and steer clear of bullying. Consequently, education just got easier.",
        "On the other hand, a school is a common option for parents because of the educational environment or maybe they are not being able to teach their child. At school, children  have the opportunity to contact friends and teachers and to exchange experiments. The child will learn how to interact with people and treat them in a variety of situations. In order to help the class go easier, the school additionally furnished a variety of tools. However, the school has many problems. Example school violence and racism are  typical issues that are being taken seriously.",
        "In conclusion, teaching children at home or taking them to school has both advantages and disadvantages. But normally parents often take kids to school because life\u2019s busy."
