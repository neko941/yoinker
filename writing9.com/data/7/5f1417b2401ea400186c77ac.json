        "Recently, there has been a growing rise in the number of short business and sightseeing trips. In general, it\u2019s good to come into contact with people from different cultures, however, the quality of communication is dependent on the duration of it.",
        "Initially, better communication skills can be considered as the potential benefit of being in contact with the new culture. If passengers are unable to obtain information about beliefs, customs, the history and eating habits of the host country, they would probably encounter with serious problems during their travel. For this reason, the knowing each other session is included in the most business trip schedule. Due to widespread use of the internet individuals become more knowledgeable and thereby passengers likely attempt to learn as much as possible about the host society. Therefore, this approach helps them exchange views and opinions more effectively.",
        "Additionally, being culturally aware businessmen may able to identify new markets and develop products in accordance with new culture requirements and needs.",
        "On the other hand, it takes a considerable amount of time to get accustomed to the new environment. Due to some problems such as feeling of loneliness and depression one makes a wrong decision based on casual observation. Since people make generalization about what they experienced which are not true. Therefore, being open-minded and well-informed has been necessary to make a right decision about the host country.",
        "By way of conclusion, the benefits of having contact with other culture is undeniable, however, it seems to me that being well-acquainted with the foreign culture can be a long process and should not just be based on a couple of limited experiences."
