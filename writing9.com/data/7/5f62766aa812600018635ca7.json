        "There is no doubt that the latest technological advancement improves our quality of life. However, there are some people who think that this cutting-edge technology widens the gulf between  the rich and the poor, in  my opinion, I firmly object this argument  because after the development, even, the economically stricken people also get equal opportunities.",
        "On the one hand, those who think the internet has revolutionised the way we live. In other words,  now, it is possible for anyone can contact their friends and family who live another part of the world through  online services. similarly, booking and travelling of air ticket were  only affordable, irrespective of  their social class. For example, in the past, it was expensive to possess a land phone at  the home, but currently, almost everyone has  personal phones. This piece of equipment can use to control the day to day affairs more effectively as  any rich man does.",
        "On the other hand, opponents of the above- mentioned argument point out that many  new gadgets  are so expensive that can be purchased by the elite members of  society. The reason is that these are meant only to make a ife of rich even comfortable and  elegant. For instance,  many modern kitchen appliances are bought by them, and used on a regular basis.  Apart from this,  learning how to incorporate these devices  in houses are taught in private schools that never can be seen in  public schools, since  it is not for the poor.",
        "In conclusion, people have a different concept whether the technology has beneficial impacts on humans or this increased the gap between various social class.  I strongly think that this enhanced the quality of life in all sectors of people. and minimised the differences."
