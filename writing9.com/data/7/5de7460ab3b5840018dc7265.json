In the past, adults got married at the ages of 25, and it was quite late if you hadn't had a husband or a wife until 30 years old. Take my friend Jane, for example, she married my father while she was 32 years old, while her sisters all had husbands at the ages of 23. However, in the society now civilian are ready to have a family after 30. Therefore, they may pregnant around 35, which is 10 years later than our parents' generation. Besides, young couples now more care about their careers than pregnancy. Some of them said, they haven't prepared to take the responsibilities to be parents.",

Therefore, the children could have a better growing environment. By contrast, the disadvantages are the dangers for the mature women pregnant. Moreover, it is a challenge for older adults to take care babies as well, which needs healthy and strong bodies.",
        "To conclude, there is not to say that having kids in their later ages is totally without merit. Nevertheless, the parents need to take the challenges and well prepared their health for their energetic children."
