        "Owing to the surge in industrialisation, the demand for fossil fuels has also increased.  For this reason, utilisation of renewable sources is encouraged in comparison to non-renewable sources. In my opinion, this is a positive development as non-conventional resources are not only reusable but can also mitigate environmental pollution.",
        "To begin with, the first reason to support my view is that the energy provided by the sun, wind, and ocean can be used again and again. This is because these sources are eternal and everlasting and there is no issue of their depletion; therefore they can serve mankind for many years. To exemplify, a USA study found that renewable energy can easily provide up to 80 percent of US electricity until 2050.  In contrast, coal, petroleum and oil are non-renewable as they take thousands of years to form; thus, the over-consumption of these resources can possibly lead to their extinction in the coming years.",
        "Second, my viewpoint is further bolstered by the factor that these resources do not pollute the environment. The reason for this is that the production of solar, ocean, and wind power, do not emit any harmful gases such as carbon dioxide and methane which can pollute the environment. For instance, according to research by the department of International Renewable Energy Resources in the USA, the usage of solar power can reduce the annual carbon emissions by 25 percent. Alternatively, while using fossils, a large amount of carbon emits into the air which pollutes the environment to a large extent.",
        "In conclusion, although setting up of solar panels, and windmills require surplus financial assistance, in my perspective, once installed, these plants tend to provide a number of benefits such as clean environment and reusability of resources. Hence, in comparison to fossil fuels, there should be more consumption of renewable sources."
