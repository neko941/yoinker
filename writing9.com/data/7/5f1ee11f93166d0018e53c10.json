        "It is not a secret that, health is the most important aspect of human life. It is not a secret that, by some individuals argues that the average standard of health of individuals will deteriorate. I agree with this statement, because the many types of fast foods are eaten by teenagers. So, due to eating fast foods, the power of the people will decrease. I will explain with reasons in the essay, why I agree.",
        "In the 21st century, the industry of food is developing and the industry in the top. However,the fast food is spreading sharply around the world. Unfortunately, the many types of foods such as pizza, hamburger are harmful for health of individuals, but the major part of people like eating the fast food especially teenagers when individuals do not have time for cooking. As a result, adults buy the such kinds of fast foods and teenagers are getting used to eating fast food products. It should be mentioned that, people are prone to diseases related to cardiovascular disorders because of the high salt and high sugar content found in these junk food products.",
        "Moreover, the stress related disorders are also becoming more common nowadays. Everyone has problems and the main part of individuals think about the difficulties during the day, as a result the human stressed daily. So, daily stresses cause fatigue in a person and insomnia, heart disease.",
        "To sum up, I agree with the arguments that average of health standard of human of life will decrease in the future. In the future, consumption of the fast food will grow and the contact exposure to stress will likely contribute to the decline of the average standard of health of many people in the coming years."
