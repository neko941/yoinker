        "It is often argued that nations have a responsibility to provide aid to each other, while some thinks that donated money are misused by national and local officials, for that reason, foreign aid is not and should not be given to developing countries. This essay will discuss both opinions before giving a conclusion.",
        "On the one hand, accepting international aid is a big advantage, especially for smaller countries. It is a tool to decrease poverty, in which sufficient supplies are loaded, like medical supplies, food and services. In addition, funds given by another state can help improve education and infrastructure projects that could boost the employment and economy of the country.",
        "On the other hand, it is commonly seen in the news and also well-known by the majority of people that several government officials are corrupt. They steal the funds that are given by other nations and use them for their personal gains. For example, Typhoon Haiyan last 2013 destroyed an area in the Philippines. Many livestock, possessions and houses are destroyed, a great number of dead people are on the streets and those that survived we're begging for help. Several nations donate assistance, like money, food, water, etc, however, no aid was provided to the city because the government kept it to themselves. What is more, a country that offers foreign aid sometimes wants an interest in return. They keep providing assistance to poor nations, in order to exploit them and become independent from others.",
        "In my opinion, it is better for a country to not seek foreign aid, especially if the citizens have become too dependent on other states instead of standing up on their two feet."
