        "Many would agree to the fact that the overall weight of the people is rising, along with their deteriorating health and physical strengths. In my opinion, the exploitation of the technology in an unsustainable way is the major culprit for this situation. This essay will discuss various reasons for the above notion and remedies to curb it.",
        "To begin with, a predominant reason for the soaring obesity in the society is a contemporary stressful lifestyle. Momentarily, people are more focusing on their professional life, without concerning their health. Consequently, most of the people rely on the junk food and avoiding to allocate ample time for the routine exercise. For instance, the researchers had revealed from their survey that, the modern unhealthy food habit and sedentary lifestyle is the prime reason for obesity and many health related issues. Moreover, the technology has introduced many gadgets to fulfil our life with ease. As a result, the obesity has become a common characteristic of a person and his health is demising.",
        "However, this potential threat to the people can be mitigated by conducting some preventive steps. The most effective remedy is to inculcate the habit of consuming healthy homemade food, as well as devote some time for the physical exercise. Although, the people have to chase their fast paced life, they should take care of their health and diet to remain energetic and productive. For example, a person with good health and fitness will merely take a sick leave from the workplace. As a result, his professional career will be flourished with his hard work. Thus, by concerning few things the issue of overweight and poor health can be curbed.",
        "In conclusion, it is indeed true that the health is wealth. The exorbitant numbers of overweight people are a major concern for the society. I firmly believe that, the non-sedentary lifestyle and nutritious food habits could eradicate the potential decease and obesity from the community."
