        "In recent times, raising kids has become a tough phase of the parent's life. Some are of the view that parents should necessarily opt for an appropriate training program in order to develop their kids. I am in complete agreement with the above viewpoint as it can help guardians to understand their kid's behavior and manage their diet.",
        "First and foremost, the key reason why I believe that mother and father should go to a parenting course is that it can help them understand their kid's actions. This is because toddlers usually use a variety of signs to communicate during their initial days. For example, pupils generally cry a lot when they catch cold or experience sleepiness. Thus, these sought of programs are of paramount importance to get to know the child better and provide them with an adequate response.",
        "Furthermore, another significant reason would be that it can help them to figure out healthier food and supplies. Th\tis is because a wide number of people does not generally aware of the nutrients which are essential in the development of a kid's brain and body. To illustrate, as per the recent report by P&G, more than half of the brain development of a child happens within the first few years of his or her biological age. Hence, it is crucial to know which food and supplement is best for the development of a pupil.",
        "To conclude, it is believed that parents should join tuition classes to learn about how to raise a child. I certainly believe in this thought as it can help parents to understand their sign languages and can grasp a deep understanding of relevant and nutritious food supplies."
