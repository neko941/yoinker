        "I am writing with regard to discontinuing my Gold Premium membership at the Gymkhana Club.",
        "My name is Jerry Brown, and I am a premium member of the club. Although I availed this membership about 6 months back only, I would have to discontinue because of some personal reasons. Since I pay for it on a quarterly basis, I believe all my dues are clear till date. Still, if there is anything that I have to settle before leaving, then please let me know.",
        "I would like to share my experience while I was a part of the club. I thoroughly enjoyed visiting the place in the evenings. As the amenities at the club are stupendous, more and more people are opting the club over others in the town. Undoubtedly, it is a premium one where one can avail various facilities from sauna to gym and much more.",
        "Unfortunately, I am moving to another town because I have changed my job. As the club is not available there, I do not have any other option but to cancel my membership for the future. I would definitely give your club a five-star rating and would recommend it to my friends in town.",
        "For further communication, you could contact me on the number in club's records. It was pleasure being a part of the club.",
        "Yours sincerely,",
