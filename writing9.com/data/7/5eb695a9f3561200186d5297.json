        "Some people argue that accessing to university is a right of all people no matter poor or rich, and government should provide the opportunity for all people to study free in university. However, I believe it is not reasonable and practical to allocate budget to all people for attending to university.",
        "On the one hand, it is true that all people should have a right to have access to university and to educate during their life because educated people have a higher chance to be employed since nowadays most jobs require academic qualifications. For example, for getting jobs with a high social status, which is well-paying such as doctor, lawyer and engineer. As a result, without such founding poor section of society would be perpetuated and society as a whole would suffer; therefore, low income background families would not have an opportunity to develop their talent and level of life.",
        "On the other hand, it is not reasonable rich people have an opportunity for studying free in university same as poor people. For instance, some people are not interested in studying in university and have an academic knowledge in their life, so allocating money to all people without considering to financial background is a waste of money. As a result, government  fund some people that do not have enough money for attending to university but they are enthusiastic. In addition, government can provide scholarships for intelligent people with new ideas",
        "In conclusion, I believe, although attending to university is a right of all people poor or rich, but it is not necessary government support all people in society because it is not practical and beneficial for society."
