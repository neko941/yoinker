        "I am a professor of history at Wilson College for the past five years. Moreover, I have researched and published many articles about the historical background of India. Therefore, I would be speaking about the rich culture and heritage of India. As you know that India has been the centre for import, export as well as trade for centuries. Additionally, I would also be including the lifestyle, tradition as well as ethnicity during earlier ages. Lastly, it would be about the importance of preserving such details and monuments of the historical era.",
        "Since, I would be presenting my studies as well in my discourse, so I was hoping that you could arrange a projector for me and also a pointer would be very appreciated. Thank you for your consideration. I am very thrilled to get the opportunity to deliver a lecture in America.",
