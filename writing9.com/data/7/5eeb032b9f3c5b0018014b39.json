        "People facing many issues such as traffic jams, crime, travel cost and time, while they move from small towns to bigger cities. Some people believe that the government should motivate people to move to regional cities. However, I do not agree on this. In my opinion government bodies should tackle this problem with improving infrastructure and installing CCTV cameras.",
        "To begin with, traffic jams are one of the main problems people are facing in bigger cities. There are hundreds of vehicles on the road which causes traffic jams and there are many consequences of this such as office goners not reaching their offices on time.  To exemplify, according to a survey in India, an average citizen spends one hour daily in traffic jams. Secondly, the law violation ratio is higher in metro cities as compared to small towns. People often keep guns to protect themselves, which have many other consequences.",
        "I do not agree that government bodies should encourage people to move to regional cities. In my opinion, authorities should tackle these problems via building better infrastructure for their citizens. Building better roads, highways, rail lines can solve traffic problems. Secondly, the government should install CCTV cameras on main roads and markets so criminals can be captured. It motivates and encourages people and they feel safe in cities. Another solution to crime can be deployed cops at the main intersection of cities and famous places. Citizens would feel safe when they see police there.",
        "To conclude, crime and traffic are major issues people are facing in metro cities. However, installing CCTV cameras, deploying cops and building better infrastructure can solve this problem."
