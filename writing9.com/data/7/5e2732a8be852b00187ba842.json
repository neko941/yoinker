        "Dear Mr.Walker",
        "This is Asma ,a current student of Business administration at Loren Brusque University . I'm wirting this letter because of the Announcement I've seen early this morning on The University's Notice Bored,after having seen your advertisement about The Quality Assurance Manager, I would like to apply for it. I will finish my Master year in this major this semester, only after sumbit the graduation project. The Main reason why i'm confidint about my abilities to do just great in this job is, as well as my study and Marks are succesd, I have  a part-time job where I teach some of the new students who share the same major as me, which helped me to get a clear Background of these kind of works, having enough Experience by managing  many different factors  at the same time.  Having a good Leadership, social and Honest Persona add points to me, which I Believe fits The Vacancy pretty well. Lastly I would deeply appreciate it if you choose me for this great job, I can't wait to hear from you and attend the Interview, Please contact me if you need any more information, Thank you.",
