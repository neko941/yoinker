        "Nowadays, people rely on their mobile phones in their daily lives. We prefer to use instant messages to communicate rather than face-to-face communication over this decade. From my perspective, it is true that  mobile phones become one of the essential items that we cannot live without it. Let me illustrate my perspective in the below paragraphs.",
        "First of all, people prefer to instant message via Whatsapp to communicate with each other first. Sending an instant message to friends can save time to express their opinions without affecting friends and relative's daily schedules. People can reply to their messages freely when they have free time that base on their own schedules. Picking up a call might be in covenant as they might be busy. Moreover,  people might not live in the same place, therefore, we can use mobile phones to keep in contact with friends and relatives without any time constraints as long as we have smartphones on hand. For example, we might prefer to use facetime, which can show the image to relatives about our surroundings, even though we are living abroad. During the pandemic, people cannot go to travel due to countries' strict travel policies, which can affect our daily lives. Using smartphones is a great tool, which can make people are still closely connected.",
        "On the other hand, some people might not prefer to use instant message apps via mobile phones, especially, elderly people. Elderly people might have certain  difficulty learning new things, especially, technology. They need time to get used to learning technology. Using instant message apps, means their relatives and friends need to have basic knowledge of how to use their mobile phones. However, elders might not be capable to learn new things. Obviously, they might prefer to have face-to-face communication as they might prefer to hang out with friends for gathering even though advanced technology has improved our society. In reality, face-to-face communication could be considered to be one of our essential social activities. In the retirement age, we might have more time to have social activities compared with the workforce stage. Because of this, mobile phones or instant messages might not be treated as an essential item for the elderly.",
        "In conclusion, we can identify the mobile phone as part of an essential item in most people's lives. In fact, no matter how  advanced technology could be improved our daily lives, we cannot only rely on the mobile phone as face-to-face or social activities are important to make people  connected."
