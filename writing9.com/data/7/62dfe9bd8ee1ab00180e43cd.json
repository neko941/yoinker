        "Punishment during an offensive attack always seems to be a debatable topic.Several individuals are at the notion that hanging to  death is a favourable way to prevent further attacks whereas;another group of people acclaimed that life-long imprisonment would serve as a better yardstick .Hence ,apart from my ,,opinion both viewpoints are elaborated further.",
        "Surging criminal activities enforces legislation to create  stringent laws and regulations.To commence with ,capital punishment would create a great impression on  society.This is to state that an individual would be afraid before attempting a crime .Even though it would help to decline the criminal rate.For instance ,hanging culprits to  death will create a sense of fear among other commuters and therefore , reduce theft.However ,it would reduce government avenues.The reason is authorities used to spend a wholesome amount of money towards the refurbishment of jail ,organising monthly checkups as well as providing foodstuff kinds of stuff.These activities require a huge amount to be spent.Hence hanging the culprit to death enhances government to save avenues which might be useful to  society in a different way .",
        "On the contrary view ,another group of people acclaimed that they should be given  life-long imprisonment .The foremost reason is they would learn few vocational skills .To add to this behind the lockup they are provided with a plethora of activities which helps individual to develop social and technical abilities in order to earn their livelihood .Furthermore ,  life-long imprisonment would reduce upcoming terrible attacks.That is felon would not be able to convey evil thoughts to other residents and thus benefit  society in a long run.To illustrate,a criminal is under  constant supervision of an officer as a result would not be able to convey thoughts to others .",
        "In conclusion , the government should deliver punishment according to the severity of the crime ; individuals possess.However ,in regards to a rape or murder case capital punishment seems to be a better option while burglary and pocket stealers should be provided with life-long imprisonment."
