In addition to this, children can be benefited with the facilities which, otherwise may not be available in their own country.",
        "Children cannot tackle with the unfavorable conditions, that may arise due to separation with their loved ones. Therefore, this may have a negative impact on their studies and may feel lonely, as children are sensitive and emotionally attached with their family members. For example, if either of the parent move abroad to work for the long term then, children may feel depressed as they are living apart. As a result, the child may become dull and gloomy.  This, in turn, will have a negative effect on his life.",
