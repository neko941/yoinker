        "People have different views about the role of museums in society. Some of them think that museums are the places where people should be educated, while others opine that they should be enjoyable. Although education tends to play a larger part, I believe museums can serve equal purposes.",
        "On the one side of the argument, it is argued that the museums should focus on entertaining. Firstly, museums are considered to be tourist attractions where interesting objects can be displayed that many individuals want to see. Should people listen or read too much educational content, they may become bored, thus museums go to the extra miles to teach them in an enjoyable way such as organizing games. Secondly, most of the museums have free entrances, so they have to balance their budget. For example, if they operate more activities to attract many visitors, they would get an additional entry fee to cover costs.",
        "On the other side of the argument, education has a radical role to be paid attention by museums. There is to say that the aim any collected exhibition should be to inform people with what they did not know before. This means staff members working in the museums need to explain all the artifacts or sculptures in detail, moreover headsets are provided for whom detailed commentaries are given about exhibition. In other words, there are people who are interested in different fields of history. Hence, museums invite specialists to give a speech about the archeology or historical jewellery which is informative as well.",
        "In conclusion, it seems to me that museums should be both educational and entertaining where people can acquire any information in an enjoyable way."
