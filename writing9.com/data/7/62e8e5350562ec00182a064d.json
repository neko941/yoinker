        "With the development of modern transportation, people think that countries should invest more bills in rail lines instead of highways and ridings. My view is that I partially agree with this opinion, and governments should develop both two transportations.",
        "It is clear that developing rail transport can reduce the pressure on the roads. This is because, due to the increasing numbers of personal vehicles, traffic jam and utilization of fossil fuels has become common. As a result, spending more cash on the construction of rails can enhance public transportation,  protect the environment by decreasing  air pollution and save oil resources.",
        "Furthermore, producing more high-speed trains can stimulate the economy in urban cities and rural areas by offering jobs to construction workers. This also means that, when the trains are operated, people can travel alongside the rails which can bring business, trade, and develop tourism to make an economic contribution. More specifically, labour can leave undeveloped areas and be sent to developed places, where people can find occupations to get salaries.",
        "It is also true that governments will utilize more bills, labour, and time when building rail lines that will waste more resources rather than in ridings. In some poor and mountainous provinces, the situation there may be more suitable and easier to construct roads instead of tracks.",
        "In my view, countries should construct tracks to perfect the public traffic ways. Meanwhile, we cannot ignore the great investment and waste of resources used in lines. To develop the economy and make lives more convenient, governments should spend funds to build both these transportations in suitable places."
