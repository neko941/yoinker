        "Many regions are having analogous traits. This might be explained by the public that is sharing the same fashionable trend through internet. This made the public forum unifying aesthetic to select the items. I utterly believe that this will bring pernicious development on different aspects of a contrary.",
        "",
        "As tradition is the basis for a contrary, it is inextricably chained hereditary artefact. While people are effortless to reach each corner of the world, global promotion will bother the public in purchasing. For instance, the internet creates a comprehensive range of contemporary substitutes for consumers. This is severely threatening the coverage of traditional objects. At the same time, the craftsman will coerce to gradually disappear. When the trait of each contrary is overlapped, the world will be just for lack of richness and diversity.",
        "Other than that, tourism would be damaged by lacking of discrepancy, the curiosity of foreigners will diminish. Because travellers are reluctant to explore a place where they have visited in advance. Without any imagination for unspecified areas, this couldn\u2019t bring up the visitors to investigate. To watch homogenous views and product is pointless to tour another area. In addition, some of the emerge contraries rely on tourism to sustain their economy. They couldn\u2019t be beneficial from souvenirs with null number of travellers.",
        "As it can be viewed, albeit the technology helps the public to purchase global products easily, and to advertise the products for the sellers. However, this would potentially bring destructive effect to craftsman, inherited artefact and techniques. Ejecting own tradition pushes a country being featureless."
