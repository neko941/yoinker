        "The behaviour of someone is an important item in the envourment ,especially in  school. We noticed in these days the behaviour is hedging worse because The parents don't learn their sons the polity and  other things.It is very necessary to deal with teachers in the school.The two solutions to solve these problems are  learning them from parents and learning them from teachers.",
        "Firstly,the parents play a good part in improving the action of children,Through they teaching them about the deal with teachers and classmates,For example, They must  talk with them alone and advise them about this issue,Moreover, they can't force them to do anything, Because this will not fix the problems instead of this will increase the problem, For illustrate I known a person in the school. He was very turbulent, so his parents  hit him always after that he died when they hit him, In the ,end the parents played a good role in improving the behaviour of children.",
        "Secondly, there is another side to the teacher.They must learn the children  polite,so They should not teach them  mutch and geography and the other thing, For , example they can give them some examples about  life nature, ,Furthermore the teacher must deal with their students with  love and respect, so He should not  be stressful with students, In the conclusion when the teacher deal in a good way with students. They will love him, so It will consume in improve their behaviour.",
        "in the conclusion, learning by the teacher and parents will improve the behaviour of children, especially the students. In my , opinion if  the student finds good treatment. They will improve on a lot of sides automatically."
