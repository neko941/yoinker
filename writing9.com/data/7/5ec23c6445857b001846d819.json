        "There are a lot of advantages and disadvantages of having a car. And also it\u2019s about environmental problems when we are talking about fuel engine cars. So is it still better to use public transport like buses and trains or car is much better?",
        "Firstly, I would say, that the first and the best advantage of the car is that you can move anywhere without any schedule. And it is really comfortable when you have a family with babies and it\u2019s too difficult to adapt to them. And personally I prefer the car to any other transport. For example, your wife is pregnant and it\u2019s Christmas and most of the ambulances don\u2019t work, but car can help you on this occasion. Any movement is better with it.",
        "Although a car is a good decision there are many problems with it, which you may encounter. I am talking about the problems with its repair. If you buy a used car you can\u2019t avoid these problems in a year. But if your car is new, then for the next 5 years you can safely drive and not care, although of course, it depends on where to go. For example, you were driving in the countryside and your car accidentally gets broken. You would have to wait for a tow. It can take hours of your life so it was the most raging defect of the car.",
        "In conclusion, I would say that car is a great decision if you will take care of it every 3 months. The car will help you in every situation about movement. And if you have an active lifestyle you should buy a car, and take care of it."
