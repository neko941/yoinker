        "Items such as puzzles, board games and pictures  undoubtedly hold the belief that they can help with the developing process of a child\u2019s brain. In my opinion, I strongly believe in that role of those things and as a mom, I would buy the mentioned items for my kids because of their inevitable factors of development for a kid.",
        "Games like puzzles and board games bring two main advantages for kids whose ages range from 0 to 15. Firstly, those carton-made games can enhance not only the recognizing and identifying objects skills but also the analytical skills to decide the next move. For example, whenever kids play with puzzles, they have to look at and remember a wide range of scattered pieces and then connect them together to make a complete picture. Secondly,  non-electrical games can promote family bonding, bringing parents closer to their children. Kids can learn their parent's ways of thinking throughout the plays whenever their moms and dads strategize their moves too. To abridge, image riddles and panel games are brilliant ways to improve a child\u2019s brain.",
        "Futhermore, pictures play a vital role in developing children\u2019s brains, especially in the creative aspects. By looking at a certain image with no words or descriptions, kids can come up with their own stories based on their own imaginations. Moreover, the more illustrations they know and remember, the more objects they can identify and tell in their own words since they recollect all the images they encountered and speak them out when they see them again. Therefore, images also do good in expanding children\u2019s abilities.",
        "In conclusion, it is a widespread belief and recognition among people that puzzles, board games and pictures contribute largely to one kid\u2019s evolvement. I do so since those items help improve certain skills such as analytical skills, creativity and identifying skills among kids and bond family relations."
