        "With the emergence of computers and internet this modern days, it is now possible to read books online. Some people prefer this because it is easier to access and sometimes, does not even cost a penny. On the other hand, reading too many books through a computer will have an effect on a person's health and libraries will no longer be utilized. In this sense, I say that these disadvantages outweigh the advantages.",
        "These electronic books are, in fact, more accessible especially to students around the world. Available reading materials such as journals and novels can be found instantly by searching them online. For this reason, there are more people who own a laptop or a tablet rather than those who own printed books. Another reason is that people do not need to buy most of these materials as they can be easily downloaded and viewed at any time of the day.",
        "On another note, the use of electronic devices in reading exposes people to several health issues that, in time, will become severe. For example, exposure to computers will strain the eyes due to radiation produced by the gadget. In addition, it might worsen into a blurry vision.",
        "Futhermore, people will have limited motion once they are in front of a computer which may result to poor body posture. For instance, the number of students having scoliosis is increasing due to the fact that they prefer staying at home doing homework using their laptops rather than going to the public library and utilizing the reading materials available. While it is true that it takes more time to search for specific books in a library, as a student, these reading materials are more reliable since they were edited and published accordingly. I can say that these disadvantages affect people's lifestyles in a considerable way, thus, outweighing its benefits.",
        "In conclusion, while it is true that utilizing electronic devices for reading makes it easier, it has more bad effects than good. I believe that it is still more advisable to read paper books as these are more accurate which is worth the time searching for the right reading material."
