        "Dear Sir/Madam,",
        "My name is Vicky Amin and I am writing this letter to apply for the scholarship that is provided by your organization to students who wish to pursue a part-time course. I was referred to this by professor John Smith, who teaches Business Laws at University of California.",
        "Speaking about my academic achievement, I have completed my graduation in International Business Management with distinction. After my graduation, I was selected by Citibank through campus placement as intern business analyst. My job responsibility involves handling the portfolios of wealthy clients from Spain and providing them with profitable consultations.",
        "I am planning to do a part-time Spanish learning course from Foreign Language School based in the city centre. The curriculum aims at improving Spanish skills of an individual in aspects of writing, speaking, listening and reading. It involves 2 hours of theoretical classes on weekdays, along with assessments to gauge student's language proficiency.",
        "This course will largely help me in interacting with my Spanish clients and peers seamlessly. Current linguistic gaps while communicating in Spanish would be error free. Also, considering my dedication towards work, I might get a chance to visit Spain to meet my clients in person or even relocate permanently to our Spain office.",
        "It would be a humble request to consider my application, so that I can accomplish my professional goals through your help.",
        "Yours faithfully,",
        "Vicky Amin."
