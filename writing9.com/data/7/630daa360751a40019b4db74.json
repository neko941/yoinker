        "The zoo is available in every city and most visited place for all age groups. While some people believe that animals are treated harshly in zoos, other people including me believe that wild animals can be protected in zoos.",
        "Few people accept that zoological gardens are maintained for business purposes and to attract visitors but most of them lack in providing suitable living conditions, are unhygienic, feed improper food etcetera. Moreover, zookeepers treat wild animals cruelly to keep them under their control. For example, a caged and tied tiger was killed and its meat was taken away, due to improper security measures in Nehru Zoological park in 2003, India and there was no evidence found in CC cameras as well.",
        "In protecting wild nature, safari parks play an important role. Other people believe that instead of treating wild animals in a cage or closed environments, a natural forest kind of environment should be provided and monitor their activities. I completely believe that proper medication and care are provided by experts if any animal is injured or unhealthy in safari parks. So wildlife nature preserves play a crucial role in saving rare animals extinct. A survey conducted by World Wildlife Fund in 2020, stated many wild animals are classified as endangered and on the red list of threatened species such as tigers, elephants, gorillas etcetera.",
        "In conclusion, zoos are the most popular attraction for all generations of people. While some individuals think that zoo animals are subjected to harsh treatment, others people including me think that zoos help safeguard wild creatures."
