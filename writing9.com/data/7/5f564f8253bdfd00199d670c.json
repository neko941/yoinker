        "Almost all the countries around the world encourage sports in one way or other. Moreover, they consider the sportspersons as pride as they win medals for their nation. Though, there are some people who believe violent sports such as boxing, martial arts etc., should be banned completely as they feel it express violent behaviour. However, I do not agree with the latter statement as it completely depends on how people perceive it.",
        "Some people feel that sports involving violence should not be encouraged as it has an adverse effect on young children. Further, they support their view with the research paper published by Harvard University which claims that youngsters who learn violent sports end up in criminal activities more likely than others. However, psychologists say that it all depends on human mentality on how we perceive things and nothing to do with the sport. They also advise youngsters to think positive and cope up with the arrogance that is inherited from society.",
        "In another hand, many people believe that sports not only keep us fit and healthy but also teach us discipline, unity and coordination. Not everyone likes to play, but most people like to watch sports. For instance, In Spain, it is observed widely that during football matches between Real Madrid and Barcelona, there is a surge in the number of students and office goers taking leave to watch those matches. Further, the foreign minister also confirms that tourism spikes by 21% during the football league matches. Sadly, rivalry among these two clubs are increasing day by day involving violence activities which need to be kept under check.",
        "In conclusion, each and every sport is unique in its own way. Simply, banning any sport will not solve the issue or prevent violence. Each sport academy should have wellness/mental education to keep people sane and awareness has to be created to the public as well."
