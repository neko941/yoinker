        "Many people argue that it\u2019s better to choose a position with a good salary even if you don\u2019t really like what you will do. I am completely against this opinion and I think that activity enjoyment has more advantages than high wage because its satisfaction would help people to be more productive and motivated.",
        "First of all, I think that work contentment is making people more creative than high salary because it gives them a sense of contentment, in other words, it gives a self-accomplishment that no money can provide. For instance, someone who likes his profession will certainly give 100 % to master his task furthermore, makes success in his field even with low pay. The physician Mary had won Nobel Prize twice for her wonderful work in chemistry and physics even she hadn\u2019t received a high wage, she had been working long years in bad conditions, because she was passionate of her job she had not given up. Therefore job enjoyment is more advantageous than important pay.",
        "Secondly, in my point of view, the liking of what people do gives inspiration besides motivation. In other meaning, it\u2019s near to impossible to be enthusiastic and motivated to get a high position when not really into the task you are doing. When I have started working for a multinational company, the beginning was very difficult for me; I didn\u2019t speak English, I haven\u2019t any experience in international reporting but I enjoy my position so my determination pushed me to work hard even there are ups and downs I have  support all the difficulties. That is why high pay can\u2019t guarantee enough motivation.",
        "To conclude, I strongly believe that job satisfaction is more advantageous than high salary this is simply because career enjoyment keeps people enthused and successful to get more wage in the future than putting money at the first place."
