        "As I'm totally new to that country, I would be very grateful if you could help me to find a job.  My course is starting from March 2020 onwards, so I would like to get a job by April. Also, my classes are from Monday to Saturday and I'll get free by 3pm. My college in Toronto in Washington Street, so, I want the job near my college so that I can easily manage to do 3-4 hours job and therefore study for my exams as well.",
        "I'm comfortable with any job as it pays me well for 3-4 hours. Also, I would like to work for 7 days and can also manage to give extra hours on Sundays. I'm sure you know the city really well, so you can easily help me out to find a good job. I'll be landing in Canada in the last week of Feburary, will see you soon.",
