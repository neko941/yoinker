        "Climate development is the greatest threat to human life on earth. However, some people consider that instead of averting it, we should find a way to adapt to it.  Although there are convincing statements  on both sides, i believe that we still have to tackle this issue.",
        "One of the main causes of temperature change is global warming. If both the government and people can take reasonable actions, this can be well controlled. For instance, the government can stop the generation of power from fossil fuels, which causes the emission of carbon and can be detrimental to the society. Also, the government can implement green taxes on industries that emit carbon-di-oxide, and invest in other renewable energy such as solar, wind, and hydro power. Furthermore, individuals can try to limit their carbon footprint by flying less and using public transport.",
        "Trying to live with climate revolution is a very dangerous idea because in the near future, climate change will make our planet inhabitable. Because of global warming, the polar ice is melting causing sea levels to rise. Provided that there is an increase water sea level, natural disasters like flooding and drought are likely to occur. As a result, this will make people lose their homes and perhaps migrate to another country.",
        "In conclusion,  weather diversity is becoming a pressing issue, I reiterate my opinion that there are different ways of tackling this problem by creating a new source of power and using less vehicles. Therefore, both the government and people have a role to play."
