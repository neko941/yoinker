        "I am using CISCO company WiFi (Product Model No: ATYPK3128Q & Bill No: 148970) device for using the internet connectivity for my workstation at home. Suddenly, Internet connectivity was stopped working on my workstation. I tried to restart my workstation and WiFi device to fix the problems, but it won't work for me. Afterwards, I directly connected the cable to my laptop and was working perfectly without any issues. On top of the investigation, I have found that the Wifi router is not switching ON and was purchased couple of weeks back which should be in under warranty.",
        "It  is a result of unable to do my office work at home and its affected my preparation of sales reports for  upcoming week meetings with Business stakeholders. I would be grateful if you could come and check the equipment at my home to fix it else I am hoping you will replace it with the new equipment based on warranty terms and conditions.",
        "I look forward to hearing back from you immediately.",
