        "In this digital age and era, shopping-online has become a trend. People are purchasing books, groceries, tickets, and any other required day-to-day items from the web. I agree that this trend has more positives than negatives and shall discuss the same further in this essay.",
        "First of all, offline purchasing (from local markets) needs a lot of time and energy, also it is not practically possible to find a huge variety of products at a single place, so one needs to go from one market to another. Moreover, these days, everyone is running out of time because of their busy and hectic work schedule, nobody got time to go physically to a store in order to buy something. For instance, a recent study published in The Times newspaper shows that 83% of the supermarket customers don't like wasting their precious time shopping every day.",
        "Because of that, there is a huge spike in the number of online purchasers, also online vendors provide huge discounts on different credit/debit cards. This way, they can easily find an enormous variety of products on a single website or app. For instance, Amazon is an online retailer, and it has got millions of different products. As a result, one can buy books, groceries or even live plants on a single platform. Thus, more and more people are shopping online these days.",
        "In conclusion, I opine that the benefits of online shopping outweigh its drawbacks. It can save a lot of time, also very cheap as compared to traditional buying from stores. In the future, the web-based purchasing industry will boom."
