        "Dear sir or madam.",
        "I am a year 3 BBA student and I am writing to reflect some opinions on what happened recently in our college cafe in the south wing.",
        "Irrefutably, the cafe in the south wing is one of the most affordable cafes in our college, and the level of price hikes is totally incomparable to the restaurants outside during these few years. Yet, it provides food of reasonable quality, and the pasta and chicken wings are especially popular among students.",
        "Nevertheless, something cropped up these weeks that I think I am compelled to raise out. The dishes are found dirty and utensils are oily at times. Not only is it my personal experience but my classmates also said that they encountered the same problem. I understand inflation is fierce and there is a shortage of labour everywhere but still the situation is not acceptable.  In my opinion, if the current salary level of cafe workers is not competitive to retain enough personnel, a hike may be necessary and students will be understand if there is only a small increase in the menu price.",
        "I am looking forward to seeing the situation rectified soon.",
