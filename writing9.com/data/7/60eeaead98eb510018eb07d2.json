        "It is evident that the gender gap is closing in the vast majority of occupations in today\u2019s society. However, some remain with the opinion that females and males are born to have differences in terms of their vocational preferences. Despite this, I would argue in this essay that it is wrong to exclude a certain gender from a certain occupation.",
        "It is undoubtedly that a certain gender could be more appreciated in some professions. It is mainly determined by the biological differences between males and females. For example, females are perceived to be more caring and nurturing by nature, so that they could be more suitable working in nurseries and hospitals; whereas, males are more likely to be employed in mining and construction industries because they are physically stronger. In those cases, the gender gap may remain in the short future.",
        "However, for the vast majority of professions, making occupations more open to both genders has significant advantages. Different genders could bring different perspectives into work, which could generate more possibilities for a company\u2019s development. For example, a male nurse could offer his unique experience to a female-dominated team in order to promote more holistic care to patients of both genders. Moreover, there is evidence that a mixed-gender working environment is often proven to be more efficient. Therefore, companies could benefit from the different perspectives and efficiency that mixed gender teams bring.",
        "To conclude, although some occupations remain to be female- or male-dominant, there are more advantages to allow both genders to have the freedom of their vocational choices. Companies that facilitate this equality could benefit from the increased possibilities and efficiency."
