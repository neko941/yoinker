        "It\u2019s argued that more and more animal species are on the brink of extinction and gradually disappearing in the world due to the activities of humans. This essay will discuss about discharge waste and emission to the environment of people as an explanation for this phenomenon followed by improving knowledge as one of the most suitable ways of how to solve it.",
        "One of the principal reality is that the disappearance of animals should have been held accountable for environmental degradation that discharge products of people\u2019s lives have created. Not only some factories dispose of their chemical waste but residents also throw away these rubbish into land and water environment and these actions lead to global warming and habitat destruction. For instance, some endangered species can not be able to live and adapt the climate changes immediately so they are becoming easy to lack of the health conditions and die after all.",
        "To rescue other animals as soon as possible, improving people\u2019s knowledge through programme at school for the youth to elder through environmental campaign and imposing law and tax is necessary enough to limit and decrease this serious phenomenon. Everyone can contribute to achieve sustainable development and the full weight of the government should be taken advantage of more and more. Instead of throwing away lots things after using to the sea and land, which can influence negatively on animal's lives, residents can recycle, reuse as second-hand products. Moreover, national and local authorities should make environmental issues high on the agenda and exert pressure on controlling the discharge processing of factories by increase tax or punish wrongdoers by the policy of zero tolerance if necessary.",
        "In conclusion, taking action on protecting animals from being in danger of extinction is considered to be one of the most prioritized responsibilities that not only the government but everyone should also have to do. If try as much as possible, this phenomenon will definitely become better and the endangered species will have been remained and lived in our world for such a long time."
