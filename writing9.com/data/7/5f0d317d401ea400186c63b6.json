        "In today\u2019s fast growing world, competition is rising quickly among the professional people to sustain jobs and career development. It\u2019s always in debate that many companies do recruitment on the basis of personal interviews or is there any better options to search skilled people for required jobs. I will focus mainly on this viewpoint and discuss about better methods to choose an employee.",
        "To begin with, nowadays many employers are finding several ways for hunting skilled and professional people for their requirements in certain projects in multinational companies. Most employers around the globe embrace the common method to recruit a skilled person is by conducting entrance examinations for the respective jobs whether it would be government or private jobs. If it is highly designated work profile, then human resource department emphasizes more strictly on setting the test papers. Consequently, employers could able to find more talented and skilled person for their corresponding job. To cite an example, many semi-government and private organizations recruiter conduct several rounds of interviews such as aptitude tests , verbal and analytical tests, group discussions, HR round, and technical test, etc.",
        "Furthermore, employers can do screening and background check of particular employees from the previous employers to find the correct person for the project requirement. In addition to it, traditional way to look down the academic records, strong work experience in the core field and other certification makes person more relevant for the corresponding job.",
        "Fortunately, as digital technology is upgrading so quickly that recruiter often conduct many interviews on face to face video calls apps such as Skype, google talk, face time and many more. Additionally, according to the research conducted, already several companies embraced the method of taking initial rounds of interviews online and the following would be taken personally.",
        "To conclude, as per my opinion test examination and a personal round of technical interviews would be wide greater method to search down the right person for their respective job."
