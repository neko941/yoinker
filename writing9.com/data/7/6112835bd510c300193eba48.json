        "If asked whether hopping jobs or staying in the same jobs give a sense of satisfaction, many people struggle to make a final choice. In my opinion, while switching jobs has its own benefits, staying a job for a long time may provide people with a greater sense of fulfilment.",
        "There are some reasons why young people should change a job. Firstly, by switching a job, they can put the knowledge gained from the previous job into practice and gain the recognition at new working places . In addition, young people can acquire more skills and experience when they can try their hands into different fields. Secondly, by switching jobs and changing workplace, young people have a chance to find things that suit them best. For example, youngsters may hate desk jobs and want to seek more dynamic opportunities.",
        "However, remaining in  a job for a long time appeals to young people. The first reason is that when a company need to promote or dismiss their employees, both dedication and experience are taken into consideration. If a person works for a company longer, he can have a chance to move up their career ladder and earning a more lucrative living. Another reason is that there are many perks that follow when people work for a long time, namely holiday entitlements and yearly bonuses.",
        "In conclusion, although job-hopping may give people many chances, staying a job can help them to achieve other opportunities."
