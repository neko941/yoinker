        "Health is an important part of human life.Although, consuming more sugar contain products may cause various health related problem.Few people deem that it's Authorities duty to reduce the consumption of sugar, While other propound that it's their choice.However, I will give my detail explanation on both sides and gives my opinion at the end of an essay.",
        "Firstly, Because of hectic work schedule people have no time to cook food at home, Thus they are ordering food from outside and restaurants.As a result, people are suffering from various health related issues, Such as, obesity, diabetes because the restaurants food contains a large amount of oil and fat.Thus, people should try to cook food at home because home food contains high amount of nutrients, which keeps the body healthy.Moreover, Teenagers are more addictive of cold drinks, Which has a huge amount of sugar. Thus, parents should try to keep their children away from such drinks.Furthermore,people should avoid consumption of some ingredient which may not suitable for health such as, chocolates, oily food etc.For example, a survey conducted by The Canadian doctors in 2019 shows about 45% of Children are suffered by obesity because of extremely consumption of fast food.",
        "On the other hand, Authorities should make some strict rules against such a product, Thus people may reduce to consume that.For instance, The administration should put extra TAX on cold drinks and fast food, As a result, peoples may think twice before they buy it.In addition, the government should organize some campaign for motivating people to consume healthy food.",
        "In conclusion, I reiterate that Eating fast food may cause different types of health related problem.From my point of view it's individual duty to maintain a healthy diet and makes their body fit."
