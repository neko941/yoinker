        "It has been commonly said that prevention is always better than cure due to two obvious and lucid reasons, the first one is that researching for accurate treatment always takes time and the second one that it has been proved treating illnesses is highly pricey. Therefore, I believe that being preventive has been always a wiser choice.",
        "One the one hand, everyone is aware of the fact that researching in medical scopes is extremely vital to save mankind. Very often humans encounter with new viruses and novel diseases or even some existent sicknesses get developed thus, new treatments should be taken. Scientists have revealed that unfortunately defecting appropriate treatments to tackle diseases usually take too much time. Furthermore, conducting research is always a costly procedure, so research centres and institutes should be granted by local governments. And if a government is eager to be a pioneer country among others in medical researches should not hesitate to spend money on such researches. Additionally, economists believe being a pioneer in medical scopes can also help to boost economy, since many people can come to the country for getting treatments. So, countries with developed medical centers can count on medical tourism.",
        "On the other hand, many people are of the opinion that always preventative measures are more logical. First and foremost, treating process has always been highly expensive. However, in recent years many governments tended to present broad health insurances to their citizens, especially to those who have low-paid jobs. Moreover, sometimes unfortunately people spend much amounts of money on treatment, though, they do not get any better. For instance, take intestine cancer as an example, doctors have regularly stated that people can easily prevent this type of cancer by avoiding junk foods. Overall, prevention considered to be the best decision.",
        "To sum up, I strictly believe that by a regular check-up with your doctor helps us to assess our overall health and to identify our risk factors for disease."
