        "In recent decades, many cities have been flooded with vehicles mostly cars. Some believe that this has led to the changing world into \u2018one big traffic jam\u2019. I completely agree with this statement. Also, the government can take few measures to discourage the public from using their cars.",
        "To start with, the urbanization has given us both positive and negative impacts.  One of the major setback are traffic jams. To elaborate, with increased earning, easy loans and convenience, each person tends to own car in the family. Although, authorities tend to increase the number of roads and widen the preexisting roads, all is in vain.  This situation is worsening every day, which leads to people spending long hours on the road rather than reaching the destination. Also, to add on, more air pollution occurs with combustion in vehicles standing on roads and health issues. To include the issues, people are having more respiratory problems and due to long sitting, have posture problems, back issues and sedentary lifestyle concerns. These all, in the runs are ruining our health.",
        "Furthermore, the government can play a crucial role in discouraging people by imposing green taxes on car owners. They can also increase service tax on person for buying a second car. Also, authorities can promote public transport by providing better connectivity and increased frequency of buses and trains. Additionally, a rebate to common people for using public transport everyday could be a promotional initiative. Government needs to take some hard steps and keep people benefits in mind to curb the jam issue.",
        "To conclude, we need to solve the traffic problems sooner and efficiently for common people benefit"
