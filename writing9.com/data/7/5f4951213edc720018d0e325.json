        "Health and fitness have become the most debated topic in recent times. Many people believe that one should be self responsible for own health and diet while others suggest that the ruling authority must take initiatives for providing healthy diet to the citizens. I strongly believe that government should regulate the food items supplied in the markets so that individuals can intake healthy and nutrition rich food.",
        "To begin with, it is imperative for an individual to take care of his fitness by inculcating good eating habits. In other words, a person should check the nutritional value of the food consumed by him and avoid those items which does not suit his body requirements. For example, by including green vegetables in the diet, and avoiding fried food items, a person can increase his immunity thereby decreasing the chances of catching a flu or a disease. Thus, it becomes essential to take self care of the body.",
        "In contrast, societies at large are of the opinion that government should keep a check on the food being supplied to supermarkets and bazaars and consumed by common public. For instance, Food Regulatory Authority should conduct regular audits of the companies manufacturing packaged foods and raids at a roadside restaurant for the ingredients being used in the food served to customers. This way the citizens of the nation will have assurance related to the food items bought from the markets and servings taken at restaurants.",
        "In conclusion, although, at the bottom level, the individual is responsible for taking care of own health, but when it comes to public at large, government should undertake the responsibility of making their citizens take a healthy and good diet through their food distribution policies. Consequently, this will lead to the achievement of a dream of a Healthy Nation."
