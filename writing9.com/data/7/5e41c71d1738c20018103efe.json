        "It is often thought that a lot of people are participating in physical activities in a younger age. Although, most of them are stopping when they grow up. In the next paragraphs, I will discuss the reason and what can be done to prevent it.",
        "One of the first problems of this issue is that there are more priorities in an adult's life. The reason for this is that once you get older there will be more responsibilities to experience a stable life. In other words, a person needs to fulfil those duties to take care of the family. For instance, providing employment is one of the tasks that makes it possible to pay the monthly bills. Moreover, this is also one of the things that is time consuming but effective in a certain ways. All in all, receiving spare time in the future is becoming difficult due to the high expectance of fulfilling the duties.",
        "A possible solution to this problem would be to reduce the amount of working days. The reason for this is that it will increase the chance to get some free time. For instance, this way it is a lot easier to provide some hours on your health and lifestyle. Moreover, fitness can keep your mind healthy and reduce the possibility for depression and other illnesses. So that's why, it is more advisable to give yourself some moments to relax.",
        "To conclude, many inhabitants are taking part in the gym or other activities, which will make you move for a number of hours. However, a lot of them are stopping fitness because of a busy schedule. This can be prevented by taking a few days off to expend some time on ourselves."
