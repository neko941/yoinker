        "In this day and age, it is common for an increasing number of people to have children later in their life. In this essay, I will get to the roots of this tendency and discuss some effects associated with it.",
        "The fact that young couples delay getting pregnant can be attributable to several culprits. One of them is due to the more competitive job market. To be more specific, it is undeniable that finding a stable job with a decent salary seems to be quite challenging these days. Consequently, many modern people decide to put their career in priority so that they not only guarantee a high-standard life but they also build a strong financial condition to prepare for their children\u2019s future. Besides, it is believed that the young nowadays are likely to be more open-minded, so they may lead their own lives with more freedom. Compared with the past when married people were restricted to the responsibilities of perpetuating their family lineage, modern ones have a tendency to enjoy the life of newly couples with fulfilling their job ambitions or their own dreams such as travelling around the world.",
        "However, this trend can leave many detrimental implications for society in general and families in particular. In terms of society, a decline in the birth rate can be one of the main reasons leading to an ageing population as well as the shortage in the labour force. This would negatively affect the development of a nation in the long term. Regarding the impacts on families, it is true that having children later can put the health of pregnant women and their babies at risk. According to some research, women at the age of over 35 may have higher risks of premature birth or miscarriage when experiencing the pregnancy.",
        "In conclusion, the popularity of giving birth later in life can be caused by numerous reasons, yet the serious impacts of it should not be overlooked."
