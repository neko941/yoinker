When we were leaving, I forgot the camera. It was until the next morning, I realized the camera was still at the bar, and I went back immediately. However, the camera had already gone. Nobody at the bar was aware of this. It was confirmed lost.",
        "I wonder how the claim process would be like. I have the vouchers for the camera and lens, would it be sufficient? What form do I need to fill in? Could you send me the necessary documents at your earliest convenience? Thank you in advance.",
