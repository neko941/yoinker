        "It is thought by few that if governments increase the tax on rubble foods, it could motivate people to buy them.as a result, people\u2019s tendency to eat healthy foods is increased and the rate of any gentle of disease that are related to eating rubble foods consequently is decreased. In this regard, I am in disagreement with this opinion, and believe that there are some other solutions that are most appropriate to eradicate this menace. A number of arguments surrounded my opinion.",
        "To begin with, this code that emphasis on increasing the tax on junk foods, like all the other similar policies, has negative effects on the middle and lower economic classes. To explain more, through this code the variety of choices for weak economic classes are decreased. On the contrary, this amiable of policies are not effective to motivate rich people to opt healthy foods rather than unhealthy foods. It is also worth recalling that pushing people to behave in a specific way could in turn, lead to dissatisfaction people. So, increasing the tendency to use healthy foods through these gentle of policies is optimistic. On the other hand, some researches indicate that in this era that huge range of men and women are employed, scant time is the most important factor which compel them to buy junk foods, so, it is obvious that increasing the cost of these gentle of foods do not have enough effect for them.",
        "Moving forward, I believe that informing people about the negative effects of junk foods on health, could lead to self-restrain them from buying unhealthy foods. The other policy that I think could be responsible to this menace, is making healthy foods more accessible in comparison compared to unhealthy foods. To do so, decreasing the cost of healthy foods could help policy-makers to reach for this goal.",
        "In conclusion, compelling people to eat healthy food, through increasing their price, without making them aware of the harmful effects of rubble foods, is not an appropriate policy and cannot help policy-makers to reach to the healthy society such as a main goal. To do so, decreasing the cost of healthy foods, to make them more accessible is more responsible to solve this menace."
