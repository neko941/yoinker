        "In today's world, by birth nobody is born with intelligence. However, some people believe that talent generally acquires from the place they born, while others, argues that it can be taught to any children who wish to learn something unique with provided the necessary support. I strongly support with the latter view. In this essay, I intend to delve into both the view and put my individual view.",
        "On the positive side, some professions require lot efforts to become efficient. For case, music and sports jobs are very expensive to learn and it cannot be possible for a common man who earns minimum wages from his pursuit. Hence, these jobs can only be affordable to the people who are wealthy. For example, sports people tend to spend more than 10 years of expertise in this field where as it's not possible for everyone to put this much of an effort.  Because of these many days of hardship one can become expert in a particular career and it does not mean that they are born with the specific capacity.",
        "On the negative side, if a parent is ready to support their children in these sports or music, learning any art will not be a burden. Although some parents believe that it is not a wise decision to educate kids from childhood, if they are grown with some training they will lead the life in a better way and they become more intellectual. For example, The great Indian cricketer Sachin Tendulkar born in a poor family, but that does not stop him from fulfilling his interest towards sport. With the help of his parent, He became star batsman in the world cricket history. This example would advise that parent and child's interest cannot be surprised by anything. If the person trained in well manner, everything is possible and achievable.",
        "To put it in a nutshell, I pen down saying that, talent is not certainly specific to one profession it can be accomplished by anyone if the directions provided from childhood. Considering the points given, talent does not belong to one stream of sports."
