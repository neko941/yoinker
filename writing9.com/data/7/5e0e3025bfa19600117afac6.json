        "It is true that the behaviour of school pupils in some parts of the world has been getting worse in recent years. There are a variety of possible reasons for this, but steps can de\ufb01nitely be taken to tackle the problem.",
        "In my opinion, three main factors are to blame for the way young people behave at school nowadays. Firstly, modern parents tend to be too lenient or permissive. Many children become accustomed to getting whatever they want, and they \ufb01nd it dif\ufb01cult to accept the demands of teachers or the limits imposed on them by school rules. Secondly, if teachers cannot control their students, there must be an issue with the quality of classroom management training or support within schools. Finally, children are in\ufb02uenced by the behaviour of celebrities, many of whom set the example that success can be achieved without \ufb01nishing school.",
        "Student behaviour can certainly be improved. I believe that the change must start with parents, who need to be persuaded that it is important to set \ufb01rm rules for their children. When children misbehave or break the rules, parents should use reasonable punishments to demonstrate that actions have consequences. Also, schools could play an important role in training both teachers and parents to use effective disciplinary techniques, and in improving the communication between both groups. At the same time, famous people, such as musicians and football players, need to understand the responsibility that they have to act as role models to children.",
        "In conclusion, schools will continue to face discipline problems unless parents, teachers and public \ufb01gures set clear rules and demonstrate the right behaviour themselves.!"
