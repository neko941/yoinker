Others, by contrast, are worried that we are not prepared for a world in which computers are more intelligent than humans. Discuss both of these views and give your own opinion.",

        "People have different views on the question whether the development of artificial intelligence would benefit people or not in the near future. In my view, I tend to agree that while technologically, people may be prepared for the advent of artificial intelligence. From the perspective of morality, there is still much time needed.",
        "Admittedly, artificial intelligence exerts a great deal of positive influence. One of the most noticeable examples is that it helps people to be free from repeated work and even daily routines such as household chores. Also, for those work that has a high requirement on operation skills, artificial intelligence could complete difficult tasks that people hardly make. In this sense, in some science fictions, artificial intelligence is a fabulous creation and people have a great aspiration for its utilization in the future.",
        "However, the development of such technology also arouses a concern in the point of humanity and morality. Firstly, some people worry that as artificial intelligence supersedes people's jobs, there will be social problems led by the unemployment. It is obvious that our governments have not put forward an effective measure to tackle the issue. Secondly, like colon technology, it is still unknown how risky if computers have similar even better intelligence than humans. Considering practical problems, such experiment is hard to be conducted, which in turn making the concern remain.",
        "In conclusion, whereas the emerging technology of artificial intelligence may benefit people in some areas to some extent, as its potential risks still exist, it would be better to be prudent for its operation."
