        "Technology comes with both; benefits and curses, however, it is debatable whether its positive impact outweigh the negative in the workers' lives or not. Various means of technology include the usage of computers, modern machines with programmable controllers, robots etc.",
        "Indeed, modern methods to conduct an activity has replaced the workers with machines. A carpenter takes an hour to cut a piece of wood, but a machine can do such task in a minute. A few decades ago, accountants used to manage the balance sheets of conglomerates, but presently a single accountant can manage such tasks by using softwares. Such technological progress has replaced some of the blue-collared workers therefore, they feel that their job security is endangered.",
        "In comparison to this, technology comes with a price. Not every company can afford the liberty to substitute cheap labour with any form of technology. The ultimate benefit that a manual worker brings to an organization is that, various tasks can be conducted by such worker, whereas a machine has certain limitations. Modern technology can do a repetitive task quite productively, but in order to carry out creative tasks, manual labour is the utilized.",
        "In addition, the cost of hiring a worker is known to a company. One of the many disadvantages of owning a modern machine is its additional cost. For example, the fixed cost of a machine coupled with a variable factor adds to the value of the product that a company is producing which means that the product cost increased, thus whenever such machines are procured, its careful calculations draw the conclusion that workers are better than such technology.",
        "In conclusion, I totally believe that no matter how much technological advancements are introduced, workers will always be the primary source of earning for any organization. Hence, there are no disadvantages to the workers."
