        "These days the number of crimes committed by the youth is on the rise and it is important to take measures to control it. Some people think that this can only be controlled by providing advanced parenting training to the parents. This essay does not agree with this opinion because of its ineffectiveness and that there are other more effective solutions.",
        "To begin with, trained parents cannot guarantee that their child would not get involved in any criminal activities. This is because parents can use their skills to try to teach their child about good and bad things, but they cannot control them. For instance, if a qualified and experienced teacher,  teaches the same subjects using the same technique to a group of students in his class, but there are possibilities that some of them do not understand or follow his instructions properly. Similarly, the idea of teaching parenting skills to all parents would not be worthwhile.",
        "Additionally, there are other more useful ways to prevent the young people from getting involved in criminal activities. Firstly, it has been observed that many younger people commit crimes such as pickpocketing or robbery because they or their parents are not able to pay for their expenses. Governments can control these crimes by providing part-time job opportunities for students. Furthermore, Police should be equipped with modern technology so that they can catch the criminals immediately. This is effective because people would think twice before doing anything wrong because of the fear of punishment.",
        "In conclusion, crimes from young offenders cannot be controlled by teaching parents the parenting skills only because of its ineffectiveness. In my opinion, by providing part-time employments and modernising law-enforcement agencies, authortise can control the crimes."
