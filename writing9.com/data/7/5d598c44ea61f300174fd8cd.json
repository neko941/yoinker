The card has been in my possession for three years now. I am writing in reference to the credit card statement that you have sent to me.",

The location of the transactions appears to be in Abu Dhabi which clearly proves that I am not the one who bought the items. I can show you my passport as a proof that I am out of the country for those dates listed in the statement. I suspect there might be a glitch in your system.",
