        "In line with the development of export markets, many people are consuming food which has been transported thousands of miles from producers. I agree with the view that eating provided food from local farmers will bring more environmental and economic benefits.",
        "Environmental problems are debating around the world day in, day out. With a huge consumer demand, a lot of fossil fuels have to be burned to transport food so far to consumers, which creates greenhouse gas emissions as a result. This causes remarkable damage to the planetary environment. Moreover, it will be better for the customer\u2019s health when they buy local food from the farms nearby because the products can taste better and fresher. Therefore, local food consumption not only helps reduce the greenhouse effect from air pollutants due to less traveling but also provides better products for people\u2019s health.",
        "Another reason for inhabitants to support local farms is that it promotes local businesses to improve the economy, especially in developing countries. Because the executives need more opportunities to work in their regions, there will be more jobs to help people out of poverty [removed unnecessary words] as well as tackle unemployment. For example, purchasing food from a local farm ensures the farm focuses on the business/ grows bigger and makes more profit. Moreover, they could have more products with the best price for the local consumers.",
        "In summary, if people purchase local goods, it will potentially bring benefits to their health, the global environment, and the economy. Due to these viewpoints, I totally agree that we should buy locally produced goods."
