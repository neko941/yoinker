        "Management and hosting of sports events is a source of business for many countries. Some people argue that it is advantageous for a country to host an international sports event in their own country, while others believe that it is useless. In this essay, I will discuss the data of both arguments in detail and provide an opinion that why hosting  an international event of sports is beneficial for a country.",
        "To commence with, an international sports event plays a vital role in the economy of a country. A lot of big companies prefer to invest in such types of states. For example, in 2023, Qatar will host a big event which is basically a football world cup, for this purpose many visitors and companies will go to Qatar, and they will invest a huge sum of money in Qatar. Moreover, such types of events are also very advantageous for the cultural development of a nation. To illustrate, when people of different cultures go to some other countries for sports events, it will automatically provide an opportunity for visitors to know about the specific cultures of that nation. Consequently, sports events are very necessary for the economical and cultural development of a nation.",
        "On the other hand, there are some drawbacks to such events. Firstly, it will provide an easy opportunity for bad people to do crimes on an international level. As an example, many drug dealers prefer to move to such countries for more income, because during such events, most visitors seek drugs and alcohol. Secondly, some people are involved in other crimes like stealing money and expensive things from tourists. For example, thieves come to stadiums and stole money from rich people with proper skills. To sum up, an international event like games can provide opportunities for many bad things.",
        "To conclude, this essay discussed the positive and negative aspects of hosting an international event. In my opinion, hosting such type of event is very beneficial for a country's economy and cultural promotion."
