        "Crime has been the major concern of many countries across the world. In the efforts to reduce the crime rate, some people believe that retaining in  jail is an effective way to alleviate the problem, while others including me reckon that education is a more promising solution to a dramatical increase in the crime rate. In this essay, the reasons to support my agreement with the latter statement will be presented before my conclusion is reached.",
        "Although prison could transform offenders into good guys back to  society, there are various competent methods that are more effective, and one of them is providing  better education. Schools and universities do not only provide students with  beneficial knowledge and useful skills, but they also teach the art of living and cultivate the attitude to be good citizens. According to the statistics data from Royal Thai Police, more than 80 per cent of inmates who commit a crime, are uneducated people, which do not even study high school. Therefore, education can discourage individuals to commit a crime.",
        "Furthermore, as the main reason for crimes is poverty, famine, and low quality of life, the number of criminal case steadily rise because they have to steal money from others to survive. However,  education can improve human well-being as people can get the opportunity to get better jobs or well-paid work with a higher degree of study. As a result, people have a better life and do not need to be involved in illegal activities. For example, the corruption rate in undeveloped countries including Brazil, Srilanka, and Myanmar is enormously higher than in developed countries such as the European states, America, and England because the livelihood in civilized nations is already good.",
        "In conclusion, providing citizens with the proper learning is more competent to declining the criminal rate than retaining the prisoners in jail according to the aforementioned reasons. Presumably, I absolutely agree with the second statement. Moreover, the authority should focus on study than punishment."
