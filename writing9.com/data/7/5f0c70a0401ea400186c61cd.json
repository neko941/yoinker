        "In the modern era, good sports and cultural events are a basic human need and a person leads a quality life, but some people ponder that spend a huge amount of money on events is a benefit for the development but others oppose it. According to my opinion, these cultural events have some pros and cons, and now, I will explain both in the upcoming paragraphs.",
        "To commence with, the technology is progressing leads and bounds in the age of information there have been favourable changes seen in the field of sports and cultural events. Nowadays, numerous people show their interest to see the live event in their life because it helps to increase their skills and knowledge. For example, the number of learners in the school and college shows their interest towards sports and they spend more money to choose their career in sports and cultural events. Also, when folks watch the live event of sports, then they can learn a lot of things which helps to enhance their career.",
        "On the flip side, most of the children live outside their home due to their study and a job then some students spend a large amount of their parent money to see sports events. For instance, sometimes children habitually tom watch all sports events in the local cities and they do not think about the cost of tickets. Also, some employees do not think about their bad time and they do not show their interest to save their money for future use.",
        "In concluding it can be said that sports and cultural events are necessary for everyone and its good time pass source as well as mind relaxation, but its negative effect on younger and society should not marginalize."
