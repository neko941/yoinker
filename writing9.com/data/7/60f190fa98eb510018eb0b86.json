        "Transportations occupy most of our life. No matter railways or roads, both of them contribute a lot to our daily activities. Government should spend money on railways rather than roads as the former is more essential than the latter one.",
        "Firstly, the efficiency of railways is higher than that of roads. Since railways operate in a highly routine system, traffic jam seldom occurs except for accidents. Thus, public transport with rails such as trains and trams are extremely reliable. Therefore, citizens place no worries about the traffic situation as long as they are taking the efficient rails.",
        "Besides, railways cover plenty of  places which people usually visit. For example, residence, workplaces and sightseeing locations are the most common areas that people always get used to. There is a surge in the proportion of usage of railways since people are easier to take railways. As a result, It is worth spending on rails so long as it has a considerable percentage of use.",
        "On the other hand, spending money on roads is comparatively less valuable. It is more costly to build roads in maintenance as it requires piles of expensive materials. Moreover, heavy vehicles, namely, container trucks and lorries cause harm to the road because of long-term running. Clearly, it is not valuable to spend money on road.",
        "In conclusion, building railways result in the efficiency and effectiveness of public transportation. On the contrary, a great amount of maintenance cost is the adverse effect of road construction. In my opinion, I agree with the government  pay for railways instead of roads."
